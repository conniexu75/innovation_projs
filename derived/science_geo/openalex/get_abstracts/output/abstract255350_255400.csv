https://openalex.org/W2105563024,"Humans restrain self-interest with moral and social values. They are the only species known to exhibit reciprocal fairness, which implies the punishment of other individuals' unfair behaviors, even if it hurts the punisher's economic self-interest. Reciprocal fairness has been demonstrated in the Ultimatum Game, where players often reject their bargaining partner's unfair offers. Despite progress in recent years, however, little is known about how the human brain limits the impact of selfish motives and implements fair behavior. Here we show that disruption of the right, but not the left, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation substantially reduces subjects' willingness to reject their partners' intentionally unfair offers, which suggests that subjects are less able to resist the economic temptation to accept these offers. Importantly, however, subjects still judge such offers as very unfair, which indicates that the right DLPFC plays a key role in the implementation of fairness-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2147544980,"The evolutionary dynamics underlying the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity have been controversial for over a century. Using a spatially explicit approach that incorporates not only origination and extinction but immigration, a global analysis of genera and subgenera of marine bivalves over the past 11 million years supports an “out of the tropics” model, in which taxa preferentially originate in the tropics and expand toward the poles without losing their tropical presence. The tropics are thus both a cradle and a museum of biodversity, contrary to the conceptual dichotomy dominant since 1974; a tropical diversity crisis would thus have profound evolutionary effects at all latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2021050140,"We developed a quantitative method, analogous to those used in statistical mechanics, to predict how biodiversity will vary across environments, which plant species from a species pool will be found in which relative abundances in a given environment, and which plant traits determine community assembly. This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94% of the variance in the relative abundances."
https://openalex.org/W1964058519,"Nucleophilic, anionic boryl compounds are long-sought but elusive species. We report that reductive cleavage of the boron-bromine bond in N,N ′-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-bromo-2,3-dihydro-1 H -1,3,2-diazaborole by lithium naphthalenide afforded the corresponding boryllithium, which is isoelectronic with an N -heterocyclic carbene. The structure of the boryllithium determined by x-ray crystallography was consistent with sp 2 boron hybridization and revealed a boron-lithium bond length of 2.291 ± 0.006 angstroms. The structural similarity between this compound and the calculated free boryl anion suggests that the boron atom has an anionic charge. The 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum also supports the boryl anion character. Moreover, the compound behaves as an efficient base and nucleophile in its reactions with electrophiles such as water, methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, 1-chlorobutane, and benzaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W2048091951,"For characterization of sequence and posttranslational modifications, molecular and fragment ion mass data from ionizing and dissociating a protein in the mass spectrometer are far more specific than are masses of peptides from the protein's digestion. We extend the ∼500-residue, ∼50-kilodalton (kD) dissociation limitation of this top-down methodology by using electrospray additives, heated vaporization, and separate noncovalent and covalent bond dissociation. This process can cleave 287 interresidue bonds in the termini of a 1314-residue (144-kD) protein, specify previously unidentified disulfide bonds between 8 of 27 cysteines in a 1714-residue (200-kD) protein, and correct sequence predictions in two proteins, one with 2153 residues (229 kD)."
https://openalex.org/W2075068237,"Innate immunity signaling pathways in both animals and plants are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. An Arabidopsis MAPK cascade (MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5, and MPK3/MPK6) has been proposed to function downstream of the flagellin receptor FLS2 based on biochemical assays using transient overexpression of candidate components. To genetically test this model, we characterized two mekk1 mutants. We show here that MEKK1 is not required for flagellin-triggered activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Instead, MEKK1 is essential for activation of MPK4, a MAPK that negatively regulates systemic acquired resistance. We also showed that MEKK1 negatively regulates temperature-sensitive and tissue-specific cell death and H2O2 accumulation that are partly dependent on both RAR1, a key component in resistance protein function, and SID2, an isochorismate synthase required for salicylic acid production upon pathogen infection. Innate immunity signaling pathways in both animals and plants are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades.

The recognition of pathogen-derived molecules, so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 4The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; DAB, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine; WT, wild type; SA, salicylic acid; R, resistance; MS, Murashige and Skoog; RT, reverse transcription; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. triggers innate immunity responses in both animals and plants (1Nurnberger T. Brunner F. Kemmerling B. Piater L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In animals, PAMP recognition is often mediated by receptors such as Toll and Toll-like receptors containing leucine-rich repeats (2Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). In plants, PAMPs are also recognized by leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor kinases. For example, Arabidopsis FLS2 is a receptor kinase required for innate immune responses triggered by a bacterial flagellin (3Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Similar to animal pathogens, many plant pathogens introduce effector proteins that are able to suppress PAMP-triggered immune responses (4Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Plants, on the other hand, recognize such effectors, directly or indirectly by resistance (R) proteins and trigger rapid defense responses, including localized cell death (4Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). The signal transduction following pathogen recognition by R proteins and receptor kinases in plants are thought to be mediated by MAPK cascades, since a number of MAPK components are known to be activated in these processes (5Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 6Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the specificity or requirement of individual MAPK signaling components in disease resistance is poorly defined, since many of these components also are activated by various environmental cues (7Nakagami H. Pitzschke A. Hirt H. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Recently, a transient reverse genetic approach based on virus-induced gene silencing provided genetic evidence for requirement of some MAPK cascade components in disease resistance. For example, tobacco MEK2, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and its substrate MAPKs, SIPK and WIPK, were shown to be essential for full N-mediated resistance against Tobacco mosaic virus (8Jin H.L. Liu Y.D. Yang K.Y. Kim C.Y. Baker B. Zhang S.Q. Plant J. 2003; 33: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The likely upstream activator of MEK2 is MAPKKKα, which is essential for Pto-mediated resistance in tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana (9del Pedley K.F. Pozo O. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistently, silencing MEK2, SIPK, or WIPK resulted in reduction of localized cell death associated with Pto resistance (9del Pedley K.F. Pozo O. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, another MAPK cascade, NPK1-MEK1-NTF6, is also essential for N-mediated resistance and Pto-dependent cell death (9del Pedley K.F. Pozo O. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y.L. Schiff M. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Plant J. 2004; 38: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These data suggest that multiple MAPK cascades operate in order to establish disease resistance. Using a transient gain of function approach in Arabidopsis protoplast, a complete MAPK cascade consisting of MEKK1, MKK4/MKK5 (MEK2 orthologs), and MPK3/MPK6 (WIPK/SIPK orthologs, respectively) was proposed as a downstream signaling process of the flagellin receptor FLS2 (5Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In these experiments, transiently expressing a MEKK1 derivative lacking the N-terminal regulatory domain (MEKK1-ΔN) resulted in activation of MKK5. Similarly, a constitutive active form of either MKK4 (MKK4a) or MKK5 (MKK5a) activated MPK3 and MPK6. Flg22 activates MPK3 and MPK6 in a FLS2-dependent manner. Furthermore, transient expression of MEKK1-ΔN, MKK4a, or MKK5a led to enhanced resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), supporting the model for the complete MAPK cascade in defense responses (5Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). However, whether full-length MEKK1 directly interacts with and activates MKK4 and MKK5 remains to be shown. Instead, MEKK1 was shown to directly interact with MKK1 and MKK2, but not with MKK4, in yeast two-hybrid assays (12Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK1 also interacts with MPK4, but not MPK3, indicating that MEKK1 may act as a scaffold to establish specific phosphorylation relays for the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade (12Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, flg22 treatment activates MKK1 to phosphorylate and activate MPK4 (14Teige M. Scheikl E. Eulgem T. Doczi F. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Dangl J.L. Hirt H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 15Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because of these potential discrepancies in the specificity of signaling pathways during defense response, we tested the existing hypotheses by isolating two mutants of MEKK1 to examine the genetic requirement of this protein for activation of the various MAPKs downstream of FLS2. We show here that MEKK1 is required for activation of MPK4, but not MPK3 and MPK6, in response to flg22. Similar to the mpk4 mutants, the mekk1 plants exhibit constitutive expression of certain defense genes, such as PR1, PR2, and PR5. These data suggest that MEKK1 and MPK4 are the components of a MAPK cascade regulating plant defense responses. Furthermore, loss of MEKK1 results in temperature-dependent H2O2 accumulation and cell death in a tissue-specific manner. Interestingly, the H2O2 accumulation and cell death is partly RAR1- and SID2-dependent, indicating a potential link between MEKK1 and R protein-dependent defense signaling pathways.

Protein Extraction, Immunocomplex Kinase Assay, and Immunoblot Analysis—Tissue samples of seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and proteins were extracted with a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as described (27Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Yoshida R. Yuasa T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by the NuPAGE Novex BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (27Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Yoshida R. Yuasa T. Shinozaki K.

After immunoprecipitates were washed with 1 ml of reaction buffer without ATP (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) (29Zhang S.Q. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar), kinase assays were performed in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and myelin basic protein as a substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer. After electrophoresis on a 4-12% gradient gel, the phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography. Antibodies—A rabbit polyclonal antibody for MPK3 were raised using a peptide from the N terminus (MNTGGGQYTDFPAVEC) (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). MPK4-specific antibody (Ab4NT1) was raised from rabbit against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal peptide (FGSSGDQSSSKGVA) of MPK4 (Sawady Technology Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Conjugation to carrier protein, affinity purification, and MPK6-specific antibody (Ab6NT1) were previously described (27Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Yoshida R. Yuasa T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA Preparation and RT-PCR Analysis—Tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using Tri Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I-treated RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in H2O. RT reactions using Superscript III (Invitrogen) were performed with 1 μg of RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12-18 primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. ExTaq polymerase (Takara Bio, Japan) was used for RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions.

MPK3 and MPK4 primer sequences were described previously (30Menke F.L.H. van Pelt J.A. Pieterse C.M.J. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The mekk1 Mutants Exhibit Dwarfism and Lethality—To investigate functions of MEKK1 (At4g08500) in defense responses, we obtained two T-DNA insertion lines of MEKK1 in the Col background, which we designated as mekk1-1 (SALK_052557) and mekk1-2 (Gabi-Kat 813G10) in agreement with the group of H. Hirt (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) (Fig. 1A). The T-DNA insertion site in mekk1-1 was found in the first exon (nucleotide 82 from the start codon), and mekk1-2 was found in the first intron (nucleotide 1203) of MEKK1. Both mekk1-1 and mekk1-2 mutants were indistinguishable from wild type (WT) Col-0 plants 5 days after germination on plates (Fig. 1B). However, as soon as the first true leaves expanded, we noticed aberrant morphologies in mekk1 mutants (Fig. 1B, bottom). The true leaves were extremely small and curled to the abaxial side. The petiole elongation was also greatly inhibited. Both mekk1-1 and mekk1-2 exhibited dwarfism and eventually died after approximately 5 weeks on soil. The mutant plants also showed early senescence in cotyledons (Fig. 1C). We maintained mekk1-1 and mekk1-2 lines as heterozygous plants, which were morphologically indistinguishable from WT. The segregation of WT and dwarf/lethal phenotypes in the F2 generation was a 90:35 (3:1, χadj2 = 0.53; p = 0.47) and 320:118 ratio (3:1, χadj2 = 0.83; p = 0.36) for mekk1-1 and mekk1-2, respectively. These data indicate that the phenotypes were caused by the loss of MEKK1 function. MEKK1 Is Dispensable for MPK3 and MPK6 Activation— The complete MAPK cascade proposed by Asai et al. (5Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar) predicted that MEKK1 has a positive regulatory role in the FLS2 signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6 via activation of MKK4 and MKK5. To test this model genetically, we treated WT and mekk1 young seedlings with flg22 peptide (100 nm) and performed an immunocomplex kinase assay by using specific antibodies for MPK3 and MPK6. Consistent with previous reports, MPK3 and MPK6 were activated by the flg22 treatment in WT plants (Fig. 2A). In mekk1, we observed that MPK3 and MPK6 were still activated by flg22 (Fig. 2A). In fact, the activation levels in mekk1 were much higher than those observed in WT. Based on these results, we concluded that MEKK1 is dispensable for MPK3 and MPK6 activation by flg22. MPK4 Activation by flg22 Requires MEKK1—MPK4 was shown to be activated upon flg22 treatment (14Teige M. Scheikl E. Eulgem T. Doczi F. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Dangl J.L. Hirt H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 15Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Lauriere C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate if MEKK1 is involved in MPK4 activation by flg22, we performed a similar immunocomplex kinase assay for MPK4. Flg22 activated MPK4 in WT but weakly, if at all, in mekk1 plants (Fig. 2A). Since protein kinase activities of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 were changed in mekk1, we compared protein levels of these MAPKs in WT and mekk1 by immunoblot analysis. We found that MPK3 and MPK4 accumulated to higher levels in mekk1, whereas MPK6 levels were unchanged in the mutant (Fig. 2B). To examine if increased protein levels of MPK3 and MPK4 in mekk1 are due to increased accumulation of transcripts, we performed RT-PCR analysis. We observed up-regulation of MPK3 and MPK4 transcripts in mekk1 (Fig. 2C). Thus, it is possible that increased activity of MPK3 observed in mekk1 is due to the increased protein levels in the mutant. These data also show that loss of MPK4 activity in mekk1 in response to flg22 is not due to reduced MPK4 protein levels. These data indicate that MEKK1 is required for activation of MPK4 triggered by flg22. Loss of MEKK1 Resulted in Tissue-specific Cell Death—The dwarfism and late lethality phenotypes with early senescence are common to cell death mutants that express constitutive defense responses (31Lam E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that the phenotypes of mekk1 mutants may be due to microscopic cell death. To test this hypothesis, we stained 2-week-old mekk1 mutant plants grown at 22 °C with trypan blue, a common dye for visualizing dead cells (32Shirasu K. Lahaye L. Tan M.W. Zhou F. Azevedo C. Schulze-Lefert P. Cell. 1999; 99: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We observed dark-stained cells in the vasculature of leaves in both mekk1-1 and mekk1-2, whereas WT plants showed very faint, if any, stained cells around the same region (Fig. 3A, top panels). No mesophyll cells between the vasculature were stained at this stage of development. At higher magnification, elongated cells in the vasculature were stained much darker in the mekk1 mutants (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Four weeks after germination, we also observed stained mesophyll cells close to vascular tissue (Fig. 3B). Based on these data, we concluded that MEKK1 negatively regulates tissue-specific cell death. Tissue-specific H2O2 Accumulation in mekk1 Mutants—Cell death caused by either depletion of negative regulators of programmed cell death or activation of R proteins upon pathogen infection often associates with accumulation of H2O2 (33Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Greenberg J.T. Yao N. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To study H2O2 production in mekk1 mutants, we stained 2-week-old leaves with DAB, which polymerizes locally in an H2O2 dose-dependent manner (24Thordal-Christensen H. Zhang Z.G. Wei Y.D. Collinge D.B. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1187-1194Crossref Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). In WT plants, only xylem and trichomes were weakly stained (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In contrast, many cells in the vasculature were stained with DAB in both mekk1-1 and mekk1-2 mutants (Fig. 4, top). This result clearly correlated with the trypan blue staining pattern of mekk1 mutants. In addition, we found that many guard cells were also stained in mekk1 mutants (Fig. 4, bottom). In this case, however, the DAB polymerization was found only the side facing the stomatal pore in the guard cell (Fig. 4, bottom). The DAB staining in the guard cells did not correlate with the trypan blue staining pattern, since we did not observe trypan blue-stained guard cells. These results strongly suggest that H2O2 accumulation is associated with cell death in the vasculature but not in the guard cells. Constitutive Defense Responses in mekk1 Mutants—Mutants that express constitutive defense responses and spontaneous cell death phenotype often accumulate callose, which can be visualized by aniline blue (23Noutoshi Y. Ito T. Seki M. Nakashita H. Yoshida S. Marco Y. Shirasu K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2005; 43: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We observed callose deposition in the mesophyll cells in the leaf of mekk1 mutants when stained with aniline blue, whereas only weak staining was visible in the vasculature of WT plants (Fig. 5A). In contrast to trypan blue and DAB staining, callose deposition was mainly observed in the mesophyll cells and only weakly in the vasculature in mekk1. Next, we tested if mekk1 mutants exhibited expression of defense-related genes in the absence of a pathogen or elicitor. We analyzed accumulation of PR1, PR2, PR5, SAG12, and PDF1.2 transcripts, markers for salicylic acid (SA), senescence, and ethylene and jasmonate pathways (35Feys B.J. Parker J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We found that expression of PR1, PR2, PR5, and SAG12 genes was constitutively up-regulated in mekk1 mutants, whereas that of PDF1.2 was slightly down-regulated (Fig. 5B). We were not able to measure disease resistance in these mutants because of their dwarfism and lethality. Taken together, these data suggest that loss of MEKK1 function leads to constitutive activation of the defense-associated responses. Tissue-specific Expression of MEKK1—Since cell death and H2O2 accumulation in mekk1 mutants were observed in the vasculature, we investigated if the MEKK1 expression profile correlates with this pattern. A 3-kb DNA fragment containing the MEKK1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the GUS reporter gene and introduced into Arabidopsis. We found that the GUS reporter was expressed predominantly in vascular tissues, especially evident in cotyledons and true leaves (Fig. 6, A and B). Higher expression of GUS in mesophyll cells was also visible in emerging true leaves (data not shown) but weaker in expanded leaves (Fig. 6B). A transverse section of an expanded true leaf clearly indicated preferential expression of MEKK1 in the vasculature (Fig. 6C). We also found strong GUS expression in guard cells (Fig. 6D). Seventeen independent lines showed similar expression patterns. Thus, MEKK1 expression is tissue-specific and correlates well with the cell death phenotype and H2O2 accumulation in leaves. Suppression of mekk1 Phenotypes at High Temperature—Activation of R protein signaling and constitutive defense responses in the cell death mutants are often suppressed by high temperature and/or high humidity (23Noutoshi Y. Ito T. Seki M. Nakashita H. Yoshida S. Marco Y. Shirasu K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2005; 43: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36Bieri S. Mauch S. Shen Q.H. Peart J. Devoto A.

Corr C. Baker B. Cell. 1994; 78: 1011-1115Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). To test whether these conditions affect the mekk1 phenotypes, we performed growth recovery assays by a temperature shift. Plants were grown on plates at 22 °C for 10 days and then transferred to closed containers in growth chambers at 22 or 28 °C until 4 weeks old. Although mekk1 plants kept at 22 °C were extremely small with impaired leaf expansion and stem elongation, growing the plants at 28 °C greatly suppressed the severe dwarfism (Fig. 7A). Similarly, mekk1 plants grown from seeds on plates at 28 °C for 19 days were indistinguishable from the WT (Fig. 7B). By contrast, mekk1 plants grown at 26 °C were only slightly larger than those at 22 °C (Fig. 7C). High humidity did not suppress the phenotypes, since mekk1 plants grown in the closed containers still exhibited dwarfism and lethality at 22 °C. Next, we examined cell death and H2O2 accumulation in mekk1 plants kept at 28 °C after the temperature shift. Compared with plants at 22 °C, the number of trypan blue- and DAB-stained cells was greatly reduced (Fig. 7, D and E). Thus, the growth defect phenotypes observed in mekk1 were correlated with the level of cell death and H2O2 accumulation. These data also indicate that the temperature-dependent process is upstream of cell death and H2O2 accumulation. To investigate if the dwarfism and lethality can be unlinked to MAPK activities in mekk1 mutants, we carried out immunocomplex MAPK assays using WT and mekk1 plants grown at 28 °C for 3 weeks (Fig. 7F). Flg22 treatments activated MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 in WT plants, indicating that the signaling pathways were intact at this temperature. In contrast, MPK4 was only slightly activated, if at all, in mekk1 mutants. Thus, reduction of MPK4 activation by flg22 in mekk1 mutants is not due to dwarfism and lethality. Furthermore MPK3 and MPK6 activities were unchanged in mekk1 mutants, supporting our conclusion that MEKK1 is dispensable for MPK3 and MPK6 activation by flg22. Interestingly, unlike at 22 °C, MPK3 and MPK6 were not hyperactivated at this temperature. Thus, hyperactivation of MPK3 and MPK6 was tightly linked to dwarfism and lethality in mekk1 plants. And the hyperactivation is likely to be due to stresses caused by the dwarfism. Partial Suppression of mekk1 Phenotypes in rar1 or sid2— The temperature-dependent cell death phenotypes in mekk1 plants indicated that R-protein-dependent signaling pathways may be activated in the mutant. To test this hypothesis, we crossed mekk1 into rar1 or edm1 (sgt1b deletion) mutants that exhibit loss of R-protein-dependent disease resistance against particular isolates of Pst and Hyalopernospora parasitica (18Tornero P. Merritt P. Sadanandom A. Shirasu K. Innes R.W. Dangl J.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Tör M. Gordon P. Cuzick A. Eulgem T. Sinapidou E. Mert-Turk F. Can C. Dangl J.L. Holub E.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). There was little or no suppression of the dwarfism in mekk1/edm1 or mekk1/rar1 double mutants compared with mekk1 when grown at 22 °C (data not shown). Interestingly, however, the dwarf phenotype was greatly recovered in the mekk1/rar1 at 26 °C, whereas mekk1/edm1 plants were only slightly bigger than mekk1 (Fig. 8A).

However, these nanoparticles inhalation can induce pulmonary toxicity and its mechanism is not fully understood. In this study we investigated the pulmonary toxicity of nanoTiO2 and its molecular pathogenesis. The adult male ICR mice were exposed to intratracheal single dose of 0.1 or 0.5 mg nanoTiO2 (19-21 nm) and lung tissues were collected at 3rd day, 1st wk, and 2nd wk for morphometric, microarray gene expression, and pathway analyses. NanoTiO2 can induce pulmonary emphysema, macrophages accumulation, extensive disruption of alveolar septa, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and epithelial cell apoptosis. NanoTiO2 induced differential expression of hundreds of genes include activation of pathways involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, chemokines, and complement cascades. In particular, nanoTiO2 up-regulates placenta growth factor (PlGF) and other chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL3) expressions that may cause pulmonary emphysema and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Cultured human THP-1 cell-derived macrophages treated with nanoTiO2 in vitro also resulted in up-regulations of PlGF, CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL3. These results indicated that nanoTiO2 can induce severe pulmonary emphysema, which may be caused by activation of PlGF and related inflammatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2076002276,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and cAMP signaling systems are both key regulators of cellular metabolism. In this study, we show that AMPK activity is attenuated in response to cAMP-elevating agents through modulation of at least two of its α subunit phosphorylation sites, viz. α-Thr172 and α1-Ser485/α2-Ser491, in the clonal β-cell line INS-1 as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and COS cells. Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide inhibited AMPK activity and reduced phosphorylation of the activation loop α-Thr172 via inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-α and -β, but not LKB1. These agents also enhanced phosphorylation of α-Ser485/491 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. AMPK α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation was necessary but not sufficient for inhibition of AMPK activity in response to forskolin/isobutylmethylxanthine. We show that AMPK α-Ser485/491 can be a site for autophosphorylation, which may play a role in limiting AMPK activation in response to energy depletion or other regulators. Thus, our findings not only demonstrate cross-talk between the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMPK signaling modules, but also describe a novel mechanism by which multisite phosphorylation of AMPK contributes to regulation of its enzyme activity.

The mammalian enzyme is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase consisting of a catalytic subunit, α, and two regulatory and targeting subunits, β and γ. Covalent activation of AMPK is mediated through its major regulatory phosphorylation site, α-Thr172, located within the “activation” loop on the α subunit. Phosphorylation of this site is essential for activity and can be catalyzed by four Thr172 AMPK kinases (AMPKKs), viz. LKB1 (1Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Mäkelä T.P.

The discovery that AMPK can be regulated not only by changes in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio, but also by the CaMKKs, which can be activated in response to several cell-surface ligands, has broadened the conceptual view of AMPK regulation (19Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Kola B. Boscaro M. Rutter G.A. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that many extracellular ligands, including leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, bradykinin, and catecholamines, can regulate AMPK activity (20Kola B. Boscaro M. Rutter G.A. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). cAMP signaling systems are known to regulate many of the same metabolic pathways of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism that have more recently been shown to be regulated by the AMPK signaling system. Instances of cross-talk between cAMP signaling and AMPK pathways are well documented in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Physiologic stimuli such as exercise and fasting, as well as hormonal stimulation via β-adrenergic receptors, may result in the simultaneous stimulation of both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and AMPK (21Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 23Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these tissues, both kinases likely work in synergy to regulate key enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism, cholesterol synthesis, and fatty acid metabolism (23Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Biochim.

However, AMPK and PKA can also antagonize one another, as is the case in their regulation of hormone-sensitive lipase, which regulates lipolysis in both adipose and muscle tissue (28Watt M.J.

In this study, we examined the relationship between the cAMP and AMPK signaling systems in an insulin-secreting cell line, INS-1. This cell line was chosen because it expresses many of the metabolic pathways regulated by both systems; responds to multiple ligands such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1, which work through Gs-coupled receptors that activate adenylyl cyclase; and has several characteristic phenotypic responses, including insulin secretion, that are influenced by activation of both pathways. Our results indicate an important intersection between these two signaling systems that involves regulation by cAMP signaling of AMPKKs active on both α-Thr172 and α-Ser485/491, underscoring the importance of multisite phosphorylation in the modulation of AMPK activity. Cell Culture, Incubation, and Extraction—INS-1 cells (a kind gift of Christopher Newgard, Duke University) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. COS cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from LKB1+/+ and LKB1–/– mice were kindly provided by Reuben Shaw (Harvard University). MEFs from CaMKKβ+/+ and CaMKKβ–/– mice 4K. A. Anderson and A. R. Means, manuscript in preparation. were prepared as described (29Robertson E. Robertson E.

MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were incubated in 6-well plates after various additions prior to extraction for immunoblotting and analysis of AMPK or AMPKK activity. Cell extracts were prepared in a 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer as described (30Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowski S.A. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem.

These included anti-total AMPKα (reactive against both the α1 and α2 subunits), anti-AMPK α-phospho-Thr172, anti-AMPK α-phospho-Ser485/491, and anti-CaMKKα/β (C terminus; BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-total Akt (pleckstrin homology domain; catalog no. 05-591, Upstate); and anti-Akt phospho-Thr308 (catalog no. 9275) and anti-Akt phospho-Ser473 (catalog no. 9271) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Where appropriate for quantitation, immunoblots were scanned into Adobe Photoshop using a UMAX Astra 6700 scanner with SilverFast software (Laser Soft Imaging AG, Kiel, Germany) at standardized settings. Band pixel intensity was quantified using IPLab Gel software. Anti-CaMKK isoform polyclonal antibodies employed in immunoprecipitation were raised by immunizing rabbits with peptide sequences specific for CaMKKα (CQDPRAELVERVAAIDCTH, corresponding to residues 9–27 of the human sequence) or CaMKKβ (EALRGLSSLSIHLGMESF, corresponding to residues 35–52 of the human sequence). Antisera were then purified by immunoaffinity chromatography against each peptide sequence, and specificity for the isoforms was determined by immunoblotting of authentic recombinant proteins (data not shown). AMPK Immunoprecipitation and Activity—AMPK was immunoprecipitated from experimental or control cell extracts prepared in triplicate, each representing a pooling of 2 wells treated under identical conditions. Protein-matched extracts (200–500 μg of total protein) were incubated with 40 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and 5 μl of serum containing antibodies immunoreactive against amino acids 2–20 of both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 or with control preimmune serum in a total volume of 1 ml. Following incubation for 2 h at 4°C, extracts were spun down briefly for 20 s at 12,000 rpm to gently pellet the beads. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the beads were washed once with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then subsequently washed two times with the same buffer containing no Triton. The beads were then resuspended in 50 μlof this buffer, and 10 μl of the resulting immune complexes was immediately assayed in duplicate for AMPK activity against the SAMS peptide at a saturating concentration of AMP as described (15Witters L.A.

CaMKK Immunoprecipitation and Activity—CaMKKα and CaMKKβ were immunoprecipitated from experimental or control cell extracts prepared in triplicate, each representing a pooling of 2 wells treated under identical conditions. Protein-matched extracts were divided into three equal fractions and incubated with 40 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads and purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either CaMKKα CaMKKβ or rabbit normal IgG (Sigma) as a control. The concentration of each antibody used was 1 μg/100 μg of total extract protein. Following incubation for 2 h at 4°C, extracts were spun down briefly at 20 s for 12,000 rpm to gently pellet the beads. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the beads were washed once with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then subsequently washed twice with reaction buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For determination of CaMKKα and CaMKKβ enzyme activity, immune complexes were resuspended in a total volume of 80 μl of reaction buffer. 25 μl of each suspension (final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was then incubated in a final volume of 60 μl with recombinant AMPKα1-(1–312) (1 μg) (30Hamilton S.R.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody directed against AMPK α-phospho-Thr172 to detect phosphorylation of recombinant AMPKα1-(1–312). AMPK α1-Ser485 Kinase Assays—AMPKK activity in cell extracts directed against the AMPK α-Ser485/491 site was determined by phosphorylation of recombinant AMPKα1-(250–548) as described (30Hamilton S.R.

The catalytic subunit (22.4 units) was incubated with 1.6 μg of recombinant AMPKα1-(250–548) in the presence of either [γ-32P]ATP or unlabeled ATP (200 μm) and Mg2+ (5 mm), and phosphate incorporation was monitored by either by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of radiolabeled proteins or by immunoblotting for α1-phospho-Ser485.

At 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium and then treated with forskolin (10 μm) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 500 μm) or ethanol (1:50) for 30 min. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as described above.

For immunoblot analysis, isolated heterotrimer (HT) samples were boiled in the presence of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and further diluted 1:1 with the sample buffer to reduce the effects of high salt on separation by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro kinase assays with recombinant CaMKKβ, isolated complexes were first dephosphorylated and inactivated by incubation with 50 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 30 °C for 30 min according to manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were stopped with 10 μm sodium vanadate to inactivate phosphatase activity. Half of this reaction was then incubated with or without 10 μg of recombinant CaMKKβ in the presence of 200 μm ATP and 5 mm Mg2+ as described (29Robertson E. Robertson E. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1987: 104-108Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 30 min, at which time reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies directed against AMPK α-phospho-Thr172, AMPK α-phospho-Ser485/491, and total AMPKα. The enzyme activities of the dephosphorylated and rephosphorylated heterotrimer complexes were measured against the SAMS peptide at a saturating concentration of AMP as described (15Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Materials—Reagents, including forskolin, IBMX, and the PKA peptide inhibitor (PKI), were purchased from Sigma. GIP was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of experimental data was performed by a paired Student's t test with two-tailed distribution. In instances in which data sets could not be paired, analysis was done unpaired, but with equal variance between data sets. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Treatment of INS-1 cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, or with GIP, a gastrointestinal hormone whose Gs-coupled receptor can activate the cAMP pathway (32Drucker D.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 153-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar), leads to the significant inhibition of AMPK activity (Fig. 1A). IBMX, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, also had similar effects (data not shown). Coincident with this activity change, AMPK α-Thr172 phosphorylation was decreased (Fig. 1, B, middle panel; and C). Additionally, there was a notably slower electrophoretic migration of AMPKα in the presence of forskolin and GIP (Fig. 1B, left panel), raising the possibility of phosphorylation of AMPKα at additional sites. Further analysis demonstrated that there was increased phosphorylation of α-Ser485/491, most prominent on the slowest migrating α band, which was minimally phosphorylated at Thr172 (Fig. 1, B, right panel; and C). Quantitation of these changes in AMPKα site-specific phosphorylation by scanning densitometry revealed similar magnitude changes in response to forskolin and GIP (Fig. 1C). Three upstream AMPKKs identified as LKB1, CaMKKα, and CaMKKβ activate AMPK by phosphorylating α-Thr172 (1Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Mäkelä T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J.

Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). To test whether any of these AMPKKs are required to mediate the cAMP-dependent inhibition of AMPK, we first utilized fibroblast cell lines derived from mouse embryos lacking either LKB1 (3Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 4Hurley R.L. Anderson K.A.

To ensure a persistent elevation of cAMP levels, cells were treated with both IBMX and forskolin (Fig. 2). In wild-type MEFs, this treatment triggered an AMPK response similar to that observed in INS-1 cells, with a decrease in AMPK activity (Fig. 2C) concomitant with reduced α-Thr172 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B, upper panels) and increased α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B, middle panels). These effects were preserved in LKB1–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A), indicating that LKB1 is not required to mediate the effects of elevated cAMP. In contrast, loss of CaMKKβ largely abrogated the cAMP-dependent reduction in both AMPK activity and α-Thr172 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B, upper panel; and C), demonstrating that CaMKKβ is an important intermediary in reducing AMPK α-Thr172 phosphorylation by agents that elevate cAMP. However, the absence of CaMKKβ did not alter the ability of forskolin/IBMX to increase α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Reduced phosphorylation of AMPK α-Thr172 could be the result of cAMP-mediated inhibition of the activity of one or more of the three known AMPKKs. To test this question directly, we attempted to immunoprecipitate LKB1, CaMKKα, and CaMKKβ from extracts of either control or forskolin-treated INS-1 cells and assay for AMPKK activity with a recombinant AMPKα1-(1–312) protein substrate. Although LKB1 was expressed in the INS-1 line (data not shown), we were unable to immunoprecipitate LKB1 activity with commercially available antibodies, leaving unanswered the question of whether this kinase can be directly regulated in response to elevated cAMP levels. However, both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ were also expressed in the INS-1 cells, and their activities could be immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with other observations (33Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), isolated CaMKKα and CaMKKβ exhibited detectable kinase activity only in the presence of added Ca2+/calmodulin (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, forskolin treatment led to a significant 40% decrease in both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ activities, as measured in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, against the AMPKα1-(1–312) fusion protein (Fig. 3, B and C). Forskolin treatment did not affect the recovery of either CaMKKα or CaMKKβ in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Taken together, the studies in CaMKKβ–/– MEFs, coupled with the in vitro measurements of individual CaMKK activities in INS-1 cell extracts, show that CaMKKα and/or CaMKKβ is required to mediate the forskolin-dependent inhibition of AMPK activity. Autophosphorylation—Although the cAMP-dependent inhibition of AMPK activity might be accounted for by the attenuation of phosphorylation of AMPK α-Thr172, the unexpected finding that another site in AMPK, α-Ser485/491, shows simultaneously a significant increase in phosphorylation raises several important questions regarding not only the nature of this phosphorylation event, but also how phosphorylation of the α-Ser485/491 site might contribute to overall enzyme activity. Regulation of phosphorylation of the α-Ser485/491 site has not been well characterized to date. There are reports suggesting that it is likely to be both an autophosphorylation site (13Horman S. Vertommen D. Heath R. Neumann D. Mouton V. Woods A. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carling D. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5335-5340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as well as a target for protein kinase B/Akt (13Horman S. Vertommen D. Heath R. Neumann D. Mouton V.

Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H2472-H2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To directly test the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate AMPK α-Ser485/491, we utilized an in vitro kinase kinase assay in which bacterially expressed truncated AMPKα1-(1–312) was first activated by recombinant CaMKKβ as described (30Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowski S.A. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and then incubated with a recombinant AMPKα1 protein substrate containing an unoccupied α1-Ser485 site. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of α1-Ser485 occurred only in the presence of active AMPKα1-(1–312), whereas both inactive AMPKα and CaMKKβ were unable to phosphorylate the site. In intact wild-type MEFs, treatment with known AMPK activators (ionomycin and 2-deoxyglucose) led to stimulation of AMPK activity (4Hurley R.L. Anderson K.A. Franzone J.M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) concomitant with increased α-Thr172 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, lower panel). This enhanced activity was also accompanied by a significant increase in α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Although these results are not inconsistent with an autophosphorylation event, the extent of α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation does not parallel α-Thr172 phosphorylation with these two AMPK activators, leaving open the possibility that other α-Ser485/491-directed AMPKKs may play a role in α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation during AMPK activation. Evidence for an α-Ser485/491 AMPKK—Because AMPK activity is substantially inhibited under conditions of elevated cAMP levels, the enhanced phosphorylation of α-Ser485/491 in response to forskolin and GIP is unlikely to be due to an autophosphorylation event, suggesting the existence of a separate α-Ser485/491 AMPKK. Such an activity was demonstrated using an in vitro kinase kinase assay in which INS-1 cell extracts made from control or forskolin- or IBMX-treated cells were incubated with a recombinant AMPKα1 protein substrate containing an unoccupied α1-Ser485 site. As shown in Fig. 4C, forskolin- and IBMX-treated cells extracts showed significantly enhanced AMPKK activity against α1-Ser485, with little activity detectable in unstimulated cells. Identity of the Forskolin-stimulated α-Ser485/491 AMPKK—Based on the studies done in the intact MEFs, forskolin-induced enhancement of α-Ser485/491 phosphorylation was maintained in the absence of both LKB1 and CaMKKβ (Fig. 2, A and B). By direct measurement, both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ activities were inhibited by forskolin and exhibited little activity in the absence of added Ca2+/calmodulin, as in the conditions of our lysate kinase kinase assay (Fig. 3C). We were also unable to demonstrate in vitro that either of the CaMKKs can phosphorylate the α-Ser485/491 site (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Taken together, these observations make it unlikely that any of the three known α-Thr172 AMPKKs double as the cAMP-stimulated α-Ser485/491 AMPKK. Recent studies have identified protein kinase B/Akt as an α-Ser485/491 AMPKK that is, in part, responsible for inhibition of AMPK activity during insulin signaling (13Horman S. Vertommen D. Heath R.

However, 1alpha-hydroxylase has been reported at extrarenal sites. Whether bone is a 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 synthesizing tissue is not univocal. The aim of this study was to investigate an autocrine/paracrine function for 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 in bone. We show that 1alpha-hydroxylase is expressed in human osteoblasts, as well as the vitamin D binding protein receptors megalin and cubilin. Functional analyses demonstrate that after incubation with the 1alpha-hydroxylase substrate 25-(OH)D3, the osteoblasts can produce sufficient 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 to modulate osteoblast activity, resulting in induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin (OC) and CYP24 mRNA expression, and mineralization. The classical renal regulators of 1alpha-hydroxylase, parathyroid hormone, and ambient calcium do not regulate 1alpha-hydroxylase in osteoblasts. In contrast, interleukin (IL)-1beta strongly induces 1alpha-hydroxylase. Besides the bone-forming cells, we demonstrate 1alpha-hydroxylase activity in the bone resorbing cells, the osteoclasts. This is strongly dependent on osteoclast inducer RANKL. This study showing expression, activity, and functionality of 1alpha-hydroxylase unequivocally demonstrates that vitamin D can act in an auto/paracrine manner in bone."

SPT is considered to be a heterodimer composed of two subunits, SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. Here we report the identification of a novel, third, SPT subunit (SPTLC3) that shows 68% homology to the SPTLC2 subunit. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that SPTLC3 expression is highly variable between different human tissues and cell lines. The highest expression was observed in placenta tissue and human trophoblast cell lines. The overexpression of SPTLC3 in Hek293 cells, which otherwise have very little endogenous SPTLC3, led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cellular SPT activity. Silencing of SPTLC3 expression in HepG2 cells or human trophoblast cells by transfecting SPTLC3-specific siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of cellular SPT activity. The expression of two SPT isoforms could be a cellular mechanism to adjust SPT activity to tissue-specific requirements of sphingolipid synthesis."

Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). At least four syndecan family members, which are transmembrane HSPGs (type I integral membrane proteins), have been described. The glypican family consists of five members and differ from syndicans in that the core protein is attached to the cell surface via a COOH-terminal glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol anchor. HSPGs bind to a litany of extracellular molecules, including growth factors, adhesion molecules, morphogens, and morphogen antagonists. Consequently, HSPGs are versatile coordinators of cellular function (2Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and are emerging as important modulators of morphogen gradients during embryonic development (3Selleck S.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies implicate HSPGs in regulating multiple signaling pathways during embryogenesis and regeneration. For example, mutations in the Drosophila genes sulfateless and sugarless, encoding HS N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, respectively, exhibit abnormalities in Wingless (Wg)-mediated dorsal/ventral patterning (4Haerry T.E. Heslip T.R. Marsh J.L. O'Connor M.B. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3055-3064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lin X. Perrimon N.

A Drosophila mutant of tout velu, an HS co-polymerase gene, exhibits abnormal Wg, Hedgehog, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity (6Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A. Tabata T. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The clinical relevance of HSPG function is demonstrated by inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor genes EXT1 or EXT2, vertebrate homologues of tout velu, which cause hereditary multiple exostoses, an auto-somal dominant disease in humans and mice characterized by benign orthotopic endochondral tumors, also known as osteochrondromas, with malignant potential (7Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). BMPs are secreted morphogens, playing crucial developmental roles in mesoderm formation, neural patterning, skeletal development, and limb formation (8Hogan B.L. Harvey. Lect. 1996; 92: 83-98PubMed Google Scholar). BMPs are heparin-binding proteins, and BMP-mediated developmental processes involve BMPHSPG interactions (9Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). HS/heparan chains bind BMP4 and restrict the expression pattern of BMP4 in Xenopus embryos (10Ohkawara B.

In addition, the combined genetic deficiency for glypican-3 and BMP4 results in abnormal skeletal development in vertebrates (13Grisaru S. Cano-Gauci D. Tee J. Filmus J. Rosenblum N.D. Dev.

Mutations in the core protein of glypican-3, a member of the HSPG superfamily of molecules, are responsible for Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome, a genetic disease involving skeletal overgrowth in humans (14Pilia G.

Despite compelling in vivo evidence, the direct role of HSPGs on BMP-mediated signal transduction remains poorly understood. Since BMP2 can induce transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into osteoblasts (15Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Ab E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), we used this in vitro model to study involvement of HSPGs in BMP2-mediated osteogenic signaling. Our results suggest that HSPGs modulate BMP2 osteogenic activity by sequestering BMP2 at the cell surface and mediate its internalization. Cell Culture and Treatments—C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For all treatments, cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104/well. Heparin (Sigma) and rhBMP2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) were added simultaneously to the culture media. To decrease GAG chain sulfation, cells were pretreated with 20 mm sodium chlorate (Sigma), a selective inhibitor of sulfation for 48 h. To selectively remove HSPG GAG chains, cells were treated with heparinase III (2 sigma units/ml) for 2 h, and then BMP2 and/or heparin were added in the continuous presence of sodium chlorate or heparinase. Cells were fed every 2 days with fresh medium supplemented with BMP2, heparinase III, or sodium chlorate as indicated. GAG Chain Assessment—GAG chain sulfation levels were assessed with dimethylmethylene blue (DMB) dye binding, which interacts with sulfated GAG chains on all proteoglycans. For the dye binding assay, untreated heparinase III (2 sigma units/ml), or sodium chlorate (NaClO3; 20 mm)-treated cells were washed and resuspended in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Thirty-μl aliquots of each sample were mixed with 125 μl of DMB and read in 96-well plates at 520 nm using a Bio-Tek Synergy HT microtiter plate spectrophotometer (16de Jong J.G. Wevers R.A. Laarakkers C. Poorthuis B.J. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). To confirm enzymatic cleavage of GAG chains, cells were treated with heparinase III, washed, and incubated with an anti-Δ-heparan mouse monoclonal antibody (antibody number 370260; Seikagaku America), which specifically detects heparinase cleaved stubs. The cells were washed and incubated with an anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase secondary antibody conjugate (Sigma). Samples were developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate stopped by the addition of 0.1 n H2SO4 and read at 450 nm. Anti-BMPRIA Antibody—Antibodies to BMP receptor IA (BMPRIA) (Entrez protein sequence number P36894) were made against a synthetic peptide GMKSDSDQKKSEN-C, comprising residues 34–46 in the extracellular domain of BMPRIA. Antibodies were prepared in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Assay—Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with insoluble substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Moss, Inc. Pasadena, MD) for 10 min. Stained cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 5 min and air-dried. Alternatively, to quantify ALP activity, cell lysates were incubated with soluble substrate, p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma), for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1 m NaOH, and color development was measured at 405 nm. ALP activity was normalized for total protein concentration, determined with a BCA protein assay. Mineralization Assay—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mml-ascorbate-2-phosphate, 10-6 m dexamethasone (Sigma), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 300 ng/ml rhBMP2 and/or 2 mg/ml heparin for 4 weeks. Cells were stained with 1% Alizarin red (pH 4.2) for 10 min. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase I (1 unit/5 μgof RNA) at 37 °C for 30 min. mRNA for osteoblast marker genes was detected by real-time PCR with ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using β-actin as an endogenous control. Forward and reverse primer sequences were as follows: osteopontin, 5′-TTTGCTTTTGCCTGTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTCACTTTCACCGGGAGG-3′; osteocalcin, 5′-CCGGGAGCAGTGTGAGCTTA-3′ and 5′-TAGATGCGTTTGTAGGCGGTC-3′; collagen type I, 5′-GCATGGCCAAGAAGACATCC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGGTTTCCACGTCTC-3′; RUNX2, 5′-GTGCGGTGCAAACTTTCTCC-3′ and 5′-AATGACTCGGTTGGTCTCGG-3′; alkaline phosphatase, 5′-GTGCCCTGACTGAGGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGATCATCGTGTCCTGCTCAC-3′; and β-actin, 5′-AAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-CATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCC-3′. Western Blots—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Invitrogen) for 1 h on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Twenty μgof protein were loaded in each lane, subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Milipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with primary anti-phospho-Smad1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with chemiluminescence using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BMP2 Internalization Assay—BMP2 (12 μl of 400 ng/ml) was incubated with mouse anti-BMP2 monoclonal antibody (40 μl of 500 ng/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. C2C12 cells were seeded in chamber slides and pretreated either with 20 mm sodium chlorate for 48 h and/or with antibody against BMPRIA for 2 h. Cells were next incubated with BMP2-anti-BMP2 complex (30 min, 4 °C) to allow complex binding to the cell surface. The cells were washed with ice-cold serum-free medium to remove unbound BMP2-anti-BMP2 complex and then incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 60 min to allow ligand internalization. Following incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with acetone, and blocked with 5% goat serum for 20 min. For BMP2 staining, cells were incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:2000) for 30 min. Fluorescence was monitored with a Leica microscope equipped with epifluorescence, and images were analyzed with Openlab software (Improvision Inc, Lexington, MA). Fluorescein Labeling—Carrier-free rhBMP2 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) was fluorescein-labeled using an EZ-Label fluorescent labeling kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. To assess ligand internalization, cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with FL-BMP2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min on ice to allow ligand engagement onto its cognate receptor. The cells were transferred to 37 °C, and at defined time periods, samples were fixed in ice-cold acetone, air-dried, and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). To reduce surface HSPGs, cells were treated with heparinase III in serum-free medium (2 sigma units/ml) for 2 h at 37°C, prior to incubation with FL-BMP2 ligand. Reduction of Cell Surface HSPG Synthesis or GAG Chain Removal Enhances BMP2-induced ALP—First, we confirmed previous reports that BMP2 can direct C2C12 cell differentiation into an osteoblast lineage (15Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Ab E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). When treated with 300 ng/ml BMP2 for 6 days, C2C12 cells expressed osteoblast markers including osteocalcin, collagen type I, Runx2, and ALP as measured by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1a). We observed no changes in osteopontin expression. BMP2 also induced robust ALP activity, as shown histo-chemically (Fig. 1b). BMPRIA has been reported to be critical for BMP2-mediated osteoblast differentiation in C2C12 cells (17Namiki M. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Yamaji N. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22046-22052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). When C2C12 cells were pretreated with antibodies against BMPRIA before the addition of BMP2, no ALP activity was detected, nor was any expression of osteoblast markers osteocalcin, collagen type I, Runx2, or ALP observed (Fig. 1b). To determine the effect of GAG side chains on BMP2 signaling, cells were treated with sodium chlorate, which blocks sulfation of GAG chains on all cell surface proteoglycans including heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Chlorate treatment reduced cell surface GAG chain sulfation levels over the 6-day treatment, as assessed by DMB binding (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with heparinase III, which specifically cleaves HSPG GAG chains (18Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), reduced GAG chain levels as demonstrated by DMB staining. In these experiments, GAG chain levels were reduced at day 2 but exhibited a slight recovery at days 4 and 6 (Fig. 2A). Heparinase III cleavage was also established by immunological analysis (see “Materials and Methods”), which specifically detects heparinase cleaved stubs (Fig. 2B). Reduction of GAG chain sulfation or HSPGs increased BMP2-induced ALP activity dose-dependently (Fig. 3, a–c). This indicated that GAG chain sulfation and cell surface HSPGs play a role in regulating ALP expression. However, ALP activity was dependent on BMP2 concentration. With BMP2 at 300 ng/ml, ALP activity remained stable, regardless of the concentration of sodium chlorate, i.e. regardless of the level of GAG chain sulfation at the cell surface. HSPGs Mediate BMP2 Internalization—Since BMP2 has a heparin-binding domain, we investigated the consequence of BMP2 binding to HSPGs at the cell surface. C2C12 cells were pretreated with sodium chlorate and/or with antibodies against BMPRIA to block specific BMP receptors. The cells were subsequently treated with BMP2 preincubated with anti-BMP2 at 4 °C for 30 min to allow BMP2 binding to the cell surface. After unbound BMP2 was washed out, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to monitor BMP2 internalization. A subgroup of cells were grown for 6 days, and ALP activity was detected in those cells. When GAG chain sulfation was decreased by sodium chlorate, BMP2 binding capacity was reduced significantly, whereas there was no change in BMP2 binding when BMPRIA was blocked. These results suggest that the major component of BMP2 binding capacity was due to GAG chain modification on HSPGs or other poteoglycans rather than BMP receptors. BMP2 binding capacity was further reduced to background levels when cells were treated with sodium chlorate and BMPRIA antibodies (Fig. 4). After 1 h at 37°C, internalized BMP2 was discernable as cytoplasmic aggregates of various sizes. BMP2 internalization was seen only in cells with sulfated GAG chains intact, independent of receptor occupancy. In cells with reduced GAG chain sulfation, BMP2 internalization was not discernable (Fig. 4, middle panel). However, signaling was enhanced, as indicated by increased ALP induction (Fig. 4, bottom panel). BMP2 internalized through BMP2-receptor complexes, in the absence of GAG chain sulfation, was extremely low and undetectable by fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that BMP2 internalization may not be necessary for signaling. For the studies described above, BMP internalization was monitored by preincubating BMP2 with a specific BMP2 monoclonal antibody and followed by internalization of the BMP2-antibody complex. Native BMP2 is a dimer of molecular mass of ∼26 kDa, whereas the BMP2-antibody complex has a molecular mass of ∼190 kDa (26 + 160). To confirm that internalization of the BMP2-antibody complex is the same as BMP2 alone, fluorescein-labeled BMP2 (BMP2-FL) was used (Fig. 5). The modified BMP2 was biologically active. To assess ligand internalization, cells were incubated with BMP2-FL on ice to allow ligand-receptor engagement and then incubated at 37 °C for internalization. BMP2 localizes to the cell surface following incubation on ice. After incubation at 37 °C, BMP2 localizes to small intracellular vesicles. Pretreatment of cells with heparinase III reduces BMP2 binding and internalization (Fig. 5, A–D), as observed with the BMP2-antibody complex (Fig. 4). As a positive control, cells were also incubated with fluorescent-tagged-transferrin, an iron-binding protein whose internalization by cells has been well characterized (19Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Stenmark H. Cell. 2003; 115: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transferrin binds and is internalized by C2C12 cells (Fig. 5, E and F). However, in contrast to BMP2, heparinase treatment has no effect on transferrin internalization (Fig. 5, G and H). Exogenous Heparin Dose-dependently Modulates BMP2 Morphogenetic Bioactivity—We next examined the effects of exogenous heparin on BMP2 signaling with cell surface HSPGs intact. Heparin attenuated ALP expression at high concentrations (>2 μg/ml) with a minimal response at the lowest BMP concentration (50 ng/ml) tested (Fig. 6, a and c). In contrast, sodium chlorate treatment resulted in a similar reduction in BMP-induced ALP induction with increasing heparin concentration, regardless of the BMP2 concentration utilized for induction (Fig. 6, b and d). Heparin alone had no effect on ALP activity. In addition, treatment of cells with heparin or BMP2 did not have any significant effect on cell proliferation rate or cell viability, as demonstrated by a cell proliferation assay (data not shown). The effects of HSPGs on BMP2 signaling were further investigated by examining activation of Smad1, a BMP2 signal transduction mediator. At a concentration of 2 mg/ml, heparin inhibited BMP2-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7a) and blocked the increase of several osteoblast-specific markers including osteocalcin, Runx2, collagen type I, and ALP after 6 days (Fig. 7b), as well as mineralization after 4 weeks (Fig. 7c). We postulate that at low concentrations, free heparin competes with cell surface HSPGs for BMP2 binding, whereas at higher concentrations (>2 μg/ml), it blocks BMP2-receptor interactions. On cells whose surface HSPGs have been depleted, heparin manifested only inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, b and d). Although the role of BMPs as developmental morphogens is well established, the mechanism by which BMP activity gradients are generated is not well understood. HSPGs can bind BMPs and their secreted antagonists (20Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Kirkpatrick C.A. Dimitroff B.D. Rawson J.M. Selleck S.B. Dev.

Cell. 2004; 7: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and two models have been proposed for the role of HSPGs in BMP gradient formation. In one model, HSPGs move BMPs from cell to cell through restricted diffusion (12Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Yan D. Opoka R.J. Khodoun M. Liu H. Lin X. Cell. 2004; 119: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In another model, HSPGs retain BMP antagonists such as noggin and establish inverse gradients of BMP activity (20Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). HSPGs have a relatively rapid turnover rate (23Egeberg M. Kjeken R. Kolset S.O. Berg T. Prydz K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mediate internalization of a diverse array of extracellular ligands including FGF2 (24Colin S. Jeanny J.C. Mascarelli F. Vienet R. Al-Mahmood S. Courtois Y. Labarre J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Chordin (a BMP antagonist) (25Jasuja R. Allen B.L. Pappano W.N. Rapraeger A.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51289-51297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), lipoproteins (26Kolset S.O. Salmivirta M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and viral particles (27Shafti-Keramat S. Handisurya A. Kriehuber E. Meneguzzi G. Slupetzky K. Kirnbauer R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13125-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that HSPGs can mediate the sequestration and internalization of BMP2, thus offering an additional mechanism by which HSPGs could regulate BMP morphogenetic gradients. Our results suggest that HSPGs are abundant on the surface of C2C12 cells and, in addition to BMP signaling receptors, constitute a major part of the BMP2 binding capacity of the cells. When HSPG synthesis is reduced by sodium chlorate, the BMP2 binding capacity is decreased significantly, and no BMP2 internalization is detected. However, ALP activity is enhanced in the absence of HSPGs. These results suggest that HSPGs or other proteoglycans not only trap BMP2 on the surface but are also capable of mediating its internalization (Figs. 4 and 5). Following internalization, HSPGs are degraded rapidly by the lysosomal pathway or recycled back to the cell surface (23Egeberg M. Kjeken R. Kolset S.O. Berg T. Prydz K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is not clear how BMP receptors mediate BMP internalization, but transforming growth factor-β receptors are reported to be internalized through both the lipid raft caveolar-mediated and clathrin-mediated early endosome pathways (18Belting M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not know which pathways mediate BMP2 internalization (28Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, exogenous heparin had little effect on BMP2 induction of ALP (Fig. 6). However, at higher concentrations, heparin exhibits an inhibitory effect as shown by decreased Smad1 phosphorylation and ALP induction (Fig. 7). This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that heparin can inhibit BMP2 and BMP7 binding to its receptors (29Takada T. Katagiri T. Ifuku M. Morimura N. Kobayashi M. Hasegawa K. Ogamo A. Kamijo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43229-43235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Irie A. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we show an inhibitory effect of heparin on BMP2 signaling in C2C12 cells when surface HSPGs were reduced (Fig. 5). Similar effects of heparin have also been reported in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells (31Hausser H.J. Brenner R.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 1062-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The methods used in our study to modify cell surface HSPGs were relatively nonspecific and did not allow us to determine whether the effects observed were due to the modification of all cell surface HSPGs or a consequence of specific changes within a single HSPG or a small subset of HSPGs. Recent work suggests that specific post-translational modifications of GAG side chains can lead to profound changes in the ability of HSPGs to modify morphogen gradients (20Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Economides A.N. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2089-2096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Viviano B.L. Paine-Saunders S. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5604-5611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of HSPG modifications on BMP morphogen gradients and the role that endogenous enzymes, such as heparanases and sulfatases, play in this process. In addition to insights into developmental regulation, our study has important clinical implications as well. We have demonstrated that exogenous heparin, used at pharmacologic doses similar to those used in humans for the treatment of coagulopathies, profoundly inhibits BMP signaling. These data provide an explanation for the well known clinical observations that short term use of heparin (as a thromboprophylatic agent) after bone fracture can delay fracture healing (33Street J.T. McGrath M. O'Regan K. Wakai A. McGuinness A. Redmond H.P. Clin. Orthop. 2000; 381: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that long term use of heparin can cause osteoporosis (34Monreal M. Olive A. Lafoz E. del Rio L. Lancet. 1991; 338: 706Abstract PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our findings also suggest that exogenous heparin or alteration of endogenous HSPGs could be exploited to modulate BMP-mediated heterotopic bone formation in conditions such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disabling genetic disease associated with a dysregulated BMP signaling pathway (35Shafritz A.B.

Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 2003; 85: 2332-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In summary, our results show that cell surface proteoglycans mediate BMP2 internalization and that a reduction of GAG chain sulfation and HSPGs increases BMP2 induction of osteogenic markers. Since HSPGs are spatially and temporally regulated during development (38Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), our findings imply that differentially expressed HSPGs play an important role in the formation of BMP activity gradients.

https://openalex.org/W2015476509,"The process of oocyte maturation, which impacts ovulation and fertilization, is complex and requires an integration of the endocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and autocrine signaling pathways. This process involves an intimate interaction between the oocyte and encircling cumulus cells within a follicle, a unique venue for somatic and germ cell communication. Cumulus cell expansion and resumption of meiosis with germinal vesicle breakdown are major events in oocyte maturation. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a known critical mediator of oocyte maturation, but the diverse function of this lipid mediator in oocyte maturation, ovulation, and fertilization has not been fully appreciated.

Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments in mice have revealed distinct functions of these isozymes. COX-1-deficient females are mostly fertile but show parturition defects. In contrast, Cox-2-/- females are mostly infertile because of severely impaired ovulation, fertilization, and implantation (4Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M.

Oocytes are arrested at the germinal vesicle stage before the surge of pituitary luteinizing hormone. This surge induces meiotic resumption of oocytes acting via its receptors on theca or granulosa cells, because luteinizing hormone receptors are scant in cumulus cells (14Peng X.R. Hsueh A.J. LaPolt P.S. Bjersing L. Ny T. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3200-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although luteinizing hormone signaling in theca or granulosa cells is not clearly understood, recent findings show that epidermal growth factor-like growth factors, amphiregulin, epiregulin, and betacellulin, are induced by hCG, and these growth factors promote meiotic resumption and cumulus expansion by depositing cell matrix through expression of hyaluronan synthase-2, COX-2, and tumor necrosis factor-induced protein-6 (TSG-6) (15Park J.Y.

Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Our more recent work, however, shows that Cox-2-/- oocytes have normal development compared with wild-type oocytes when matured spontaneously in vitro (10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, normal GVBD is observed in Cox-2-/- mice after superovulation (5Davis B.J. Lennard D.E.

In contrast, oocytes with signs of fragmentation are frequently observed in Cox-2-/- mice on CD1 background on day 2 of pregnancy, suggesting defective oocyte maturation, resulting in fertilization failure. In the absence of definitive roles of PGs in oocyte maturation, we initiated an in-depth investigation on the roles of PGs in oocyte maturation in vivo and in vitro using Cox-2-/- mice on the CD1 background and the signaling pathways involved in this process. Reagents—Minimum essential medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) was a gift from National Hormone and Peptide Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). PGE2, butaprost, sulprostone, 11-deoxy-prostaglandin E1 (11-deoxy-PGE1), prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), and AH6809 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). H-89, U0126, SB203580, and SP60012 were purchased from Calbiochem.

PCR of genomic DNA determined the genotypes (4Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Adult female mice on the CD1 background (2-6 months old) were used for all experiments. Generation of CD1 Cox-2-/- mice was described previously (24Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10649-10658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All mice used were housed in the Institutional Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. To induce superovulation, mice received intraperitoneal injections of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed by injections of 5 IU of hCG 48 h later as described previously (10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J.

To examine whether PGE2 can rescue normal oocyte maturation in CD1 Cox-2-/- mice, wild-type or Cox-2 mutant females received subcutaneous injections of vehicle (3% ethanol in saline) or PGE2 (40 μg/mouse) concurrent with hCG administration and followed by a second injection 4 h later (5Davis B.J. Lennard D.E. Lee C.A. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Wetsel W.C. Langenbach R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Ovulated cumulus-oocyte complexes were recovered from the oviduct 14-15 h after hCG injection. Cumulus cells were removed by a brief hyaluronidase treatment, and the meiotic status was evaluated by nuclear staining. Culture of Cumulus-Oocyte Complex—Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated by puncturing large antral follicles with a 26-gauge needle. In some cases, ovulated COCs were collected from the oviduct. For experiments with in vitro oocyte maturation, COCs were collected 46-47 h after PMSG injection. COCs with uniform compacted cumulus cells were used for in vitro culture. COCs were transferred into the medium containing 4 mm hypoxanthine (HX) to prevent spontaneous GVBD. The culture medium was bicarbonate-buffered minimum essential medium supplemented with 75 mg/liter penicillin G, 50 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate, and 3 mg/ml crystallized lyophilized bovine serum albumin (basal medium). To examine FSH-induced oocyte meiotic maturation, groups of 20-30 COCs were cultured in 100-μl droplets of basal medium containing 4 mm HX and 100 IU/liter hFSH covered with mineral oil in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. For cumulus expansion experiments, 1% fetal bovine serum instead of bovine serum albumin was added to the basal media. For assessment of oocyte meiotic status, cumulus cells were removed by hyaluronidase digestion, and denuded oocytes were fixed in 4% buffered formalin, mounted on a glass slide with glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline (1:1) solution containing 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Oocyte meiotic status was classified as follows: germinal vesicle, MI, or MII. To assess cumulus expansion, images of COCs were captured under an inverted microscope, and the projected cumulus areas of COCs were calculated using the Image J Imaging System software version 1.3 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). In some experiments, the degree of cumulus expansion was determined as 0 (no expansion) to 4 (complete expansion) (25Buccione R. Vanderhyden B.C. Caron P.J. Eppig J.J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In Vitro Fertilization—To assess whether PGE2 can restore normal fertilizing capacity of Cox-2 null oocytes, we performed in vitro fertilization experiments in both wild-type and Cox-2 mutant mice receiving vehicle or PGE2 injections (5Davis B.J. Lennard D.E. Lee C.A. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Wetsel W.C. Langenbach R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PGE2 was given subcutaneously at a dose of 40 μg/mouse concurrently with hCG injection followed by a second injection 4 h later. Ovulated COCs were collected from the oviduct after 14-16 h of hCG injection, placed into droplets of 200 μl of HTF medium, and cultured in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C until sperm insemination. Sperm were collected from the cauda epididymidis of mature wild-type mice and were preincubated for 2 h in 400 μl of HTF medium to allow capacitation. After capacitation, sperm were introduced into 200 μl droplets containing COCs. Six hours after insemination, COCs were transferred into droplets of 100 μl of HTF medium, and cumulus cells were removed by repeated pipetting. Fertilization was assessed by the appearance of two pronuclei in oocytes that were further cultured in KSOM medium for 5 days under 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The number of blastocysts developed was recorded at the end of culture. Prostaglandin Assays—Twenty COCs were cultured in 500-μl droplets of the HX media in the presence or absence of hFSH, and culture media were collected at 3, 6, and 18 h post-treatment for PG analysis by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assay (6Lim H.

Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as described (26Wang H. Matsumoto H. Guo Y. Paria B.C. Roberts R.L. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14914-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to COX-2 (1:300), TSG-6 (1:100), EP1 (1:100), EP2 (1:100), EP3 (1:100), EP4 (1:100), Akt (1:80), phospho-Akt (1:100), or cleaved caspase-3 (1:100) were used. The images were captured using the Image J Imaging System software (version 1.3) under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting—Thirty COCs or cumulus cells from 30 COCs were lysed, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for TSG-6, total Akt, phospho-Akt (1:1000), Bcl-2, or actin as described (26Wang H.

Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescent detection reagents (Pierce) and quantitated using a densitometer. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cumulus cells using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primers generated cDNAs from 5 μg of total RNA using Superscript II. DNA amplification was carried out with a Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using the following primers: Ptgerep1 (148 bp), 5′-GGGGGCTGGAACTCTAACTC-3′ and 5′-TGACCCTCAGGGGTAGGA-3′; Ptgerep2 (401 bp), 5′-AGGACTTCGATGGCAGAGGAGAC-3′ and 5′-CAGCCCCTTACACTTCTCCAATG-3′; Ptgerep3 (262 bp), 5′-TACCTGTTTCCCTGGGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGGTTCTGAGGCTGGAG-3′; Ptgerep4 (389 bp), 5′-CCTGGATTTACATCCTTCTCCG-3′ and 5′-ACTAACCTCATCCACCAACAGG-3′. The reaction conditions for PCR were as follows: Ptgerep1, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; Ptgerep2, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 65 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s; Ptgerep3, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; Ptgerep4, denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 62 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. PCRs were run for 35 cycles. Amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Apoptosis Detection—DNA fragmentation was detected by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique using Dead-End™ colorimetric or Fluorometric TUNEL Systems (Promega, Madison, WI; catalog numbers G7130 and G3250) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Each oocyte maturation experiment was conducted at least three times independently with 20-30 oocytes per treatment group. Differences between means were assessed by Student's t test or were calculated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher LSD post hoc test using StatView software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Each experiment was repeated at least three times unless stated otherwise. Values are shown as mean ± S.E. Data expressed as percentages were analyzed by using χ2 tests. Significant differences are defined as p < 0.05. Gonadotropin-induced Oocyte Maturation and Cumulus Expansion Are Compromised in Cox-2-/- Mice—Previous observations of ovulation and fertilization defects in Cox-2-/- mice on the C57BL/6J/129 background suggested that COX-2derived ovarian PGs are critical to these events (4Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, significantly improved ovulation with frequently observed fragmented eggs in CD1 Cox-2-/- females indicated that the processes of oocyte maturation and follicular rupture during ovulation have differential requirements for COX-derived PGs (24Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10649-10658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed in CD1 Cox-2-/- females that an early induction of COX-1 by gonadotropin in mural granulosa and theca cells partially offsets the loss of COX-2 for completion of follicular rupture, whereas cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte lacking COX-1 expression fail to correct the COX-2 deficiency-associated aberrant oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion (24Wang H.

Thus, an in-depth understanding of compromised oocyte maturation events in the absence of COX-2 remains elusive and instigated us to further explore the role of PGs in oocyte maturation in vivo and in vitro using Cox-2-/- mice and the potential signaling pathways involved in this process. To examine in vivo oocyte maturation status in CD1 Cox-2-/- mice, we employed a standard superovulation regimen using a combination of PMSG and hCG protocol as described previously (10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Wang H. Ma W.G. Tejada L. Zhang H. Morrow J.D. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10649-10658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All wild-type oocytes retrieved from superovulated mice 15 h after an hCG injection underwent GVBD, and a large number of them were arrested at MII stage (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, deferred resumption and progression of meiosis were observed in Cox-2-/- oocytes in response to hCG stimulation. For example, the majority of null oocytes was arrested in MI stage, followed by those that progressed to MII stages. Most strikingly, a small percentage of null oocytes still exhibited intact GV, indicating their failure to resume meiosis (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). These results confirm our initial observation of compromised oocyte maturation in the absence of COX-2. Because oocyte meiosis resumption and progression, including GVBD and MI to MII transition, are temporally regulated dynamic events, we next examined the kinetics of in vivo oocyte maturation induced by hCG. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, although all wild-type oocytes underwent GVBD (the first visible sign of meiosis resumption) at 6 h post-hCG stimulation, Cox-2-/- oocytes showed delayed resumption of meiosis, most of which exhibited GVBD at 15 h post-hCG administration. Under normal conditions, in parallel to meiotic oocyte maturation, the surrounding cumulus matrices underwent physical and physiological changes termed cumulus expansion preparing for “soon-to-occur” sperm-oocyte fertilization events. Thus, we compared the cumulus expansion status between wild-type and Cox-2-/- mice in vivo. Again, we observed deferred and compromised cumulus expansion in Cox-2-/- mice (Fig. 1B). For example, wild-type COCs showed visible signs of expansion at 3 h after hCG injection and reached full expansion at 12 h. In contrast, the expansion of Cox-2-/- COCs was first noted at 9 h post-hCG administration with a largely reduced expanded area compared with that of wild-type COCs. Collectively, the results suggest that oocyte maturation is lessened in response to ovulation stimulus in Cox-2-/- mice. This finding led us to examine whether gonadotropin-induced oocyte maturation is impaired in vitro in the absence of COX-2. We have shown previously that in vitro maturation of C57BL/6J/129 Cox-2-/- oocytes in the presence of fetal bovine serum and FSH is comparable with wild-type oocytes (10Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Under the same culture condition, we further observed that there were no differences between the wild-type and CD1 Cox-2-/- oocytes in their ability to undergo GVBD and progression to the MII (∼80%) stage (data not shown). This observation indicates that serum-derived factors compensate for the loss of COX-2 or, alternatively, COX-2-derived PGs are not always necessary for oocyte maturation in vitro. To address this issue, we next used a serum-free medium containing 4 mm HX, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents spontaneous maturation of oocytes. Interestingly, a compromised oocyte meiotic maturation and cumulus expansion evaluated by GVBD ratio and projected area of cumulus expansion, respectively, were observed when Cox-2-/- COCs were cultured under serum-free conditions and challenged with FSH (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1C). In addition, the percentage of Cox-2-/- oocytes progressing to the MII stage in response to FSH stimulation was significantly lower in comparison to wild-type mice (supplemental Fig. 1D). These results faithfully phenocopied the in vivo observation of defective oocyte maturation in Cox-2-/- females and provoked us to further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways associated with gonadotrophins and COX-2-derived PGs during oocyte maturation using this simply defined culture system. PGE2 Differentially Regulates Oocyte Maturation and Cumulus Expansion in Vitro—Previous studies have demonstrated a spatiotemporal expression of COX-2 in mural granulosa and cumulus cells in response to preovulatory gonadotropin stimulation in mice (24Wang H.

Reprod. 2003; 68: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the physiological significance of COX-2-derived PGs in oocyte maturation in vitro, we first assessed COX-2 expression by immunofluorescence in wild-type COCs in culture. As shown in Fig. 2A, COX-2 proteins are progressively induced in cumulus cells by FSH stimulation; first detectable expression was seen as early as 4 h with sustained high levels until termination of the culture at 18 h. This temporal induction of COX-2 in COCs is well correlated with PG accumulation in the culture medium. We noted that PGE2 is the major PG secreted upon induction of COX-2 by FSH in wild-type COCs with low to undetectable levels in Cox-2-/- COCs similarly cultured (Fig. 2B). These results further support the previous view that COX-2-derived PGE2, but not COX-1, is a key player in regulating oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion (8Hizaki H. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Hirose M.

Because PGE2 is the primary PG produced by cumulus cells in response to gonadotropin both in vivo and in vitro, we subsequently tested whether PGE2 could rescue defective oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion in Cox-2-/- mice. With respect to meiotic maturation, although FSH was fully functional in stimulating wild-type oocyte GVBD and progression into the MII stage, PGE2 alone was also able to induce meiotic resumption but to a lesser extent. A combined treatment with FSH and PGE2 exerted a similar effect as FSH alone (Fig. 3, A and B). This observation is consistent with our findings described above showing FSH-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion in cumulus cells. However, our observation of less efficient meiotic resumption by PGE"
https://openalex.org/W2029925836,"Chromatin remodeling enzymes such as SWI/SNF use the hydrolysis of ATP to power the movement of nucleosomes with respect to DNA. BRG1, one of the ATPases of the SWI/SNF complex, can be recruited by both activators and repressors, although the precise role of BRG1 in mechanisms of repression has thus far remained unclear. One transcription factor that recruits BRG1 as a corepressor is the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST). Here we address for the first time the mechanism of BRG1 activity in gene repression. We found that BRG1 enhanced REST-mediated repression at some REST target genes by increasing the interaction of REST with the local chromatin at its binding sites. Furthermore, REST-chromatin interactions, mediated by BRG1, were enhanced following an increase in histone acetylation in a manner dependent on the BRG1 bromodomain. Our data suggest that BRG1 facilitates REST repression by increasing the interaction between REST and chromatin. Such a mechanism may be applicable to other transcriptional repressors that utilize BRG1."
https://openalex.org/W1974066245,"Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme that mediates agonist-dependent arachidonic acid release in most cell types. Arachidonic acid can then be metabolized by the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme to generate the proinflammatory signal leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Here we report that Ca2+ entry through store-operated CRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+) channels activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, within minutes and this is necessary for stimulation of cPLA2. Ca2+ entry activates ERK indirectly, via recruitment of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C alpha and betaI. Ca2+ influx also promotes translocation of cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase to the nuclear membrane, a key step in the activation of this enzyme. Translocation is dependent on ERK activation. A role for gene activation is shown by the finding that CRAC channel opening results in increased transcription and translation of c-fos. Inhibition of ERK activation failed to prevent c-fos expression. Our results show that CRAC channel activation elicits short-term effects through the co-coordinated regulation of two metabolic pathways (cPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase), which results in the generation of both intra- and intercellular messengers within minutes, as well as longer term changes involving gene activation. These short-term effects are mediated via ERK, whereas, paradoxically, c-fos expression is not. Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels can therefore activate different signaling pathways at the same time, culminating in a range of temporally diverse responses."

A key target is the gene ENA1, encoding a Na+-ATPase, whose induction by alkaline pH has been shown to involve calcineurin and the Rim101/Nrg1 pathway. Previous functional analysis of the ENA1 promoter revealed a calcineurin-independent pH responsive region (ARR2, 83 nucleotides). We restrict here this response to a small (42 nucleotides) ARR2 5·-region, named MCIR (minimum calcineurin independent response), which contains a MIG element, able to bind Mig1,2 repressors. High pH-induced response driven from this region was largely abolished in snf1 cells and moderately reduced in a rim101 strain. Cells lacking Mig1 or Mig2 repressors had a near wild type response, but the double mutant presented a high level of expression upon alkaline stress. Deletion of NRG1 (but not of NRG2) resulted in increased expression. Induction from the MCIR region was marginal in a quadruple mutant lacking Nrg1,2 and Mig1,2 repressors. In vitro band shift experiments demonstrated binding of Nrg1 to the 5· end of the ARR2 region. Furthermore, we show that Nrg1 binds in vivo around the MCIR region under standard growth conditions, and that binding is largely abolished after high pH stress. Therefore, the calcineurin-independent response of the ENA1 gene is under the regulation of Rim101 (through Nrg1) and Snf1 (through Nrg1 and Mig2). Accordingly, induction by alkaline stress of the entire ENA1 promoter in a snf1 rim101 mutant in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 is completely abolished. Thus, the transcriptional response to alkaline stress of the ENA1 gene integrates three different signaling pathways.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grows better at acidic pH and for this microorganism, sudden alkalinization of the medium represents a stress situation because it interferes with the proton gradient essential for uptake of many solutes from the medium, such as nutrients or diverse cations (1van der Kamminga A.H.

Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Consequently, null mutants in many components of the vacuolar ATPase complex or strains lacking a functional ENA1 gene are unable to proliferate even under mild alkaline conditions (6Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).The Ena1 P-type ATPase also represents a major element in the detoxification of sodium and lithium cations and ena1 mutants are largely defective in cation efflux and extremely sensitive to these toxic ions. ENA1 is the first member of a cluster composed by four to five genes encoding very similar proteins (ENA1–ENA5) (4Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and, although early work suggested post-transcriptional regulation of the ATPase (5Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), compelling evidence indicates that regulation of the Na+-ATPase function in the cell is mainly based on the control of the expression of the gene. ENA1 is hardly expressed under standard growth conditions, but its expression is rapidly induced after exposure to saline, osmotic or alkaline stress. The complex regulation of ENA1 expression after saline stress (8Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) has been characterized in some detail in the past. The presence of glucose in the medium represses ENA1 expression by a mechanism that involves the Snf1 kinase and the repressor complex Mig1-Ssn6-Tup1, which targets to a MIG element located at position –534/–544 in the ENA1 promoter (9Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to the release from Mig1-mediated repression, induction of ENA1 by high salt involves at least three different pathways. Activation of the HOG pathway in response to high osmolarity results in phosphorylation and activation of the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which migrates to the nucleus and phosphorylates the Sko1 repressor (9Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Sko1 prevents its binding to the cAMP response element present in the promoter at position –502/–509. Activation of the ENA1 promoter by high salt is also greatly influenced by the calcineurin pathway (5Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hirata D. Harada S. Namba H. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activation of calcineurin increases ENA1 transcription through dephosphorylation and activation of the Crz1/Tcn1/Hal8 transcription factor (15Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 17Mendizabal I. Rios G. Mulet J.M. Serrano R. de Larrinoa I.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which binds to specific DNA sequences (calcineurin-dependent response elements). In the case of the ENA1 promoter, two such elements are present at positions –813/–821 and –719/–727, the downstream element being more important for the transcriptional response under saline stress (18Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. de Larrinoa I.F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, a role of the TOR pathway in the regulation of ENA1 expression has been documented. In this case, saline stress would inhibit the TOR pathway, so the Gln3 and Gat1 transcription factors would no longer be retained in the cytoplasm and, upon entry into the nucleus, would activate ENA1 by (presumably) binding to the diverse GATA sequences present in the ATPase gene promoter (19Crespo J.L. Daicho K. Ushimaru T. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34441-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In contrast to the fairly well defined response of ENA1 to high salt, the mechanisms underlying its activation by alkaline stress are not fully understood. Current evidence suggests that high pH stress triggers a burst of cytoplasmic calcium that results in activation of calcineurin and subsequent Crz1-dependent induction of ENA1 expression (20Viladevall L. Serrano R. Ruiz A. Domenech G. Giraldo J. Barcelo A. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43614-43624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Functional mapping of the promoter revealed that the calcineurin-dependent pH-responsive region could be restricted to a region, named ARR1, which contains the calcineurin-dependent response element at –719/–727, whereas a second pH-responsive but calcium-independent region (ARR2) was located downstream ARR1, spanning from position –490 to –573 (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Induction of ENA1 by high pH is also influenced by the Rim101 pathway. Rim101, a transcription factor initially identified as a positive regulator of gene expression in meiosis and sporulation (22Su S.S.Y. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1993; 133: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans PacC pH response regulator (23Penalva M.A. Arst Jr., H.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 426-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae rim101 mutants display sensitivity to high pH and decreased expression of several genes induced by high pH (24Lamb T.M. Xu W. Diamond A. Mitchell A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1850-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to what is known in A. nidulans, there is evidence that Rim101 acts in vivo as a repressor that targets to, at least, two previously known transcriptional repressors: Smp1 and Nrg1 (25Lamb T.M. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that activation of Rim101 would block the expression of Nrg1, thus releasing the ENA1 promoter from the negative control exerted by the repressor. Consistent with this model, alkaline induction of ENA1 is impaired in a rim101 mutant (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Lamb T.M. Xu W. Diamond A. Mitchell A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1850-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 25Lamb T.M. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and this effect is suppressed by deletion of Nrg1 (25Lamb T.M. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).The ENA1 promoter contains two sequences that were recognized as consensus binding sites for Nrg1 (CCCTC and CCCCT), at positions –725/–729 and –647/–651, respectively (25Lamb T.M. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The former is located in ARR1 and, in fact, overlaps with the downstream calcineurin-dependent response element sequence found in this region. The latter is located between ARR1 and ARR2, and is probably not functional because this segment of the promoter is not responsive to high pH (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas functional mapping of the ENA1 promoter revealed that the alkaline response from both ARR1 and ARR2 regions was clearly reduced by mutation of RIM101, no evident Nrg1 site was identified in ARR2 (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that blocking the calcineurin-mediated response in a rim101 mutant does not fully abolish the transcriptional response of ENA1 to alkaline stress and that the ARR2 region of this promoter must contain regulatory elements other than those controlled by Rim101 (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All these evidence definitely indicates that still unknown, Rim101- and calcineurin-independent regulatory components of the ENA1 response to high pH stress must exist. In this work we characterize a third regulatory pathway relevant in this response and provide a working model that integrates our current knowledge in this field.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used throughout this work are derived from the DBY746 haploid wild type strain and are listed in Table 1. Yeast cultures were grown at 28 °C in YPD medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, 20 g/liter dextrose) or complete minimal medium. When indicated, synthetic complete medium lacking appropriate supplements was used to maintain selections for plasmids (26Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing, when needed, 50 μg/ml ampicillin for plasmid selection. E. coli cells were transformed by standard treatment with calcium chloride (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were transformed by a modification of the lithium acetate method (28Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction mapping, DNA ligations, and other recombinant DNA techniques were carried out by standard methods (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Purification of DNA fragments from complex mixtures, including PCRs and restriction nuclease digests was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The appropriate bands were recovered from agarose gel slices using the Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Roche).Deletion Cassettes and Gene Disruptions—The mig2::TRP1 cassette was constructed as follows. A 1.76-kbp 6The abbreviations used are: kbp, kilo base pair(s); TAPS, N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid; MCIR, minimum calcineurin independent response; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. region of the MIG2 genomic locus, spanning from nucleotides –809 to +1149 from the start codon, was amplified by PCR using primers mig2_5′_SalI and mig2_3′_PstI, which contain artificial SalI and PstI restriction sites (the sequence of oligonucleotides used in this work can be found in supplemental Table 1). The amplification fragment was cloned into the SalI/PstI sites of plasmid pBluescript-SK, to give pBS-MIG2. A 387-bp SnaBI/NheI fragment of the open reading frame was replaced by a 1.0-kbp TRP1 marker recovered from plasmid YDp-W by digestion with SmaI/NheI, yielding plasmid pBS-MIG2::TRP1. This plasmid was digested with StuI/AfeI and the 2.0-kbp fragment obtained was used to transform the yeast cells. The nrg1::kanMX4 disruption cassette was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-nrg1_disr and 3′-nrg1_disr from genomic DNA obtained from a nrg1::kanMX4 mutant in the BY4741 background, in which the entire NRG1 open reading frame was replaced by the heterologous marker (29Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). A similar strategy, using the appropriate deletion mutants, was used to generate the nrg2::kanMX4 (oligonucleotides 5′-nrg2_disr and 3′-nrg2_disr) and mig1::kanMX4 (5′-mig1 _disr and 3′-mig1_disr). Disruption of NRG1 with the nat1 marker was accomplished as follows. A 2.1-kbp DNA fragment encompassing the NRG1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-nrg1_comp and 3′-nrg1_disr. The fragment was digested with XbaI and PmlI, yielding a 1.7-kbp fragment that was cloned into the XbaI and HincII sites of pBluescript-SK to generate pBS-NRG1. This construct was digested with EcoRI and HincII and the 0.8-kbp fragment replaced by the 1.27-kbp nat1 gene fragment recovered from plasmid pAG25 (30Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and PvuII. The resulting construct, pBS-NRG1::nat1, was then digested with XbaI and XhoI and the 2.15-kbp fragment was released used to transform yeast cells. Disruption of the NRG2 gene by the marker TRP1 was generated as follows. A 2.0-kbp region of the NRG2 locus was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, prepared from the DBY746 wild type strain, using oligonucleotides 5′-nrg2_disr, which contains an artificial restriction EcoRI site, and 3′-nrg2_disr, which contains an artificial PstI site. This fragment was cloned into the same sites of plasmid pBluescript-SK to give plasmid pBS-NRG2, which was digested with NheI/HincII to remove a 652-bp internal region. This region was replaced by a 1.0-kbp TRP1 marker recovered from plasmid YDp-W by digestion with SmaI/NheI, to yield plasmid pBS-NRG2::TRP1. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI/SmaI and the 2.2-kbp fragment obtained was used to transform the appropriate yeast strain.Strain MP005 (rim101 snf1) was generated by transformation of strain RSC21 (rim101) with the snf1::LEU2 cassette recovered from plasmid pCC107::LEU2 (31Rodriguez C. Sanz P. Gancedo C. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) after digesting with restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII. Strains MP012 (mig1 mig2) and MP015 (snf1 mig2) were made by introducing the mig2::TRP1 cassette into strains RSC13 (mig1) and RSC10 (snf1), respectively. Strains MP009 (mig1 nrg1) and MP011 (mig2 nrg1) were constructed by transformation of strains RSC13 (mig1) and MP010 (mig2) with the nrg1::kanMX4 cassette. Strains MP013 (mig1 mig2 nrg1) and MP020 (snf1 nrg1) were generated by introducing the cassette nrg1::kanMX4 into strains MP012 and RSC10, respectively. Strains MP014 (snf1 mig1) and MP016 (snf1 mig2 mig1) were generated by transformation of strains RSC10 and MP015, respectively, with the cassette mig1::kanMX4. Strain MP019 (nrg1 nrg2) was constructed by transforming strain MP008 (nrg1) with the nrg2::TRP1 disruption cassette. Strains MP021 (snf1 nrg2) and MAR194 (mig1 mig2 nrg2) were obtained by transformation of strains RSC10 and MP012 with the nrg2::kanMX4 disruption cassette. Strain MP022 (nrg1 nrg2 snf1) was generated by introducing the snf1::LEU2 cassette into MP019 strain. Strain MAR195 (nrg2 rim101) was obtained by transformation of strain MP018 (nrg2::TRP1) with the rim101::kanMX4 disruption cassette (21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Strains MAR198 (mig1 mig2 nrg1), MAR199 (mig1 mig2 nrg2 nrg1), MAR200 (nrg2 rim101 nrg1), and MAR206 (rim101 nrg1) were constructed by introducing the cassette nrg1::nat1 in strains MP012, MAR194, MAR195, and RSC21, respectively.Construction of β-Galactosidase Reporters—The following reporter plasmids, containing diverse regions of the ENA1 promoter, were used. Construction of pMRK213 and pKC201 was described in Refs. 21Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 10Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, respectively. Plasmids pMRK505, pMRK525, and pMRK564 were constructed as follows: the corresponding ENA1 promoter region was amplified by standard PCR using the appropriate primers (see supplemental data) and plasmid pKC201, which contains the entire promoter, as a template. The PCR products were digested by restriction enzymes XhoI and SalI and cloned into the XhoI restriction site of pSLFΔ-178K. This plasmid is a CYC1 promoter-lacZ fusion from which the CYC1 UAS elements have been deleted (32Idrissi F.Z. Fernandez-Larrea J.B. Pina B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All inserts were verified by sequencing using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).β-Galactosidase Activity Assays—Yeast cells were grown to saturation in the appropriate drop-out media overnight and then inoculated in YPD at A660 0.2. Growth was resumed until A660 of 0.5 to 0.7 and cultures were then distributed into 1.0-ml aliquots and centrifuged for 5 min at 1620 × g. The supernatant was discarded and cultures were resuspended in the appropriate media. Unless otherwise stated, alkaline stress was provoked by resuspending cells in YPD containing 50 mm TAPS adjusted to pH 8.5 by addition of potassium hydroxide (autoclaving decreases the pH of the medium up to pH 8.0 approximately). Non-induced cells were resuspended in YPD medium adjusted to pH 6.3 after autoclaving. Cell were grown for 60 min and β-galactosidase activity assayed as described (33Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E.. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.6.1-13.6.6Google Scholar). Saline stress was induced by addition of 0.4 m NaCl. Growth was resumed and cells were collected after 60 min.Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Saturated cultures of the appropriate strains were diluted to A660 of 0.2 in YPD and grown up to A660 of 0.5–0.7. Then, two 10-ml aliquots of each culture were centrifuged during 5 min at 1620 × g at room temperature and pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of fresh YPD containing 50 mm TAPS buffered at pH 8.0 (alkaline induction) or YPD (no induction), respectively. After 10 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 2 min at 1620 × g at 4 °C, washed once with cold water, and centrifuged again to obtain cell pellets that were immediately frozen and stored at –80 °C until RNA purification. When inhibition of calcineurin was desired, FK506 (final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml) was added to the medium 1 h prior initiation of the alkaline treatment. The drug was also present in final resuspension media during stress.Total RNA was purified using the RiboPure-Yeast kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed by denaturing 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and RNA quantification was performed by measuring A260 in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). Real time PCR was performed in a SmartCycler (Cepheid) apparatus, using the QuantiTect SYBR Green reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Qiagen) and 10 ng of total RNA. For ENA1 amplification, oligonucleotides ENA1fw and ENA1rev were used. Control experiments were carried out by amplifying a fragment of the PHO84 gene using oligonucleotides PHO84fw and PHO84rev. In this case, due to the slower induction of this gene after alkaline stress, cell samples were taken after 30 min of induction. Reverse transcription was performed for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by incubation at 95 °C for 15 min. Finally, 45 PCR cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C) were carried out.Expression in E. coli of S. cerevisiae Nrg1—For expression in E. coli, the NRG1 open reading frame (approximately 0.7 kbp) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-Nrg1 and 3′-Nrg1. The amplification fragment was cleaved with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the BamHI-XhoI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to yield plasmid pGEX-4T1-Nrg1. E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were transformed with plasmid pGEX-4T1-Nrg1 and grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was then diluted 1/10 in the same medium and cultures were grown to an A660 of 0.6–0.8. At this point isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mm and cells were induced for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were centrifuged at 1620 × g at 4 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 ml/liter of culture) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, plus a protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were harvested by sonication (3 × 15 s), centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant collected. The GST-Nrg1 fusion protein was purified by incubating the bacterial crude lysate with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), allowing gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-Nrg1 was eluted with a 10 mm glutathione solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol).Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—Probes were labeled with 32P by PCR using [α-32P]dCTP and the appropriate primers, and purified using S-200 HR microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Various amounts of GST-Nrg1 were incubated with 10 ng of α-32P-labeled probe (∼10,000 cpm) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 6 μg of bovine serine albumin, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Probe 578, which was added as a nonspecific competitor where indicated, was obtained by amplification from genomic DNA of the –578/–640 region of the ENA1 promoter, using primers ena1_pr_5′_640 and ena1_pr_3′_578. The reaction samples were loaded onto 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 150 V for 3 h in a 22.5 mm Tris base, 22.5 mm boric acid, and 0.63 mm disodium EDTA buffer, adjusted to pH 8.0.

https://openalex.org/W2018323091,"Nidogens are two ubiquitous basement membrane proteins produced mainly by mesenchymal cells. Nidogen-mediated interactions, in particular with laminin, collagen IV, and perlecan have been considered important in the formation and maintenance of the basement membrane. However, whereas mice lacking both nidogen isoforms or carrying mutations in the high affinity nidogen-binding site upon the laminin γ1 chain have specific basement membrane defects in certain organs, particularly in the lung, characterization of these mice has also shown that basement membrane formation per se does not need nidogens or the laminin-nidogen interaction. Limb development requires the complex interplay of numerous growth factors whose expression is dependent upon the apical ectodermal ridge. Here, we show that lack of nidogen-1 and -2 results in a specific and time-limited failure in the ectodermal basement membrane of the limb bud. The absence of this basement membrane leads to aberrant apical ectodermal ridge formation. It also causes altered distribution of growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors and leads to a fully penetrant soft tissue syndactyly caused by the dysregulation of interdigital apoptosis. Further, in certain animals more severe changes in bone formation occur, providing evidence for the interplay between growth factors and the extracellular matrix.

Further, in certain animals more severe changes in bone formation occur, providing evidence for the interplay between growth factors and the extracellular matrix. Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices found underlying all epithelia and endothelia as well as ensheathing several forms of mesenchymal cell. They have diverse structural functions in strengthening and delimiting tissues as well as in serving as selective barriers (1Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Further, they play major roles in cellular differentiation, migration, proliferation, and survival by inducing signaling effects through interactions with transmembrane receptors for specific basement membrane components and by acting as reservoirs for cytokines and growth factors. All basement membranes contain members of the laminin, nidogen, proteoglycan, and collagen IV families, and basement membrane diversity is in part derived from the large numbers of differentially expressed isoforms of laminin and collagen IV (2Miner J.H. Yurchenco P.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 255-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Both laminins and collagen IV molecules can self-assemble into extensive networks in vitro; however in vivo, although structural stability is in part dependent upon collagen IV (3Pöschl E. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Brachvogel B. Saito K. Ninomiya Y. Mayer U. Development. 2004; 131: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), the initial development of a basement membrane requires the presence of laminin (4Miner J.H. Li C. Mudd J.L. Go G. Sutherland A.E. Development. 2004; 131: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To date, and with the notable exception of zebrafish, the nidogen family has been shown to contain two members in all vertebrates where comprehensive sequence data exist. Whereas both isoforms are present in all basement membranes, nidogen-2 shows a more regulated expression pattern throughout development (6Salmivirta K. Talts J.F. Olsson M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both nidogen isoforms have been shown to interact in vitro with many other components of the basement membrane, in particular with laminin and collagen IV, and it has been proposed that nidogens act as integrating elements for basement membrane assembly (7Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The binding between the laminin γ1 short arm and nidogen-1 has been especially well studied both in vitro and in vivo. This very high affinity interaction occurs at the γ1LEb3 laminin-like epidermal growth factor module (8Mayer U. Nischt R. Poschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Incubation with antibodies directed against this module or with competing recombinant proteins results in defects in basement membrane formation (9Tunggal J. Wartenberg M. Paulsson M. Smyth N. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and a failure in epithelial branching morphogenesis in a number of tissue and organ culture systems (10Ekblom P. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Klein G. Zhang H.Y. Kadoya Y. Chu M.L. Mayer U. Timpl R. Development. 1994; 120: 2003-2014PubMed Google Scholar). However, results from mice where this binding domain was deleted by gene targeting showed that nidogen-laminin binding, although important for the formation of certain basement membranes, is not a general prerequisite for basement membrane assembly (11Willem M. Miosge N. Halfter W. Smyth N. Jannetti I. Burghart E. Timpl R. Mayer U. Development. 2002; 129: 2711-2722PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of either of the nidogen genes in the mouse results in only mild changes with no alteration in tissue or basement membrane architecture (12Dong L. Chen Y. Lewis M. Hsieh J.C. Reing J. Chaillet J.R. Howell C.Y. Melhem M. Inoue S. Kuszak J.R. DeGeest K. Chung A.E. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1617-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Murshed M. Smyth N. Miosge N.

Skarnes W.C. Timpl R. Bader B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further, the finding of a redistribution and up-regulation of nidogen-2 in nidogen-1-deficient animals suggested a partial redundancy within the family (13Murshed M. Smyth N. Miosge N. Karolat J. Krieg T. Paulsson M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7007-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Studies of mice lacking both nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 showed that this is indeed the case for the abnormalities occurring in the lung and heart, which are directly related to defects in basement membrane assembly (15Bader B.L. Smyth N. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Baranowsky A. Mokkapati S. Murshed M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6846-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Curiously, although changes in the lung are common between the nidogen double null animals and those lacking the binding site, the latter mice do not display cardiac changes (11Willem M. Miosge N. Halfter W. Smyth N. Jannetti I. Burghart E. Timpl R. Mayer U. Development. 2002; 129: 2711-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bader B.L. Smyth N. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Baranowsky A. Mokkapati S. Murshed M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6846-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Further, whereas nidogen double null mice generally develop kidneys, there is a highly penetrant renal aplasia in mice lacking the nidogen-binding site upon the laminin γ1 chain. The finding that nidogen double null mice can in many tissues form basement membranes that appear normal by electron microscopy shows that nidogens are not essential in producing a basement membrane and that different basement membranes have different requirements for nidogens (15Bader B.L. Smyth N. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Baranowsky A. Mokkapati S. Murshed M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6846-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Limb formation is directed by a complex interplay of epithelial and mesenchymal factors. Original theories suggested that the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), 2The abbreviations used are: AER, apical ectodermal ridge; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; En, embryonic day n; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. 2The abbreviations used are: AER, apical ectodermal ridge; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; En, embryonic day n; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. a thickening of the epithelium over the distal edge of the limb bud, is maintained by sonic hedgehog expressed by mesenchyme as part of a positive feedback loop. The secretion of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) including FGF-4 and -8 from the AER (16Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1571-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) direct proliferation of the underlying mesenchymal cells of the progress zone, resulting in elongation of the limb. As the limb grows, the concentration of FGFs around these cells decreases, and they leave the progress zone, stop proliferating, and differentiate into chondrocytes. FGF signaling pathways are in numerous ways strongly affected by the surrounding matrix. Not only are the growth factors retained in the extracellular matrix and so concentrated in specific regions, but they are also protected from proteolytic degradation (17Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Further FGF receptor dimerization, which is required for its signaling, is dependent upon heparan sulfate side chains on either matrix or cell surface proteoglycans (18Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). Finally, many of the growth factor signaling pathways are shared with integrin pathways, causing extracellular matrix-modulated signaling to in part regulate growth factor responses (19Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Development of digits is directed by the activity of members of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family, primarily BMP-2, -4, and -7. These factors, expressed in the undifferentiated limb bud mesoderm, AER, and the interdigital mesenchyme, induce, among other events, apoptosis of the interdigital webs resulting in digit separation and cartilage development in prechondrogenic blastemas leading to phalanx formation (20Dahn R.D. Fallon J.F. Science. 2000; 289: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Here we show that nidogen deficiency results in disturbances in basement membrane assembly at specific time points in limb development and study the role of these extracellular matrix structures in growth factor action. Mice and Breeding—The mutant Nid1 allele was generated by deleting exon 3 as described previously (13Murshed M. Smyth N. Miosge N. Karolat J. Krieg T. Paulsson M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7007-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The mutation in the Nid2 gene was introduced by insertion of a gene trap vector in intron 4 (14Schymeinsky J. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Poschl E. Rao C. Beier D.R. Skarnes W.C. Timpl R. Bader B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Embryos lacking both nidogen isoforms were produced by breeding mice heterozygous for the nidogen-1 and homozygous for the nidogen-2 mutation. For timing of gestation, noon of the day of the vaginal plugging was considered to be E0.5. Where more precise staging was required, somites posterior to the forelimb bud were counted, with the first somite being considered somite 13. Although the Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mutant animals were generally smaller than their littermates, only mice with similar somite numbers were compared in this study. Genotyping for the mutant Nid1 and Nid2 alleles was carried out by PCR or Southern blot hybridization from yolk sac and embryonic tissues. Because mice carrying one wild type allele of Nid1, irrespective of the Nid2 status, show no obvious postnatal phenotype, fetuses used as controls were littermates of a Nid1+/+ Nid2-/- or a Nid1+/- Nid2-/- genotype. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence Staining of Tissues—Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against the following proteins were used: perlecan, laminin-111 (5Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), agrin (a kind gift from Dr. Markus Ruegg, Basel), collagen XVIII (kindly given by Dr Takako Sasaki, Munich), and E-cadherin. A primary goat serum against collagen IV (Southern Biotech) and the following monoclonal antibodies were also used: rat antibodies against laminin γ1 and β1 integrin (both from Chemicon) and a mouse antibody against FGF-8 (R & D Systems). The secondary antibodies used for detection of the primary immunoglobulins were either a goat anti-rabbit or a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin coupled to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or alternatively a donkey anti-rat or a donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin coupled to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Mouse embryos were dissected from the uterus, fixed for 1 h in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and then embedded in paraffin wax. 6-μm sections were subjected to trypsin digestion or citric acid-based antigen retrieval and blocked with 5% BSA/TBS. Incubations with primary antibodies were carried out overnight in 0.8% BSA/TBS at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.8% BSA and 3% normal goat serum in TBS. After three washes in TBS, the sections were mounted in Non-Fade-Mountant (DakoCytomation). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiophot 165 microscope or with a Leica TCS confocal laser microscope. Apoptosis Assays—Staining of apoptotic cells was performed with the DeadEnd™ fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were counterstained with bisbenzimide (Serva). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—DNA fragments used to produce antisense mRNA probes for Bmp2 and 7 were gifts from Brigid Hogan (Duke University Medical Center) and for Fgf8 from Gail Martin (University of California). Whole mount in situ hybridization with a digoxygenin-labeled probe was performed by standard protocols. Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy—Mouse embryos were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and, after processing through ethanol, embedded in Epon. 2-μm semi-thin sections were cut with a glass knife and stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy. Ultra thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and stained with lead citrate plus uranyl acetate prior to viewing with an EM 902A Zeiss electron microscope. For scanning electron microscopy, embryos or isolated limbs were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde. Following washing in the same buffer, they were dehydrated by passing through an ethanol gradient to 100% ethanol and then critical point-dried and mounted upon an aluminum stub. Specimens were viewed uncoated with a FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope set to the variable pressure mode. Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red Staining—To stain cartilage and bone in newborn embryos, Alcian blue 8GX and Alizarin red (Sigma) were used. Bead Implantation—Affi-gel blue agarose beads with a 100-200 mesh (Bio-Rad) were soaked in 100 μg/ml recombinant human BMP-4 (R & D Systems) or BSA and implanted into the interdigital tissue of E13.5 forelimbs. The limbs were placed on polycarbonate membranes with a pore size of 0.1 μm (Nuclepore) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the limbs were processed for histology and immunofluorescence. Cutaneous Syndactyly Occurs in All Nid1-/- Nid2-/- Mice—Mice lacking both nidogen forms die shortly after birth, they are usually smaller than their littermates and show defects in lung and heart development (15Bader B.L. Smyth N. Nedbal S. Miosge N. Baranowsky A. Mokkapati S. Murshed M. Nischt R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 6846-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Further, all Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mice have developmental defects of both fore- and hindlimbs (Fig. 1). Although the severity of this phenotype varies (see below), there was in all cases a cutaneous syndactyly with webbing of the interdigital skin. Generally, however, the fifth digit developed normally. Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining, performed to check whether skeletal involvement also occurred, showed that in most mice all of the skeletal elements were present (Fig. 1, E-H), and the bones of the digits had formed separately, a finding also seen in histological sections (Fig. 1C). However, in some animals there was fusion of the developing distal phalanges. This appeared to be the result of a defect in separation later in development rather than a failure in the formation of the cartilage anlage, because the outline of each was readily seen even when joined (Fig. 1, C, F, and G). The Nid1-/- Nid2-/- animals often showed reduced osteoid development in the middle phalanx of both fore- and hindlimbs, a finding suggestive of delayed development (Fig. 1, F and G). Apoptosis Is Inhibited in the Interdigital Web of Nid1-/- Nid2-/- Animals—Digit formation and separation in amniotes occurs by two events: differential growth at the front of the developing digit and apoptosis of the intervening tissue (21Salas-Vidal E. Valencia C. Covarrubias L. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis occurs in the webs in the absence of both nidogens, TUNEL assays were performed upon the autopods at E13.5. In wild type animals a strong signal indicative of cell death was seen in the interdigital regions (Fig. 2, A and C). This signal was either absent or very reduced in the mutant limbs (Fig. 2, B and D). BMPs have been implicated as the main signaling molecules inducing apoptosis in digit development (22Guha U. Gomes W.A. Kobayashi T. Pestell R.G. Kessler J.A. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is thought to occur through the regulation of pro-apoptotic signaling molecules, such as Msx family members. Three BMPs, BMP-2, -4, and -7, have been shown to be expressed during limb development and to be involved in apoptosis, digit identity, and chondrogenesis (20Dahn R.D. Fallon J.F. Science. 2000; 289: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). BMP activity, like that of many TGF-β family members, is highly regulated, in large part by extracellular matrix interactions. Mutations in extracellular matrix molecules such as fibrillin-2 have been shown to curtail BMP activity and result in limb defects both in mouse (24Arteaga-Solis E. Gayraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Chaudhry S.S. Gazzard J. Baldock C. Dixon J. Rock M.J. Skinner G.C. Steel K.P. Kielty C.M. Dixon M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and man (26Putnam E.A. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Milewicz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar effect could be occurring in the absence of both nidogen isoforms, we examined Bmp expression in the developing limbs. In situ hybridization showed reduced expression of Bmp2 at E13.5 (Fig. 2, E and F), whereas Bmp7, whose signal was also decreased, had an expression domain, which did not extend so far distally in the interdigital region (Fig. 2, G and H). These results suggested either that the levels of BMP expression are not sufficient to induce cell death in the interdigital region or that BMP activity or presentation was altered by the lack of the nidogens. BMP signaling acts through a shared pathway for all isoforms. To check whether this could still occur in the Nid1-/- Nid2-/- embryos, carrier beads soaked in either BMP-4 or BSA were implanted into the presumptive interdigital regions of control and mutant limb buds (Fig. 3). The limbs were cultured for 20 h and then analyzed for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Here unlike in the nonmanipulated limb buds, there was diffuse apoptosis observed in the autopods of control as well as mutant mice, presumably caused by the culture conditions. However, there was no increase in apoptosis at the site of the bead coated in BSA in either mutant or control animals (Fig. 3, B, C, and F). In contrast, in Nid1-/- Nid2-/- limbs the interdigital region where the BMP-4 bead had been implanted showed a robust signal when it was placed between digits 2 and 3 (Fig. 3, B, C, and D), which were usually fused. A similar increase was observed about BMP-4 beads implanted into control autopods (Fig. 3E), suggesting a graded response to BMPs and that the reduced levels of the signaling proteins were responsible for the failure in septation in the nidogen null animals.FIGURE 3BMP induced apoptosis in Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mutant interdigital tissues.

To determine whether this structure is present over the limb at birth, immunostaining of the fused digits was carried out. This showed the expected linear staining patterns for perlecan and laminin, similar to that observed in the normal appearing Nid1+/- Nid2-/- littermates (not shown). We then analyzed basement membranes during limb bud development. At E10.5 Nid1-/- Nid2-/- embryos, although smaller than their littermates, showed no obvious abnormalities. However, whereas sections of the limb confirmed the presence of the AER, this structure appeared in some sections, particularly those through the median planes, to be less compacted, larger, and less organized than in controls (Fig. 4, B and E), whereas in other sections the AER appeared less well defined (Fig. 4, C and F). Immunostaining of these limb buds for basement membrane proteins revealed a linear basement membrane under the surface epithelium in the control mice, with a typical continuous staining being seen under the AER and in the developing blood vessels of the limb bud (Fig. 4, A and D). Further, the staining for the matrix molecules laminin-111 and collagen IV was restricted to these structures. In contrast, sections of limbs from Nid1-/- Nid2-/- animals showed very little or no discernable basement membrane staining under the AER. Instead, rather irregular and presumably disorganized deposits of matrix were seen. Laminin immunoreactivity was more widespread throughout the epithelium and AER (Fig. 4, B and C), its main site of production, whereas collagen IV was more generally distributed through the whole limb bud (Fig. 4, E and F). Further, in contrast to the control animals, there was no evidence for basement membrane deposition around developing blood vessels in the limb bud mesenchyme. However, distinct basement membrane staining was found elsewhere in the embryo (Fig. 4, J and K). There are three main basement membrane-associated proteoglycans: perlecan, collagen XVIII, and agrin. Perlecan and collagen XVIII were found in the AER basement membrane of control limb buds at E10.5 (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas agrin occurred both in the basement membrane and on the epithelial cell membrane (Fig. 5C). These failed to be concentrated to the basement membrane zone under the AER in Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mutant mice (Fig. 5, D-F). Perlecan was in particular widely distributed through the limb bud, and none of the proteoglycans were seen in the developing blood vessel basement membranes. Semi-thin sections of control limbs at E10.5 showed a clear border between the AER and underlying mesenchyme (Fig. 6A). In the Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mutant, however, the AER was less distinctly defined, and the cells directly overlying the mesenchyme did not have the differentiated columnar phenotype seen in the control (Fig. 6, B and C). In agreement with the immunohistological findings, transmission electron microscopy of the developing limb bud at E10.5 showed that the basement membrane was present as a typical intact double layer under the epithelium of control animals (Fig. 6D). However, in Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mice it was absent, although diffuse regions of matrix deposition were seen, suggesting an improper organization (Fig. 6, E and F). Cell attachment and signaling from the basement membrane is to a large part induced through the interaction of laminins with integrins of the β1 family. To determine whether these integrins had an altered expression pattern in the absence of nidogen, we immunostained the limbs with antibodies against β1 integrin. In the control animals a strong signal was seen, which was highly concentrated at the epithelial plasma membrane, colocalizing with laminin at the contact with the basement membrane (Fig. 4G). Integrin β1 was also highly expressed on endothelial cells. In Nid1-/- Nid2-/- animals the integrin β1 signal was much reduced in the AER and was largely absent from the epithelial mesenchymal border (Fig. 4, H and I). Staining for β4 integrin, which as α6β4 forms another important laminin receptor, showed similar results (not shown). Interestingly, although laminin, a main ligand in basement membranes for β1 integrins, appeared to be absent from forming endothelial structures (Fig. 4, B and C), integrin staining in these regions was reminiscent of that in control mice (Fig. 4, H and I). The histological analysis had suggested that the AER was aberrantly differentiated in Nid1-/- Nid2-/- limb buds, and in some sections it appeared enlarged. Scanning electron microscopy of control limbs showed an evident ridge structure over the flattened limb bud (Fig. 6G). In mice lacking both nidogens, the AER was barely evident over much of the limb (Fig. 6, H and J), with the exception of the most distal portion, which had an enlarged extrusion with the hypercellular distal AER, giving some of the limbs an almost conical appearance (Fig. 6K). Further, the limb bud did not have the usual flattened shape seen in the controls but was thickened. To determine whether this aberrant protuberance was ectoderm or a mesenchymal extrusion, sections were stained for the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, which was present in both control (Fig. 6I) and Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mice (Fig. 6L), showing that this is a morphological defect of the AER itself. The limb bud begins to develop as an outgrowth from the lateral mesoderm at about E9 in the forelimb. To examine whether basement membranes were found at early stages of limb formation, we immunostained sections of mouse embryos at E9.5, prior to the development of the AER. Here a continuous basement membrane staining was observed in both control (Fig. 7, A-C) and Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mice (Fig. 7, D-F). This suggests that the basement membrane either breaks or cannot be efficiently remodeled under the conditions of rapid growth and cell compaction induced by the development of the AER. Limb buds were then examined at E13.5, when the AER has regressed, condensation of the digital mesenchyme has begun to occur, and there are initial alterations of the interdigital regions of the forelimbs (Fig. 7J). Scanning electron microscopy showed the expected failure in septation in the Nid1-/- Nid2-/- mice (Fig. 7K), with a thickened mass of tissue forming a ridge over the fingers that extends as a band between the tips of the developing digits (Fig. 7, K and L). Further, it showed a less well differentiated epithelial layer over these regions. Sectio"
https://openalex.org/W2165747951,The central few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way host a massive black hole and exhibit very violent gas motion and high temperatures in molecular gas. The origin of these properties has been a mystery for the past four decades. Wide-field imaging of the 12 CO (rotational quantum number J = 1 to 0) 2.6-millimeter spectrum has revealed huge loops of dense molecular gas with strong velocity dispersions in the galactic center. We present a magnetic flotation model to explain that the formation of the loops is due to magnetic buoyancy caused by the Parker instability. The model has the potential to offer a coherent explanation for the origin of the violent motion and extensive heating of the molecular gas in the galactic center.

Here, we use the microtubule associated protein tau as a model system to investigate the role of amino acid side chains in the formation of such fibrils. We identify a region (positions 272-289) in the tau protein that, in the fibrillar state, either forms part of a core of parallel, in-register, β-strands, or remains unfolded. Single point mutations are sufficient to control this conformational switch with disease mutants G272V and ΔK280 (found in familial forms of dementia) inducing a folded state. Through systematic mutagenesis we derive a propensity scale for individual amino acids to form fibrils with parallel, in-register, β-strands.

This scale should not only apply to tau fibrils but generally to all fibrils with same strand arrangement. The deposition of proteins into extracellular plaques and intracellular inclusions is a key pathological hallmark of numerous degenerative diseases affecting the brain and peripheral tissues (1Dobson C.M.

These deposits are comprised of amyloids and “amyloid-like” fibrils, respectively. All fibrils are made up of β-strands that run perpendicular to the fiber axis and are spaced ∼4.8-Å apart from each other (3Sunde M. Blake C. Adv.

Although charge, hydrophobicity and β-sheet propensity are important factors that regulate formation of all types of fibrils (17Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M.

The degree to which these contacts will be stabilizing should vary for different amino acids, but exactly how these interactions depend on side chain identity and how sequence modulates these interactions remains poorly understood. Sequence analysis does not provide any conserved motifs, as parallel, in-register structures can be formed by proteins with little or no sequence homology. Here, we examine the role of side chain interactions and protein sequence in a parallel, in-register fibril and derive an experimental scale for the propensity of different amino acids to form parallel, in-register structures. Our studies were performed using fibrils generated from tau, a microtubule-associated protein that is mainly found in the axons and dendrites of nerve cells. Mutations in the tau gene have been shown to cause a hereditary form of dementia referred to as frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (19Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Altogether, tau fibrils (typically referred to as filaments) are found in over 20 neurodegenerative diseases (20Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Although originally controversial, recent evidence clearly demonstrates that tau fibrils have a cross-β structure (21von Barghorn S. Bergen M. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J.

In the large isoform of tau (441 amino acids), this region is composed of four semiconserved repeats (27Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). A particularly important role in fibril formation has been attributed to the third repeat (29von Friedhoff P. Bergen M.

Sasaki M. Taniguchi T. Ishida T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 2The abbreviations used are: EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy. spectroscopy, we recently showed that 18 consecutive residues (positions 303-320, henceforth referred to as S3) in the third repeat and its N-terminal boundary were tightly packed and formed a parallel, in-register structure wherein same residues from different molecules came into contact (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The introduction of spin label in this stretch was well tolerated and did not compromise filament stability. In the current EPR study, we set out to investigate an equivalent set of mutants (positions 272-289, henceforth referred to as S2) in the preceding second repeat and its boundary (Fig. 1A). Smaller isoforms of tau lack this repeat, yet are fully capable of forming fibrils (see for example (32Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Here we find that S2 can take up two structurally very different forms in the fibril. S2 can either form a separate domain of parallel, in-register structure or remain unfolded. This marginal stability allowed us to assess the ability of different amino acids to form parallel-stacked structures, and to evaluate the roles of amino acid composition and sequence on tau fibril structure. Our findings are likely to be important for other fibrils with parallel, in-register structures. Constructs—A pET-28 vector containing the large isoform of human tau, with its two cysteines replaced by serines (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), served as a template for the construction of all single cysteine mutants (positions 272-289, positions 296-298). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange protocol from Stratagene. Five of the single cysteine mutants (positions 277, 283, 284, 287, and 296) were used as templates for creating the following double mutants: I277C/V275K, I277C/I278K, I277C/K280V, D283C/V275K, D283C/I278K, D283C/K280V, L284C/V275K, L284C/I278K, L284C/K280V, L284C/G272V, L284C/ΔK280, V287C/V275K, V287C/I278K, V287C/K280V, and N296C/K280V. An additional cysteine mutant (position 306, described in Ref. 9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) served as a template for the following control mutants: V306C/V275K, V306C/I278K, V306C/K280V, V306C/G272V, and V306C/ΔK280. The accuracy of all sequences was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression and purification were performed essentially as described previously (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) were pelleted and resuspended in extraction buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Frozen pellets were heated for 20 min at 80 °C and further treated by sonication. Bacterial debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and soluble tau was precipitated from supernatant with ammonium sulfate (60%, m/V). Precipitates were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in H20, 2 mm dithiothreitol. After passage through syringe filters, proteins were loaded onto a UnoS cation exchange column from Bio-Rad. Tau protein was eluted from the column by a NaCl gradient, and peak fractions were pooled and reloaded onto a preparative grade Superdex 200 column for further purification. Proteins were >95% pure, as judged by SDS/PAGE. Monomeric tau was precipitated by an equal volume of MetOH, pelleted, washed, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. At every step, care was taken to include sufficient amounts of reducing agent (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Spin Labeling and Filament Assembly—Tau pellets (∼4-6 mg) were solubilized in 200 μlof6 m guanidinium chloride, and incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with a 10-fold molar excess of spin label [1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl]methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, Canada) or with a 1:3 mixture of spin label and diamagnetic analog (33Gross A. Columbus L. Hideg K. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10324-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The disulfide cross-linking of the spin label resulted in the side chain R1 (Fig. 1B). The properties of this side chain have been extensively characterized, and its minimal structural perturbation and high structural sensitivity are well established (34Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 35Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.S. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). After labeling, all samples were loaded onto PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were collected as 1.5-ml fractions (elution buffer: 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance measurement at 276 nm. For this purpose, protein aliquots of 100 μl were adjusted to 6 m guanidinium chloride. Spin-labeled tau proteins (free of denaturant and excess label) were mixed with heparin (Mr ∼ 3,000, at a tau/heparin molar ratio of 4:1) and brought to a final protein concentration of 40 μm (volume, 1 ml). Samples were incubated for 8 days, stirring at room temperature. Filaments were sedimented for 30 min at 160,000 × g, and pellets were washed once with elution buffer. EPR Measurements and Analysis—Pellets were taken up in quartz capillaries (Vitro Com Inc., New Jersey) and measured at X-band frequency in a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with an ER 4119HS resonator. The scan width in all experiments was 150 G. All spectra were normalized to the same amount of spins. Single line EPR spectra were generated by subtracting a simulated fast motional spectrum from the experimental composites. This fast motional spectrum was computed from the theoretical stick pattern of an electron interacting with 1 proton on the ring, 12 equivalent protons in the α-methyl groups, and 6 equivalent 13C nuclei at their natural abundance. Groups of stick spectra corresponding to the 14N hyperfine states were individually convoluted with a Lorentzian line of adjustable width (for more detail, see Ref. 36Langen R. Cai K. Altenbach C. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7918-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The simulated spectrum had a shape as that of the experimentally obtained spectra for positions 401-405 in the random coil region of the filament (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In fact, these latter spectra could be used interchangeably to generate the single line spectra, as might be expected in view of random coil structure at sites 272-289 in the tau filament. Spectra of free spin label and unpolymerized tau, however, were sufficiently different in line shape and could not be used for subtraction (for a comparison of spectra, see supplemental Fig. S1). Negative Stain Electron Microscopy (EM)— 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grids were placed for 1 min on 10-μl drops of tau filaments (4 μm), for 40 s on 10-μl drops of 2% uranyl acetate (freshly prepared), and for 5 s on 10-μl drops of EM grade water. The grids were air-dried on filter paper and images were taken on a JOEL JEM1200EX microscope at 80 kV. Two Independent Conformational States of S2—Our previous study demonstrated that S3 forms a parallel, in-register β-sheet structure in the filament (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, S2 is similar in sequence to S3, but harbors one additional lysine residue. Because such an additional charged residue could potentially be destabilizing, we first sought to determine whether S2 was still capable of forming a parallel, in-register structure. Toward this end, we used the large isoform of tau for a nitroxide scan in which each residue in S2 (positions 272-289) was replaced with the spin label R1 (Fig. 1B), one amino acid at a time. To monitor the structural changes in S2 upon filament formation, EPR spectra were obtained for spin-labeled tau in the monomeric and filamentous states. EPR spectra for all 18 derivatives in the soluble, monomeric state gave rise to three sharp lines, indicative of high mobility that is characteristic of a random coil structure (data not shown). These data agreed closely with our previous EPR data for S3 (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), as well as with the notion that soluble, monomeric tau is predominantly unfolded (37Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tau filaments were grown in the presence of heparin (32Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 38Perez M. Valpuesta J.M. Montejo de Medina M. Garcini E. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) under constant agitation. After 8 days, the filaments were harvested and carefully washed from any remaining unfibrilized material or free spin label (see “Experimental Procedures”). Filament formation was monitored by negative stain electron microscopy. All 18 derivatives formed wild-type-like filaments, as shown for representative examples I278R1 and K281R1 (Fig. 2A). The EPR spectra for the resulting spin-labeled tau filaments are depicted in Fig. 2B. In contrast to the single line, exchange-narrowed EPR spectra previously obtained for sites in S3 (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the EPR spectra for sites in S2 were much more heterogeneous, varying widely in amplitude and line shape. This heterogeneity was the consequence of varying amounts of two different spectral components that were identified in all spectra. These components were resolved by the subtraction-simulation procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first component is characterized by three sharp and narrowly spaced spectral lines that are of high amplitude. This component is very similar to the previously published spectra for sites outside the core region of the filament, and is clearly distinct from spectra of free spin label or unpolymerized tau (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the spectral component could not be observed in the supernatants of sedimented fibrils indicating that it cannot arise from an equilibrium of fibrils with monomers. The spectral component was particularly prominent for sites at which isoleucines or valines were substituted (I277R1, I278R1, V275R1, V287R1). In contrast, it was much less pronounced at other sites, especially when charged residues were replaced (e.g. K280R1, K281R1, and D283R1). Despite these strong site-to-site variations, all spectra indicated the presence of at least some amount of unfolded structure. The second component was already quite apparent in some spectra (e.g. K280R1, K281R1, and D283R1), and was clearly revealed by subtracting out the sharp component from the EPR spectra in Fig. 2B (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The spectral line shapes were very similar to each other and exhibited clear evidence of exchange narrowing (Fig. 3). Such exchange narrowing is the consequence of a loss of hyperfine structure (i.e. absence of outer lines) and results in single line EPR spectra. Exchange narrowing is rarely observed in site-directed spin labeling because it requires a highly specific and organized structure that allows a large number of spin labels to be in van-der Waals contact at the same time (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, in our previous studies on tau filaments, we also observed exchange-narrowed spectra at consecutive single-labeled sites in S3. These data indicated a pronounced parallel, in-register arrangement in which same residues were stacked at a distance of 4.8 Å along the fibril axis (9Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Similarly, the occurrence of exchange narrowing at consecutive sites in S2 suggested that this region, like S3, could adopt a highly ordered parallel, in-register structural state. This notion was further supported by spin dilution experiments, which showed that the exchange-narrowed component was of low mobility (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, analysis of the S2 spectra revealed varying amounts of two very different spectral components: one component with a highly unfolded and dynamic structure, and the other with an unusually ordered, highly stacked structure. These structures cannot be simultaneously taken up by a single tau molecule, as a given residue cannot be folded and unfolded at the same time. Rather, they require the existence of two separate structures (as shown in Fig. 4A) that are present in varying amounts. To determine why the relative amounts of these structural states varied for the different derivatives, we performed more quantitative analyses of the respective spectral components for each site. This analysis was performed in two independent ways: (a) by plotting the experimentally observable spectral amplitudes, and (b) by quantitative analysis of the spectral subtractions described above. The rationale for the former was based on the observation that all spectra are made up of two distinctively different spectral components that vary by approximately one order of magnitude in signal amplitude (Fig. 4A, bottom). Thus, the signal amplitude increases linearly with increasing amounts of the high amplitude mobile state. Systematic analysis revealed that the signal amplitudes strongly depended on the nature of the amino acid side chain that had been replaced, regardless of their position in sequence. Substitutions of the charged residues (aspartate and lysine) invariably resulted in very small amplitudes (Fig. 4B, left), whereas the highest amplitudes were observed when hydrophobic, β-branched residues (isoleucine and valine) were replaced (Fig. 4B, right). The next highest amplitudes were observed for sites at which Leu was replaced by R1. Although Leu is also hydrophobic, it is notβ-branched and has a lower propensity than Ile and Val for forming β-structures. Thus, the elimination of any charged residue strongly promoted formation of the ordered, parallel state of S2, whereas the replacement of residues with high β-sheet propensity, such as Ile and Val, was destabilizing. These conclusions were further supported by quantitative analysis of the aforementioned spectral subtractions, which gave direct estimates of the relative amounts of the ordered and disordered states. As shown in Fig. 4C, these results closely followed the trend observed in the amplitude plot and reestablished that charge substitution strongly favored the ordered state, while loss of the β-branched Ile and Val was highly destabilizing. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the two highly different structural states of S2 are of similar energy, since single amino acid substitutions had a significant impact on the relative populations (also see below). Because the relative populations were simply dependent on the nature of the amino acids that had been replaced, the values presented in Fig. 4, B and C likely reflect an intrinsic propensity of a given amino acid to stabilize the folded state of S2. Mutations in S2 Have Long Range Stability Effects on S2, but Not S3—Next, we sought to obtain independent support for the two-state nature of S2, and to test whether we could use the propensity scale depicted in Fig. 4 to predict how additional changes in amino acid composition could affect the folding of S2. We reasoned that, if the marginally stable S2 region folds up cooperatively, mutations at one site in S2 should have long range effects on other distant sites in that region. To test this notion, we developed a reporter/guest system. Reporter sites are sites at which spin labels were introduced. The EPR signal from this spin-labeled site was then used to determine how additional mutations at a guest site influenced the relative proportions of the folded and unfolded states. We constructed a total of 15 double mutants that harbored spin labels either at selected sites in S2 (residue 283, 284, 287, or 277) or in S3 (residue 306). For each of these reporter sites, two types of additional substitutions were made at guest sites. In one set of mutants, the β-branched residues were replaced with lysine (V275K or I278K), while in another set of mutants, the charged lysine was replaced with valine (K280V). The first row in Fig. 5 shows the results of the D283R1 reporter substitution, which, in the absence of any additional guest mutations, gave rise to a highly ordered state (Fig. 2B and Fig. 5, upper left). Interestingly, substitution of either β-branched residue with Lys caused a significant increase in the sharp lines, demonstrating that these guest site mutations strongly reduced the stability of S2 and increased the amount of the unfolded state. The K280V mutation was made to stabilize S2, but using D283R1, little additional stabilization could be detected since this reporter mutation alone was sufficient to induce the folding of S2. Next, we investigated three reporter sites that, by themselves, did not result in a highly folded state of S2 (L284R1, V287R1, and I277R1). For each of these sites, the additional V275K and I278K guest site substitutions further increased the amount of the unfolded state of S2 (albeit less pronounced for the already highly dynamic V277R1 derivative). Importantly, the K280V guest site substitution induced the formation of a stable folded structure of S2 for all of the sites tested. To test whether mutations in S2 could affect the stability of S3, we chose the β-branched residue Val306 as the reporter site for the S3 structure. As shown in the bottom row of Fig. 5, the spectra for V306R1 were invariable regardless of any guest site mutation in S2, indicating an independent parallel, in-register structure for S3 under all conditions. Collectively, these data confirm that S3 is a stable core region of tau filaments that can fold regardless of the structural state of S2. In contrast, S2 is only a marginally stable, cooperatively folding unit. Its stability depends on the delicate balance of residues that promote the formation of stacked, parallel, in-register structures with residues that are charged or that otherwise destabilize the parallel, in-register structure. Linker Region—Having established that S3 and S2 fold as independent domains, the question arose as to whether residues connecting the two stretches also take up a parallel, in-register structure or whether they represent a more flexible linker region. To address this question, we generated three additional derivatives harboring spin labels at sites between S2 and S3 (N296R1, I297R1, and K298R1). EPR spectra of filaments formed from these derivatives (Fig. 6) were distinctively different from those observed at any site in S2 or S3. None of the spectra contained the sharp lines that are indicative of a highly unfolded region; rather, the spectra contained multiple components with mobilities ranging from moderately mobile to immobile. Although some spin-spin interaction might well be present at all three sites, no exchange narrowing could be detected, demonstrating that this region did not form a perfectly stacked, parallel, in-register structure. As a further control, we generated the N296R1/K280V double mutant to test what effect the more complete ordering of S2 had on the structure of the region between S2 and S3. This additional substitution, however, caused only minor spectral changes and failed to induce the formation of a highly stacked, parallel, in-register structure at position 296. Thus, we conclude that the region around residues 296-298 is part of a moderately flexible linker region that is structurally distinct from that of S2 or S3.

These mutations could have multiple effects, as they may influence the splicing into different isoforms, the binding to microtubules, or the"
https://openalex.org/W2072873097,"Septic shock is the leading cause of death in noncoronary intensive care units and the 10th leading cause of death overall. Several lines of evidence support an important role for the vasodilator NO in hypotension, a hallmark of septic shock. However, NO may also positively or negatively regulate inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. These dual effects of NO may relate to its isoform specific production but also to differences in cellular and/or temporal expression. Via bone marrow transplantations, we examined the contribution of hematopoietic cells to the dramatically elevated NO levels seen in (septic) shock. Surprisingly, hematopoietic cells are not responsible at all for the production of circulating NO after systemic tumor necrosis factor or lipopolysaccharide challenge and contribute only marginally in a bacteremic (Salmonella) model of septic shock. Immunohistochemistry identified the nonhematopoietic sources of NO as hepatocytes, paneth cells, and intestinal and renal epithelial cells. In contrast, during granulomatous Bacillus Calmette-Guérin inflammation, the hematopoietic cell population represents the sole source of systemic NO. These mouse data demonstrate that, in contrast to the general conjecture, the dramatically elevated levels of NO during (septic) shock are not produced by hematopoietic cells such as monocytes/macrophages but rather by parenchymal cells in liver, kidney and gut."
https://openalex.org/W2092967947,"APOBEC3 proteins comprise a multigene family of antiviral cytidine deaminases that are active against human immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, endogenous retroelements. The Vif protein of lentiviruses binds to specific APOBEC3 proteins, notably A3F and A3G, to induce their degradation by proteasomes. APOBEC3 proteins are of two types, those with a single deaminase domain such as human (h)A3A and hA3C and those with two cytidine deaminase domains (CDD) such as hA3G, hA3F, hA3B and the mouse APOBEC3, mA3. In hA3G, both active sites are required for antiviral function but serve separate functions. CDD2 mediates the C to U deamination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome, whereas CDD1 binds the viral RNA to allow for virion packaging. Here we analyzed the role of the two domains in additional APOBEC3 family members. We analyzed APOBEC3 proteins in which either the critical glutamic acid residue or the Zn2+ coordination amino acid residues in the active sites were mutated. The separation of function of the domains is maintained in hA3B and hA3F, but in the mouse protein mA3, the roles of the two domains are reversed. Deamination is mediated by CDD1, whereas encapsidation and dimerization are mediated by CDD2. Antiviral function of each of the APOBEC3 proteins was largely attributable to deaminase activity. Deaminase-independent antiviral activity of the active site mutants was minor. These findings suggest that the two active sites have different functions but that these functions can be interchanged in different APOBEC3 family members.

In cells infected with HIV-1 deleted for Vif (Δvif), hA3G molecules are packaged into the assembling virion, causing a dramatic reduction in particle infectivity. The ability to be packaged in retroviral virions is a property that is shared among the APOBEC family members, regardless of whether they have antiviral activity or not (17Yu Q. Chen D. Konig R.

Virus that lacks an intact nucleocapsid domain in the Gag precursor polyprotein does not efficiently package hA3G, suggesting either a direct interaction with Gag or binding to the viral genomic RNA (13Navarro F.

Upon infection of target cells with Δvif virus, the packaged hA3G deaminates the minus strand reverse transcript as it is synthesized. The specificity for the minus strand results from the requirement of APOBEC3G for single-stranded DNA. The majority of the virus DNA molecules are degraded prior to integration by DNA repair enzymes such as uracil DNA glycosylase, and the few proviruses that form are generally inactivated by the G→ A mutations (2Mangeat B.

The cytidine deaminase domains (CDD) of APOBEC proteins contain an active site with a conserved consensus motif His-X-Glu-X23–28-Pro-Cys-X2–4-Cys in which the His-Cys-Cys residues coordinate a Zn2–+ ion, and the glutamic acid residue serves an essential role in catalysis as a proton shuttle (26Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Some of the APOBEC3 proteins contain a single CDD (hA3A and hA3C), whereas others (hA3B, hA3G, hA3F, and mA3) have two tandem CDDs. In the case of hA3G, both domains contain an intact active site consensus sequence motif, but only CDD2 appears to be catalytically active (13Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). hA3G with a mutation of the critical Glu-67 in active site 1 maintained its antiviral activity, whereas a mutant in which the analogous Glu-259 of active site 2 was changed to Ala lost antiviral activity (13Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The catalytic function of CDD2 was also demonstrated using hA3G/hA3F chimeras where it was shown that the target site preference of the chimeras was specified by CDD2 (27Langlois M.A. Beale R.C. Conticello S.G. Neuberger M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). AS1 of hA3G was required for virion encapsidation and for dimerization but not to induce G→ A mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcripts (13Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that deamination is the primary mechanism by which APOBEC3 proteins inhibit virus replication, an additional deaminase-independent antiviral function was suggested by Newman et al. (28Newman E.N. Holmes R.K. Craig H.M. Klein K.C. Lingappa J.R. Malim M.H. Sheehy A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 166-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In that study, hA3G E259Q was found to lack detectable activity in a bacterial mutagenesis assay, failed to induce G→ A mutations on HIV-1 DNA, yet was fully active in a single cycle reporter virus assay. Additional support for a deaminase-independent antiviral activity was suggested by the finding that hA3G inhibited the replication of hepatitis virus in culture in the absence of detectable G→ A mutations (5Turelli P. Mangeat B. Jost S. Vianin S. Trono D. Science. 2004; 303: 1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and the report of hA3A activity against retroelements (29Bogerd H.P. Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Lueders K.K. Cullen B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the function of the deaminase domains of the two domain APOBEC3 family members, hA3F, hA3B, and mA3. We found that as for hA3G, CDD2 was the catalytically active domain of hA3B and hA3F. In contrast, in the mouse enzyme, mA3, the situation was reversed. Deamination was mediated by AS1, and packaging and homodimerization were mediated by AS2. In each of the APOBEC3 proteins, the antiviral activity was dependent on deaminase activity.

Cell Lines—HEK 293T and human osteosarcoma cell line HOS.T4.X4 that expresses CD4 and CXCR4 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Infectivity Assay—VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase reporter viruses were generated as described previously (3Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C.

Briefly, 293T cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and 1 day later transfected with 1 μg each of pNL-Luc-E–R– Δvif, pVSV-G, and wild type, or mutant APOBEC3 expression vector or pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Negative control transfections were included in which the reporter virus plasmid was substituted with pcDNA3.1(+). In APOBEC3 titrations, the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by the addition of pcDNA3.1(+). Virus-containing supernatant was harvested 2 days post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the p24 concentration was determined by ELISA. APOBEC3 mutants had no effect on p24 release. Supernatant containing 0.25 ng of p24 was added in triplicate to 1.0 × 104 HOS.T4.X4 cells in a 96-well plate. After 3 days, luciferase activity was measured using Steady Lite HTS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data are presented as the average of the triplicates with the standard error. APOBEC3 Encapsidation—Virions were produced by 293T cells that were cotransfected with 1 μg of pNL-Luc-E–R– Δvif and APOBEC3 expression vector or empty vector control. To control for nonspecific release of APOBEC3 into the supernatant, mock virions were produced by transfection of the cells with APOBEC3 expression vector without the viral plasmid. Two days post-transfection, the culture supernatant was harvested, and cell lysates were prepared. Level of p24 in the natant of the sample transfected with pNL-Luc-E–R– super-Δvif was determined to be about 50 ng/ml by ELISA. The supernatant (2 ml) was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and then ultracentrifuged for 1 h through a 20% sucrose cushion at 150,000 × g. Approximately 40% of p24 in the supernatant was pelleted. The pelleted virions were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Virion lysates were quantitated by p24 ELISA, and the protein concentration of the lysates was measured by Bradford assay. Solubilized virions (1.5 ng of p24) and cell extracts (6 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance) or anti-p24 monoclonal antibody AG3.0. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and the blot was developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To quantitate the signal a Typhoon fluorescence gel reader was used (Amersham Biosciences). APOBEC3 Dimerization Assay—293T cells were seeded at 1 × 105/well in 6-well plates and transfected a day later with 1.0 μg each of Myc-tagged APOBEC3 expression vector or empty pcDNA3.1(+) and HA-tagged APOBEC3. Two days post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem) for 1 h on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g and precleared with protein-G-Sepharose. Myc-tagged APOBEC3 was immunoprecipitated by addition of 2 μl of mAb 9E10 (Covance) for 1 h at 4°C followed by 20 μl of protein-G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times with lysis buffer, and then 50 μl of reducing sample buffer was added (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on an immunoblot probed with 16B12 and 9E10 mAbs. Sequencing of Viral Reverse Transcripts—Virions were prepared by transfection of 1 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish with 8.0 μg of APOBEC3 expression vector, 8 μg of proviral plasmid, and 4 μg of pVSV-G. Two days post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested and treated with DNase-I for 1 h at 37°C. The virus (10 ng) was added to 5.0 × 105 HOS.T4.X4 cells in a 6-well plate. The cells were cultured for 8 h at which time total DNA was prepared using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). A portion of gag was amplified with the sense primer 5′-CACAATCACACTCCCATGCAGAAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGTAGCTGAAGAGGCACAGGCT-3′ using Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The amplicon was cloned into the TOPO TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of 10 independent clones was determined. In Vitro Deaminase Assay—293T cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and a day later transfected with 1 μg of APOBEC3 expression vector. Two days post-transfection, the cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm DTT). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and precleared with 40 μl of protein-G-Sepharose. The precleared lysate was incubated with anti-HA mAb bound to protein-G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer. 1/5 of the resin was removed for immunoblot analysis, and the remainder was washed once with deaminase reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Biotin-labeled oligonucleotide (biotin-5′-T28CCCGT28-3′ for and hA3G, hA3B, mA3 or biotin-5′-T29CAT28-3′ for hA3F) in 20 μl of deaminase reaction buffer was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. The reactions were stopped by heating to 90 °C for 5 min, cooled on ice, and then centrifuged to collect the resin at the bottom of tube. The supernatant was incubated with uracil DNA glycosylase (New England Biolabs) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C and treated with 150 mm NaOH for 1 h at 37°C. The samples were separated by 15% TBE/urea-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The bound oligonucleotide was detected with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce), and the bands were quantitated on a Typhoon fluorescence gel reader. The Antiviral Activity of mA3 Requires the Catalytic Glutamic Acid of AS1—To extend our analysis of the function of the CDDs of the APOBEC3 proteins (13Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), point mutants of hA3B, hA3F, and mA3 were generated in which the catalytic glutamic acid residue of AS1 in CDD1 and AS2 in CDD2 was changed to alanine. For hA3G, AS1 (E67A), AS2 (E259A), and the AS1/AS2 double mutants (E67A/E259A) were generated and termed hA3GAS1*, hA3GAS2* and hA3GAS1/AS2*, respectively. Analogous AS1 and AS2 mutations in hA3B and hA3F were also generated and named similarly. Antiviral function of the mutant proteins was evaluated using Δvif single cycle luciferase reporter virus. The virus was produced in 293T cells cotransfected with APOBEC3 expression vector, and its infectivity was measured on HOS target cells. For hA3G, the AS1 mutant, hA3GAS1*, was fully active, whereas the AS2 and AS1/AS2 mutants, hA3GAS2* and hA3GAS1/AS2*, were minimally active, showing only about 40% reduction in infectivity (Fig. 1). For hA3B, the AS1 mutant was as active as wild-type hA3B, whereas the AS2 and the AS1/AS2 double mutants were inactive. HA3B was less inhibitory overall as compared with hA3G, consistent with previous findings regarding its weak activity against HIV-1 (17Yu Q. Chen D. Konig R. Mariani R. Unutmaz D. Landau N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53379-53386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For hA3F, the AS1 mutant was fully active, whereas the AS2 and AS1/AS2 double mutants were partially active with 80 and 60% reduction, respectively. This activity, however, was rapidly lost when the APOBEC3 was titrated down in the subsequent experiment shown below, suggesting that the antiviral activity of these proteins is weak. Interestingly, for mA3, the phenotype of the mutants was reversed. The AS1 mutant and the AS1/AS2 double mutant showed only 70 and 60% reduction on the infectivity, whereas the AS2 mutant retained full function. To more accurately gauge the difference in function of the active sites in mA3, the antiviral activity of the wild-type and mutant proteins was tested over a range of concentrations (Fig. 2). For hA3G, the AS1 mutant was at least as active as wild type over the titration. It was interesting to note that over the titration, the hA3G AS1 mutant was significantly more active than wild type. This suggests that CDD1 has a negative effect on the catalytic function of AS2. The AS2 mutant reduced viral infectivity only about 40% even at the highest dose. For hA3B, the wild-type protein was considerably less active against HIV-1, consistent with our previous findings (17Yu Q. Chen D. Konig R. Mariani R. Unutmaz D. Landau N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53379-53386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Over the course of the titration, the AS1 mutant was nearly as active as wild type, whereas the AS2 mutant was inactive. For hA3F, the AS1 mutant was as active as wild type. The AS2 mutant was somewhat active at the highest dose (60% inhibition), but this was lost by the next lower dose. For mA3, the reversed functional organization of the cytidine deaminase domains was most clear with 0.5 μg of plasmid. At the 1.0-μg dose, the AS1 mutant was somewhat active, perhaps reflecting nonspecific effects of the protein. To test whether the mutant APOBEC3 proteins were similarly expressed and competent for virion encapsidation, lysates of the transfected cells and the virions were analyzed on an immunoblot probed with anti-HA mAb. The results showed that wild-type, AS1, AS2, and AS1/AS2 mutants of hA3G, hA3B, mA3, and hA3F were similarly expressed (Fig. 3, upper panel) and were efficiently loaded into virions (Fig. 3, middle panel). The only exception was the hA3B AS1 mutant, which was not as efficiently packaged as wild-type hA3B (Fig. 3, middle panel). Similar loading of the viruses was confirmed by probing the blot with anti-CA mAb (Fig. 3, lower panel). Analysis of G→ A Mutations in the Viral Genome Confirms Reversed Roles of mA3 CDD1 and CDD2—To determine which of the domains of the different APOBEC3 proteins was required to generate G→ A mutations in the viral genome, viral cDNA derived from newly infected cells was PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Cells were infected with Δvif virions produced by 293T cells cotransfected with the various APOBEC3 active site mutants. After 8 h, the cells were harvested; DNA was prepared, and a 1-kb fragment of the viral genome near the 3′ end of env was PCR-amplified. The fragment was then cloned into a plasmid vector, and the nucleotide sequence of 10 independent clones was determined. The sequences of viral cDNAs derived from infection of Δvif virus that had been produced without APOBEC3 had no mutations (data not shown). Wild-type virus produced in the presence of hA3G had a single G→ A mutation (mutational frequency = 0.02%; data not shown). As expected, viral cDNAs derived from Δvif virions produced with hA3G were heavily mutated with seven clones containing 10 or more G→ A mutations (Fig. 4). The other APOBEC3 proteins also induced a significant number of G→ A mutations (hA3G, 2.28%; hA3B, 0.82%; hA3F, 0.92%; and mA3, 1.52%). The AS1 mutants for each of the human two-domain APO-BEC3 proteins induced mutations with a frequency similar to that of wild type (3.35% for hA3GAS1*, 0.45% for hA3BAS1*, and 0.23% for hA3FAS1*). In contrast, mutation of AS2 reduced the number of G→ A mutations to near zero (0.02% for hA3GAS2* and 0% for hA3BAS2* and hA3FAS2*). The situation was reversed for the mouse protein. The mA3 AS1 mutant was nonfunctional whereas the AS2 mutant retained function. For all APOBEC3 proteins tested, no G→ A mutation was detected in the AS1/AS2 double mutants. These results suggest that cDNA deamination is mediated by AS2 for the human APOBEC3 proteins and by AS1 for the mouse protein. In addition, the higher G→ A mutational frequency of human AS1* and mouse AS2* mutants when compared with human AS2* and mouse AS1* mutants correlated with the higher antiviral function of human AS1* and mouse AS2* mutants than human AS2* and mouse AS1* mutants. Catalytic Activity of mA3 Is Mediated by AS1—To determine the relative contribution of the two active sites to the G→ A mutational frequency, the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins was measured with an in vitro cytidine deaminase assay. For this, we developed an assay to measure the catalytic activity of APOBEC3 proteins immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysates rather than from solubilized pelleted virions as we have reported previously (13Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation deaminase assay, 293T cells were transfected with APOBEC3 expression vector and lysed after 2 days. APOBEC3 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate with anti-HA mAb, and the immunoprecipitate was incubated with a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide that contains a target sequence for APOBEC3 deamination. The deaminated product was detected by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. The assay was validated with control samples, which included an empty vector transfection, which yielded no detectable deamination, and hA3G expression vector transfection, which resulted in a deaminated product with about 23-fold above background band intensi"
https://openalex.org/W2153072759,"Ebola and Marburg viruses can cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks with high mortality in primates. Whereas Marburg (MARV), Ebola Zaire (ZEBOV), and Ebola Sudan (SEBOV) viruses are pathogenic in humans, apes, and monkeys, Ebola Reston (REBOV) is pathogenic only in monkeys. Early immunosuppression may contribute to pathogenesis by facilitating viral replication. Lymphocyte depletion, intravascular apoptosis, and cytokine dysregulation are prominent in fatal cases. Here we functionally characterize a 17 amino acid domain in filoviral glycoproteins that resembles an immunosuppressive motif in retroviral envelope proteins. Activated human or rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were exposed to inactivated ZEBOV or a panel of 17mer peptides representing all sequenced strains of filoviruses, then analyzed for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, apoptosis, and cytokine expression. Exposure of human and rhesus PBMC to ZEBOV, SEBOV, or MARV peptides or inactivated ZEBOV resulted in decreased expression of activation markers on CD4 and CD8 cells; CD4 and CD8 cell apoptosis as early as 12 h postexposure; inhibition of CD4 and CD8 cell cycle progression; decreased interleukin (IL)-2, IFN-gamma, and IL12-p40 expression; and increased IL-10 expression. In contrast, only rhesus T cells were sensitive to REBOV peptides. These findings are consistent with the observation that REBOV is not pathogenic in humans and have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of filoviral HF."
https://openalex.org/W2134961581,"The biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in higher eukaryotes requires the functions of several cellular proteins and includes nuclear as well as cytoplasmic phases. In the cytoplasm, a macromolecular complex containing the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, Gemin2-8 and Unrip mediates the ATP-dependent assembly of Sm proteins and snRNAs into snRNPs. To carry out snRNP assembly, the SMN complex binds directly to both Sm proteins and snRNAs; however, the contribution of the individual components of the SMN complex to its composition, interactions, and function is poorly characterized. Here, we have investigated the functional role of Gemin8 using novel monoclonal antibodies against components of the SMN complex and RNA interference experiments. We show that Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip form a stable cytoplasmic complex whose association with SMN requires Gemin8. Gemin8 binds directly to SMN and mediates its interaction with the Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimer. Importantly, loss of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip interaction with SMN as a result of Gemin8 knockdown affects snRNP assembly by impairing the SMN complex association with Sm proteins but not with snRNAs. These results reveal the essential role of Gemin8 for the proper structural organization of the SMN complex and the involvement of the heteromeric subunit containing Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip in the recruitment of Sm proteins to the snRNP assembly pathway.

Pre-mRNA splicing is a key step in the pathway of eukaryotic gene expression. The accurate excision of introns and joining of exons of pre-mRNAs is carried out by the spliceosome, a dynamic macromolecular assembly of hundreds of proteins and a few RNAs (1Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) whose essential constituents are the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) 2The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SMN, survival motor neuron; GST, glutathione S-transferase. particles. Despite steady-state localization in the nucleus, where they function in pre-mRNA splicing, the biogenesis pathway of snRNPs involves an ordered series of events that take place in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of higher eukaryotes (2Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Spliceosomal snRNPs contain an snRNA molecule, a set of common proteins known as Sm proteins and specific proteins unique for each snRNP. The hallmark of snRNPs is a ring structure of seven Sm proteins around a single-stranded region of the snRNAs (3Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. de la Avis J.M. Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J.

A large macromolecular complex containing the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein and at least eight additional integral components, which are tightly associated by a network of protein-protein interactions and include Gemin2-8 and Unrip proteins (4Liu Q.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Precursor snRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II and exported to the cytoplasm by the concerted action of the cap-binding complex, PHAX, CRM1, and RanGTP (15Ohno M. Segref A. Bachi A. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, newly translated Sm proteins associate with pICln and the PRMT5 complex and, following symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues of a subset of Sm proteins by the PRMT5 complex, are transferred to the SMN complex (16Meister G.

The pool of cytoplasmic SMN complexes bound to the seven Sm proteins represents the functional unit competent for snRNP assembly in cells. These SMN complexes bind directly to specific domains of the snRNAs exported from the nucleus and carry out the ATP-dependent assembly of the Sm core (19Meister G. Buhler D. Pillai R. Lottspeich F.

Cap hypermethylation and trimming of the 3′-end extension of snRNAs follow snRNP assembly and precede import in the nucleus, where snRNPs undergo further maturation steps before functioning in pre-mRNA splicing (2Will C.L. Luhrmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the SMN complex also plays a direct role in the nuclear import of newly assembled snRNPs and possibly in other steps of snRNP biogenesis (22Massenet S. Pellizzoni L.

Bordonne R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a similar way to the well established role of protein chaperones, the SMN complex is thought to impose efficiency and specificity to the process of Sm core formation on snRNAs and to overcome spontaneous but potentially promiscuous association of Sm proteins with other RNAs (20Pellizzoni L. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2002; 298: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This is likely accomplished through the direct and independent interaction of the SMN complex with both Sm proteins and snRNAs (13Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that knockdown of SMN and several Gemin proteins affects snRNP assembly, but in most cases, the molecular defects responsible for reduced SMN complex activity have not been characterized (10Carissimi C.

HeLa Cell Fractionation—For preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, HeLa cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended gently in cytoplasmic buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4). After swelling for 10 min on ice, the cells were passed five times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 4000 revolutions/min for 1 min at 4 °C to separate the cytoplasm (supernatant) from nuclei (pellet). The supernatant was collected and, after adjusting the salt concentration to RSB-100 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, centrifuged again at 10,000 revolutions/min for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain soluble cytoplasmic HeLa extract. The nuclei were washed gently with cytoplasmic buffer and centrifuged again at 4000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then discarded, and the nuclei were resuspended in RSB-100 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following brief sonication, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 revolutions/min for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain soluble nuclear HeLa extract. In Vitro snRNP Assembly and snRNA Binding Experiments— U1, U1ΔSm, SL1, and SL1A3 RNAs were in vitro transcribed in the presence of [α32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and purified from denaturing polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures. Bead-bound SMN complexes immunopurified using anti-SMN (7F3) antibodies from HeLa cell extracts or sucrose gradient fractions were analyzed for snRNP assembly or snRNA binding in reconstitution buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 as previously described (10Carissimi C.

Identification of a Cytoplasmic Complex Containing Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip—To further our understanding of the composition, structure, and function of the SMN complex, we generated novel monoclonal antibodies against Gemin6 (20H8), Gemin7 (5F1), Unrip (2G3), and SmB (12F5) proteins. Western blot analysis shows that each of these antibodies recognizes the corresponding purified recombinant protein as well as a protein of the expected molecular weight in HeLa cell extracts (supplemental Fig. S1). Immunoprecipitation experiments from HeLa cell extract show that antibodies against Gemin6, Unrip, and SmB, similar to SMN antibodies used as a reference, specifically co-immunoprecipitate all the known integral components of the SMN complex (Fig. 1). Strikingly, the anti-Gemin7 antibody 5F1 co-immunoprecipitates Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip but none of the other components of the SMN complex (Fig. 1). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells with the anti-Gemin7 antibody 5F1 shows cytoplasmic and very weak nucleoplasmic staining but no co-localization with SMN in nuclear Gems (Fig. 2, A-C), whereas the anti-Gemin6 antibody 20H8 displays the expected subcellular localization pattern of SMN complex components (Fig. 2, D-F). These results suggest that the Gemin7 epitope recognized by 5F1 is masked in the SMN complex but accessible in a distinct protein complex containing Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip.FIGURE 2Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells with novel monoclonal antibodies against Gemin6 and Gemin7.

SMN shows the typical heterodisperse distribution in large macromolecular complexes that also contain Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip as well as the other components of the SMN complex (Fig. 3, A and B) (10Carissimi C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunoprecipitation with anti-Gemin7 antibodies demonstrates that Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip found in slow-sedimenting fractions at the top of the gradient are associated in distinct protein complexes that do not contain SMN or other Gemin proteins (Fig. 3C and data not shown). This finding was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Gemin6 and anti-Unrip antibodies, although they also immunoprecipitated SMN complexes (Fig. 3D and data not shown). Importantly, SmB is associated with the entire spectrum of SMN complexes, which are also competent for snRNP assembly (supplemental Fig. S2), but not with the Gemin6-Gemin7-Unrip complex (Fig. 3E). Next, we sought to investigate the subcellular localization of the Gemin6-Gemin7-Unrip complex. To do so, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments from cytoplasmic and nuclear HeLa extracts (Fig. 4). The accuracy of cellular fractionation is indicated by proper distribution of poly(A)-binding protein and p300 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Immunoprecipitation with the anti-Gemin7 antibody 5F1 demonstrates that the Gemin6-Gemin7-Unrip protein complex is mostly, if not exclusively, present in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Conversely, as indicated by immunoprecipitation with either anti-SMN or -Gemin6 monoclonal antibodies, Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip proteins are associated with SMN in both cytoplasmic and nuclear SMN complexes. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip form a heteromeric protein complex separate from the SMN complex and present in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Gemin8 Bridges SMN to the Gemin6/Gemin7 Heterodimer— Gemin8 is not found in the Gemin6-Gemin7-Unrip complex identified above, despite its direct interaction with the Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimer (10Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In search for additional Gemin8 interactions, we found that recombinant SMN binds directly and specifically to immobilized GST-Gemin8 but not to GST (Fig. 5A). In the reciprocal experiment, recombinant Gemin8 binds to GST-Gemin2/SMN, although with a lower efficiency compared with GST-Gemin6/Gemin7, but neither to GST nor to GST-Gemin2 alone (Fig. 5B). Therefore, Gemin8 interacts directly with both SMN and the Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimer. To test whether these interactions occur simultaneously, we purified GST or GST-Gemin2/SMN recombinant proteins from E. coli either in the presence or in the absence of co-expressed Gemin8. Gemin8 specifically co-purifies with GSTGemin2/SMN but not with GST (Fig. 5C). We then analyzed the capacity of Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimers to bind these protein complexes and found that they interact specifically and efficiently with Gemin2/SMN only in the presence of Gemin8 (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that Gemin8 mediates the association of Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimers with SMN. Gemin8 Is Required for SMN Association with Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip—To investigate the role of Gemin8 in the association of Gemin6 and Gemin7 with SMN in vivo, we knocked down Gemin8 expression by RNA interference and analyzed the composition of SMN complexes isolated with anti-SMN antibodies from HeLa cell extracts. Strikingly, Gemin8 knockdown strongly affects the association of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip with SMN, whereas there is little, if any, effect on SMN interaction with Gemin2-5 proteins (Fig. 6). There is also a noticeable reduction of Gemin6 and Gemin7 expression levels upon Gemin8 knockdown, which may be due to partial destabilization as a result of their impaired association with SMN. These results indicate that Gemin8 is required for the efficient association of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip proteins with the SMN complex in vivo. Gemin8 Knockdown Affects SMN Association with Sm Proteins—To investigate the consequence of Gemin8 knockdown on SMN complex activity, we carried out snRNP assembly using SMN complexes isolated with anti-SMN antibodies from HeLa cell extracts following Gemin8 RNA interference. Consistent with our previous results in cell extracts (10Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), loss of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip association with the SMN complex as a result of Gemin8 knockdown severely impairs Sm core formation (Fig. 7), indicating that these proteins are required for SMN complex activity in snRNP assembly. To carry out snRNP assembly, the SMN complex interacts directly and independently with Sm proteins and snRNAs (13Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). First, we investigated the potential role of Gemin8 in snRNA binding by using stem loop 1 (SL1) of U1, which binds the SMN complex, and the SL1A3 mutant containing three point mutations as a control (33Yong J. Pellizzoni L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immobilized SMN complexes purified from HeLa cell extracts following Gemin8 knockdown by RNA interference displayed no difference in their ability to interact with SL1 compared with the control (Fig. 8A). These results indicate that Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip do not contribute to the snRNA binding activity of the SMN complex. These results are in good agreement with the recent identification of Gemin5 as the snRNA-binding protein of the SMN complex (29Battle D.J. Lau C.K. Wan L. Deng H. Lotti F. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which was reported when our paper was in the final stage of preparation. Next, we analyzed the effect of Gemin8 knockdown on the association of Sm proteins with the SMN complex. HeLa cells were transfected with control or Gemin8 siRNAs and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine before immunoprecipitation of SMN complexes with anti-SMN antibodies. Remarkably, and in addition to that of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip, Gemin8 knockdown affects the association of Sm proteins with the SMN complex (Fig. 8B). Immunoprecipitation with anti-SmB antibodies further highlighted the specific impairment of SmB association with SMN but not with the PRMT5 complex upon Gemin8 knockdown (Fig. 8C). These results indicate that Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip are required for the efficient association of Sm proteins with the SMN complex. The SMN complex is the large macromolecular machine employed by cells for the assembly of spliceosomal snRNPs (13Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence linking impaired snRNP biogenesis to motor neuron degeneration, additional SMN functions have also been implicated in spinal muscular atrophy (35Eggert C. Chari A. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of the SMN complex activities and the function of its integral components are needed to elucidate a fundamental cellular process, such as the biogenesis of the splicing apparatus, and to unravel the pathophysiology of spinal muscular atrophy. Here, we have analyzed the contribution of Gemin8 to the composition, interactions, and function of the SMN complex. We found that Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip form a distinct protein complex and that Gemin8 is essential for their efficient association with the SMN complex, which is likely accomplished through the direct and independent interaction of Gemin8 with both SMN and the Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimer. Importantly, Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip form a heteromeric subunit of the SMN complex required for the efficient association of Sm proteins and snRNP assembly activity. Altogether, these results highlight the essential role of Gemin8 for the architecture of the SMN complex and its function in snRNP assembly. We have demonstrated that Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip are associated in a stable cellular complex separate from the SMN complex (Figs. 1 and 3). Importantly, this heteromeric complex is localized in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and 4). Large pools of Gemin3, Gemin4, and Gemin5 also exist without SMN (11Carissimi C. Baccon J. Straccia M. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Gemin3 and Gemin4 were previously found to associate with Argonaute proteins and micro-RNAs (36Mourelatos Z. Dostie J. Paushkin S. Sharma A. Charroux B. Abel L. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that several components of the SMN complex are part of additional multiprotein complexes and likely perform important cellular functions outside the SMN complex. Alterations in the expression and association of Gemin proteins with SMN, as is the case in cells of spinal muscular atrophy patients that have reduced levels of SMN, might therefore influence multiple cellular pathways either directly or indirectly. Although future studies are needed to shed light on these possibilities, it is conceivable that individual components and preformed multiprotein subunits with distinct functional properties are brought together by SMN to carry out specific tasks in the snRNP biogenesis pathway. To do so, SMN interacts directly with a subset of Gemin proteins (13Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here, we uncovered a novel direct interaction between SMN and Gemin8 that, together with Gemin8 binding to the Gemin6/Gemin7 heterodimer (10Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), is important for the association of Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip with the SMN complex (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, the SMN complex is a dynamic platform for multiple interactions, and Gemin8 is essential for its structural integrity. The SMN complex mediates Sm core formation by specifically bringing Sm proteins and snRNAs in close spatial proximity (13Yong J. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 226-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Gemin5 is responsible for the interaction of the SMN complex with snRNAs (29Battle D.J. Lau C.K. Wan L. Deng H. Lotti F. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Direct binding of SMN and several Gemin proteins to distinct subsets of Sm proteins is thought to account for the association of the SMN complex with the seven Sm proteins (4Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 9Baccon J. Pellizzoni L. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions are mostly based on in vitro binding studies, and it is unknown which of these interactions contribute to the association of Sm proteins and to snRNP assembly in vivo. The interaction between SMN and Sm proteins has been characterized in detail. High-affinity SMN binding to the arginine- and glycine-rich domains at the carboxyl terminus of SmB, SmD1, and SmD3 proteins requires SMN oligomerization and the Tudor domain (37Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 39Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, symmetrical dimethylation of specific arginines by the PRMT5 complex strongly enhances SMN affinity for the arginine- and glycine-rich domains of Sm proteins (40Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 41Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that SMN itself plays a crucial role in the recruitment of Sm proteins to the SMN complex. Here, we have shown that Gemin8 knockdown impairs the SMN complex association with Sm proteins and snRNP assembly activity (Figs. 7 and 8). Because Gemin8 does not bind Sm proteins in vitro (10Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is most likely that the reduced interaction with Sm proteins is because of the loss of the SMN complex association with Gemin6, Gemin7, and Unrip upon Gemin8 knockdown. Consistent with this possibility, it has been shown that both Gemin6 and Gemin7 have an Sm protein-like structure, which may facilitate the binding and/or organization of Sm proteins with the SMN complex in preparation for snRNP assembly (42Ma Y. Dostie J. Dreyfuss G. Van Duyne G.D. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 883-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In principle, it is possible that the reduced association of Sm proteins with the SMN complex might reflect a change in the methylation status of Sm proteins upon Gemin8 knockdown. Several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. First, both Gemin8 and the Gemin6-Gemin7-Unrip complex do not associate with pICln or the PRMT5 complex (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Second, decreased Gemin8 expression does not affect Sm protein interaction with the PRMT5 complex (Fig. 8C). Third, no reduction in the methylation of SmB is detected upon Gemin8 knockdown by Western blot analysis with the monoclonal antibody Y12 (10Carissimi C. Saieva L. Baccon J. Chiarella P. Maiolica A. Sawyer A. Rappsilber J. Pellizzoni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which recognizes the symmetrically dimethylated arginine- and glycine-rich domains of Sm proteins. One possible view is that the SMN complex relies on both the SMN protein, which interacts with the symmetrically dimethylated arginine- and glycine-rich domains of Sm proteins, and the Gemin6/Gemin7/Gemin8/Unrip heteromeric subunit to efficiently bind Sm proteins in vivo. Surprisingly, however, loss of symmetrical dimethylation of Sm proteins by genetic disruption of PRMT5 complex components in Drosophila does not affect snRNP biogenesis or function (43Gonsalvez G.B. Rajendra T.K. Tian L. Matera A.G. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1077-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that this post-translational modification is dispensable for snRNP assembly in vivo. In conclusion, our findings point to the heteromeric subunit containing Gemin6, Gemin7, Gemin8, and Unrip as a major determinant for the association of Sm proteins with the SMN complex and therefore their recruitment to the snRNP biogenesis pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1993562765,"Arnt and the homologous Arnt2 share a high degree of sequence similarity and are believed to function as obligate common partners for a number of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription factors including arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and HIFα. Genetic disruption of both Arnt and Arnt2 demonstrated both unique and overlapping functions in response to environmental stimuli and during mouse development. Either stably or transiently expressed Arnt/Arnt2 wild type and various mutants or chimeric constructs in Hepa1-c4 cells exhibit similar levels of hypoxic response element-driven reporter gene expression and the induction of endogenous <i>Glut-1</i> through binding with HIFα in response to hypoxia. In contrast, we observed clear functional differences in the ability of Arnt and Arnt2 to induce xenobiotic response element-driven reporter and endogenous <i>CYP1A1</i> gene expression. In contrast with Arnt, Arnt2 was practically incapable of interacting with ligand-activated AhR to induce the expression of target genes for xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in response to xenobiotics. The differential binding of AhR by Arnt and Arnt2 can be ascribed to a single His/Pro amino acid difference in the PASB region of Arnt and Arnt2, suggesting that the PASB/PASB interaction between bHLH-PAS transcription factors plays a selective role for their specific partner molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2064930425,"Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) constitute a distinct lineage in the globin superfamily, distantly related in size and fold to myoglobin and monomeric hemoglobins.

Recent phylogeny of the globin superfamily indicates that it contains three lineages belonging to two structural classes: one showing a 3-on-3 α-helical sandwich (animal, plant, and chimeric globins) and one having a 2-on-2 α-helical sandwich (truncated hemoglobins: trHbs). 2The abbreviations used are: trHb, truncated hemoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; Mb, myoglobin; Mt-trHbN, Mycobacterium tuberculosis trHbN; Mt-trHbO, Mycobacterium tuberculosis trHbO; Bs-trHbO, Bacillus subtilis trHbO; Cj-trHbP, Campylobacter jejuni trHbP; r.m.s., root mean square. Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the ancestral state of the globin fold, the occurrence of the 2-on-2-fold, but not of an isolated 3-on-3 fold, in all three kingdoms of life suggests that the 2-on-2 fold is the ancestral fold. On the other hand, functional studies indicate that the predominant function of globins would be enzymatic, O2 transport and storage being a specialized function associated with the evolution of metazoans (1Vinogradov S.N.

Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whose members are distinguished by the N, O, and P suffixes, respectively. Group I and group II trHbs further separate into two and four subgroups, respectively, whereas group III trHbs display a high level of overall conservation. Sequence identity between trHbs from different groups is low (≤20% overall identity), but may be higher than 80% within a given group. TrHbs are largely present in eubacteria, with some bacteria displaying more than one trHb belonging to different groups. Analysis of the distribution of trHbs suggested a scenario for the evolution of the different groups where the group II trHb gene is the ancestral gene, and group I and group III genes are the results of duplications and transfer events (3Vuletich D.A. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At present, four trHbs from group I and two from group II have been structurally characterized (4Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Giangiacomo L. Ilari A. Boffi A. Morea V. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9192-9202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that specific residue deletions and substitutions distributed throughout the trHb sequence allow the achievement of the simplified fold, whereas granting enough affinity for the heme, and ligand access to the heme-iron atom. Among sequence peculiarities, two Gly-Gly sequence motifs have been deemed necessary for stabilization of the trHb fold in groups I and II, and identified in their related amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) (3Vuletich D.A. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 4Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies also showed that, in contrast to animal and plant globins, residues building the distal heme cavity of trHbs may vary considerably between groups and even between subgroups. Thus, except for the Phe(B9) 3Amino acid residues have been labeled using their three-letter codes, the sequence numbering (in parentheses), and the topological site they occupy within the globin fold; topological site identification has been omitted for most inter-helical residues. -Tyr(B10) pair commonly found, other residues lining the heme distal pocket are not conserved in trHbs. The proximal His(F8), which binds the heme iron, is the only truly invariant residues in trHbs (Fig. 1) (2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Vuletich D.A. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All trHbs investigated so far bind O2, although with affinity ranging from nanomolar to micromolar. TrHbs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt-trHbN) and Campylobacter jejuni (Cj-trHbP) have been deeply investigated for their function. Studies performed with Mycobacterium bovis Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrated that inactivation of the glbN gene impairs the ability of stationary phase cells to protect aerobic respiration from •NO inhibition, suggesting that trHbN may play a vital role in protecting M. tuberculosis from •NO toxicity in vivo. This functional assessment is supported by the observation that trHbN catalyzes the rapid oxidation of •NO into nitrate (trHbN-Fe2+O2 + •NO → trHbN-Fe3+ + NO3- ) with a second-order rate constant of 745 μm-1 s-1 (10Ouellet H. Ouellet Y. Richard C. Labarre M. Wittenberg B. Wittenberg J. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5902-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mt-TrHbN has also been shown to protect Escherichia coli against nitrosative stress (11Pathania R. Navani N.K. Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. Dikshit K.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a trHbP defective C. jejuni was found disadvantaged with respect to wild-type cells when grown under high aeration, achieving lower growth yields and consuming O2 at approximately half the rate displayed by wild-type cells. Interestingly, Cj-trHbP mutated cells did not show increased sensitivity to •NO or oxidative stresses. It has been proposed that Cj-trHbP may play a role in cell respiration (12Wainwright L.M. Elvers K.T. Park S.F. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4079-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inspection of the available group III trHb amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) indicates the absence of the Gly-Gly motifs, and a series of specific residue substitutions that fit only moderately on the sequence/structure scheme developed for groups I and II. On the other hand, analysis of 24 group III trHb amino acid sequences indicates a high level of residue conservation within this group, higher than within group I and group II trHbs (3Vuletich D.A. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on the above considerations, the interest for structural characterization of a prototype group III trHb has grown substantially in the last few years, also considering that, in light of the sequence conservation reported above, it would allow generalization of structural properties to several of the known group III trHb sequences. C. jejuni is a Gram-negative micro-aerophilic enteric micro-organism, which is often the predominant pathogenic agent in bacterial gastrointestinal disease. It possesses two distinct hemoglobins encoded by the Ctb and Cgb genes, coding for a group III trHb, and a single domain “classic” globin, respectively (12Wainwright L.M. Elvers K.T. Park S.F. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4079-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In line with our continuous research activity on structure to function relationships in the trHb family, we present here the results of a crystallographic investigation on C. jejuni trHbP in its cyano-met form, at 2.15-Å resolution. We show that the main features of the trHb fold in C. jejuni trHbP are closer than expected to those observed for group II trHbOs. Structural features likely representative of group III trHbs are an extended C-helix, the presence of specific Trp residues, and the absence of a ligand diffusion protein matrix tunnel previously characterized in group I, and partly in group II trHbs. Our crystal structure suggests that ligand entry into the heme distal site is likely supported by the classical His(E7)-gating mechanism (14Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Cj-trHbP—Genomic DNA from C. jejuni NCTC11168 was kindly provided by Professor Sir Alec J. Jeffrey from University of Leicester (United Kingdom). We used the PCR to amplify the coding region of Cj-trHbP. The DNA primers used were (5′-CGCCTCCATATGAAATTTGAAACAATTAATC-3′, upper primer) and (5′-ATGGATCCAAAATTGCCAAATTAATGTCC-3′, lower primer). The NdeI-BamHI digested PCR fragment was cloned into the pET3a prokaryotic expression vector and the recombinant protein was expressed in freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 2-liter flasks containing 850 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 67 μg/ml of FeCl3, and 10 μg/ml of hemin chloride until the absorption at 600 nm reached 0.5-0.8, at which point they were incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and conserved at -80 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended with 0.02 volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and DNase I (10 units/g). The cells were disrupted by passing them twice through a French pressure cell operated at 20,000 p.s.i., cooled at 4 °C. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was then fractionated with ammonium sulfate (40-80% saturation). The precipitate was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min, then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA and dialyzed against the same buffer (3 times with 5 liters) overnight at 4 °C in 6-8-kDa molecular mass cutoff membranes (Spectrapor). The dialysate was loaded onto a XK 26/40 column of 135 ml of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (1350 ml) of 50-200 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, buffer, containing 50 μm EDTA at 4 °C. Fractions with a 410/280 nm ratio >1.2 were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (95% saturation). The protein sample was then dissolved in 1-2 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The protein sample was passed through a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 gel-filtration column (prep grade, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA and 300 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Fractions with a 410/280 nm ratio >2.5 were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (95% saturation), and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA. The protein was oxidized using 10-fold molar excess potassium ferricyanide. After completion of the reaction, the protein was desalted over a phosphate-6-dehydrogenase (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA. For crystallographic studies the cyano-met form was obtained by incubating the protein with 10 mm KCN. The protein was then loaded onto a Resource Q 6-ml column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient (120 ml) of 0-200 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 10 mm KCN and 50 mm EDTA at 4 °C. Fractions with a 410/280 nm ratio >2.5 were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, as described above, and were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 50 μm EDTA overnight at 4 °C. The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The heme was identified and quantified by the pyridine-hemochrome method. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of C. jejuni trHbP was achieved using the hanging drop vapor diffusion setup. The protein solution, at 35 mg/ml concentration was equilibrated against a precipitant solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4-5, at 277 K. Large single crystals grew within a few weeks. They were stored in a stabilizing solution containing 2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4-5, and then transferred to the same solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, immediately prior to cryo-cooling and data collection. The crystals diffract up to 2.15-Å resolution, using synchrotron radiation (beamline ID29, ESRF, Grenoble, France), and belong to the trigonal P3221, or P3121, space group with unit cell parameters: a = 95.6 Å, b = 95.6 Å, c = 65.4 Å. The VM value is 2.9 Å3 Da-1, with 57.1% solvent content, assuming two trHbP molecules (2 × 14937.2 Da). Alternatively, bunches of thin plates grew in about 2-3 weeks (each plate having typical dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.005 mm3) using a precipitant solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 2.0 m NaCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5-7.5, at 277 K. The crystals were stored in a stabilizing solution containing 2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 2.0 m NaCl, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5-7.5; they were transferred to the same solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, immediately prior to data collection (at 100 K). These crystals diffracted up to 2.5-Å resolution using synchrotron radiation (beamline ID14-3, ESRF, Grenoble, France), and were characterized as belonging to the monoclinic space group P21, with unit cell parameters: a = 68.3 Å, b = 39.5 Å, c = 68.6 Å, β = 102.8°. The VM value is 3.0 Å3 Da-1, with 59% solvent content, assuming two trHbP molecules per asymmetric unit. All collected data were reduced and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA, respectively (15Leslie A.G.M. MOSFLM User Guide.

The crystal structure of truncated group II trHbO from Bacillus subtilis (Protein Data Bank code 1UX8) (9Giangiacomo L. Ilari A. Boffi A. Morea V. Chiancone E. J. Biol.

The rotational and translational searches run in the 40-3.5-Å resolution range yielded a prominent solution for a dimeric molecule (solving the space group ambiguity in favor of P3221). After rigid body refinement of this solution (moving independently all the helices and the heme group in each monomer), the final correlation coefficient and R-factor values were 30.0 and 50.2%, respectively (at 2.15-Å resolution). Several cycles of manual rebuilding, using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

At the end of the refinement stages, 93 water molecules, 2 acetate, and 4 sulfate ions were located through inspection of difference Fourier maps, using the program O.

At the end of the refinement stages, 15 water molecules were located through inspection of difference Fourier maps, using the program O. The final R-factor value was 21.9% and R-free 26.6% (Table 2). The programs Procheck (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and Surfnet (22Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) were used to assess the stereochemical quality of the protein structures and explore the protein matrix cavities. The program PISA (23Krissinel E. Henrick K. Berthold M.R. Glen R. Diederichs K. Kohlbacher O. Fischer I. Detection of Protein Assemblies in Crystals. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2005: 163-174Google Scholar) was used to identify putative quaternary assemblies within the crystal unit cell. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (24Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar), with entry codes 2IG3 and r2IG3sf, respectively. Quality of the Model—The structure of Cj-trHbP was solved on crystals belonging to the trigonal space group P3221 (two molecules per asymmetric unit, referred to as A and B, respectively) by means of molecular replacement, based on the model of group II trHbO from B. subtilis (PDB code 1UX8) (9Giangiacomo L. Ilari A. Boffi A. Morea V. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9192-9202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Cj-trHbP structure was refined at 2.15-Å resolution, to final R-factor and R-free values of 20.6 and 26.2%, respectively, with ideal stereochemical parameters (Table 2). His46(E7) displays a double conformation in chain B; additionally, in this chain no electron density is observed for the last two C-terminal residues. Superposition of 122 Cα atoms of the two independent Cj-trHbP chains (excluding the last C-terminal 5 residues) yields a r.m.s. deviation of 0.43 Å. All results discussed below apply to both chains A and B unless otherwise stated. Additionally, crystals of the Cj-trHbP, grown in the P21 space group (two molecules per asymmetric unit), were also analyzed and refined against a 2.5-Å resolution data set, yielding R-factor and R-free values of 21.9 and 26.6%, respectively, with ideal stereochemical parameters (Table 2). Superposition of 127 Cα atoms of the two independent molecules yields a r.m.s. deviation of 0.19 Å. Comparison of the Cj-trHbP structures from the monoclinic and trigonal crystal forms yielded r.m.s. deviations in the 0.36-0.38-Å range, for 122 Cα atoms (excluding the last C-terminal 5 residues), depending on the chains superposed. Overall Structural Properties—Cj-trHbP shows the typical features of the 2-on-2 α-helical trHb-fold (2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol.

Despite the considerable divergence evident in the amino acid sequences of the whole trHb family (Fig. 1), the above comparative structural analysis stress the conservation of the 2-on-2 trHb fold, but it also highlights some key structural properties of group III proteins. Among these, helix A is completely absent in Cj-trHbP, and the N-terminal backbone runs, in an extended conformation, in the opposite direction relative to the corresponding region in group I and II trHbs (Fig. 2, B and C). Such peculiar orientation of the Cj-trHbP pre-B region is supported by hydrogen bonding interactions between Phe3 O-Asn99 NH, Phe3 NH-Val97(G19) O, and Lys2 NZ-Asn95(G17) O atoms, being structurally related to the absence of Gly-Gly sequence motifs at the AB and EF interhelical hinges of group III trHbs (supplemental materials Fig. S1A). Given that the observed conformation of the pre-A region is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds in an otherwise solvent-exposed environment, additional conformations dynamically accessible to this N-terminal region cannot be excluded (6Falzone C.J. Vu B.C. Scott N.L. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Gly-based motifs are instead conserved, and are key sequence markers, in group I and II trHbs (Fig. 1) (2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Vuletich D.A. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 62: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), where they help stabilize the short A helix in a conformation locked onto helices B and E (supplemental materials Fig. S1B) (4Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Milani M. Pesce A. Ouellet Y. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3902-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In Cj-trHbP such a stabilizing interaction is lost because the first residue of the modified Gly-Gly motif in the EF hinge is Leu59, whose side chain fills the spatial location occupied by the side chain of Tyr/Phe A12 in group I and II trHbs (supplemental materials Fig. S1). However, stabilizing interactions between the B and E helices are granted by an extended distribution of hydrophobic residues at the B/E helical interface (supplemental materials Fig. S1A). Furthermore, the absence of the Gly-Gly motif at the AB hinge of Cj-trHbP does not provide the backbone flexibility required to direct the N terminus toward the BE interhelical region, thus forcing the protein residues preceding the B helix to extend toward the GH region. A unique structural feature of group III trHbs is a 3-7-amino acid insertion located between the C and E helices (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, such elongation of the CD region in Cj-trHbP does not shift the position of helix E relative to the heme distal site. Rather, it affects the span of the C and E helices, which relative to the corresponding helices in group I and II trHb structures, gain one C-terminal and one N-terminal turn, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, the protein structure in the short region comprised between the C and E helices deviates markedly (up to 7.5 Å) in the three trHb groups. Additionally, in Cj-trHbP the C helix displays a clear α-helical character, as compared with the 310 helical character commonly displayed not only by group I and II trHbs but also by vertebrate globins (14Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, juxtaposition of the C and E helices is granted by a bifurcated hydrogen bond connecting the group III conserved Trp43(E4) NE1 to Asn33 OD1, and to Gly37 O; the Trp43(E4) indole side chain is shielded from the solvent region by the Arg23(B14) NH1-Asp40(E1) OD1 salt b"
https://openalex.org/W2151300113,"We recently showed that the up-regulation of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) pathway in the midbrain, is the molecular mechanism by which the putative anti-addiction drug Ibogaine mediates its desirable action of reducing alcohol consumption. Human reports and studies in rodents have shown that a single administration of Ibogaine results in a long-lasting reduction of drug craving (humans) and drug and alcohol intake (rodents). Here we determine whether, and how, Ibogaine exerts its long-lasting actions on GDNF expression and signaling. Using the dopaminergic-like SHSY5Y cell line as a culture model, we observed that short-term Ibogaine exposure results in a sustained increase in GDNF expression that is mediated via the induction of a long-lasting autoregulatory cycle by which GDNF positively regulates its own expression. We show that the initial exposure of cells to Ibogaine or GDNF results in an increase in GDNF mRNA, leading to protein expression and to the corresponding activation of the GDNF signaling pathway. This, in turn, leads to a further increase in the mRNA level of the growth factor. The identification of a GDNF-mediated, autoregulatory long-lasting feedback loop could have important implications for GDNF's potential value as a treatment for addiction and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2001643087,"Heme oxygenases catalyze the oxidation of heme to biliverdin, CO, and free iron. For pathogenic microorganisms, heme uptake and degradation are critical mechanisms for iron acquisition that enable multiplication and survival within hosts they invade. Here we report the first crystal structure of the pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 heme oxygenase ChuS in complex with heme at 1.45 Å resolution. When compared with other heme oxygenases, ChuS has a unique fold, including structural repeats and a β-sheet core. Not surprisingly, the mode of heme coordination by ChuS is also distinct, whereby heme is largely stabilized by residues from the C-terminal domain, assisted by a distant arginine from the N-terminal domain. Upon heme binding, there is no large conformational change beyond the fine tuning of a key histidine (His-193) residue. Most intriguingly, in contrast to other heme oxygenases, the propionic side chains of heme are orientated toward the protein core, exposing the α-meso carbon position where O2 is added during heme degradation. This unique orientation may facilitate presentation to an electron donor, explaining the significantly reduced concentration of ascorbic acid needed for the reaction. Based on the ChuS-heme structure, we converted the histidine residue responsible for axial coordination of the heme group to an asparagine residue (H193N), as well as converting a second histidine to an alanine residue (H73A) for comparison purposes. We employed spectral analysis and CO measurement by gas chromatography to analyze catalysis by ChuS, H193N, and H73A, demonstrating that His-193 is the key residue for the heme-degrading activity of ChuS.

Iron is an essential cofactor whose role as a biocatalyst or electron carrier enables organisms to fulfill many vital biological processes including respiration, the citric acid cycle, oxygen transport and utilization, gene regulation, and DNA biosynthesis (1McHugh J.P. Rodriguez-Quinones F. Abdul-Tehrani H. Svistunenko D.A. Poole R.K. Cooper C.E. Andrews S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29478-29486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). For bacteria invading mammalian hosts, iron acquisition, transport, and utilization are essential for survival and pathogenesis. However, due to the low solubility of iron(III) salts at physiological pH in the presence of oxygen, iron uptake, storage, and transport are considerable obstacles for invading bacteria to overcome. Enterohemorrhagic pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 may induce hemolytic lesions to gain access to host nutrient stores, such as heme, the most abundant source of invertebrate host iron (2Law D. Kelly J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 700-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, growth of O157 isolated from human patients is stimulated in the presence of heme and hemoglobin, suggesting that heme may be an important signaling molecule for the up-regulation of factors contributing to host colonization and virulence (2Law D. Kelly J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 700-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The proteins involved in heme internalization by enterohemorrhagic pathogens have been shown to involve homologues to members of the heme utilization locus (3Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Using a laboratory strain of E. coli (1017 (ent::Tn5)) that was unable to import heme into the cytoplasm, it was established that the outer membrane receptor ChuA was required for heme uptake along with TonB, an energy-transducing protein associated with ExbB and ExbD, forming a complex that uses the proton motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane for the transport of ligands into the periplasm (4Torres A.G. Payne S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Four other members of the heme uptake operon from Yersinia enterocolitica were shown to be required to complete heme uptake, transport, and use as an iron source by E. coli K-12 (3Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) including: the periplasmic heme-binding protein HemT, the heme permease protein HemU, the ATP-binding hydrophilic protein HemV, and the protein HemS, whose role was supposed to have been involved in regulating the amount of non-protein-associated heme in the cell (5Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These Y. enterocolitica are homologous to members of the E. coli O157:H7 heme utilization locus chuT, chuU, chuV, and chuS, respectively.We recently reported the crystal structure of apo-ChuS and confirmed via spectral analysis and CO measurement that ChuS was an HO, 3The abbreviation used is: HO, heme oxygenase. 3The abbreviation used is: HO, heme oxygenase. the first to be identified in any strain of E. coli (6Suits M.D. Pal G.P. Nakatsu K. Matte A. Cygler M. Jia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16955-16960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A Shigella dysenteriae chromosomal knock-out of shuS, a homologue to chuS, was shown to be defective in utilizing heme as an iron source, and expression of ShuS was up-regulated when challenged with iron-limiting conditions (7Wyckoff E.E. Lopreato G.F. Tipton K.A. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, shuS was implicated to have a cytoprotective role against heme toxicity in that growth of the shuS knock-out mutant was impaired at intermediate concentrations of heme (15 μm) and that shuS was absolutely required for colony growth at high heme concentrations (40 μm) (7Wyckoff E.E. Lopreato G.F. Tipton K.A. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that ChuS and its homologues are up-regulated under iron-limiting conditions and that ChuS activity enables pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 to use heme as an iron source, whereas conferring a cytoprotective role in the prevention of heme toxicity. It appears very probable that ChuS is an essential protein in heme utilization by various pathogenic, enterohemorrhagic bacteria.The crystal structures of HOs from other Gram-negative bacteria such as HemO (8Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), HmuO (9Hirotsu S. Chu G.C. Unno M. Lee D.S. Yoshida T. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Ikeda-Saito M. J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5239-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) all share a high structural similarity with human HO-1 (11Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); they are mainly α-helical, and the heme is sandwiched between a histidine residue and a glycine residue. However, the structure of ChuS revealed a unique architecture when compared with other HOs in that it contains a central set of antiparallel β-sheets and that the N- and C-terminal halves are structural repeats. In light of the identification of ChuS as a novel HO and its unique overall structure, it was of interest to elucidate the mechanism of its heme binding and degradation. To this end, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of ChuS in complex with heme to 1.45 Å resolution. We have further performed site-directed mutagenesis of the histidine residue (His-193) (shown in the crystal structure to be responsible for axial coordination of the heme group within ChuS) to an asparagine (H193N) and of another conserved histidine residue (His-73) to an alanine (H73A) as a control. Using spectral analysis and CO measurement by gas chromatography to analyze heme degradation catalyzed by ChuS, H193N, and H73A, we have demonstrated that His-193 is a key residue for the heme-degrading activity of ChuS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification, Site-directed Mutagenesis—ChuS fused to an N-terminal His6-tag was subcloned into a pET expression vector. Based on the complex structure and sequence conservation analysis, the mutations of H73A and H193N of ChuS were selected (6Suits M.D. Pal G.P. Nakatsu K. Matte A. Cygler M. Jia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16955-16960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), wild-type ChuS was mutated at these two histidine positions using the following primers, where base pair changes have been underlined: H73A, sense, 5′-CGTAATGAATATGCAGTCGCGGAGCAAGTTGGTACG-3′, antisense, 5′-CGTACCAACTTGCTCCGCGACTGCATATTCATTACG-3′, and H93N, sense, 5′-GGGCGATGACCGACGTTAATCAGTTTTTTACGTTGCTCAAG-3′, antisense, 5′-GAGCAACGTAAAAAACTGATTAACGTCGGTCATCGCCC-3′. Briefly, polymerase chain reaction conditions and cycling parameters recommended by Stratagene (12Liu Q. Swiderski P. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 33. 134-136, 1382002: 129-132Google Scholar) were followed using Pfu Turbo polymerase for 30 cycles between 30 s, 95 °C melt, 60 s, 55 °C anneal, and 9 min, 68 °C extend. Methylated (non-PCR amplified) DNA was then digested with DpnI restriction enzyme for 1 h, and the digested DNA was heat shock-transformed into MC1061 cells. Transformed cells were subsequently plated onto LB-agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Single colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of Terrific Broth (Bioshop, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (TB-amp). Plasmid DNA was purified by means of a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was transformed into BL21(DE3), and the desired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis (Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada).Cultures (1 liter) of BL21(DE3) cells carrying plasmids for the respective recombinant protein were grown at 37 °C in TB-amp. Protein expression was induced at a culture A600 between 0.6 and 1.0 using 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 5 h. ChuS, H73A, and H193N were then purified via nickel nitrilotriacetate agarose batch purification in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and dialyzed overnight in 30 mm Tris, 5 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Overexpression of ChuS and H73A resulted in cells exhibiting a blue-green pigment that is characteristic of biliverdin accumulation (8Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J.

ChuS, H73A, and H193N all expressed at high levels (>20 mg/liter culture depending on batch) and were soluble in Tris (pH 8.0) or phosphate (pH 7.0) buffers following nickel nitrilotriacetate agarose purification. Purification of each protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and each was estimated to be >95% pure prior to spectral analysis, CO measurement, or heme reconstitution. H193N and H73A were subsequently dialyzed twice more to eliminate any residual imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in 96-well format, using bovine-γ-globulin as a protein standard.ChuS-Heme Reconstitution—The ChuS-heme complex was prepared by dissolving heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride) (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) into 0.5% (v/v) ethanolamine for 30 min and then into 30 mm Tris, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0. Small volumes of this mixture were then added to dialyzed ChuS until a final ratio of 4:1 heme to protein was reached. The ChuS-heme mixture was then incubated for 15 min, centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min in a JA-20 Beckman Coulter rotor (Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and purified using a Resource Q column on an ATKA Explorer fast protein liquid chromatography system with 30 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl (pH 8.0) as the elution buffer. Collected fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and those that were evaluated to contain pure protein were pooled. Pure ChuS was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 15-kDa cutoff centrifugal filtration device (Fisher, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and used immediately for crystallization. Reconstituted ChuS-heme complex concentrations were determined by using the extinction coefficient reported for ShuS (ϵ410) of 159 mm-1 cm-1 for ChuS (15Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Crystallization of ChuS-Heme—ChuS-heme crystals were obtained only by means of the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC), using freshly prepared protein and reagents. Crystallization was achieved by mixing 1.75 μl of 20 mg/ml ChuS-heme with 1.75 μl of chilled reservoir solution consisting of 12-15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.15-0.20 m magnesium formate, and 10-20 mm NAD. Crystallization plates were incubated in the dark at 4 °C, with both hexagonal and triangular prism crystals appearing after 1-3 days. For cryoprotection, crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution containing ethylene glycol (concentration increased stepwise to 30% (v/v)), picked up using a nylon loop, and flash-cooled in the N2 cold stream at 100 K. Two crystal forms belonging to space groups P65 and R3 were obtained whose morphologies were hexagonal and triangular prism, respectively.Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data of the P65 and R3 crystals were collected at beam line X29 equipped with an ADSC Quantum-315, nine-quadrant, CCD detector at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. For both the P65 and the R3 crystals, data were collected for 180° (0.5 and 1.0° oscillations, respectively) at the wavelength 1.100 Å. Data were processed with HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (see Table 1), and the structure of the R3 crystal was solved via molecular replacement using the program Phaser (17Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) with apo-ChuS (Protein Data Bank ID code 1U9T) as the initial probe structure. Although the P65 crystals diffracted beyond 2.0 Å resolution, due to the long unit cell dimensions and resulting spot proximity, diffraction was only collected to 2.7 Å. The heme moiety was manually placed in the ChuS structure according to the difference density in both space groups. The ChuS-heme complex structure in the R3 space group was completed by iterative cycles of manually fitting using XtalView/Xfit (18McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and refinement using Refmac5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Coordinates and structure factors for ChuS-heme have been deposited in the RSCB Protein Data Bank under accession code 2HQ2. Due to lower resolution and poor data quality in regions along the long axes, the P65 complex structure was not further refined beyond confirming the heme position.TABLE 1Diffraction data and refinement statisticsSpace groupP65R3Cell dimensionsa = b (Å)58.4106.5c (Å)390.090.2α = β (°)9090γ (°)120120No. of molecules in ASUaASU, asymmetric unit21λ (Å)1.1001.100Resolution range50-2.750-1.45Total reflectionsbNumber of reflections following merging92612361180Unique reflectionsbNumber of reflections following merging2072467663Completeness (%)cValues in parentheses are for the outermost shell (P65: 2.81-2.70 Å, and R3: 1.50-1.45 Å)85.2 (97.0)98.7 (98.4)Rsym (I) (%)10.06.7I/σIbNumber of reflections following merging23.9 (14.8)38 (1.8)RefinementResolution range (Å)50-1.45Rwork (%)17.05Rfree (%)19.30No. of reflections unique/Rfree63392/3371No. of atoms, protein/heme/solvent (H2O)/total2606/45/354/3005B factors (Å2) protein/heme/solvent/total21.4/24.3/32.2/22.7r.m.s.dr.m.s., root mean square, bond length (Å)/bond angle (°)0.0199/1.894Protein Data Bank accession code 2HQ2a ASU, asymmetric unitb Number of reflections following mergingc Values in parentheses are for the outermost shell (P65: 2.81-2.70 Å, and R3: 1.50-1.45 Å)d r.m.s., root mean square Open table in a new tab Spectral Analysis and CO Measurements—Reconstitution of ChuS, H73A, and H193N with heme was achieved by dissolving heme into 0.5% (v/v) ethanolamine and diluted into phosphate buffer just prior to mixing with 10 μm protein samples to a final ratio of 1:1 protein to heme. Absorbance data were collected after a 15-min incubation at room temperature in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Heme degradation was initiated in parallel by adding ascorbic acid to a final concentration of 50 μm, and spectra were recorded between 300 and 700 nm at 5-nm intervals.For CO measurement, in 2-ml amber vials, 250-μl reaction volumes of 10 μm heme and 10 μm ChuS, H73A, or H193N in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were incubated with constant shaking at room temperature for 15 min, at which time enzymatic heme degradation was initiated by adding ascorbic acid to a final concentration of 50 μm. The amber vials were then sealed with screw caps and blue silicone rubber septa, the headspace above each was immediately purged with CO-free air, and the vials were incubated for 25 min at 37 °C with constant shaking. The reaction was stopped by placing the vials on powdered dry ice (-78 °C), where they remained for ∼30 min. The amount of liberated CO in the headspace of each vial was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with an HgO reduction detector (Trace Analytical). The amount of CO resulting from ChuS-catalyzed breakdown of heme was determined by comparing n = 3 peak area measurements for CO against linear CO standard curves (n = 2 determinations; average correlation coefficient, 0.9859). Technical details of CO detection are described elsewhere (21Vreman H.J. Kwong L.K. Stevenson D.K. Clin. Chem. 1984; 30: 1382-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Cook M.N. Nakatsu K.

In the sitting drop vapor diffusion setup, two different crystal forms of ChuS-heme were obtained from the same set of crystallization conditions over the same time period, but they differed dramatically in their morphology. In the case of the P65 crystals, which appeared more frequently at room temperature, the crystals appeared as broad (>1 mm), flat, hexagonal plates. Crystals belonging to the R3 space group appeared as clusters of long (>1 mm) triangular prisms and diffracted to 1.45 Å resolution. Crystals from the P65 space group contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit, whereas those belonging to the R3 space group contained only one.The final structure of ChuS-heme complex contains residues 0-337 of a total 354 amino acids including the His6 affinity tag for the R3 space group (Fig. 1). In total, 100% of residues are within the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Only one residue, Ala-96, was in the generously allowed region and resides just prior to a surface-exposed β-turn. Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.The ChuS-heme complex structure is very close to that of apo-ChuS (all-atom root mean square deviation, 1.69 Å). The overall structure comprises a central core of two large pleated β-sheets, each consisting of nine anti-parallel β-strands sandwiched together and bowing outward in a saddle motif (Fig. 1). Each β-sheet is flanked at its N terminus by one pair of parallel α-helices and at the C terminus by three α-helices in an α-loop-α-loop-α motif, forming a structural repeat. When ChuS-heme is superimposed with apo-ChuS, the only notable structural change is that the two α-helices N-terminal of His-193 have shifted toward the core of the protein (e.g. C-α of His-193 has shifted by 3.58 Å), resulting in the appropriate orientation of this key histidine residue for heme coordination (see following section and Fig. 1, inset).Heme Binding—The heme group is coordinated in a cleft region delineated between His-193 at the base of a C-terminal α-helix and Arg-100 from the central set of β-sheets at the core of ChuS (Fig. 1). A network of hydrogen bonds is formed between Arg-100 and the iron atom of the heme group via two water molecules with distances of 2.93, 2.17, and 1.93 Å, respectively (Fig. 2). In this cleft, the heme group is stabilized by the non-polar residues Leu-90, Leu-92, Phe-102, Val-192, and Phe-243, and the polar residues Arg-100, His-193, Arg-206, Met-241, Lys-291, Gln-313, Tyr-315, and Arg-318 (Fig. 2). In contrast to other HOs, the propionic side chains of the heme moiety in ChuS are rotated ∼110°, pointing toward the interior of one of the structural lobes formed between the two halves of ChuS, and are stabilized by the positively charged side chains Arg-206, Lys-291, and Arg-318 (Fig. 2). These interactions are probably important in maintaining the correct orientation of heme within ChuS. The burying of the propionic side chains exposes the α-meso carbon of the heme group, which is where O2 is selectively added during heme degradation in HO reactions. Although the P65 data were of lower quality, the identical heme position in this structure was unmistakable (not shown). The heme orientation in ChuS is unique when compared with other HOs, such as HO-1, in which the propionic side chains point outward (23Schuller D.J. Ortiz de Wilks A. Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), although the heme-degrading enzymes IsdG/IsdI may bind heme with the propionic side chains pointing inward (24Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Difference omit map for the heme moiety and two water molecules (blue) within the active site pocket of ChuS contoured at 2σ in the R3 space group. Heme and waters were omitted from refinement prior to map calculations. Residues contributing to heme stabilization include the non-polar series Leu-90, Leu-92, Phe-102, Val-192, and Phe-243 and the polar series Arg-100, His-193, Arg-206, Met-241, Lys-291, Gln-313, Tyr-315, and Arg-318. Heme is therefore mainly coordinated by the C-terminal half but also by a distant residue, Arg-100 from the N-terminal half. A network of hydrogen bonds is formed between Arg-100 and the iron atom of the heme group via two water molecules (dotted lines). In this orientation, the propionic side chains of the heme group point toward the protein interior, exposing the α-meso carbon edge (black arrow). This presentation of the α-meso edge may facilitate electron attack during heme degradation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Essential to the heme coordination is His-193, which makes axial interaction with the central iron atom of the heme group. In ChuS, the interaction distance is 2.03 Å between the NE2 atom of His-193 and the center of the iron atom, allowing His-193 to clamp the heme firmly into place. Arg-100, from the N-terminal domain, interacts with heme via two water molecules and originates from the protein core beneath the heme group on one of the central β-sheets (Fig. 2B). These water molecules were clearly visible even at early refinement stage across multiple data sets and well defined in the final high resolution structure.Spectroscopic Properties of ChuS, H73A, and H193N in Complex with Heme—His-193 resides at the end of an α-helix, pointing into a cleft delineated by the α-helix and the core set of β-sheets, interacting directly with iron in the heme group. Thus, the mutation of His-193 was expected to inactivate the protein. On the other hand, His-73 is within the central β-sheets, pointing between the N- and C-terminal halves, and does not make contact with the heme group. Since His-73 is fully conserved but does not interact with heme, it provides a good control for His-193. As previously reported, the absorbance spectrum of native ChuS exhibits a clear Soret peak at 410 nm together with the common characteristic α/β-bands of HOs around 550 and 580 nm (6Suits M.D. Pal G.P.

However, the spectrum of the H193N mutant broadened, showed a decrease in the magnitude of absorbance, and shifted the peak absorbance to 390 nm when compared with the Soret absorption observed for ChuS and H73A. A similar trend of spectral flattening and peak shift to 625 nm was also observed for H193N in the α/β-band region.Heme Degradation by ChuS—Bacterial and mammalian HOs use the cytochrome P450 reductase-NADPH system, ferredoxin, flavodoxin, and/or ascorbic acid as reducing partners in vitro (8Zhu W.

Furthermore, catalase and superoxide dismutase were used for additional controls.

https://openalex.org/W1987410274,"Oncostatin M (OsM) is a member of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines and is well known for its role in inflammation, cell proliferation, and hematopoiesis. OsM, together with its glycoprotein 130 containing receptor complex, is expressed and regulated in most cells of the central nervous system (CNS), yet the function of OsM within this compartment is poorly understood. Here we have investigated the effect of OsM using in vitro and in vivo models of excitotoxic injury. Using primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons, OsM was shown to reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -induced neuronal death by 50% when added simultaneously with NMDA while pretreatment of neurons with OsM fully prevented NMDA toxicity indicating a profound protective effect of this cytokine. OsM was also shown to inhibit NMDA-mediated increase in levels of free intracellular calcium and to selectively reduce neuronal expression of the NR2C subunit of the NMDA receptor. Finally, using an in vivo model of excitotoxic injury, OsM significantly reduced the NMDA-induced lesion volume when coinjected with NMDA into the mouse striatum. Taken together, these results identify OsM as a powerful neuroprotective cytokine and provide a rational foundation to explore the therapeutic potential for OsM in diseases of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1969712702,"In addition to their conventional G-C/T target sequences, Sp1 family transcription factors (Sp-factors) can interact with a subset of the target sequences for NFκB. Due to the low level of bona fide NFκB activity in most resting cells, this interaction between Sp-factors and κB-sites could play important roles in cell function. Here we used mutagenesis of a canonical κB element from the immunoglobulin and HIV promoters to identify the GC-rich sequences at each end required for Sp-factor targeting. Through screening of multiple κB elements, a sequence element located in the second intron of superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) was identified as a good candidate for both NFκB and Sp-factor binding. In neurons, the prominent proteins interacting with this site were Sp3 and Sp4, whereas Sp1, Sp3, and NFκB were associated with this site in astroglia. The neuronal Sp-factors repressed transcriptional activity through this κB-site. In contrast, astroglial Sp-factors activated promoter activity through the same element. NFκB contributed to control of the SOD2 κB element only in astrocytes. These findings imply that cell-type specificity of transcription in the central nervous system, particularly with regard to κB elements, may include two unique aspects of neurons: 1) a recalcitrant NFκB and 2) the substitution of Sp4 for Sp1.

Transcription factors belonging to the family typified by Sp1 are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cell types. Sp-factors are involved in the expression of a large number of genes, including most of those known as housekeeping genes; therefore, these factors might participate in every aspect of cellular activity. Indeed, null mutation of Sp1 in mouse is embryonic lethal (1Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); similarly, mice genetically ablated for Sp3 die soon after birth (2Bouwman P. Gollner H. Elsasser H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The abnormalities arising from Sp4 ablation are most apparent in the nervous system (3Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Zhou X. Long J.M. Geyer M.A. Masliah E. Kelsoe J.R. Wynshaw-Boris A. Chien K.R. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), consistent with the finding that Sp4 expression is highly enriched in neurons (4Zhou X. Long J.M. Geyer M.A. Masliah E.

Other zinc-finger transcription factors with homology to Sp1, including Sp2, have DNA-binding preferences quite distinct from those for Sp1, -3, and -4 (7Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that Sp-factors are not redundant in their roles and that none is dispensable. Abundant evidence shows that each Sp-factor possesses discrete functional properties (8Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 is generally considered a transcriptional activator, although an inhibitory region has recently been mapped in its extreme amino terminus (7Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9Lee J.A. Suh D.C. Kang J.E. Kim M.H. Park H. Lee M.N. Kim J.M. Jeon B.N. Roh H.E. Yu M.Y. Choi K.Y. Kim K.Y. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28061-28071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sp3 can be an activator or inhibitor dependent on its translation initiation sites, post-translational modifications, and the sequence context of a given cis element (10Sapetschnig A. Koch F. Rischitor G. Mennenga T. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42095-42105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sp4 also exhibits some flexibility with regard to transactivation, but the determinants of its activity remain obscure. The importance of Sp-factors has also become manifest in two forms of human disease. Leaching Sp1 from chromatin by a CUG expansion appears to be a key step for the development of myotonic dystrophy type I (11Ebralidze A. Wang Y. Petkova V. Ebralidse K. Junghans R.P. Science. 2004; 303: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, sequestering Sp-factor activity by mutant huntington protein might be one of the primary cellular events in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (12Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 13Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M.

Apart from binding to their consensus GC- or GT-rich sequences, Sp-factors are able to bind to non-canonical sequences, in particular to some κB elements (14Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M.

In neurons, the interaction between Sp-factors and κB elements could be especially important for cell function because of the paucity and/or recalcitrance of NFκB activity in neurons (5Massa P.E. Aleyasin H. Park D.S. Mao X. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol.

The prominent proteins binding to κB elements in neurons are Sp-factors, and the activity of Sp-factors can be diminished by toxic levels of glutamate (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858PubMed Google Scholar). In mixed neuron-glia cultures, glutamate induces NFκB activity in the glia but not in the neurons; NFκB is unresponsive to glutamate in pure cultures of glia or neurons (19Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For these reasons, and to further elucidate the disparate gene-regulatory mechanisms utilized by neurons and glia, it is important to characterize in neurons the influence of Sp-factors on the transcription of genes that are responsive to NFκB in other cell types. One gene typically controlled by NFκB factors and playing an important role for cell survival is superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2 2The abbreviations used are: SOD2, superoxide dismutase-2; APP, amyloid precursor protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COX2, cyclooxygenase-2; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HIV-LTR, human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MEM, minimal essential medium (Earle's salts); MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RSI, rat SOD2 intron; TK, thymidine kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein. ; also known as manganese SOD) (23Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). SODs are a group of enzymes engaged to fend off cellular stress initiated by reactive oxygen species. SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix and plays an indispensable role in protecting cells from a myriad of insults (24Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J. Dionne Jr., L. Lu N. Huang S. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 25Fujimura M. Morita-Fujimura Y. Kawase M. Copin J.C. Calagui B. Epstein C.J. Chan P.H. J.

In many types of cells, reactive oxygen species can activate NFκB, which in turn up-regulates the compensatory expression of prosurvival genes. These may include SOD2, because its promoter contains a functional κB cis element. Interestingly, the functional κB site has been mapped into the second intron of both human and mouse SOD2 genes (23Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Kiningham K.K. Xu Y. Daosukho C. Popova B. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This intron also harbors other essential enhancer elements (C/EBP-1, C/EBP-2, and C/EBP-x) besides the κB site. Similar gene organization is found in the rat SOD2 gene, where the κB site is conserved with a slight variation from human and mouse counterparts (Table 1).TABLE 1κB-oligonucleotides used in EMSA studiesNameSequenceIg/HIV-κBAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGCmut1AGTTGAcGGGACTTTCCCAGGCmut2AGTTGAGcGGACTTTCCCAGGCmut3AGTTGAGGcGACTTTCCCAGGCmut4AGTTGAGGGcACTTTCCCAGGCκBΔCATTGGGGACTTTCCAGGCIL6AATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGAAPP1GAGACGGGGTTTCACCGTGTTAPP2GCATGGGGCTCCTCCCACCGBcl-xGGCGGGGGGGACTGCCCAGGGAGCOX-2CGGGAGAGGGGATTCCCTGCGCCMHC class ICCAGCTTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCSOD2 (rat)GAGTAGGGGAAAAGCCCAGTTGGSOD2 (human)AGACTGGGGAATACCCCAGTTGTSOD2 (mouse)AAGCAGGGGAATAGCCCAGTTGG Open table in a new tab Based on our analysis of κB sequences required for Sp-factor binding, we speculated that the SOD2-κB sequence could be an efficient site for both NFκB and Sp-factor binding. We found that the SOD2-κB site could be bound by both Sp-factors and NFκB in astrocytes, whereas in neurons the prominent binding factors were Sp3 and Sp4. Reporter assays showed that the intron was inhibitory in neurons and the κB site was solely responsible for this effect. In astrocytes, the intron acted as an activator driven by NFκB and Sp-factors (Sp1 and Sp3). Materials—The Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and the oligonucleotide (Ig/HIV-κB) containing the κB enhancer shared by the immunoglobulin light chain and the HIV-LTR was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Invitrogen supplied all other oligonucleotides. Antibodies against Rel family and Sp family proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): p50 (sc-114x), p65 (sc-372x), p52 (sc-297x), RelB (sc-226x), c-Rel (sc-71x), Sp1 (sc-59x), Sp3 (sc-644x), and Sp4 (sc-645x). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF, catalog no. 400-14) was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and glutamate were from Sigma. Most of the oligonucleotides used in EMSA are delineated in Table 1; not listed are the following: 50-14 (GTG ACG GGG AGG CCC CCA TAT), NFAT (GGA GGA AAA ACT GTT TCA TAC AGA AGG CGT), AP1 (CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA), and Oct1 (TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC CAT AGA A). Phosphothioate-modified oligonucleotides were used for Sp1 decoy (5′-CCA TAA GGG CGG GCA TTA GTC-3′) and its scrambled control (5′-GAC TGC AGT GAT CGA CTG ACG-3′). Cell Cultures—Primary neuronal cultures were established from the neocortices of 18-day Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (21Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (both from Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. This serum-free medium combined with a transient (first 5 days) exposure to the mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (3–10 μm) achieved cultures that were at least 99% neurons (19Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All neuronal cultures used in this study were 8–10 days in vitro. Astrocyte cultures were established from Sprague-Dawley rat postnatal day 2 and maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented to 10% with fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), as described previously (19Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After reaching confluency, the astrocytes were denuded of microglia by shaking and vigorous lavage; the remaining cells had a morphology consistent with type I astrocytes and were subcultured for experiments by trypsinization. The NT2 (NTera2/D1) human neural-lineage teratocarcinoma cell line was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The T98G human astroglioma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); the N9 mouse microglial cell line was described previously (30Barger S.W. Harmon A.D. Nature. 1997; 388: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell lines were maintained in MEM plus 10% FBS. NT2 cells were differentiated according to the rapid, neurosphere protocol developed by Cheung et al. (31Cheung W.M. Fu W.Y. Hui W.S. Ip N.Y. BioTechniques. 26. 950–952, 9541999: 946-948Google Scholar). Specifically, the NT2 cells were grown in suspension and treated with retinoic acid (10 μm) for 14 days, followed by another 5 days of enrichment with arabinoside (1 μm) and uridine (10 μm) in Neurobasal/B27 medium; most cells were morphologically consistent with mature neurons after enrichment. Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells were maintained at room temperature in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. Plasmids—pGL3-basic was purchased from Promega. pGL3-RSI was constructed by PCR-cloning rat SOD2 intron 2 (RSI) into MluI and BglII sites of pGL3-basic. Relative to the κB site, the cloned sequence included 400 bp in the 5′ direction (primer: GCC GAC GCG TGC CAA CCA CAA CTT CTG GG; MluI site underlined) and 100 bp in the 3′ direction (primer: CCG GAG ATC TGT CTC CAC GGA AGG G; BglII site underlined) to the κB site, and the clone was verified by sequencing. This sequence contains most of the elements responsive to TNF stimulus (23Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). GeneEditor™ in vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Promega) was used to mutate the κB site (GGGGAAAAGCCC → GGGGAAAAGatC), and the mutation was verified by sequencing. A truncated form of the SV40-promoter (SV40-promΔ (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), in which six tandem-repeat Sp1 sites were deleted, was derived from pGL3-prom (Promega). The TK promoter was obtained from pRL-TK (Promega). pGL3-RSI-promΔ and pGL3-RSImut-promΔ were constructed by inserting SV40-promΔ into the multiple cloning sites (BglII and HindIII sites) of pGL3-RSI and pGL3-RSImut, respectively. pGL3-RSI-TK and pGL3-RSImut-TK were constructed by the same strategy. The p65 and IκBα coding regions were amplified from NT2 cells with a high fidelity PCR system (cat. no. 1732 641, Roche Applied Science) and cloned in-frame into pEFGP-N1 (p65) or pDsRed2-N1 (IκBα) (BD Biosciences-Clontech, Mountain View CA), creating p65-EGFP and IκB-DsRed2 fusion proteins. Clones were verified by sequencing, and p65-EGFP proteins were located in nuclei while IκBα co-transfection retained all p65-EGFP in cytosol (32Barger S.W. Moerman A.M. Mao X. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pRL-CMV (Promega) plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase constitutively was used as a control for transfection efficiency and viability. All plasmids were prepared with Qiagen Midiprep kits, and DNA quality and quantity were determined by both spectrophotometry and visual inspection in agarose gels. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Mammalian cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Astrocytes were transfected when the cultures reached 60–70% confluency, whereas neurons were plated and transfected at a density of 1 × 105/cm2. One microgram of total DNA per well was used; neuron transfections: 0.5 μg of pGL3-basic or pGL3-promΔ series, 0.1 μg of pGL3-TK series, and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV; astrocyte transfections: 0.6 μg of pGL3-TK series and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV; pBluescript II (Stratagene) was used to adjust the total to 1 μg. When decoy oligonucleotides (50 nm final concentration) were used, pBluescript II was omitted. For p65 and IκBα co-transfection, 0.2 μg (per well) of plasmid encoding these proteins was used. Transfections took place in the existing media (for neurons, Neurobasal with B27 supplement; for astrocytes, MEM plus 10% FBS). After 60–90 min of incubation, DNA and Lipofectamine were washed off, and fresh maintenance medium was applied. Cells were harvested ∼24 h after transfection for luciferase assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to detect both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities through a Veritas luminometer (Promega). All experiments were repeated at least five times. SL2 cells were transfected by pPACSp1 and pPACSp3 with a calcium phosphate method, which has been described previously (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nuclear Protein Extraction and EMSA—The detailed protocols have been described previously (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). N9 cells were activated with 10 nm LPS for 60 min, and primary rat astrocytes were treated with TNF (100 ng/ml) for 60 min prior to nuclear protein extraction. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in MEM for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline; this phosphate-buffered saline and all subsequent buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (1 μm). After centrifugation, cell pellets were dissolved in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and sonicated. The sonication conditions were optimized for each of the two cell types used. Chromatin was reproducibly reduced to fragments of 200–1000 bp by 8 and 12 sonication pulses in NT2 and T98G cells, respectively. Each pulse lasted 10–15 s, and the energy output was set at 25% of sonicator maximum (F60 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps utilized buffers supplied in a kit by Upstate Biotech (Lake Placid, NY), essentially following the manufacturer's instructions. The cleared supernatants were diluted 10-fold with chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The solution was precleared with a slurry of protein A/G-agarose (Invitrogen) in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 200 μg/ml sheared salmon-sperm DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Germany) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, incubating for 60 min at 4 °C with rotation, followed by removal of the A/G-agarose by centrifugation. The precleared solution was incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Antibody complexes were recovered with protein A/G-agarose in salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin; the agarose pellets were then washed with 1 ml of the following buffers in order: once with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.1); once with high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.1); once with LiCl wash buffer (250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1); three times with TE buffer, pH 8.0. DNA-protein complexes were eluted from the agarose pellets with two sequential aliquots of 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The eluted samples were combined, and protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed by incubation in 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h, followed by proteinase K (10 μg/ml) digestion at 45 °C for 1 h. The chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform and then precipitated in ethanol. Purified DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of H2O. One microliter of DNA was amplified (56 °C for annealing) in a 25-μl PCR reaction (forward primer: 5′-CGA ACC TTG AAT TAC GGG AAA; reverse primer: 5′-CCT GGT GTC AGA TGT TGC CT). PCR products (130 bp) were fractionated and visualized on a 1.2% agarose gel. Reverse Transcription-PCR—The general protocol has been described elsewhere (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Specific primers and PCR conditions were as follows: SOD2 upstream primer: 5′-CTG GCC AAG GGA GAT GT-3′; downstream primer: 5′-GGC CTG TGG TTC CTT GC-3′ (27 cycles, producing a 309-bp product). β-Actin upstream primer: 5′-GTC CTC TGC CAT GTG GTT TTC-3′; downstream primer: 5′-GCT GCG CTC TCG TAA TTG TG-3′ (21 cycles, producing a 439-bp product). Annealing temperature for all reactions was 60 °C. The cycle numbers and other conditions were optimized to achieve linear rates of amplification. All data depicted are representative of at least three experiments. Sequence Requirements for Sp-factors Binding to κB Sites—We previously determined that three different classes of transcription factor (Sp-factors, NFκB, and RBP-Jκ) can bind to the Ig/HIV-κB site (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a sequence widely used as a probe in “NFκB” EMSA analyses. RBP-Jκ binding is conferred by a sequence located at the 3′ half of this site (5′-CCTGGGAAA-3′ in the complementary strand) and requires additional 3′ flanking sequences outside the core κB element. All these interactions between transcription factors and the Ig/HIV-κB sequence appeared to be sequence-specific (17Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We extended this investigation to establish the efficiency of the interaction between Sp-factors and this κB site. Nuclear extract containing Sp-factors, NFκB, and RBP-Jκ was prepared from LPS-activated N9 microglial cells; the Sp-factors in these cells consist primarily of Sp1 and Sp3 (5Massa P.E. Aleyasin H. Park D.S. Mao X. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Mao X. Yang S.-H. Simpkins J.W. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). EMSA analysis was performed using the Ig/HIV-κB sequence as a 32P-labeled probe and various sequences as unlabeled (“cold”) oligonucleotides in competition assays. When Ig/HIV-κB was used as an autologous competitor, binding was diminished for each of the three classes of transcription factors; but as a fraction of its baseline value, binding of the Sp-factors was the least sensitive among the three (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a canonical Sp1 target sequence competed much more efficiently with the κB sequence for binding to Sp-factors; this sequence had no effect on the binding activity of NFκB or RBP-Jκ. No appreciable competition for any of the three transcription factors was observed when unrelated target sequences for transcription factors AP-1 or Oct1 was used. A similar competition pattern was observed when the Sp1 target sequence was used as a radiolabeled probe (data not shown). These results suggest that the affinity of Sp-factors for the Sp1 target sequence is ∼30-fold greater than that for the Ig/HIV-κB sequence. However, a precise quantitation of this difference is confounded by a third-order competition for probe between the Sp-factors and the other transcription factors in these extracts, the quantities of which undoubtedly vary with cellular conditions. Sp-factors bind to a subset of κB elements (14Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), so it is important to determine the sequence requirements for this interaction. We made such determinations within the context of the widely used Ig/HIV-κB sequence. The 5′-end of the sequence contains four adjacent guanines (G4 motif). Each guanine in the G4 motif was individually mutated to cytosine (G → C) (κB-mut1–4, Table 1). To evaluate the binding efficiency, the mutated oligonucleotides were used as unlabeled competitors for Sp-factor binding to the 32P-labeled Ig/HIV-κB sequence. Again, activated N9 nuclear extracts were used to assay Sp-factors and NFκB in the same EMSA analysis. Mutation of any of the four guanines abolished Sp-factor binding, because substantial competition was not observed from any of the mutated sequences (Fig. 1B). In contrast, none of the mutations interfered with RBP-Jκ binding, because the 3′-half of Ig/HIV-κB sequence was unchanged. The third and fourth guanines were required for NFκB binding, as expected from their location within the κB core sequence. But mutation of the first two guanines did not affect NFκB binding. The first guanine was predicted to be dispensable, because it lies outside the κB core sequence. NFκB binding after mutation of the second guanine can be explained by the retention of a κB site (GGGAAAGTCC) in the complementary strand. To test the sequence requirements of the 3′-end of the Ig/HIV-κB site for Sp1 binding, we made another mutation (κBΔC, Table 1) removing the distal cytosine from the three cytosines (C3 motif) present there. When κBΔC was used as a labeled probe, NFκB was the only prominent band, and little Sp1 binding could be detected (Fig. 1B). In competition assays, κBΔC could compete for NFκB binding with the same efficiency as the intact Ig/HIV-κB sequence (Fig. 1B), whereas κBΔC was not an efficient competitor for RBP-Jκ or Sp-factors binding to the original Ig/HIV-κB probe. These data indicated that both the G4 motif and the C3 motif were essential for Sp-factors binding to the Ig/HIV-κB probe. Together with our earlier work (19Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the experiments presented here indicate that Sp-factor binding to the Ig/HIV-κB site requires four guanines at the 5′-end and three cytosines at the 3′-end of the same strand. For example, the IL6-κB site has three guanines at 5′, which makes it a poor site for Sp1 bin"

Each of the three assembly steps requires formation of a three-helix interface involving one particular basic TCR TM residue and two acidic TM residues of the respective signaling dimer. The extracellular domains of CD3δϵ and CD3γϵ contribute to assembly, but TCR interaction sites on CD3 dimers have not been defined. The structures of the extracellular domains of CD3δϵ and CD3γϵ demonstrated parallel β-strands ending at the first cysteine in the CXXCXEXXX motif present in the stalk segment of each CD3 chain. Mutation of the membrane-proximal cysteines impaired assembly of either CD3 dimer with TCR, and little complex was isolated when all four membrane-proximal cysteines were mutated to alanine. These mutations had, however, no discernable effect on CD3δϵ or CD3γϵ dimerization. CD3δϵ assembled with a TCRα mutant that lacked both immunoglobulin domains, but shortening of the TCRα connecting peptide reduced assembly, consistent with membrane-proximal TCRα-CD3δϵ interactions. Chelation of divalent cations did not affect assembly, indicating that coordination of a cation by the tetracysteine motif was not required. The membrane-proximal cysteines were within close proximity but only formed covalent CD3 dimers when one cysteine was mutated. The four cysteines may thus form two intrachain disulfide bonds integral to the secondary structure of CD3 stalk regions.

The TCR heterodimer is responsible for ligand recognition but lacks cytoplasmic signaling domains. Instead, it associates through non-covalent interactions with three dimeric signaling modules, CD3δϵ, CD3γϵ, and ζζ (1Oettgen H.C. Terhorst C. Crit. Rev.

The ζ chain only has a short nine-amino acid extracellular domain and forms covalent dimers through a cysteine at position 2 of the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain (3Samelson L.E. Harford J.B.

The CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ chains have more substantial extracellular components, and their Ig domains form noncovalent heterodimers through parallel β-strands, which create a β-sheet along the dimer interface. In each CD3 chain, a nine-amino acid segment with a highly conserved CXXCXEXXX motif connects this β-strand to the TM domain (1Oettgen H.C. Terhorst C. Crit. Rev.

Assembly of the TCR heterodimer with the three dimeric signaling modules requires proper placement of a total of nine ionizable TM residues, the three basic TM residues of the TCR heterodimer (7Blumberg R.S.

Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Each basic TCR TM residue serves a specific role in the assembly process; lysine residues located close to the center of the TM domains of TCRα and TCRβ serve as interaction sites for the CD3δϵ and CD3γϵ dimers, respectively, whereas the arginine in the N-terminal third of the TCRα TM domain interacts with the ζζ dimer (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The formation of these three-chain TM interactions requires both acidic residues of each signaling module, because substitution of only one of these acidic residues greatly diminishes or abolishes complex formation (4Call M.E.

Several lines of evidence suggest contributions of the CD3 extracellular domains to assembly of TCR-CD3 complexes, but the location and precise nature of these interaction sites on CD3 dimers remain unknown. Global approaches have demonstrated physical proximity between TCR constant domains and CD3 dimers. Chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated an interaction between TCRβ and CD3γ (21Brenner M.B. Trowbridge I.S. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), a result consistent with the TM interaction of the acidic CD3γϵ residues and the TCRβ lysine (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mAb (H57) that binds to the TCR Cβ FG loop was shown to reduce subsequent staining with a CD3ϵ mAb (2C11) (23Ghendler Y. Smolyar A. Chang H.C. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Steric hindrance between these two mAbs does not provide fine resolution due to the fact that Fab fragments are similar in size to the entire TCRαβ ectodomain. TCRαβ-CD3 complexes contain only one copy of each CD3 dimer, despite the similarity of the lysine-based TM interaction sites for CD3δϵ and CD3γϵ (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W.

At least two mechanisms contribute to the specific requirement for both CD3 dimers; the TCRα chain has a strong preference for interaction with CD3δϵ, and efficient interaction of CD3γϵ with TCRβ requires prior association of TCRα and CD3δϵ (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A contribution of the CD3γ extracellular domains to specificity of assembly was shown by domain exchange; a CD3γ mutant with the TM domain of CD3δ was incorporated into full TCR-CD3 complexes, but a CD3γ mutant with the extracellular domain of CD3δ failed to be incorporated (4Call M.E.

The persisting uncertainties about the physical nature of TCR-CD3 extracellular domain interactions have resulted in a number of competing models (2Kuhns M.S. Davis M.M. Garcia K.C. Immunity. 2006; 24: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Early models emphasized lateral interactions between Ig domains of TCR and CD3 dimers. However, a more recent model suggested the possibility that the CD3 ectodomains may be located close to the cell membrane underneath the TCR constant domains (27Arnett K.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16268-16273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This model is based on three facts: 1) the TM domains of TCRα-CD3δϵ and TCRβ-CD3γϵ are within close proximity (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar); 2) the CD3 stalks are substantially shorter than the TCR connecting peptides (2Kuhns M.S. Davis M.M. Garcia K.C. Immunity. 2006; 24: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); 3) the location of conserved glycans in CD3γ, CD3δ, and TCRαβ excludes particular surfaces as candidates for such interactions (27Arnett K.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16268-16273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This model suggests that the stalk regions of TCRα-CD3δϵ and TCRβ-CD3γϵ may form a three-chain interface. We therefore investigated whether the conserved CXX-CXEXXX motif present in all CD3 chains contributes to assembly of TCR-CD3 complexes. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-CD3ϵ (mouse mAb UCHT1) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and high affinity anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA, rat mAb 3F10) and calcium-dependent anti-Protein C (anti-PC, mouse mAb HPC4) were from Roche Applied Science. Streptavidin coupled to agarose beads was purchased from Sigma, and digitonin was from Biosynth International (Naperville, IL). cDNA Constructs and in Vitro Transcription—Human CD3γ, -δ, -ϵ, and -ζ constructs were generated form peripheral blood lymphocytes by reverse transcription-PCR, whereas TCRα and -β sequences originated from the A6 T cell clone (28Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). All sequences were cloned into a modified pSP64 vector (provided by M. Kozak) with the murine H-2Kb signal sequence (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by PCR using overlapping primers. Peptide tags were added as C-terminal in-frame fusions, usually with a three-amino acid flexible linker. The streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) was sequence C4 (29Wilson D.S. Keefe A.D. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), with 4 methionines and 1 cysteine changed to serine so that radiolabeled methionine or cysteine would not be incorporated into the tag. Peptide tag sequences (single-letter code) were as follows: SBP (SDEKTTGWRGGHVVEGLAGELEQLRARLEHHPQGQREPSSSGGSKLG), PC (EDQVDPRLIDGK), and HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA). In vitro transcription was performed from linearized cDNA constructs using a RiboMax T7 large scale RNA production kit and methyl-7G cap analog (Promega, Madison, WI). Translation and Assembly Reactions—Each 25-μl reaction contained 17.5 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture minus cysteine and methionine (Promega), 0.5 μl of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion), 1.0 μl of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences), equivalent molar amounts of each RNA (60-200 ng of each), and 2.0 μl of ER microsomes. These microsomes were prepared on continuous iodixanol gradients from a mouse IVD12 hybridoma (ATCC) as previously described (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). All translation and assembly reactions were performed at 30 °C. An initial translation period of 30 min under reducing conditions was followed by a 2-4-h assembly period (4 h for complete TCR-CD3 complexes, 2 h for any assembly intermediate) after the addition of GSSG to 4 mm. Reaction volumes were 25-100 μl as required for optimal signal with multistep sequential nondenaturing IP (snIP) procedures. Immunoprecipitation, Electrophoretic Analysis, and Densitometry—Translation and assembly reactions were stopped by dilution with 1 ml of ice-cold TBS, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and microsomes were pelleted (10 min/20,800 g/4 °C) and rinsed. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of solubilization/IP buffer (TBS plus 0.5% digitonin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; with 1 mm CaCl2 when anti-Protein C mAb was used) by vigorous pipetting and then rotated for 30 min at 4 °C in a total of 400 μl of solubilization/IP buffer. Lysates were precleared for 1 h with PBS/bovine serum albumin-blocked Sepharose 4 beads, and primary captures were performed overnight at 4 °C. Primary IP products were washed twice in 0.5 ml of wash buffer (TBS plus 0.5% digitonin, 10 mm iodoacetamide; with 1 mm CaCl2 for anti-Protein C mAb binding). Nondenaturing elution of SA-captured complexes was performed by incubation with 400 μl of solubilization/IP buffer with 100 μm free biotin for 1 h at 4 °C, and eluted complexes were incubated with subsequent antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose 4 beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C and washed as before. Nondenaturing elution with EDTA (PC tag) was performed as described (4Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Final precipitates were digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 500 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs), separated on 12% BisTris gels under nonreducing conditions (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and exposed to PhosphorImager plates. Densitometry was performed using the Wide Line tool in the ImageQuant software package (Amersham Biosciences). Chelation of Cations during TCR-CD3 Assembly—RNAs were translated for 30 min under reducing conditions to permit insertion of newly synthesized radiolabeled proteins into ER microsomes. 20 mm EDTA was then added to the reaction to chelate all divalent cations (0.5 mm Mg2+ is present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate); the same volume of water was added to control reactions. 4 mm GSSG was added simultaneously to initiate formation of structural disulfide bonds. Following a 2-4-h assembly period, membrane microsomes were pelleted and solubilized in IP buffer supplemented with 20 mm EDTA. TCR-CD3 complexes were isolated by one-step IP using the CD3ϵ-specific UCHT1 mAb. Endoglycosidase H digestion, electrophoresis, and densitometry were performed as described above. The Membrane-proximal Tetracysteine Motif of CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ—The membrane-proximal segments of CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ carry a highly conserved CXXCXEXXX sequence motif, and the two cysteines within this motif are located at positions -6 and -9 relative to the predicted TM segments (Fig. 1A). The NMR and crystal structures of CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ demonstrated that the G strands of the two chains form a long β-sheet at the dimer interface (27Arnett K.L. Harrison S.C. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl.

The cysteines were not included in these recombinant soluble proteins or could not be resolved in these structures, but the available structural information indicates that the four cysteines are located within close proximity in the stalk region of both CD3 dimers. Conserved arginines are located close to the C terminus of the β-strands, and the stalk starts with the first cysteine of this motif (Fig. 1C). The four cysteines may form two intrachain disulfide bonds that stabilize the secondary structure of the CD3 stalk regions or may coordinate a divalent cation, such as zinc. The CD3 constructs that were used to probe the contribution of these cysteine residues to assembly of CD3 dimers with TCR are illustrated in Fig. 1D. The Four Membrane-proximal Cysteine Residues Are Not Required for CD3δϵ or CD3γϵ Dimerization— We examined the assembly of CD3 dimers and their interaction with TCR using an in vitro translation system with ER microsomes isolated from a murine B cell hybridoma, and we and others have previously shown that this system faithfully reproduces protein interactions in the ER identified with metabolic labeling techniques in cells (4Call M.E.

Major advantages of this system are that a series of mutations can be evaluated in parallel under identical reaction conditions and that quantification of 35S-labeled protein complexes provides highly reproducible measurements (25Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wucherpfennig K.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2348-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previous studies based on Western blotting techniques had suggested that the membrane-proximal cysteines may contribute to formation of CD3 dimers (31Sun Z.J. Kim K.S. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L.

CD3 complexes were isolated with the UCHT1 mAb that binds to an exposed surface epitope of CD3ϵ. This mAb is suitable for this analysis, because it immunoprecipitates properly folded CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ dimers (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), including CD3 dimers incorporated into TCR-CD3 complexes (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6) (4Call M.E.

Alanine substitution of the two membrane-proximal cysteines of CD3ϵ (ϵ2CA) did not reduce recovery of dimers with WT CD3γ or CD3δ (lanes 4 and 5). A mixing control (*, lane 3) in which the three chains were translated separately and then combined prior to solubilization of membranes with digitonin and IP demonstrated that dimer formation occurred in ER microsomes and not following solubilization. Similar mutations of both cysteines in either CD3γ or CD3δ (γ2CA and δ2CA, respectively, lanes 6 and 7) did not impair dimer formation with WT CD3ϵ, and even alanine substitution of all four membrane-proximal cysteines did not reduce either CD3γϵ or CD3δϵ dimerization (lanes 8 and 9).FIGURE 3The membrane-proximal cysteines of CD3δϵ contribute to assembly with TCRα. A, CD3ϵ and CD3δ mutants in which both membrane-proximal cysteines were substituted by alanine (ϵ2CA and δ2CA, respectively) were analyzed for their ability to assemble into a three-chain TCRα-CD3δϵ complex. TCRα-CD3 complexes were isolated by two-step snIP using the PC tag attached to TCRα and the CD3ϵ-specific UCHT1 mAb. The amount of immunoprecipitated TCRα was quantitated relative to the reaction with WT sequences (lane 1). Substitution of the two membrane-proximal cysteines of CD3δ to alanine substantially reduced assembly with TCRα (lane 5), and substitution of all four membrane-proximal cysteines diminished assembly to less than 10% relative to WT (lane 7). Lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 represent mixing controls (*) in which TCRα and CD3δϵ RNAs were translated in separate reactions that were combined prior to detergent solubilization of ER membranes. SDS-PAGE of aliquots of reactions prior to IP (lower panel) demonstrated equal quantities of input proteins. B, analysis of CD3δ mutants. CD3δ mutants were analyzed for their ability to form CD3δϵ dimers (lanes 1-5) and to assemble into TCRα-CD3δϵ complexes (lanes 6-10). The two membrane-proximal cysteines were either both substituted by alanine (δ2CA, lanes 2 and 7) or serine (δ2CS, lanes 5 and 10) or individually substituted by alanine (δC72A and δC75A, lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9). CD3δϵ dimer formation was assessed by two-step snIP targeting the SBP tag on CD3ϵ and the HA tag on CD3δ (lanes 1-5), whereas TCRα-CD3δϵ complexes were isolated using the PC tag attached to TCRα and the CD3ϵ specific UCHT1 mAb (lanes 6-10). Even conservative substitution of the two CD3δϵ cysteines by serine substantially reduced assembly with TCRα (lane 10) but did not affect CD3δϵ dimerization (lane 5). Mutation of single membrane-proximal cysteines resulted in formation of covalent CD3δϵ dimers (†, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the cysteines comprising the tetracysteine motif are within close proximity. Analysis of aliquots of translation reactions prior to IP demonstrated equal quantities of input proteins (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4A TCRα mutant lacking both Ig domains assembles with CD3δϵ. A, TCRα assembly with the CD3δϵ dimer was compared for full-length TCRα, a mutant lacking the two TCRα Ig domains (αTM2), and a mutant in which the connecting peptide was shortened to six residues (αTM1). B, complexes containing these TCRα constructs and CD3δϵ were isolated by two-step snIP using the SBP tag on TCRα and the CD3ϵ-specific UCHT1 mAb. The αTM2 construct lacking both TCRα Ig domains assembled with CD3δϵ; assembly occurred at reduced levels with the shorter αTM1 construct. The αTM1 peptide was targeted in the first IP step and was therefore present in the isolated complex, but this short peptide was difficult to visualize at the quantities isolated in this IP (lane 2). Signal peptide cleavage of αTM2 protein was incomplete (†, lane 3 of the no IP gel in the lower panel). The mixing control in lane 4 (*) in which TCRα and CD3δϵ chains were translated separately and mixed prior to detergent solubilization demonstrated specificity of assembly. C, CD3δ cysteine mutants yield similar results with the TCRα mutants as with WT TCRα. Three-chain assembly reactions were set up with CD3δ, CD3ϵ, and SBP-tagged TCR αTM1 or αTM2 peptides, and three-chain complexes were isolated as in B. Substitution of one or both cysteine residues by alanine (δC72A, δC75A, and δ2CA, respectively) or serine (δ2CS) substantially reduced assembly of either TCR αTM1 or αTM2 with CD3δϵ. The amount of immunoprecipitated CD3ϵ in reactions with these CD3δ mutants was compared with reactions with WT CD3δ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Role of tetracysteine motifs in formation of the six-chain CD3δϵ-TCRαβ-CD3γϵ intermediate. A, assembly of the six-chain complex was examined in reactions with TCRα, TCRβ, and CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ. TCR complexes containing both CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ were isolated by two-step snIP utilizing the PC and HA tags attached to CD3γ and CD3δ, respectively. The other components (TCRα, TCRβ, and CD3ϵ) carried SBP tags to facilitate resolution of all components by SDS-PAGE. Substitution of the two membrane-proximal cysteines by alanine in only CD3γ (γ2CA) or CD3ϵ (ϵ2CA) moderately reduced assembly of the six-chain complex, but introduction of these mutations into both CD3γ and CD3ϵ chains (γ2CA and ϵ2CA) resulted in a severe assembly defect. B, the cysteine mutations do not affect the final assembly step, association of the ζζ dimer. Assembly reactions with all TCR-CD3 components (lanes 4-6) were compared with reactions lacking the ζ chain (lanes 1-3). Complete TCR-CD3 complexes were isolated by two-step snIP targeting the ζ chain (PC tag) and CD3ϵ (UCHT1 mAb) (lanes 4-6), whereas six-chain complexes were isolated from reactions lacking the ζ chain by two-step snIP targeting CD3δ (PC tag) and CD3γ (HA tag) (lanes 1-3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Chelation of divalent cations does not interfere with assembly of complete TCR-CD3 complexes. A, a control experiment confirmed that CD3 dimers do not form under the reducing conditions of the initial translation period. Following this translation period of 30 min, reactions in lanes 3 and 4 were oxidized by the addition of oxidized glutathione. CD3 dimers were immunoprecipitated using the UCTH1 mAb after a 2-h assembly period. B, the addition of EDTA does not prevent assembly of TCRα with CD3δϵ. Three-chain complexes were isolated with the UCHT1 mAb even when EDTA was added before the 2-h assembly period. Lane 3 represents an IP specificity control (C) with an isotype control antibody. C, the presence of EDTA does not interfere with formation of complete TCR-CD3 complexes. Specificity of IP was demonstrated by replacing the CD3ϵ-specific UCHT1 mAb (lanes 1 and 2) with an isotype control mAb (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation of Membrane-proximal Cysteines Substantially Impairs Assembly of CD3δϵ with TCRα—The first major step in the assembly of TCR-CD3 complexes is the interaction of TCRα with the CD3δϵ dimer (4Call M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2000735090,"Integrin-mediated adhesion is a crucial step in lymphocyte extravasation and homing. We show here that not only the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13 but also the lysophospholipids sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhance adhesion of murine follicular and marginal zone B cells to ICAM-1 in vitro. This process involves clustering of integrin LFA-1 and is blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting that Gi family G-proteins are involved. In addition, lysophospholipid-induced adhesion on ICAM-1 depends on Rho and Rhokinase, indicative of an involvement of G12/G13, possibly also Gq/G11 family G-proteins. We used G12/G13- or Gq/G11-deficient B cells to study the role of these G-protein families in lysophospholipid-induced adhesion and found that the pro-adhesive effects of LPA and S1P are completely abrogated in G12/G13-deficient marginal zone B cells, reduced in G12/G13-deficient follicular B cells, and normal in Gq/G11-deficient B cells. We also show that loss of lysophospholipid-induced adhesion results in disinhibition of migration in response to the follicular chemokine CXCL13, which might contribute to the abnormal localization of splenic B cell populations observed in B cell-specific G12/G13-deficient mice in vivo. Taken together, this study shows that lysophospholipids regulate integrin-mediated adhesion of splenic B cells to ICAM-1 through Gi and G12/G13 family G-proteins but not through Gq/G11.

Integrins are adhesion receptors that connect cells to extracellular matrix or to counter-receptors on other cells. Integrin-mediated adhesion is critically involved in a variety of processes such as tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, blood clotting, and leukocyte trafficking. In leukocytes, chemokines and their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; MZ B, marginal zone B; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; PTX, pertussis toxin; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; MZ B, marginal zone B; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; PTX, pertussis toxin; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. play an important role in the regulation of integrin activity. While a wealth of studies addressed the role of chemokine receptors in lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes and Peyer′s patches (1Stein J.V. Nombela-Arrieta C. Immunology. 2005; 116: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Butcher E.C. Williams M. Youngman K. Rott L. Briskin M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 209-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), not much is known about the regulation of B lymphocyte adhesion in the spleen. The spleen contains two subpopulations of mature B cells, follicular B cells and marginal zone B (MZ B) cells, the latter residing at the interface between red and white pulp, the marginal zone. Due to this localization at a site of early antigen contact and due to their high proliferative capacity, MZ B cells play an important role in the rapid defense against blood-borne bacterial antigens (3Martin F. Kearney J.F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 4Pillai S. Cariappa A. Moran S.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 161-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Both entry of follicular B cells into the white pulp (5Lo C.G. Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and MZ B cell localization within the marginal zone (6Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. Science. 2002; 297: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) depend on the interaction between lymphocyte integrins LFA (leukocyte function antigen)-1 and α4β1 and their respective ligands on stromal cells, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), respectively. A role for GPCRs in the regulation of this interaction was suggested based on pharmacological or genetic inactivation of different G-protein families in mice. For example, treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), which ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Gi family G-proteins, causes displacement of both follicular B cells and MZ B cells from their physiological niches (5Lo C.G. Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gi-coupled receptors normally contribute to splenic B cell homing. This hypothesis is strengthened by the finding that numbers of MZ B cells are low in mice lacking either the Gαi2 subunit of Gi (8Dalwadi H. Wei B. Schrage M. Spicher K. Su T.T. Birnbaumer L. Rawlings D.J. Braun J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or different effector molecules of the Gi family like Pyk-2, Rac2, or Dock2 (7Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 9Croker B.A. Handman E. Hayball J.D. Baldwin T.M. Voigt V. Cluse L.A. Yang F.C.

Shirai T. Sasazuki T. Nature. 2001; 412: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition to Gi, also G12/G13 family G-proteins seem to be involved in splenic B cell localization, since MZ B cell numbers are reduced both in B cell-specific G12/G13-deficient mice (11Rieken S. Sassmann A. Herroeder S. Wallenwein B. Moers A. Offermanns S. Wettschureck N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in mice lacking the G12/G13 effector Lsc/p115RhoGEF (12Girkontaite I. Missy K. Sakk V. Harenberg A. Tedford K. Potzel T. Pfeffer K. Fischer K.D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, whether abnormal B cell localization in these mice is due to loss of GPCR-mediated integrin activation or secondary to other defects is not clear. To elucidate the mechanisms regulating B cell adhesion we studied the effects of chemokine and lysophospholipid GPCR agonists on integrin-mediated adhesion in splenic B cell populations. We show here that not only chemokines, but also the lysophospholipids S1P and LPA, enhance B cell adhesion to ICAM-1, but not to VCAM-1, and that this process involves LFA-1 clustering. We also show that, in contrast to chemokines, lysophospholipids mediate their effects not only through Gi family G-proteins but also through the G12/13/Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway, while Gq/11 family G-proteins are not involved. Animals—B cell-specific G12/G13-deficient mice and B cell-specific Gq/G11-deficient mice were generated by mating the B cell-specific CD19-Cre line (13Rickert R.C. Roes J. Rajewsky K.

Gehring D. Wilkie T.M. Chen J. Chien K.R. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), respectively. Control mice (CD19-Cre-/-;Gna13fl/fl;Gna12+/+ or CD19-Cre-/-; Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11+/+, respectively) and B cell-specific double-deficient (CD19-Cre+/-;Gna13fl/fl;Gna12-/- or CD19-Cre+/-; Gnaqfl/fl;Gna11-/-, respectively) mice were generated by intercrosses of triple heterozygous parents. B cell-specific Gαq/Gα11-deficient mice were kept on a C57BL6/N background (eighth generation backcross), B cell-specific Gα12/Gα13-deficient mice were kept on a mixed C57BL6/N x Sv129J background, with a predominant contribution of the C57BL6/N strain (fourth generation backcross). Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. Genotyping was performed as described previously (14Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Gruner S. Konrad I. Schulte V.

Flow Cytometry—Lymphocytes from splenocyte suspension were enriched with Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). B lymphocyte subsets were analyzed with a three-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences) using the following antibodies: anti-CD21-FITC, anti-CD23-PE, anti-B220/CD45R-Biotin, anti CD11a-Biotin, anti-CD18-Biotin, rat IgG2aκ isotype control, and SA-PerCP (all from BD Biosciences). Integrin Staining—Untouched B cells were prepared from splenocytes using a B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany), adhered to ICAM-1-coated coverslips (coated as described for adhesion assays) for 3, 10, or 30 min in the presence or absence of 100 nm S1P or LPA at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice in PBS, and incubated with biotinylated anti-CD11a antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:200) for 1 h. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated in SA-TRITC 1:200 in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 1 h, washed, mounted in Mowiol, and analyzed on a Leica DC300F microscope. To quantify the effect of S1P or LPA on LFA-1 clustering, the number of CD11a clusters per cell was counted at ×63 magnification by an investigator blinded to genotype and treatment. Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed in 48-well plastic dishes as described (6Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. Science. 2002; 297: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For ICAM-1, wells were coated with 50 μg/ml goat-anti-human-IgG-Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 4 °C overnight, washed twice with PBS, incubated with 2.5 μg/ml mouse ICAM-1-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in PBS for 2-3 h, and finally blocked with 0.5% BSA/PBS (100 μl per well for each step). Uncoated wells were treated with 0.5% BSA/PBS only. For VCAM-1, wells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl/well 3 μg/ml hVCAM-1 (R&D Systems) in carbonate buffer and blocked with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 30 min before use. In some cases CXCL12 or CXCL13 were co-immobilized together with ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Lymphocytes were enriched with Lympholyte-M from splenocyte suspensions and incubated for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) with 10 mm HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to remove contaminating macrophages. Non-adherent cells were washed twice, counted, and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% FCS. In some cases, cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 with 200 ng/ml PTX (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences), 10 μm Y27632 (kind gift from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Inc., Osaka, Japan), or 0.2 μm TAT-C3 (16Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) before the adhesion assay. In these cases, the toxins were also present during adhesion. Blocking antibodies directed against CD11a or CD18 or isotype control antibodies (all from BD Biosciences; 1:200) were added only during adhesion. For the adhesion assay itself, 50 μl of cell suspension (1 × 107 cells/ml) were added to each well of the coated plate and mixed with 50 μl of RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% FCS containing 2× concentrated GPCR agonists. The following agonists were used (100 nm each if not otherwise indicated): SDF-1α/CXCL12 (Chemicon, Temecula CA), S1P (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 1 μm LPA (Biomol), CXCL13/BCA-1 (R&D Systems). After 30 min of adhesion at 37 °C/5% CO2, non-adherent cells were discarded and adherent cells detached in RPMI 1640, 5 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice. Cells were then stained for B cell subpopulations with CD45R/B220-Biotin/SA-PerCP, CD21-FITC, CD23-PE (all from BD Biosciences) and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and data were acquired for 1 min. The absolute number of follicular (CD45R/B220pos, CD21int, CD23hi) and marginal zone (CD45R/B220pos, CD21hi, CD23lo) B cells was calculated and expressed as proportion of input into adhesion assay. Migration Assays—Lympholyte-M-purified splenocytes were preincubated in RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37 and 5% CO2 and then allowed to migrate through uncoated, ICAM-1-coated, or VCAM-1-coated (coating see above) transwell inserts (5 μm pore size; Corning, Acton, MA) at a density of 2 × 106 splenocytes/100 μl/well. The lower wells contained 600 μl of RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA either without chemokine or with 100 nm CXCL13. If indicated, 100 nm LPA was added to the upper well. After 2 h of incubation at 37 and 5% CO2, transwell plates were kept on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 180 × g for 3 min, inserts were discarded, and cells were stained for B cell subpopulations as described above. Cell numbers were expressed as proportion of input. All experiments were done in triplicates. Reverse Transcription-PCR—B220pos, CD21hi, and CD23lo marginal zone B cells were sorted with a FACSVantage, and mRNA was prepared with a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed according to standard protocols. LPA receptor subtypes were amplified with the following primers: S1P1,5′-GTGTAGACCCAGAGTCCTGCG-3′ and 5′-AGTACATGGGCCGGTGGAACT-3′; S1P3, 5′-GGAGCCCCTAGACGGGAGT-3′ and 5′-AGCCAAGTTGCCGATGAAAAAGT-3′; S1P4,5′-CCTGGAACTCACTTTATAGACCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCTGCCGCTGTGATTGTA-3′; LPA1, 5′-GCAGCTGCCTCTACTTCCAC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGCCGGTTGCTCATTC-3′; LPA2, 5′-TGGCGCCCCAAAGATGTGG-3′ and 5′-TAGCAACCCCAGACCCAGTG-3′; LPA3, 5′-GCAACACAGACACAGCGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCCACACCAGCAGAATGAGC-3′; LPA4, 5′-AACTGCATTCCTTACCAACATC-3′ and 5′-GAAAACAAAGAGGCTGAAATACC-3′; LPA5, 5′-GCAACACAGACACAGCGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCCACACCAGCAGAATGAGC-3′. RhoA Activation Assay—Levels of GTP-bound RhoA were determined in wild-type and mutant splenic B cells before and 1, 3, and 10 min after stimulation with 1 μm LPA using a G-LISA RhoA activation kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) and Akt Phosphorylation—To determine phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in response to 1 μm LPA splenic lymphocytes were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of agonist, then fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. To determine ERK phosphorylation in MZ B cells, cells were incubated for 30 min with a FITC-labeled anti-ERK1/2 (pT202/pY204) antibody (BD Biosciences), PerCP-labeled anti-CD45R/B220 antibody, and PE-labeled anti-CD23 antibody, and the mean FITC intensity was determined in CD45R/B220pos and CD23neg cells (MZ B cells and newly formed B cells). To determine Akt phosphorylation in MZ B cells, cells were incubated for 30 min with a PE-labeled anti-Akt (pT308) antibody (BD Biosciences), PerCP-labeled anti-CD45R/B220 antibody, and FITC-labeled anti-CD21 antibody, and the mean PE-intensity was determined in CD45R/B220pos and CD21hi cells (MZ B cells). Data are displayed as mean fluorescence intensity as determined by the BD CellQuestPro Software. Western Blotting—Splenic B cells from control and mutant mice were isolated by magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany), and membrane bound proteins were extracted as described earlier (17Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Extracts from 106 cells per lane were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes according to standard protocols. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies directed against Gα13 (1:1000), Gα12 (1:500), Gαi3 (1:500), and Gαq/11 (1:500) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or α-tubulin antibodies for loading control (Clone DM1a, 1:1000; Sigma). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000; Sigma) for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was developed using the ECLplus kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Statistics—Data are displayed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were performed with Student's t test. Multiple comparisons were performed with analysis of variance and Bonferroni's post hoc test. To test whether GPCR activation contributes to B cell adhesion in vitro, we incubated murine splenic lymphocytes on ICAM-1- or VCAM-1-coated dishes in the presence or absence of different GPCR agonists and determined the percentage of adherent follicular B or MZ B cells, respectively. We found that the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, as well as the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), strongly enhanced adhesion on ICAM-1-coated plastic in both cell types (Fig. 1, A and B). On VCAM-1-coated dishes, basal adhesion was generally lower, and although PMA induced a mild but significant increase in adhesion of both MZ B cells and follicular B cell (adherent FoB cells: basal, 4 ± 0.7%; PMA, 10.8 ± 2.8%; adherent MZ B cells: 4.1 ± 0.5%; PMA, 8.5 ± 1.5%; p < 0.05), CXCL12 and CXCL13 failed to induce significant increases in adhesion (data not shown). Interestingly, also the lysophospholipids S1P and LPA strongly enhanced adhesion to ICAM-1 in both cell types (Fig. 1, A and B), while adhesion to VCAM-1 was not affected (data not shown). While effects of CXCL12 and CXCL13 on B cell adhesion have been described before (18Okada T. Ngo V.N. Ekland E.H. Forster R. Lipp M. Littman D.R. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), no direct data exist with respect to lysophospholipid-induced ICAM-1 adhesion. To characterize the pro-adhesive effects of S1P and LPA in more detail, we first tested the involvement of LFA-1, the main interaction partner of ICAM-1 on lymphocytes (19Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We pretreated cells with blocking antibodies directed against LFA-1 α-chain CD11a or its β-chain CD18 and found that both treatments completely abrogated S1P- or LPA-induced adhesion of MZ B (Fig. 2A) and follicular B (Fig. 2B) cells, while pretreatment with isotype control antibodies did not affect adhesion. Two types of integrin activation have been described, enhanced affinity and increased clustering (20Hogg N. Henderson R. Leitinger B. McDowall A. Porter J. Stanley P. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and we found that treatment with 100 nm S1P or LPA significantly enhanced the number of LFA-1 clusters per control cell (Fig. 2C), while we failed to detect increased binding of soluble ICAM-1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that lysophospholipids stimulate B cell adhesion to ICAM-1 and that this process involves enhanced LFA-1 clustering. Since most LPA and S1P receptor subtypes can couple to Gi family G-proteins (23Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Takuwa Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of Gi in lysophospholipid-induced B cell adhesion. Pretreatment of cells with PTX strongly inhibited S1P- or LPA-induced adhesion (Figs. 3, A and B), suggesting that Gi family G-proteins are involved. A potential toxic effect of PTX-treatment on Gi-independent pathways in primary B cells can be ruled out, since LPA-induced RhoA activation was not impaired in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 7D).FIGURE 7Intracellular signaling cascades activated in response to LPA in control B cells (WT), Gα12/Gα13-deficient B cells (G12/G13-/-), and PTX-treated control cells (WT+PTX).

Cells were stimulated, fixed, permeabilized and stained with the following antibodies: for A, FITC-anti-ERK1/2, PerCP-anti-CD45R/B220, PE-anti-CD23 (gate on CD45R/B220pos;CD23neg MZ B and newly formed B cells); for B PE-anti-Akt, PerCP-anti-CD45R/B220, FITC-anti-CD21 (gate on CD45R/B220pos;CD21hi MZ B cells).

Scarpini E. Ottoboni L. Narumiya S. Butcher E.C. Constantin G. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2004; 20: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and we tested the effects of the cell permeable version of the RhoA inhibitor Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 (TAT-C3) (16Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) or the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 (26Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 273-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like PTX these toxins abrogated the pro-adhesive effects of S1P and LPA both in MZ B cells and in follicular B cells (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that also the RhoA/Rho-kinase cascade critically contributes to agonist-induced adhesion to ICAM. However, RhoA and Rho-kinase are not typically associated with activation of Gi but are rather a main effector pathway of the G12/G13 family of heterotrimeric G-proteins (27Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Since this G-protein family has also been shown to couple to LPA and S1P receptors subtypes (23Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Takuwa Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we tested lysophospholipid-induced adhesion in B cells from B cell-specific G12/G13-deficient mice. Most strikingly, the pro-adhesive effects of S1P and LPA were completely abrogated in Gα12/Gα13-deficient MZ B cells, and reduced in follicular B cells. In contrast, chemokine-induced adhesion was normal (Fig. 4, A and B). We performed dose response experiments for S1P and LPA and found that while control mice showed a bell-shaped dose-response curve with maximal effects at 100 nm, none of the tested S1P and LPA concentrations enhanced ICAM-1 adhesion in Gα12/Gα13-deficient B cells (Fig. 4, C-F). In line with this we found that S1P and LPA did not induce significant LFA-1 clustering in mutant cells (Fig. 4G). Also pretreatment with PTX caused an abrogation of LPA- and S1P-induced LFA-1 clustering (Fig. 4G). This shows that lysophospholipid receptors mediate their pro-adhesive effects on ICAM-1 not only through Gi family G-proteins but also through G12/G13 family G-proteins, and both G-protein families are required for LFA-1 clustering. To test whether genetic inactivation of G12/G13 leads to altered expression of Gi3 or Gq/G11, we performed Western blotting experiments with wild-type and Gα12/Gα13-deficient B cells. We did not find significant differences in the protein levels of these α-subunits between the two genotypes (Fig. 5A). To rule out that impaired agonist-induced adhesion is due to reduced integrin expression, we analyzed expression of CD11a and CD18 by flow cytometry. We did not find major differences in the distribution of fluorescence intensity between the two genotypes (Fig. 5B), suggesting that it is indeed integrin activation, and not integrin expression, that is impaired in Gα12/Gα13-deficient B cells. To exclude major differences in the expression levels of S1P and LPA receptors between control and mutant B cells we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions for the different receptor subtypes (Fig. 5C). As described by others (28Cinamon G. Matloubian M. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Low C. Lu T. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), MZ B cells and follicular B cells expressed the S1P receptor subtypes S1P1, S1P3, and S1P4, and expression was comparable between control and mutant B cells. In addition, we found that MZ B and follicular B cells expressed the LPA receptor subtypes LPA2, LPA3, and weakly also LPA1 (Fig. 5C). Of the recently described non-Edg family receptors LPA4 (29Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and LPA5 (30Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) only LPA4 was expressed in MZB cells. Also with respect to LPA receptor subtypes we did not find significant differences in expression levels between the genotypes (Fig. 5C). In addition to the G12/G13 family of G-proteins, the Gq/G11 family has been suggested to activate RhoA and Rho-kinase (31Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether lysophopsholipid-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 was impaired in B cells from B cell-specific Gαq/Gα11-deficient mice but did not find significant differences between the genotypes (Fig. 6, A and B). In these experiments both basal and agonist-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 was lower than in cells from B cell-specific Gα12/Gα13-deficient mice and their respective controls, which is most likely due to differences in the genetic background. We next investigated which downstream effectors are activated in response to LPA in control, G12/G13-deficient, or PTX-treated B cells. We found that LPA induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKBAkt (Akt) (Fig. 7, A-C) in wild-type cells. In addition, LPA induced activation of RhoA (Fig. 7D) in wild-type cells. Both ERK and Akt phosphorylation were completely abrogated in PTX-pretreated cells, while in G12/G13-deficient B cells Akt phosphorylation was normal and ERK phosphorylation only slightly reduced (Fig. 7, A-C). In contrast, PTX treatment did not affect the LPA-induced increase in active, GTP-bound RhoA, while LPA-induced RhoA activation was completely abrogated in G12/G13-deficient B cells (Fig. 7D). B cell-specific Gα12/Gα13-deficient mice show strongly reduced numbers of marginal zone B cells (11Rieken S. Sassmann A. Herroeder S. Wallenwein B. Moers A. Offermanns S. Wettschureck N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and we asked whether impaired agonist-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 might contribute to this phenotype. It has been suggested that integrin-mediated adhesion within the marginal zone contributes to MZ B cell homing by counteracting promigratory signals like CXCL13 from adjacent follicles (6Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. Science. 2002; 297: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether lysophospholipid-mediated enhancement of adhesion impairs migration toward CXCL13 in vitro. Since S1P exerts strong promigratory effects itself (28Cinamon G. Matloubian M. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Low C. Lu T. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and was also shown to facilitate chemokine-induced migration in splenic lymphocytes (34Yopp A.C. Ochando J.C. Mao M. Ledgerwood L. Ding Y. Bromberg J.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2913-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we used LPA in these experiments. We found that addition of LPA to the upper transwell chamber indeed resulted in a significant reduction of both basal (Fig. 8A, left) and CXCL13-induced (Fig. 8B, left) migration through ICAM-1-coated inserts in control cells. Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells did not differ from control cells with respect to basal or CXCL13-induced migration; however, the anti-migratory effect of LPA was strongly reduced in mutant cells (Fig. 8, A and B, right). This indicates that the lysophospholipid-induced inhibition of CXCL13-dependent B cell chemotaxis depends on the G12/G13-mediated signaling pathway. Inhibition of migration was not present on uncoated transwell inserts (Fig. 8, C and D) or VCAM-1 coated inserts (data not shown), suggesting that ICAM-1-mediated adhesion is underlying this effect. Taken together, these results show that not only chemokines, but also lysophospholipids, can enhance B cell adhesion to ICAM-1 in vitro. The pro-adhesive effects of lysophospholipids are mediated both through Gi family G-proteins and the G12/G13/RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, but do not involve Gq/G11 family G-proteins. Loss of lysophospholipid-induced adhesion causes disinhibition of migration in response to the follicular chemokine CXCL13, which might contribute to the abnormal localization of splenic B cell populations in B cell-specific G12/G13-deficient mice. The molecular mechanisms governing integrin-mediated adhesion of splenic B cells are not well understood. We show here that not only chemokines, but also lysophospholipids enhance adhesion of murine B cells to ICAM-1 in vitro, and that this process involves LFA-1 clustering. Integrin activation by non-chemokine GPCRs has been reported in a variety of cellular systems, e.g. for thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors in platelets (35Stouffer G.A. Smyth S.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), or for S1P in human and murine cell lines (38Yamamura S. Hakomori S. Wada A. Igarashi Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Paik J.H. Chae S. Lee M.J. Thangada S. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for a role of S1P in integrin-mediated processes comes from genetic or pharmacological inactivation of the S1P1 receptor, which causes impaired lymphocyte entry into secondary lymphoid organs (40Halin C. Scimone M.L. Bonasio R. Gauguet J.M. Mempel T.R. Quackenbush E. Proia R.L. von Mandala S. Andrian U.H. Blood. 2005; 106: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and dislocation of MZ B cells from the marginal zone (28Cinamon G. Matloubian M. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Low C. Lu T. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 41Vora K.A. Nichols E. Porter G. Cui Y. Keohane C.A. Hajdu R. Hale J. Neway W. Zaller D. Mandala S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also show that lysophospholipid-induced adhesion depends on both Gi and G12/G13 family G-proteins, while chemokine-induced adhesion does not require G12/G13. This finding is in line with the general assumption that chemokine GPCRs signal primarily through Gi family G-proteins (42Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar), while lysophospholipid receptors can utilize a variety of different G-protein families (23Siehler S. Manning D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is not completely clear why activation of Gi through chemokine receptors is sufficient to enhance adhesion to ICAM-1, while activation of lysophospholipid receptors requires both Gi and G12/G13 to do so. Possible explanations might be differences in the expression levels of chemokine versus lysophospholipid receptors or differences in the signaling efficiency of the respective receptors. MZ B cells and follicular B cells express the S1P receptor subtypes S1P1, S1P3, and S1P4 (28Cinamon G. Matloubian M. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Low C. Lu T. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and according to our results also LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3. While S1P1 and LPA3 are believed to activate predominantly Gi family G-proteins, LPA1, LPA2, S1P3, and S1P4 were shown to couple to both Gi and G12/G13 (24Takuwa Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 43Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1582: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our results show that the pro-adhesive effects of lysophospholipids are mediated both through G12/G13 and Gi-type G-proteins. Such co-operativity between different G-protein families has been described in other systems, e.g. in platelets, where activation of Gi-mediated signaling alone is unable to trigger full activation of integrin αIIbβ3 but requires co-activation of Gi and G12/G13 family G-proteins (45Dorsam R.T. Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47588-47595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 47Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39493-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of G-proteins, we were able to show that lysophospholipid-induced integrin activation involves the small GTPase RhoA and its effector Rho-kinase. This is consistent with a variety of studies showing an involvement of RhoA in integrin-mediated adhesion (25Giagulli C. Scarpini E. Ottoboni L. Narumiya S. Butcher E.C. Constantin G. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2004; 20: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 48Vielkind S. Gallagher-Gambarelli M. Gomez M. Hinton H.J. Cantrell D.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although G12/G13 are believed to be the major mediators of RhoA activation in response to GPCR stimulation, it has been shown that also Gq/G11 family G-proteins can activate RhoA (31Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Booden M.A. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4053-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We did not find differences with respect to lysophospholipid-induced adhesion between control and Gαq/Gα11-deficient B cells, while LPA-induced RhoA activation is completely abrogated in G12/G13-deficient B cells. Both findings strongly suggest that Gq/G11-mediated Rho activation is not critical in this setting, which is in line with the finding that ligand-induced RhoA activation through Gq/G11 occurs with lower potency than G12/G13-mediated Rho activation (33Vogt S. Grosse R. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28743-28749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We were able to show that LPA induces not only RhoA activation but also phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in MZ B cells and that the latter effect is predominantly mediated by Gi. Although our data do not prove that ERK- and Akt-phosphorylation are critically involved in the proadhesive effects of LPA, our findings suggest that in addition to the G12/13/RhoA/ROCK signaling cascade also Gi-mediated ERK and Akt phosphorylation are required for LPA-induced pro-adhesive effects in MZ B cells. B cell-specific Gα12/Gα13-deficient mice show strongly reduced numbers of splenic MZ B cells but not of follicular B cells (11Rieken S. Sassmann A. Herroeder S. Wallenwein B. Moers A. Offermanns S. Wettschureck N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This selective loss of MZ B cells has been attributed to a strong enhancement of migration in these cells (11Rieken S. Sassmann A. Herroeder S. Wallenwein B. Moers A. Offermanns S. Wettschureck N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but it seems likely that also impaired lysophospholipid-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 contributes to the phenotype. Lysophospholipids are highly abundant in the blood (51Hla T. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 52Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Small molecule antagonists of αLβ2 are under intense investigation as potential anti-inflammatory drugs. We describe for the first time a small molecule integrin agonist. A previously described α/β I allosteric inhibitor, compound 4, functions as an agonist of αLβ2 in Ca2+ and Mg2+and as an antagonist in Mn2+. We have characterized the mechanism of activation and its competitive and noncompetitive inhibition by different compounds. Although it stimulates ligand binding, compound 4 nonetheless inhibits lymphocyte transendothelial migration. Agonism by compound 4 results in accumulation of αLβ2 in the uropod, extreme uropod elongation, and defective de-adhesion. Small molecule integrin agonists open up novel therapeutic possibilities.

Integrins are a large family of α/β heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and transduce signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane. Integrin αLβ2 (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)) 5The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, lymphocyte function associated anti-gen-1; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; mCFP, monomeric cyan fluorescent protein; mYFP, monomeric yellow fluorescent protein. belongs to the β2 integrin subfamily and is constitutively expressed on all leukocytes. αLβ2 remains in a low affinity state in resting lymphocytes and undergoes dramatic conformational change during lymphocyte activation, which greatly increases its binding affinity for its ligands intercellular adhesion molecule-1, -2, and -3 (ICAM-1, -2, and -3). Regulation of αLβ2 activation is pivotal for controlling leukocyte trafficking and immune responses in health and diseases (1Anderson D.C. Smith C.W. Springer T.A. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B.

Furthermore, small molecule antagonists of αLβ2 have been discovered and are in development (11Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Cottens S. Takada Y. Hommel U.

Science. 2002; 295: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). αLβ2 contains two von Willebrand factor-type A domains, the inserted (I) domains in the αL and the β2 subunits (18Humphries M.J.

Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Both αL I and β2 I domains have a Rossman fold (i.e. a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices) with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) formed by β-α loops at the “top” face of the domain (20Shimaoka M.

In ligand binding the Mg2+ ion in the MIDAS of the αL I domain coordinates directly to a Glu residue that is in the center of the ligand binding sites in domain 1 of ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 (20Shimaoka M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3366-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The affinity of the αL I domain for ICAMs is regulated by downward axial displacement of its C-terminal α7 helix, which is conformationally linked to reshaping of MIDAS loops and increases affinity for ligand by up to 10,000-fold (25Shimaoka M.

Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). During activation, the β I domain undergoes similar α7 helix downward axial movement, which is induced by the swing out of the hybrid domain (27Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A.

Previous data suggested that when activated, the β2 I domain binds (through the Mg2+ in its MIDAS) to the Glu residue (Glu-310) in the C-terminal linker of the αL I domain, exerts a downward pull on its α7 helix, and thereby activates the αL I domain (Fig. 1A) (32Alonso J.L.

Two distinct classes of small molecule antagonists of αLβ2 have been developed as anti-inflammatory agents. One group of antagonists binds the hydrophobic pocket underneath the α7 helix of the αL I domain (e.g. LFA703 or BIRT377), blocks the downward axial movement of the α7 helix, and inhibits ligand binding of αLβ2 allosterically by stabilizing the αL I domain in the low affinity conformation (11Weitz-Schmidt G.

The other group of antagonists appears to bind to the β2 I domain MIDAS near a key regulatory interface with the αL I domain, blocking communication of conformational change to the αL I domain while at the same time activating conformational rearrangements elsewhere in integrins (35Fotouhi, N., Gillespie, P., Guthrie, R., Pietranico-Cole, S., and Yun, W.

These antagonists, such as compounds 3 and 4 from Genentech and XVA143 from Hoffmann-La Roche, are called α/β I allosteric inhibitors (Fig. 1B). In this report, however, we describe that compound 4, previously regarded as an α/β I allosteric inhibitor based on studies in Mn2+, actually activates αLβ2 under physiological conditions in Ca2+, and Mg2+ and inhibits integrin-dependent functions by perturbing de-adhesion.

Kelly (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ridgeway, CT). Cell Isolation and Culture—K562 transfectants expressing wild-type and mutant αLβ2 were described (40Lu C. Springer T.A. J.

Preparation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and interleukin-2-cultured primary lymphocytes was previously described (41Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and cultured as confluent monolayers on fibronectin (10 μg/ml) coated on glass coverslips or ΔT live-cell imaging chambers (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) in EGM-2 complete media (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Binding of Soluble ICAM-1—Binding of soluble ICAM-1-IgA Fc fusion protein complexed with affinity-purified, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgA was measured by flow cytometry (37Shimaoka M.

Cell Adhesion to Immobilized ICAM-1—Binding of fluorescently labeled transfectants to immobilized ICAM-1 was as described (40Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ICAM-1-IgG Fc fusion protein at 10 μg/ml was immobilized on microtiter plates previously coated with 20 μg/ml protein A and blocked with 2% human serum albumin. Binding of transfectants to immobilized ICAM-1 was determined in Hepes, NaCl, glucose, bovine serum albumin (BSA; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml glucose, 1% BSA) supplemented with divalent cations and compounds as indicated. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, unbound cells were washed off, and bound cells were quantitated (40Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Chamber Assay—Binding and detachment in shear flow of αLβ2 transfectants on immobilized ICAM-1 substrates was done in a parallel plate flow chamber as described (42Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. von Harwood C. Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay—FRET assay using αL-monomeric cyan fluorescent protein (mCFP)/β2-monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (mYFP) K562 stable transfectants was as described (43Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Cell Migration Assays—Lymphocyte transendothelial migration assays were as described (41Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Briefly, before each experiment confluent HUVEC monolayers were activated for 12 h with TNF-α (100 ng/ml). HUVECs were then washed 3 times in buffer A (Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1% human serum albumin). Interleukin 2-cultured primary human lymphocytes were pelleted, resuspended at 100,000 cells/ml in 500 μl of buffer A containing compound 4 (1 μm), compound 5 (1 μm), BIRT377 (20 μm), or CBR LFA-1/2 Fab (20 μg/ml) and then added to HUVECs and incubated at 37 °C for 10 or 60 min. Samples were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and stained for leukocyte αL integrin (TS2/4 mAb conjugated to Cy3), endothelial cell ICAM-1 (IC1/11 mAb conjugated to Alexa488), and F-actin (phalliodin-Alexa647; Molecular Probes) as described (41Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Imaging was conducted using Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Laser-scanning confocal microscope system. For each condition complete Z-stacks (0.5 μm thickness) were obtained in each of ten randomly selected fields. Using LaserSharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad) Z-stacks were analyzed (based on previously described criteria (41Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar)) to determine the number of cells in the process of, or having completed diapedesis. Morphological analysis of the apically adherent lymphocyte population was based both on the overall cell shape and the distribution of actin and αLβ2. Cells exhibiting generally even actin and αLβ2 distributions and either spherical or symmetrically spread shapes were designated as “round” or “spread”, respectively. Cells exhibiting polarized shapes with an actin-enriched leading edge and roughly even distribution of LFA-1 were designated “polarized”. Cells that exhibited both extended uropods and sequestration of the majority of the cellular LFA-1 to the uropod were designated as “X-polarized” (i.e. extremely polarized). For live-cell experiments confluent TNF-α-activated HUVEC monolayers were prepared on Bioptechs ΔT imaging chambers, rinsed three times with buffer A, and maintained at 37 °C. Lymphocytes (100,000) were added to the chambers, and differential interference contract images were acquired (using a Zeiss Axiovert S200 epifluorescence microscope (Germany) equipped with a 63× oil objective coupled to a Hamamatsu Orca CCD (Japan)) at 5-s intervals over a course of 30 min. Cell migration was analyzed by manually tracing the outline of each cell in selected frames (i.e. at 180-s intervals) for each time course. Lines connecting the centroid of each cell outline (auto-matically calculated by OpenLab software) were generated to represent the migration path or “track” followed by each lymphocyte. The total length of the cell tracks was divided by the total time interval during which the track was recorded to calculate average migration velocity. The linear distance between the beginning and endpoint of each track was measured to determine the overall displacement of each cell. Measurement of cell lateral migration parameters was restricted to lymphocytes during their migration over the apical surface of the endothelium and discontinued upon diapedesis across the endothelial monolayer to the subendothelial space. The percentage of diapedesis was obtained by dividing the number of cells that initiated diapedesis by the total number of migrating cells. To analyze the qualitative details of migration behavior, representative cells were traced at 50-s intervals. The distance separating the centroid of the cell in the initial frame and the centroid of the cell at each subsequent interval was plotted against the cumulative time elapsed. Online Supplemental Material—Supplemental Videos 1 and 2 are representative videos of lymphocyte migration in the absence (Video 1) and presence (Video 2) of compound 4 as described in Figs. 7, C and D, respectively. K562 cells expressing αLβ2 showed little binding to soluble multimeric ICAM-1 in Ca2+/Mg2+ (Fig. 2A), whereas binding was greatly increased by Mn2+ (Fig. 2B) or the activating mAb CBR LFA-1/2 (Fig. 2C). In Mn2+, compounds 3-5 potently inhibited soluble, multimeric ICAM-1 binding by αLβ2 (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous observations (17Gadek T.R. Burdick D.J. McDowell R.S. Stanley M.S. Marsters Jr., J.C. Paris K.J. Oare D.A. Reynolds M.E. Ladner C. Zioncheck K.A. Lee W.P. Gribling P. Dennis M.S. Skelton N.J. Tumas D.B. Clark K.R. Keating S.M. Beresini M.H. Tilley J.W. Presta L.G.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in physiologic cations (i.e. 1mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2) we found, unexpectedly, that compound 4 greatly increased ligand binding, whereas compounds 3 and 5 had no effect (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, activation of αLβ2 binding to ICAM-1 in Ca2+/Mg2+ by CBR LFA-1/2 mAb was further increased by compound 4 but inhibited by compounds 3 and 5 (Fig. 2C). Next we assessed the effects of these compounds on physiologic leukocytes (i.e. primary human PBMCs). The PBMCs showed weak binding to soluble multimeric ICAM-1 in Ca2+/Mg2+ alone and significant binding in Mn2+ alone (Fig. 2D). Consistent with our observations with K562 transfectants (Fig. 2, A-C), compound 4 strongly increased binding of soluble ICAM-1 to PBMCs in Ca2+/Mg2+ but inhibited Mn2+-induced binding (Fig. 2D). Both compound 4- and Mn2+-induced ICAM-1 binding was αLβ2-dependent, as such binding was completely inhibited by the αL I domain-specific blocking antibody TS2/14 (Fig. 2D). The activating effect of compound 4 was confirmed and further analyzed using static cell adhesion and flow chamber assays. In the static cell adhesion assay, K562 cells expressing αLβ2 were allowed to adhere to immobilized ICAM-1, and the unbound cells were removed with an automatic plate washer. In the presence of Ca2+/Mg2+ alone very little cell adhesion was observed, whereas in the presence of Mn2+ alone adhesion was greatly enhanced (Fig. 2E). The addition of either compound 4 or 5 abolished Mn2+-induced adhesion. In contrast, in Ca2+/Mg2+ compound 4, but not compound 5, greatly increased cell adhesion (Fig. 2E). In a flow chamber assay, K562 cells expressing αLβ2 showed weak rolling and firm adhesion to immobilized ICAM-1 in Ca2+/Mg2+ (Fig. 2F). As demonstrated previously, the addition of compound 5 in Ca2+/Mg2 significantly increased rolling adhesion, and Mn2+ increased firm adhesion (42Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. von Harwood C. Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). At a shear stress of 2 dyn/cm2, compound 4 in Ca2+/Mg2+ induced firm adhesion to a similar extent as observed with Mn2+ alone. Under a high shear regime of 32 dyn/cm2 compound 4 still promoted significant adhesion (Fig. 2F). However, the total number of rolling and firmly adherent cells was reduced by about half, whereas the amount of adhesion in Mn2+ alone remained essentially unchanged. Thus, αLβ2 adhesiveness induced by compound 4 is less shear-resistant than adhesiveness induced by Mn2+. The Activating Effect of Compound 4 Is Inhibited by Compound 5 Competitively—Compound 4 and compound 5 have homologous structures, and our previous findings suggested that both compounds bind to the MIDAS of the β2 I domain (37Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in Ca2+/Mg2+, compound 4 was activating, whereas compound 5 was inhibitory to wild type αLβ2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, we studied whether ICAM-1 binding to αLβ2 in Ca2+/Mg2+ stimulated by compound 4 could be competitively inhibited by compound 5. We found that αLβ2 activation by 50 nm compound 4 was reversed by compound 5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the inhibitory dose-response curve of compound 5 was shifted significantly to the right in the presence of a higher concentration (1 μm) of compound 4 (Fig. 3A). Such concentration dependence demonstrates a competitive mode of inhibition. Binding to ICAM-1 stimulated by compound 4 was also inhibited by an α I allosteric inhibitor, LFA703, that binds the hydrophobic pocket underneath the α7 helix of the αL I domain (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibitory dose-response curve of LFA703 was identical with 50 and 1000 nm compound 4, demonstrating non-competitive inhibition. Compound 4 and Mn2+ Activate αLβ2 by Different Mechanisms—The interaction between the β2 MIDAS and an acidic residue in the C-terminal linker of α I domains, e.g. Glu-310 in αL, is indispensable for Mn2+-induced activation of β2 integrins (32Alonso J.L.

Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mutation of either the metal-coordinating MIDAS residue Ser-114 in the β2 I domain or Glu-310 in the αL I domain C-terminal linker totally abolished Mn2+-induced ICAM-1 binding (Fig. 4). Mutation of another nearby acidic residue in the C-terminal linker of the αL I domain, αL-E316, only partially reduced Mn2+-induced ligand binding and served as a control (Fig. 4). Consistent with our previous conclusion that compound 4 binds to the MIDAS of the β2 I domain (37Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the β2 Ser-114 mutation completely abolished both inhibition of ICAM-1 binding in Mn2+ by compound 4 and stimulation of ICAM-1 binding in Ca2+/Mg2+ by compound 4 (Fig. 4). Despite the absolute requirement for αL-Glu-310 in Mn2+-induced ICAM-1 binding by αLβ2, compound 4 was able to activate binding to ICAM-1 by the αL-E310A mutant, demonstrating that compound 4 activates αLβ2 by a mechanism that is distinct from that of Mn2+. Susceptibility to αLβ2 Inhibitory Antibodies—mAbs exist that inhibit αLβ2 function by distinct mechanisms. Whereas some mAbs bind to the αL I domain and competitively block ICAM-1 binding, other αL I domain and β2 I domain mAbs block ICAM-1 binding indirectly through allosteric mechanisms (34Lu C.

We compared inhibition by a panel of these mAbs of CBR LFA-1/2-activated αLβ2 (wild type + mAb); αL-Glu-310C/β2-A210C (CC), an αLβ2 mutant that is constitutively activated by introducing an intersubunit disulfide bond between residue 210 in a β2 I domain MIDAS loop and the αL-Glu-310 residue (33Yang W.

The αL-E310C/β2-A210C mutant and wild-type αLβ2 activated by compound 4 showed almost identical susceptibility, i.e. they were inhibited by both the competitive αL I domain mAbs and the allosteric TS2/14 αL I domain mAb, were partially inhibited by mAb to Glu-175 in the specificity-determining loop of the β2 I domain, and were resistant to mAbs to residues in the α1 helix (133) and α7 helix (332 and 339) of the β2 I domain.TABLE 1Inhibition by αL I and β2 I domain antibodies of multimeric ICAM-1 binding to αLβ2 mutantsmAbDomainEpitopeInhibitionWT + mAbCCWT + #4HA%TS2/6αL I154-18397969997May.035αL ILys-197, His-20198989997MHM24αL ILys-19796979896TS1/22αL IGln-266, Ser-27096979692TS2/14αL ISer-270, Glu-27299999914May.017β2 IGlu-175, ?9870823MHM23β2 IGlu-1759740122TS1/18β2 IArg-133, His-33298400YFC51β2 IArg-133, His-33298200CLB LFA-1/1β2 IHis-332, Asn-33997200 Open table in a new tab Effect of Compounds on αLβ2 Conformation—mAbs m24 and KIM127 represent reporters for αLβ2 active conformations. Whereas m24 recognizes the active conformation of the β2 I domain, KIM127 binds to an epitope in the β2 EGF2 domain that is buried in the bent (i.e. latent) integrin conformation and exposed in the extended (i.e. active) conformation. Compounds 3-5 induced exposure of the m24 and KIM127 epitopes on cell surface αLβ2 with similar dose responses (Fig. 5A and B), in agreement with previous measurements on purified αLβ2 with compounds 4 and 5 (37Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We previously developed a FRET method to monitor the spatial proximity of αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains in living cells by fusing mCFP and mYFP to the C termini of αL and β2, respectively (43Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Efficient FRET can only be observed when the cytoplasmic tails of αL and β2 (and, therefore, the fused mCFP and mYFP) are in close proximity. Consistent with our previous observations (43Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), we found here that stable K562 cell transfectants expressing αL-mCFP/β2-mYFP exhibited a significant FRET signal under basal conditions and that FRET was significantly decreased by treatment with Mn2+ plus soluble monomeric ICAM-1 (Fig. 5C). Exposure to either compound 4 or 5 in Ca2+/Mg2+ also statistically significantly reduced FRET, although to a somewhat lesser extent. These data suggest that compounds 4 and 5, consistent with induction of exposure of the m24 and KIM127 epitopes (Fig. 5, A and B), induce spatial separation of the αL and β2 cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 5C). Compounds 4 and 5 Inhibit Lymphocyte Transendothelial Migration by Distinct Mechanisms—To assess the effects of compounds on transendothelial migration, i.e. diapedesis, we monitored migration of interleukin-2-cultured primary human lymphocytes through TNF-α-activated HUVEC monolayers in medium with Ca2+/Mg2+ by confocal microscopy. Under control conditions, efficient lymphocyte transendothelial migration was observed (∼45% by 10 min and ∼70% by 60 min). Compared with control, compound 4, compound 5, and BIRT377, an α I allosteric antagonist (Fig. 6A), all inhibited transendothelial migration by greater than 2-fold. Interestingly, Fab fragments of the αLβ2-activating antibody, CBR LFA-1/2, also produced a comparable inhibition of diapedesis (Fig. 6A). Despite similarity in overall extent of inhibition of diapedesis, morphological analysis (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) revealed dramatic differences among these antagonists (Fig. 6, B-D). Under control conditions (Me2SO), the majority of the cells were polarized, whereas the remaining cells were equally divided into round and spread populations. In the presence of either compound 5 or BIRT377, the polarized cell population was reduced by greater than 2-fold, and the round cell population was dominant (Fig. 6, C and D). In stark contrast, for both compound 4 and CBR LFA-1/2 Fab treatments, the major cell population was in an unphysiologic “extremely polarized” (X-"
https://openalex.org/W2086265440,"We describe here the interactions of CCR8 with its ligands using both CCR8 transfectants and a T-cell line expressing the receptor endogenously. Of the CCR8 agonists reported previously, only CCL1 and vMIP-I exhibited potency in assays of intracellular calcium flux, chemotaxis, and receptor internalization, this latter mechanism being dependent upon the expression of β-arrestins 1 and 2 but independent of Gαi signaling. NH2-terminal extension of the mature CCL1 sequence by a serine residue (Ser-CCL1) resulted in a partial agonist with a reduced affinity for CCR8, suggesting that the NH2 terminus of the ligand plays a role in ligand binding to an intrahelical site. Attempts to identify key residues within this site revealed that the conserved glutamic acid residue in transmembrane helix 7, Glu-286, is crucial for trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface, while Asp-97 of transmembrane helix 2 is dispensable. CCL7 was found to inhibit both Ser-CCL1 and vMIP-I responses but not those of CCL1 itself. Similarly, vMIP-I responses were more than 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive to the specific CCR8 antagonist MC148 than those induced by CCL1, which is difficult to reconcile with the reported affinities for the receptor. Collectively, these data suggest that the CCR8 ligands are allotropic, binding to distinct sites within CCR8 and that the human immune system may have evolved to use CCL7 as a selective antagonist of viral chemokine activity at CCR8 but not those of the host ligand.

The mammalian immune system can be organized into innate and adaptive immunity with the directed movement of leukocytes being of paramount importance to the effectiveness of both systems. This is mediated largely by the chemokine family of proteins, whose activity is mediated by seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors expressed on the leukocyte cell surface. Inadvertent or excessive production of chemokines has been implicated in the inflammatory components of many clinically important diseases (1Charo I.F. Ransohoff R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar) and the development of specific antagonists to inhibit chemokine receptor function remains a goal of the pharmaceutical industry (2Wells T.N. Power C.A. Shaw J.P. Proudfoot A.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The chemokine receptor CCR8 is expressed on lymphocytes of the Th2 lineage (3Zingoni A. Soto H. Hedrick J.A. Stoppacciaro A. Storlazzi C.T. Sinigaglia F. D'Ambrosio D. O'Garra A. Robinson D.

The level of infiltrating CCR8-expressing Th2 cells has been correlated with the severity of asthmatic responses in challenged individuals (5Panina-Bordignon P. Papi A. Mariani M. Di Lucia P.

CCR8 has also been shown to be involved in the migration of dendritic cells from the lymph nodes (9Gombert M. Dieu-Nosjean M.C. Winterberg F. Bunemann E. Kubitza R.C. Da Cunha L. Haahtela A.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 5082-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest that CCR8 also plays a role in the innate immune response, with CCR8 negatively correlated with the effective innate immune responses during models of septic peritonitis (10Matsukawa A.

Moreover, viruses have effectively targeted this receptor. Genes encoding polypeptide agonists and antagonists of CCR8 are present in the genomes of human herpesvirus-8 (16Dairaghi D.J. Fan R.A.

In this paper we re-address the repertoire of chemokines that activate CCR8 and dissect the molecular signature necessary for receptor activation by different ligands. Materials—Reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) and Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) unless stated otherwise. Recombinant human CCL1, vMIP-I, and MC148 were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK), all other chemokines were human orthologues and were acquired from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK). The monoclonal mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) 4The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; WT, wild type; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TM, transmembrane. antibody was purchased from Covance Research Products (Berkley, CA), and its corresponding IgG1 isotype control antibody was from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Dako cytomation (Ely, UK). Generation of HA-CCR8 and Point Mutants—The cDNA encoding human CCR8 was tagged at the 5′ region with a sequence encoding the HA-epitope as described previously for CCR4 (19Jopling L.A. Sabroe I. Andrew D.P. Mitchell T.J. Li Y. Hodge M.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6864-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This results in an NH2-terminally HA-tagged construct when expressed in the pcDNA3 vector. Point mutants of human CCR8 were generated by PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Verification of mutation was performed by DNA sequencing on both strands (MWG Biotech, London, UK). Cell Culture—The murine pre-B lymphoma cell lines L1.2 and 4DE4 and the human T lymphoma cell line HUT-78 were maintained in suspension in HEPES-modified RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 × minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids at 37 °C with 5% CO2 at a density of no more than 1 × 106 cells/ml. 4DE4 cells transfected with CCR8 as described previously (11Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were cultured in medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418). L1.2 cells were transfected transiently by electroporation with 1 μg DNA/1 × 106 cells, as described previously (20Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and incubated overnight in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate to increase responsiveness. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from WT mice and those deficient in β-arrestins 1 and 2 were maintained and electroporated with 1 μg DNA/1 × 106 cells, as described previously (21Kohout T.A.

Flow Cytometry—Approximately 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3 in HEPES-modified phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-HA antibody or the corresponding IgG1 isotype control in 100 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer for 20 min. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and incubated with 50 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 20 min in 50 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer. After this time, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 400 μl of FACS buffer before being analyzed by flow cytometry, as described previously (20Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Intracellular staining was assessed with the addition of 0.1% saponin to the FACS buffer. Chemotaxis Assay—The chemotactic responsiveness of cells was ascertained using ChemoTx™ plates (Receptor Technologies Ltd., Oxon, UK), as described previously (11Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of chemokine in duplicate were applied in a final volume of 31 μl to the lower wells of a chemotaxis chamber. 2 × 105 cells were applied to the filter, and following a 5 h incubation (3 h for CCR8–4DE4 cells) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2, the number of migrating cells traversing a 5-μm pore filter were counted using a hemocytometer. Data are shown as the percentage of migrating cells. Intracellular Calcium Measurements—These were performed as described previously (23Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using 4DE4-CCR8 cells loaded with the fluorescent dye Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were stimulated with the appropriate chemokine and real-time data were recovered using a fluorimeter (LS-50B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data are expressed as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential stimulation at 340 and 380 nm. Internalization Assay—Chemokine receptor internalization was assessed by the loss of cell surface receptor expression, as determined by flow cytometry using an antibody directed against the HA-tag introduced into the CCR8 protein sequence. 5 × 106 cells were resuspended, in duplicate in 100 μl of ice-cold culture medium. One duplicate also received the addition of 100 nm chemokine. All samples were then incubated at 37 °C for the required duration, before washing, staining, and receptor expression analysis by flow cytometry. Alternatively, for the dose-response assays, cells in duplicate were resuspended in culture medium containing various concentrations of chemokine. One of these samples was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, while the other remained on ice throughout the assay. The remaining receptor expression was calculated using the following equation: 100 × [(mean fluorescence of chemokine treated cells at 37 °C – mean fluorescence of negative control cells)/(mean fluorescence of chemokine treated cells at 4 °C – mean fluorescence of negative control cells)], where negative control cells were buffer-treated cells stained with an IgG1 isotype control antibody. Competitive Radioligand Binding Assay—Whole cell binding assays on 4DE4 cells expressing human CCR8 stably were performed as described previously (23Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), using 0.1 nm 125I-CCL1 purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, UK) and various concentrations of unlabeled chemokine competitor. A Canberra Packard Cobra 5010 γ-counter (Canberra Packard, Pangebourne, UK) was used to assess the level of competition for binding of 125I-CCL1 with the receptor. Purification and Analysis of CCL1—CCL1 was purified and analyzed from conditioned medium from megakaryocytic cells as described previously (24Struyf S. Burdick M.D. Proost P. Van Damme J. Strieter R.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, following fractionation by heparin-Sepharose chromatography and Mono S cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, CCL1 immunoreactivity was purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and eluted from the C8 column by an acetonitrile gradient, while absorbance was measured at 220 nm. The amino-terminal sequence of mature CCL1 in fraction 43 was confirmed by automated Edman degradation on a 491 Procise cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). CCL1 immunoreactivity was measured by a sandwich ELISA using monoclonal anti-human CCL1 (R&D Systems) and polyclonal anti-human CCL1 (Peprotech) as capture and detection antibodies, respectively. GTPγS Assays—Membrane fractions were prepared from TK–143 cells infected with vΔB8R-7LHAN or vΔB8R and assayed for their ability to bind [35S]GTPγS in response to stimulation by various concentrations of chemokine, as described previously (25Najarro P. Lee H.J. Fox J. Pease J. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data and Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the stated number of experiments and were analyzed with the application of a relevant statistical test, where appropriate, using PRISM software (GraphPad PRISM v4.03, San Diego, CA). CCL1 and vMIP-I Are Potent CCR8 Agonists—Initial experiments were performed using the 4DE4 cell line that expresses CCR8 stably (11Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We focused upon the ligand repertoire of CCR8, examining reported human CCR8 agonists in assays of chemotaxis and intracellular calcium release. CCL1 induced migration of CCR8–4DE4 cells with a typical “bell-shaped” profile with 1 nm CCL1 inducing optimal migration (Fig. 1A). However, CCL4, CCL16, and CCL17 were unable to induce any significant migration of these cells. In contrast, the virally encoded chemokine vMIP-I induced CCR8–4DE4 cell migration with a very similar profile to that of CCL1, which is surprising when one considers they share only 32% amino acid identity. These chemotaxis results were also replicated in the HUT-78 cell line that expresses CCR8 constitutively (data not shown). In keeping with these data, in assays measuring the change in [Ca2+]i following stimulation with 25 nm of ligand, only CCL1 and vMIP-I were capable of provoking Ca2+ release from 4DE4-CCR8 transfectants (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas CCL4, CCL16 and CCL17 were without effect (Fig. 1, D–F). CCL1 and vMIP-1 Induce the Internalization of CCR8 via a β-Arrestin-dependent, Pertussis Toxin-independent Pathway— Following incubation with ligand, chemokine receptors typically undergo endocytosis. Generally this is assayed by flow cytometry using receptor specific antibodies. However, the lack of CCR8-specific antibodies that work efficiently in this application has hampered progress in this area. Therefore, we used an HA epitope-tagged CCR8 construct that was expressed transiently in the L1.2 cell line. Significant cell surface CCR8 expression was observed, as ascertained by flow cytometric analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and a relevant isotype control (Fig. 2A). Cell surface expression of HA-CCR8 was reduced following treatment of the cells with 100 nm CCL1 for 20 min at 37 °C (Fig. 2A), suggesting that like other chemokine receptors, CCR8 also undergoes ligand-induced internalization. We subsequently extended these studies to assess both the time course and the dose-responsive nature of this process by treating cells with either CCL1 or vMIP-I (Fig. 2, B and C). The process of internalization was extremely rapid, reaching a maximum within 10 min of incubation with chemokine. In keeping with the previous chemotaxis data, both ligands were equally potent in inducing CCR8 internalization. In contrast, treatment with buffer alone had no significant effect on CCR8 cell surface levels. As reported for other chemokine receptors, the process by which HA-CCR8 is internalized is independent of Gαi protein coupling, because pretreatment of the CCR8 expressing cells with pertussis toxin had no effect on the ability of CCL1 to induce receptor endocytosis (Fig. 2D). In contrast, chemotaxis of the same pertussis toxin-treated cells in response to 1 nm CCL1 was completely ablated (data not shown). Next we addressed the intracellular mechanism by which CCR8 undergoes endocytosis. This was undertaken by the transient expression of HA-CCR8 in MEFs derived from both WT and mice deficient in β-arrestins 1 and 2 (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). HA-CCR8 was expressed efficiently in both cell types and its internalization in response to CCL1 was observed in WT MEFs (Fig. 3A), with ∼60% of cell surface CCR8 levels internalized over a 20 min time period. In contrast, the internalization of HA-CCR8 was negligible in MEFs from β-arrestin1/2-deficient mice, suggesting a critical role for β-arrestins in the internalization of CCR8 in these cells. This was supported further by dose-response experiments with little internalization of CCR8 observed in β-arrestin1/2-deficient MEFs at concentrations of CCL1 up to 100 nm (Fig. 3B). Amino-terminal Modification of CCL1 Produces a Partial Agonist of Human CCR8—One of the original reports of CCL1 in the literature described the purification of a 73-amino acid protein following the transfection of COS cells with the corresponding cDNA (26Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Data sheets accompanying two commercial sources of CCL1 (both recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli) stated that they differed by a single amino acid, with one form possessing an additional serine residue at the amino terminus when compared with the published primary sequence of the mature peptide. We named this extended form Ser-CCL1. In chemotaxis assays using the 4DE4-CCR8 line (Fig. 4A) and the HUT-78 cell line (Fig. 4B), Ser-CCL1 exhibited both a 10-fold lower potency and a reduced efficacy when compared with CCL1, suggesting that, in this assay at least, Ser-CCL1 is a partial agonist of CCR8. This is reminiscent of the activity of mutant forms of CCL5, AOP-RANTES (27Proudfoot A.E. Buser R. Borlat F. Alouani S. Soler D. Offord R.E. Schroder J.M. Power C.A. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32478-32485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), where additions to the amino terminus reduced function severely, presumably by hindering access of the chemokine to an activation site within the receptor. We subsequently determined the NH2-terminal sequence of natural CCL1. CCL1 was purified to homogeneity from the supernatants of megakaryocytic cells (Fig. 4C) and subsequent amino-terminal sequencing revealed that the major product was the 73 amino acid form of CCL1 described by Miller and Krangel (26Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which lacks a serine residue at the amino terminus. We consequently used Ser-CCL1 as a tool to examine the structural requirements for CCR8 activation. In keeping with the chemotaxis data, displacement of 125I-CCL1 from 4DE4-CCR8 cells by Ser-CCL1 was reduced by an order of magnitude when compared with CCL1 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that in addition to activating the receptor, the amino-terminal portion of the chemokine makes a significant contribution to receptor binding. CCL7, which was reported to compete for CCL1 binding to both CCR8 (16Dairaghi D.J. Fan R.A. McMaster B.E. Hanley M.R. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21569-21574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and to a poxviral orthologue 7L (25Najarro P. Lee H.J. Fox J. Pease J. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), displaced 125I-CCL1 weakly with 50% displacement only apparent with a 1000-fold excess of cold competing CCL7. To assess whether these partial agonist properties of Ser-CCL1 were specific for the human receptor, we used cells expressing 7L, an orthologue of CCR8 encoded by Yaba-like disease virus that shares 53% amino acid identity with CCR8 (25Najarro P. Lee H.J. Fox J. Pease J. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Lee H.J. Essani K. Smith G.L.

Virol. 2006; 87: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). G protein activation following stimulation with both CCL1 and Ser-CCL1 was assessed by GTPγS assays using membranes from both 7L and mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast to the data obtained with human CCR8, Ser-CCL1 was a slightly more potent ligand than CCL1, with both forms of the chemokine inducing similar levels of maximal stimulation. Thus, it appears that the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of 7L are distinct from those governing CCR8 activation. E286 of TM7 Is Critical for CCR8 Trafficking to the Cell Surface—Previous structure/function analysis of chemokine receptors has suggested a two-step model of receptor activation in which the chemokine is initially bound by the amino terminus of the receptor, facilitating the subsequent delivery of the amino terminus of the chemokine to an intrahelical binding site. This latter step results in signaling (30Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 33Blanpain C. Doranz B.J.

Since the additional serine residue at the amino terminus of Ser-CCL1 reduced its affinity for CCR8 by an order of magnitude (Fig. 5A), we postulated that the serine residue might inhibit access to an intrahelical pocket within the receptor and that the amino terminus of the chemokine itself contributes significantly to receptor binding. Analysis of the primary sequence of CCL1 shows that it is unusually basic, with lysine and arginine residues at positions 1 and 9 of the mature peptide. We hypothesized that these residues might form ionic interactions with acidic residues within the transmembrane (TM) helices of CCR8. Only two acidic amino acids reside within this region, namely Asp-97 of TM2 and Glu-286 of TM7, which are highly conserved among chemokine receptors and class A GPCRs in general. Therefore, we mutated these residues of the HA-CCR8 cDNA to generate alleles encoding asparagine and glutamine residues at the respective positions. Transient expression of both constructs together with HA-CCR8 was carried out in L1.2 cells as before. While the D97N-CCR8 mutant was expressed on the surface of cells at levels similar to those of HA-CCR8, the E286Q construct was absent, with staining of these cells at levels similar to that of the mock transfection (Fig. 6A). Intracellular staining of the same cells indicated that despite poor cell surface expression, the E286Q protein was produced at levels comparable with HA-CCR8 (Fig. 6B). At a functional level, cells expressing the D97N-CCR8 mutant showed identical chemotactic profiles to WT-CCR8 when migrating in response to CCL1, Ser-CCL1, and vMIP-I (Fig. 7, A–C). Unsurprisingly, a migratory response to all three chemokines was absent in cells transfected with the E286Q-CCR8 cDNA. These data indicate that the amino acid Glu-286 in TM domain 7 is critical for efficient cell surface expression of CCR8, while Asp-97 is dispensable for both effective receptor expression and CCR8 activation.FIGURE 7The highly conserved residue Asp-97 is dispensable for CCR8 mediated chemotaxis. A–C show the migration of L1.2 cells expressing WT-CCR8, D97N-CCR8 or E286Q-CCR8 in response to CCL1 (A), Ser-CCL1 (B), or vMIP-I (C).

Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both this and previous studies have indicated that CCL7 can bind to both human CCR8 (16Dairaghi D.J. Fan R.A. McMaster B.E. Hanley M.R.

Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it was predicted that this chemokine might also be an antagonist at CCR8. To test this hypothesis, pretreatment with CCL7 was used in an attempt to inhibit ligand-induced [Ca2+]i release. Fig. 8, A and B, show that CCL1 responses were unperturbed by pretreatment with an equimolar amount of CCL7 and that CCL7 alone was unable to induce a detectable calcium flux. In keeping with this latter finding, neither CCR8–4DE4 cells nor HUT-78 cells migrated toward CCL7 in chemotaxis assays (data not shown) nor was CCL7 able to induce CCR8 internalization in L1.2 transfectants (data not shown). In contrast to their effect upon CCL1 stimulation, the Ca2+ responses to vMIP-I and Ser-CCL1 were reduced markedly by CCL7 pretreatment (Fig. 8, C–F). CCL7 pretreatment had no effect on the subseq"
https://openalex.org/W1991501883,"Despite considerable similarity in their amino acid sequences and structural features, the mammalian members of the CLC chloride channel/transporter family have different subcellular locations. The subcellular location and function of one of these members, hClC-4, is controversial. To characterize its cellular function, we investigated its tissue distribution and subcellular location. Expression was high in excitable tissues such as the nervous system and skeletal muscle. When heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and in skeletal muscle fibers, hClC-4 localizes to the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) membranes, in contrast to hClC-3, which localizes to vesicular structures. This location was confirmed by identification of endogenous ClC-4 in membrane fractions from mouse brain homogenate enriched for the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase SERCA2, an ER/SR marker. To identify the motif responsible for ER localization of hClC-4, we generated hClC-4 truncations and chimeras between hClC-4 and hClC-3 or the unrelated plasma membrane protein Ly49E. A stretch of amino acids, residues 14-63, at the N-terminus constitutes a novel motif both necessary and sufficient for targeting hClC-4 and other membrane proteins to the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2016586404,"A high-affinity receptor for interleukin (IL)-13 (interleukin-13R alpha 2) is over-expressed in disease-related fibroblasts and neoplastic cells and is involved in cancer, allergic, and inflammatory diseases. The extracellular domain of IL-13R alpha2 (ECD alpha2) could be cleaved, which serves as a decoy receptor. We have expressed and purified ECD alpha2 in both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and mammalian systems as a soluble fragment and studied its biological activities. Although both products of ECD alpha2 showed IL-13 inhibitory activities, mammalian cell-derived ECD alpha2 appeared to be superior compared with purified protein from E. coli. When expressed in E. coli, ECD alpha2 appeared to be a monomer of 42 but a 60 kDa protein when purified from mammalian cells due to heavy glycosylation. The purified glycosylated ECD alpha2 efficiently inhibited IL-13-induced STAT6 phosphorylation in immune and Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines, IL-13 binding, and cytotoxicity of IL-13 cytotoxin in various cancer cell lines. The improved potency of mammalian cell-derived ECD alpha2 was shown over ECD alpha2/Fc fusion protein. The N-linked glycosylation of ECD alpha2 was found to be essential for optimal IL-13 inhibitory activity as deglycosylation by PNGase F showed lower activity. ECD alpha2 did not inhibit IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation, indicating that inhibitory effects of ECD alpha2 are receptor specific. These results indicate that glycosylated ECD alpha2 can serve as a potent inhibitor of IL-13 in a variety of conditions in which IL-13 is a key mediator, e.g., pulmonary, allergic, fibrotic, and neoplastic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1972829955,"Microsomal prostaglandin (PG) E synthase (mPGES)-1 is an inducible enzyme that acts downstream of cyclooxygenase (COX) and specifically catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin (PG)H2 to PGE2, most prominently in inflammatory conditions. Specific inhibitors of mPGES-1 are not yet available, however, mice with genetic deletion of mPGES-1 have been generated that have given insight into the specific role of mPGES-1 in eicosanoid biosynthesis in vivo and in peritoneal macrophages. We created mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines that would facilitate investigation of the effect of mPGES-1 genetic deletion on prostanoid biosynthesis in fibroblast lineage cells and its subsequent effect on the expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) and nitrite biosynthesis using cells derived from mPGES-1 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (Het), and null mice. The results show that genetic deletion of mPGES-1 results in a dramatic decrease in PGE2 production in Het and null MEFs under basal conditions and after stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1beta, suggesting that mPGES-1 is critically important for PGE2 production. Furthermore, we show that mPGES-1 gene deletion results in diversion of prostanoid production from PGE2 to 6-keto PGF1alpha (the stable metabolic product of PGI2; prostacyclin) in a gene dose-dependent manner in Het and null MEFs compared with their WT counterparts, suggesting a shunting phenomenon within the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway. In addition, we show that mPGES-1 gene deletion and subsequent decrease in PGE2 levels results in a differential induction profile of iNOS and nitrite levels (the stable breakdown product of nitric oxide (NO) in mPGES-1 WT MEFs compared with null MEFs. These results provide important information regarding the therapeutic potential for pharmacologic inhibition of mPGES-1 in inflammatory conditions."

Factor Va directs prothrombin activation by factor Xa through the meizothrombin pathway, characterized by initial cleavage at Arg320 (meizo pathway). We have shown previously that a pentapeptide encompassing amino acid sequence 695–699 from the COOH terminus of the heavy chain of factor Va (Asp-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Gln, DYDYQ) inhibits prothrombin activation by prothrombinase in a competitive manner with respect to substrate. To understand the mechanism of inhibition of thrombin formation by DYDYQ, we have studied prothrombin activation by gel electrophoresis. Titration of plasma-derived prothrombin activation by prothrombinase, with increasing concentrations of peptide, resulted in complete inhibition of the meizo pathway. However, thrombin formation still occurred through the pre2 pathway. These data demonstrate that the peptide preferentially inhibits initial cleavage of prothrombin by prothrombinase at Arg320. These findings were corroborated by studying the activation of recombinant mutant prothrombin molecules rMZ-II (R155A/R284A/R271A) and rP2-II (R155A/R284A/R320A) which can be only cleaved at Arg320 and Arg271, respectively. Cleavage of rMZ-II by prothrombinase was completely inhibited by low concentrations of DYDYQ, whereas high concentrations of pentapeptide were required to inhibit cleavage of rP2-II. The pentapeptide also interfered with prothrombin cleavage by membrane-bound factor Xa alone in the absence of factor Va increasing the rate for cleavage at Arg271 of plasma-derived prothrombin or rP2-II. Our data demonstrate that pentapeptide DYDYQ has opposing effects on membrane-bound factor Xa for prothrombin cleavage, depending on the incorporation of factor Va in prothrombinase.

Prothrombinase is the enzymatic complex responsible for timely thrombin formation in response to vascular injury (1Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Cawthern K.M. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev.

Activation of human prothrombin is the consequence of two cleavages at Arg271 and Arg320 in prothrombin by factor Xa. Depending on the order of peptide bond cleavage, different intermediates are formed (Fig. 1). Cleavage first at Arg271 produces fragment 1·2 and prethrombin-2, whereas initial cleavage at Arg320 results in the formation of meizothrombin, which has enzymatic activity (3Mann K.G. Bajaj S.P.

Whereas factor Xa alone can activate prothrombin following sequential cleavages at Arg271 and Arg320 to produce thrombin (Fig. 1, pathway I, pre2 pathway), its catalytic efficiency is poor in the absence of factor Va, and the overall reaction is incompatible with survival and the rapid arrest of bleeding. The prothrombinase complex, which is formed following the interaction of factor Va with membrane-bound factor Xa in the presence of divalent metal ions, catalyzes the activation of prothrombin following the opposite pathway (Arg320 followed by Arg271; see Fig. 1, pathway II, meizo pathway), resulting in a substantial increase in the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa required for normal hemostasis (15Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both cleavages are phospholipid-dependent, only initial cleavage of prothrombin at Arg320 is strictly dependent on factor Va. The increase in the rate of the overall enzymatic reaction is attributed to an increase in the kcat, which in turn is solely credited to the interaction of the cofactor molecule with both the membrane-bound enzyme and the membrane-bound substrate (11Rosing J.

We have recently identified a pentapeptide from the COOH terminus of the heavy chain of the cofactor (spanning amino acid residues 695–699, DYDYQ) as potent inhibitor of prothrombinase function (40Beck D.O.

The peptide was found to be a competitive inhibitor of prothrombinase with respect to substrate. According to the mode of inhibition, we postulated that the peptide binds prothrombin in competition with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme and inhibits prothrombinase activity by substrate depletion. This mode of DYDYQ inhibition of prothrombin activation by the factor Va-factor Xa complex is similar to that demonstrated previously for sulfated hirugen (28Anderson P.J. Nesset A.

The present work was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of prothrombin activation by DYDYQ.

The chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme-TH was from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Human α-thrombin and human prothrombin were from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The monoclonal antibody αhFV1 coupled to Sepharose was provided by Dr. Kenneth G. Mann (Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT). Human factor Xa was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The pentapeptide DYDYQ that was previously shown to inhibit prothrombinase activity and delay factor V activation (40Beck D.O. Bukys M.A. Singh L.S. Szabo K.A. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3084-3095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was custom-synthesized under the form H2N-DYDYQ-amide and purchased from New England Peptide, Inc. (Gardner, MA) and from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). In each case, the peptide was purified by HPLC to more than 96% homogeneity. Its molecular weight and composition were usually verified by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition analysis, respectively. DYDYQ is a highly negatively charged peptide, and all mass spectrometry analysis was conducted in a negative mode. The peptide was stored lyophilized at –20 °C in a dessicator. It is noteworthy that significant solubility problems were encountered when using the peptide. DYDYQ was insoluble at concentrations higher than 5 mm in water or in the assay buffer. DYDYQ at high concentrations slowly precipitated when incubated in an ice bucket, resulting in a gelatinous insoluble mass. Thus, for all experiments DYDYQ was made fresh in Milli Q (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) water at concentrations ranging between 2 and 4 mg/ml and kept at room temperature. DYDYQ was also frozen in small aliquots. All frozen peptide aliquots were thawed and used only once. Peptide solutions were always centrifuged prior to use to remove potential microaggregates and insoluble material. After the peptide was dissolved in water or buffer, the molar concentration of DYDYQ was initially calculated to a theoretical concentration assuming the degree of purity specified by the supplier and 100% peptide content. However, because DYDYQ is a highly negatively charged pentapeptide, theoretically it could adsorb water and counter ions during HPLC purification. Invariably, significant amounts of salt were present in the initial lyophilized, purified peptide preparations obtained from the manufacturers and used in this study. Thus, the exact concentration of each peptide solution used and provided throughout this study was determined following amino acid composition analysis of an aliquot in the laboratory of Dr. Alex Kurosky and Steve Smith (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston). Briefly, peptide samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 rpm to remove any precipitation that might be present in the tube. 10 μl of each supernatant was placed in a Wheaton 1-ml pre-scored vacule and dried (a vacule is a small thin-walled glass vial with a long neck that can be sealed with a torch while a vacuum is being applied). 100 μl of 6 n constant boiling HCl was added to each vacule. The vacules were sealed with a torch under vacuum and hydrolyzed for 20 h at 107 °C. After hydrolysis the vacules were dried, and the contents were resuspended in 40 μl of 0.02 n HCl. 10 μl of each sample was subsequently injected into a Hitachi L-8800 amino acid analyzer. Average concentration (micromoles/ml) was determined by data analysis using the Hitachi L-8800 AAA System Manager. The mole/ml values obtained directly from the analyzer for each amino acid were multiplied by the molecular weight of the peptide (Mr 702) to determine the milligram/ml of peptide. Because of the harsh conditions of hydrolysis, the mole values found for Tyr were not taken into account for the determination of the final peptide concentrations. It is noteworthy that for each analysis, the average mole numbers of Asp divided by 2 was usually very close to the total mole number obtained with Gln, confirming the accuracy of the method. Usually the mole values obtained with Asp and Gln were averaged to obtain the exact concentration of peptide. This method determines the concentration of a peptide solution with an accuracy of 96 ± 6%. Under these conditions, the calculated starting concentration of peptide in each experiment was systematically found to be lower than its initial concentration calculated after the peptide was dissolved in water or buffer. It is important to note that in order to verify peptide bond integrity of DYDYQ during storage, several peptide solutions used in this study were randomly analyzed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis in the same laboratory. Again, significant problems were encountered when attempting to sequence DYDYQ using the traditional method (polyvinylidene difluoride sample support). Under these conditions, the yield of amino acid per cycle was low as most of the peptide was washed off the polyvinylidene difluoride sample support. NH2-terminal sequencing of DYDYQ was thus performed on a Biobrene Plus™-treated glass fiber filter sample support (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.). Biobrene Plus is a cationic polymer used to immobilize peptide and protein samples on the glass fiber filter during Edman degradation. A much higher yield of amino acids per cycle was observed using these conditions. NH2-terminal sequencing demonstrated that the majority of peptide remained intact following extensive incubation periods. Recombinant prothrombin rMZ-II and rP2-II that have only one cleavage site for factor Xa were prepared and purified as described (47Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E.

Human factor V was purified using methodologies previously described employing the monoclonal antibody αhFV1 coupled to Sepharose (50Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 80: 243-275Google Scholar) and activated to factor Va with thrombin as described recently (51Bukys M.A. Blum M.A. Kim P.Y. Bruffato N. Nesheim M.E. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27393-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (referred to as PCPS vesicles throughout the study) were prepared as described previously (52Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Assay Measuring Thrombin Formation—Initial experiments performed to identify the best conditions allowing peptide inhibition of prothrombin activation revealed that preincubation of prothrombin with DYDYQ in a small volume is required to observe maximum inhibition of prothrombinase activity by the peptide. Thus, the ability of the peptide to inhibit prothrombin activation by either prothrombinase or factor Xa alone was conducted exactly as follows. In a typical experiment, a constant concentration of prothrombin was preincubated with increasing concentrations of peptide at room temperature in a 15-μl volume. Following a 10-min incubation period, the prothrombin/peptide sample was centrifuged, and the entire mixture was added to different tubes containing a solution composed of PCPS vesicles (1 or 10 μm), DAPA (50 μm), and factor Va (1–5 nm) in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ in 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of factor Xa (0.5 nm) at room temperature. The final concentration of prothrombin was 1.4 μm or 300 nm, whereas the final concentration of peptide is provided in the text. All final concentrations of reagents provided in the text and relating to the measure of activity of prothrombinase in the presence or absence of peptide were calculated assuming a final reaction volume of 225 μl. At selected time intervals, aliquots of the mixture were diluted 2-fold in a buffer containing EDTA (50 mm) to quench the reaction. The assay verifying thrombin formation was conducted as described by measuring the initial rate of thrombin formation by the change in the absorbance of a chromogenic substrate at 405 nm (Spectrozyme-TH) monitored with a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (51Bukys M.A. Blum M.A. Kim P.Y. Bruffato N. Nesheim M.E. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27393-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Percent inhibition of thrombin generation was calculated by comparing the initial rates of thrombin formation obtained in the presence of peptide with the control reaction in the absence of peptide. Inhibition of Prothrombin Cleavage by DYDYQ and Analysis of Prothrombin Activation by Gel Electrophoresis—Initial preliminary experiments carried out to determine the optimum conditions necessary to observe the effect of DYDYQ on prothrombin activation by prothrombinase by gel electrophoresis established that the best results (maximum inhibition) are obtained when the peptide is preincubated with prothrombin in a small volume. Thus, all samples analyzed by gel electrophoresis examining the effect of DYDYQ on prothrombin activation were prepared precisely as follows. In a typical experiment, plasma-derived prothrombin or recombinant mutant prothrombin at a constant concentration were preincubated with varying (increasing) concentrations of DYDYQ for 10 min in a 50-μl volume. Following centrifugation, the entire supernatant containing the prothrombin/peptide mixture was added to separated solutions containing PCPS vesicles (1 or 10 μm), DAPA (50 μm), and factor Va (1–5 nm) in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The reaction was started by the addition of factor Xa (0.5 nm) at room temperature. The final volume of each reaction mixture was 1,200 μl when the prothrombin concentration was 1.4 μm. The final concentration of DYDYQ reported throughout the study in experiments studying prothrombin activation by gel electrophoresis was always calculated using the final volume of the reaction mixture. The effect of the peptide on prothrombin activation by factor Xa alone (in the absence of factor Va) was studied in a similar manner (preincubation of prothrombin and peptide in a 50-μl volume for 10 min). The reaction was started by the addition of factor Xa. The final concentrations of reagents in this case were as follows: 2.5–5 nm enzyme, 1.4 μm prothrombin, and 50 μm PCPS in a final volume of 1,200 μl. Control experiments studying activation of prothrombin by factor Xa alone in the absence of factor Va and phospholipid were also performed in a similar fashion. At selected time intervals (indicated in the figure legends), aliquots from the reaction mixtures (60 μl) were removed and immediately diluted into 2 volumes of 0.2 m glacial acetic acid and concentrated using a Centrivap concentrator attached to a Centrivap cold trap (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO). The dried samples were dissolved in 0.1 m Tris base, pH 6.8, 1% SDS (final concentration), 1% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration), heated for exactly 65 s at 90 °C, mixed again, and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 9.5% gels according to the method of Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Usually 6 μg of total protein per lane were applied. Protein bands were visualized following staining by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained in a methanol/acetic acid/water solution. After each experiment using a new peptide solution, an aliquot of the solution was stored at –20 °C. Following amino acid composition analysis, the exact initial concentration of each peptide solution was calculated for every experiment. The final concentration of peptide used was then back-calculated and is reported throughout the study. Finally, it is worth mentioning that despite all the problems encountered when working with DYDYQ, using the precise experimental protocol provided above, highly reproducible results were observed with 18 separate peptide preparations from two different suppliers (New England Peptide, Inc. and American Peptide Co.) representing three different batches of peptide. Scanning Densitometry of SDS-PAGE and Calculation of the Rate of Prothrombin Consumption—Scanning densitometry of the gels was performed as described earlier (54Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently with several modifications (51Bukys M.A. Blum M.A. Kim P.Y. Bruffato N. Nesheim M.E. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27393-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The stained gels were scanned with a Lexmark printer/scanner; the final images were imported into Adobe Photoshop, captured as TIFF files, and subsequently imported into the software UN-SCAN-IT gel (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Following analysis, the numerical data were saved as a Microsoft Excel file, and the molar concentration of prothrombin as observed on the gels was calculated by normalizing its staining intensity to the initial prothrombin concentration. The data representing prothrombin consumption as a function of time (seconds) were subsequently plotted according to the equation representing a first-order exponential decay using the software Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego). The apparent first-order rate constant, k (s–1), obtained directly from the graph was subsequently divided by the molar concentration of factor Xa used in each experiment (to obtain s–1 × molar factor Xa–1). The number obtained was subsequently multiplied by the starting concentration of prothrombin used (1.4 μm or 300 nm). The final numbers reporte"

The E1A proteins are expressed as two major isoforms from two alternatively spliced mRNA of 12 S encoding 243 residues (243R) and 13 S encoding 289 residues (289R). Although both E1A proteins exhibit transforming activities, the 289R protein functions as a transcriptional activator of other viral early genes. The 243R and 289R proteins share three conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR4, whereas the 289R protein contains an extra 46-amino acid region (CR3). The CR3 region contributes to the trans-activation function of 289R (2Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Pusztai R. Symington J.S.

The 243R protein is sufficient for transformation of primary cells in cooperation with oncogenes such as the activated Ras oncogene (4Moran E. Grodzicker T. Roberts R.J. Mathews M.B. Zerler B. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 765-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming activities of E1A are critically dependent on the N-terminal 80-amino acid region encompassing CR1 and the region between amino acids 120 and 140 (CR2) (5Zerler B. Roberts R.J. Mathews M.B. Moran E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 80-amino acid region interacts with the global transcriptional coactivators p300 and its paralog CBP, which function as histone acetyl transferases (HATs) (6Stein R.W. Corrigan M.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2836-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The potential presence of Tip60 in E1A-associated TRRAP-p400 has not been investigated thus far. In addition to p300/CBP and GCN5, the CR1 region also binds P/CAF directly (15Lang S.E. Hearing P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2836-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Reid J.L. Bannister A.J.

Thus, the N-terminal 80-amino acid region of E1A recruits multiple HATs either directly or through adapter proteins such as TRRAP and p400 to regulate cell proliferation and to contribute to the transforming activities of E1A. Although it is generally believed that sequestration and suppression of the activities of various HATs such as p300 and CBP by E1A (7Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A.

A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) study has suggested that E1A-mediated targeting of HATs to promoters of cell cycle regulatory genes results in removal of the histone mark (methylation of H3K9) associated with transcriptional repression and addition of the mark (acetylation of H3K9) characteristic of transcriptional activation during G0 → G1 cell cycle progression (19Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, targeting the N-terminal HAT-recruiting region of E1A to promoters via the DNA-binding domain of c-Myc has been shown to induce Ras cooperative transformation (11Deleu L. Shellard S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5054-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) are consistent with a model that targeting E1A-associated HATs to promoters of cell cycle regulatory genes might contribute to cell proliferation and transformation. In contrast to the lack of clear understanding of the mechanism by which the N-terminal region of E1A contributes to cell proliferation and transformation, the mechanism by which the interaction of E1A with pRb family proteins (pRb, p130, and p107) contributes to these activities is better understood (20Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 21Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The CR2 region interacts with pRb family members through the prototypical Rb-binding motif, LXCXE, with high affinity and displaces various E2F family members from the RB protein complex resulting in transcriptional activation of the S-phase genes. Although activation of S-phase genes by the E1A CR2 region is sufficient for driving cells into S-phase, it is not sufficient to drive cells through the entire cell cycle. The activity of the N-terminal 80-amino acid region (i.e. interaction with p300 and other HATs) is required for conferring the full cell proliferation promoting activity of E1A (22Howe J.A.

Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal CR4 region interacts with two highly related proteins, collectively termed as C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) through a sequence motif, PLDLS, conserved among all primate Ad E1A proteins (24Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The CR4 region modulates the transforming activity of E1A in opposing manners. It is essential for immortalization and cooperative transformation with E1B (26Quinlan M.P. Douglas J.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2020-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gopalakrishnan S. Douglas J.L. Quinlan M.P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 541-551PubMed Google Scholar). However, CR4 exerts a strong negative regulatory effect on cooperative transformation with the activated Ras oncogene in primary epithelial cells (24Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Quinlan M.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2093-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transformed by Ras and E1A CR4 mutants are highly tumorigenic and invasive (24Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 29Subramanian T. La Regina M. Chinnadurai G.

Several CR4 mutants that cooperate with Ras more efficiently are deficient in interaction with CtBP (24Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) suggesting a link between recruitment of CtBP and retardation of the oncogene cooperating activity of E1A. The CtBP family members CtBP1 and CtBP2 are highly homologous, and a number of transcriptional repressors bind to both homologs through motifs that resemble the canonical CtBP-binding motif (PLDLS) of E1A (32Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 33Turner J. Crossley M. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A proteomic analysis of the nuclear protein complex of CtBP1-L has revealed the presence of CtBP2 as well as enzymatic constituents that mediate histone modifications, in addition to DNA-binding repressors such as ZEB (34Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 35Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that DNA sequence-specific repressors recruit the CtBP corepressor complex to mediate coordinated histone modifications by deacetylation, demethylation, and methylation. Additionally, CtBP1 has been reported to interact with p300/CBP and inhibit their HAT activity (36Kim J.H. Cho E.J. Kim S.T. Youn H.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Senyuk V. Sinha K.K. Nucifora G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 441: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which may contribute to a global repression activity. The presence of both CtBP homologs in the CtBP1 complex is consistent with the observation that CtBP1 and CtBP2 play redundant transcriptional regulatory roles during mouse development (39Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Genetic studies with mice have revealed that CtBP1 and CtBP2 also play distinct transcriptional regulatory roles. The determinants for the unique regulatory activities of the two CtBPs are not known. Despite extensive sequence similarities, the vertebrate CtBPs differ in the N-terminal 20-amino acid region. CtBP2 contains a unique 19-amino acid Lys/Arg-rich N-terminal domain, which is modified by acetylation by p300 and is required for nuclear localization of CtBP2 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of CtBP1 vary by the presence of a 13-amino acid N-terminal domain in CtBP1-L or by the absence of this domain in CtBP1-S (reviewed in Ref. 41Chinnadurai G. Chinnadurai G. CtBP Family Proteins. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2006: 1-17Google Scholar). The availability of mouse cells that are null for both CtBP1 and CtBP2 has provided an experimental system to investigate the activities of CtBP1 and CtBP2 individually. The mechanism by which the E1A C-terminal region down-regulates Ras cooperative transformation and restrains the oncogenic and metastatic potentials of transformed cells is not fully understood. Some of the activities of the E1A C-terminal region may be linked to relief of CtBP-mediated transcriptional repression of various epithelial genes such as E-cadherin by cellular repressors (42Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 43Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, CtBP associated with the E1A C terminus might also modulate the activities of protein complexes associated with the E1A N-terminal region. Such a possibility was initially suggested from an observation that a transcriptional activation function encoded by the N-terminal region of E1A was efficiently inhibited by the C-terminal region of E1A (44Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the N- and C-terminal activities of E1A may oppose each other becomes attractive considering the opposing biochemical activities (e.g. HATs versus HDACs) of the cellular proteins associated with E1A. Because CtBP2 is specifically acetylated by p300 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we have tested a hypothesis that the recruitment of p300 and CtBP2 into a single protein complex by E1A would result in changes in the activities of these cellular proteins. Here, we report that E1A-mediated juxtaposition of p300 and CtBP2 results in increased acetylation of CtBP2 and the E1A C-terminal region antagonizes the transcriptional activity of the N-terminal region of E1A through specific recruitment of CtBP2. Additionally, E1A caused changes in the composition of the CtBP2 corepressor complex. Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Purification—The GFP open reading frame was PCR-amplified from pEGFP-N1 with primers N45 (ACTGCACTCGAGGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC) and N46 (CATCGAGGATCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC) and cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of pHA-IRESneo (Clontech) to generate pHA-GFP. E1A (Ad2 12 S) was PCR-amplified with primers N103 (ACTGACGGATCCGGCAGAGAAGGCATGAGACATATTATCTGCCACGG) and N20 (TTCGACGAATTCTTATGGCCTGGGGCGTTTACAGCTC). The PCR product was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and ligated to the BamHI/XbaI fragment of pHA-GFP and the EcoRI/Xbal fragment of the pIRESpuro3 vector (Clontech) to generate pGFP-E1A. All E1A mutants and the E1A 13 S (Ad5) were prepared by a similar approach using PCR. To express His6-tagged CtBP proteins in Escherichia coli, the CtBP2 N-terminal coding sequence was PCR-amplified with primers N135 (AGACTGCCATGGCACATCACCACCATCATCACGGCCTCGAGGCAATGGCCCTTGTGGATA) and N136 (GATGGTGTGGTACATCATGGCGCC). The PCR-amplified DNA was digested with NcoI/SalI and ligated to the SalI/BamHI fragment of pFH-CtBP2 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the NcoI/BamHI fragment of the pET-11c vector (Novagen) to generate the pH6-CtBP2 expression construct. pH6–3KR-CtBP2 was constructed by the same approach using pFH-3KR-CtBP2 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as the template for PCR. Plasmids pH6-ΔN-CtBP2 and pH6-A58E-CtBP2 were constructed by substituting the XhoI/BamHI fragment of pFH-ΔN-CtBP2 and pFH-A58E-CtBP2 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the same fragment of pH6-CtBP2. pH6-CtBP1-L and pH6-CtBP1-S were constructed by substituting the XhoI/BglII fragment of pFH-CtBP1 and pFH-CtBP1-S (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the XhoI/BamHI fragment of pH6-CtBP2. All His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. To express p300 in insect cells using the baculovirus vector, the full-length p300 open reading frame and the aa 1063–2414 region of the p300 open reading frame were PCR-amplified with primers N104 (ACATGCCTCGAGGCAATGGCCGAGAATGTGGTGGAACCGG) and N107 (AGCTAATAGCGGCCGCTAGTGTATGTCTAGTGTACTCTGTGAGAGG), and N123 (ACTACGCTCGAGGCCATGGAGGCACTTTACCGTCAGGATCC) and N107, respectively. The PCR-amplified DNAs were digested with XhoI/NotI and ligated to the StuI/NotI fragment of pBacPak8 (Clontech) and the EcoRV/XhoI fragment of pFH-CtBP2 (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated in Sf21 cells following recommended conditions (Clontech). Both the full-length p300 and the p300BD(+) constructs carry a FLAG-HA tag at the N terminus. For protein expression and purification, Sf21 cells grown in T75 flasks were infected with baculoviruses for 2 days. Cell lysates were used for partial purification of the FLAG-HA-tagged proteins using the FLAG antibody beads (Sigma). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Adenoviral Infection—HeLa and the mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF90) null for CtBP1 and CtBP2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Insect cells (Sf21) were cultured in SF-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) with 2% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's recommendations. MEF90 cells were transfected for luciferase assays using the JetPEI reagent (Mid Sci) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 2 × 104 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates and transfected the next day in duplicates with 0.2 μg of pG5-Luc (Promega), 0.05 μg of phRL-0, 0.3 μg of pGal4E1AΔ91–199, and 0.3 μgof CtBP constructs. One day after transfection, luciferase assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega), and the average deviation was plotted as the error. For immunofluorescence staining of CtBP2 and 3KR-CtBP2, MEF90 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 for 1 day and then stained with the Cy3-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Adenoviruses expressing the E1A 12 S or E1A 12 S with a C-terminal deletion (29Subramanian T. La Regina M. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 415-420PubMed Google Scholar) were used to infect the HeLa/CtBP2 cell line at an multiplicity of infection 100 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were analyzed for CtBP2-associated proteins at 40 h after infection. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blots—To examine CtBP2 acetylation, 20 h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and bound to 30 μl of FLAG (Sigma) antibody beads at 4 °C for 1.5 h in IP buffer. After three washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using the ECLplus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the CtBP2 complex in the HeLa/CtBP2 cell line (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or transfected cells, cells in T75 flasks were collected and lysed following previously described conditions (45Huh K.W. DeMasi J. Ogawa H. Nakatani Y. Howley P.M. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11492-11497Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were lysed in 0.3 m KCl lysis buffer and mixed with a 2× volume of the lysis buffer without KCl. After centrifugation, the clear supernatant was precleared with protein A-agarose, and then bound to the FLAG-agarose antibody beads (Sigma). The bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample loading buffer without reducing agent and then combined with 0.1 m dithiothreitol before gel electrophoresis on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gel. The following antibodies were used for Western blots: pan acetyl-lysine, #9681 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA); E1A, #SC-25 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); CtBP2, #612044 (BD Biosciences); Penta-His-HRP conjugate, #1014992 (Qiagen); GFP, #632460 (BD Biosciences); p300, SC-584 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); GCN5; #SC-20698 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PCAF, #SC-13124 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); G9a, #07–551 (Upstate Biotech); ZEB, #SC-25388 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CoREST, #612146 (BD Biosciences); HDAC1, #SC-8410 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and HDAC2, #SC-9959 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signal intensities in Western blots were quantified on a QuantityOne gel scanner (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Acetylation of CtBP2 and p300 Binding—For CtBP2 acetylation, ∼1 μg of purified H6-CtBP2 was incubated with p300 (∼20 ng) for 30 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of acetylation buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, 1 mm sodium butyrate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100. For p300/CtBP binding assays, p300 was first bound to the FLAG antibody beads, washed, and then incubated with various CtBP proteins (1 μg) in the presence or absence of GST-E1A (0.5 μg) in 100 μl of the acetylation buffer with a gentle rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant of this assay was treated as the unbound fraction, and the bound proteins were washed and examined by Western blots. Radioactive acetylation of CtBP2 was performed with [14C]acetyl-CoA under recommended conditions (Upstate Biotechnology). Reaction products were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and examined by electrophoresis on a 4–15% gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or phosphorimaging analysis (Storm 850, Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assay was performed under recommended conditions (EZ ChIP kit, Upstate) with the following modifications. HeLa cells or HeLa/CtBP2 cells in 100-mm dishes were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, collected, and resuspended in 0.6 ml of the IP buffer supplemented with 20 mm EDTA. The cell suspension was sonicated, and the chromatin preparation was precleared with protein G-agarose. Pre-cleared chromatin preparations were bound to FLAG antibody beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibody beads were washed twice with the IP/EDTA buffer, once with half-strength IP/EDTA buffer with 0.25 m LiCl, and twice with TE. Bound protein-DNA complexes were eluted and cross-linking reversed, and the DNA was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Precipitated DNA was PCR-amplified with primers N187 (CTGCACTCCAGCTTGGGTGAAAGAGTG) and N179 (GGTGCGTGGCTGCAGCCAGGTGAGCC) to detect the human E-cad promoter region. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and photographed with the Quantity One system (Bio-Rad). Control ChIP analysis of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter region was performed as recommended (EZ ChIP kit, Upstate Biotechnology). RT-PCR Assay—HeLa/CtBP2 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected for 24 h, and mRNA was prepared from the transfected cells using the QuickPrep mRNA Mini kit (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse transcription reaction was performed with 0.2 μg of mRNA and a mixture of two primers: N55 (E-cad): CTCAGCCCGAGTGGAAATC and N38 (actin): AGTCCGCCTAGAAGCATTTGC. The RT products were diluted and used as templates for E-cad PCR with primers N53 (TACACCATCCTCAGCCAAGATCCTGAGC) and N54 (GTACTGCTGCTTGGCCTCAAAATCCAAGCC), or for actin PCR with primer N36 (CATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTC) and N37 (TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC). RT-PCR products were analyzed by the same manner as for ChIP assay. E1A Enhances Acetylation of CtBP2 in Vivo—CtBP2 has three Lys residues at positions 6, 8, and 10 (Fig. 1A) that can be acetylated by p300 in vivo (40Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because Ad E1A interacts with p300 (6Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J.

To facilitate immunoprecipitation analyses, CtBP2 was engineered to carry a FLAG-HA tag at the N terminus, and E1A was expressed as a GFP-E1A fusion protein. Throughout the text, E1A refers to the 12 S isoform, whereas the 13 S isoform is designated as such. Cell lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody and examined by Western blot analysis using different antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-expression of CtBP2 with GFP-E1A resulted in a dramatic enhancement of CtBP2 acetylation (compare lanes 1 and 2, top panel). In contrast, co-expression of CtBP2 with the mutant GFP-E1A-C*, which carries a mutation (DL → AS) within the PLDLS motif, had a muc"

Genomics. 1999; 59: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion of the CXXC1 gene in mice results in a peri-implantation embryonic lethal phenotype (14Carlone D.L. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking CFP1 fail to differentiate upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (15Carlone D.L.

CXXC1-/- ES cells also exhibit a 3-fold increase in apoptosis and a 60-80% loss of global genomic cytosine methylation, including reduced cytosine methylation within repetitive elements, single copy genes, and imprinted genes (15Carlone D.L. Lee J.H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, CFP1 is a component of the mammalian Set1 histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex, and co-localizes to nuclear speckles with both Set1 and human trithorax (2Lee J.H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Lee J.H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Absence of CFP1 in ES cells leads to perturbed patterns of histone modifications consistent with reduced levels of heterochromatin. Hence, CFP1 is an important regulator of both cytosine methylation and histone methylation. Consistent with the early death of CXXC1-/- embryos, epigenetic regulation is critical for cellular differentiation and embryogenesis (17Lee J.H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar). A dramatic reduction in CpG dinucleotide methylation occurs during early development in preimplantation mouse embryos (20Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development. 1987; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Singal R. G.D. G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the time of implantation, de novo methylation occurs at most CpG motifs except for CpG islands, which remain unmethylated and transcriptionally active (22Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 23Razin A.D. Shemer R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1751-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, ES cells undergo a global epigenetic reprogramming upon induction of in vitro differentiation, and inhibition of histone deacetylase enzymes prevents cellular differentiation (17Lee J.H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Dnmt1 gene in mice results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (18Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar), and Dnmt1-/- ES cells exhibit impaired erythroid colony differentiation and no myeloid colony differentiation (24Jackson M. Krassowska A. Gilbert N. Chevassut T. Forrester L. Ansell J. Ramsahoye B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8862-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Overexpression of DNMT1 leads to DNA hypermethylation and embryonic lethality (25Biniszkiewicz D. Gribnau J. Ramsahoye B. Gaudet F. Eggan K. Humpherys D. Mastrangelo M.A. Jun Z. Walter J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2124-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The DNMT3a and DNMT3b de novo methyltransferases are also critical for mammalian development (19Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4533) Google Scholar). Dnmt3b-/- mice die in utero at day E14.5-E18.5, and Dnmt3a-/- mice develop to term but are runted and die within 4 weeks of age. Lastly, disruption of genes that encode histone methyltransferases, such as G9a (26Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), ESET (27Dodge J.E. Kang Y.K. Beppu H. Lei H. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), or human trithorax (28Ayton P. Sneddon S.F. Palmer D.B. Rosewell I.R. Owen M.J. Young B. Presley R. Subramanian V. Genesis. 2001; 30: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), results in embryonic lethal phenotypes in mice. Given the inability of CXXC1-/- ES cells to differentiate, we hypothesize that CFP1 is also required for stem and progenitor cell function later in development. In particular, we reason that CFP1 is important for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function. Hematopoiesis requires appropriate epigenetic regulation to achieve a balance between stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment. Stem cell differentiation involves global remodeling of chromatin structure and a progressive accumulation of heterochromatin and restriction of gene expression and developmental potential (29Akashi K. He X. Chen J. Iwasaki H. Niu C. Steenhard B. J.H. Zhang J. Li L. Blood. 2003; 101: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Treatment of hematopoietic stem cells with inhibitors of DNMT enzymes (deoxyazacytidine) and histone deacetylase proteins (trichostatin A) leads to altered cell fate and an expansion of stem cells in vitro (30Milhem M. Mahmud N. Lavelle D. Araki H. DeSimone J. Saunthararajah Y. Hoffman R. Blood. 2004; 103: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Finally, the transcription factor IKAROS is a critical regulator of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis. The absence of IKAROS leads to a 40-fold decrease in hematopoietic stem cell function (31Nichogiannopoulou N. Trevisan M. Naben S. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). IKAROS associates with the 2-MDa chromatin remodeling complex NURD, which contains histone deacetylase proteins and an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme (32O'Neill D.W. Schoetz S.S. Lopez R.A. Castle M. Rabinowitz L. Shor E. Krawchuk D. Goll M.G. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Han S. Seong R.H. Park S.D. Agalioti T. Munshi N. DThanos D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bank A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7572-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The importance of epigenetics to hematopoietic cell development was recently illustrated by the finding that DNA demethylation and alterations in chromatin structure occur prior to induction of gene expression at the lysozyme locus during myeloid cell differentiation (33Tahoh H. Melnik S. Lefevre P. Chong S. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Blood. 2004; 103: 2950-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is also a large body of literature describing a correlation between the level of gene-specific DNA methylation and the appearance or extinction of lineagerestricted gene expression throughout hematopoiesis (34Singal R. Ferris R. Little J.A. Wang S.Z. Ginder G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13724-13729Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Lubbert M. Mertelsmann R. Herrmann F. Leukemia. 1997; 11: S12-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of DNA methylation in normal hematopoiesis, aberrant DNA methylation is associated with the development of leukemia. A common mechanism is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as DAP-kinase, HIC1, p15, and p16, leading to the loss of gene expression (38Katzenellenbogen R.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4347-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Baur A.S. Shaw P. Burri N. Delacretaz F. Bosman F.T. Chaubert P. Blood. 1999; 94: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypermethylation of DNA has also been linked to chromosome instability and increased chromosomal translocations that are frequently associated with hematopoietic malignancies (43Litz C.E. Etzell J. Leukemia Lymphoma. 1998; 30: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Agents that inhibit DNA methylation, such as azacytidine, are being used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia (44Hennessy B.T. Garcia-Manero G. Kantarjian H.M. Giles F.J. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 12: 1985-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 46Wijermans P. Lubbert M. Verhoef G. Bosly A. Ravoet C. Andre M. Ferrant A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 956-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altered histone modifications are also associated with leukemia. For example, the gene encoding the human trithorax histone H3-K4 methyltransferase is involved in chromosomal translocations in the majority of pediatric leukemia (47Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W. Rozovskaia T. Wassell R. Dubois G. Mazo A. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1119-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar,48Rowley J.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because of the early embryonic death of CXXC1-/- mice, zebrafish were used as an alternative model system with which to assess the role of CFP1 during post-gastrulation development, particularly hematopoiesis. The zebrafish homolog of CFP1 (zCFP1) was identified, and its function during embryogenesis was examined using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. Targeting of zCFP1 with morpholino oligonucleotides results in decreased global genomic cytosine methylation and disrupted primitive hematopoiesis. These studies demonstrate that zCFP1 is required for proper epigenetic regulation of primitive hematopoiesis. Zebrafish Maintenance—Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained under standard conditions (49Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000: 1.1-1.8Google Scholar) in accordance with the Indiana University policy on animal care and use. Development of embryos proceeded at 28.5 °C, and developmental stages were determined by the time of fertilization and morphologic features. Embryos were treated with 0.2 m phenylthiourea (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent melanization, and embryo ages are given as hours post-fertilization (hpf) or days post-fertilization. Isolation of Zebrafish CFP1 cDNA—First strand cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA isolated from 24-hpf zebrafish embryos using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of the zebrafish CXXC1 (zCXXC1) cDNA was performed by RT-PCR using the following oligonucleotides: zebrafish forward, 5′-TTGTTAGCTGTCTGCCCACGG-3′; and zebrafish reverse, 5′-TACTGATTACTGAGATGGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pCR®4-TOPO (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions and then into pBluescript® SK. Morpholino Oligonucleotides—Two nonoverlapping antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting the zCXXC1 transcript were purchased from Gene-Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR). Morpholino oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: zCFP1 MO1, 5′-GACATTTCGCTGTCCATCGCTGCTC-3′; zCFP1 MO2, 5′-TGAATGCTGCGACTATAATAACTGA-3′. A control morpholino oligonucleotide (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) with no known target in zebrafish was used as a negative control. Morpholino oligonucleotides were diluted to 0.5 m in Daneau buffer (58 m NaCl, 0.7 m KCl, 0.4 m MgSO4, 0.6 m Ca(NO3)2, 5.0 m HEPES, pH 7.6) and injected as described below. Microinjection—Morpholino oligonucleotides were microinjected into embryos at the 1-2 cell stage. The injection volume into each embryo was 1-2 nl (4.3-8.6 ng/embryo). Injected embryos were imaged using a Leica MZ12.5 dissecting microscope equipped with a SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Synthetic capped murine CXXC1 mRNA was transcribed from murine CXXC1 cDNA in the pBluescript® SK vector using the T7 mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Messenger RNA was co-injected with morpholino oligonucleotides as described above into 1-2 cell stage embryos at 50 pg/nl (50-100 pg/embryo). Acridine Orange and o-Dianisidine Staining and TUNEL Assays—Apoptosis in whole zebrafish embryos was visualized by staining with acridine orange or TUNEL assay. Live embryos were removed from their chorions, stained with 5 μg/ml acridine orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 min, and washed three times in embryo medium (49Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000: 1.1-1.8Google Scholar). Epifluorescence images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with DIC optics and a SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). For TUNEL analysis of apoptosis, whole zebrafish embryos were dechorionated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. TUNEL assay was then performed using a fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The embryos were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope equipped with SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Staining of hemoglobin was performed as described (50Detrich H.W. Kieran M.W. Chan F.Y. Barone L.M. Yee K. Rundestadler J.A. Pratt S. Ransom D. Zon L.I. Proc. Natil. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10713-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Briefly, unfixed embryos were dechorionated and stained with a solution of o-dianisidine (0.6 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.65% hydrogen peroxide, and 40% (v/v) ethanol in the dark for 15 min. The embryos were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope equipped with a SPOT RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Video Capture of Blood Flow—Zebrafish were placed in embryo medium in glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) for imaging. Blood flow videos were acquired at 30 frames/s using a DAGE MTI CCD 72 camera (Michigan City, IN) mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with DIC optics. To enhance visibility of the blood flow, the images were processed in Adobe Photoshop using contrast-stretch and unsharp-mask effects. An AVI format movie was generated from the image sequence using Quicktime Pro (Apple) and then converted to MPG1 format using a TMP-GEnc MPEG encoder (Pegasys Inc., Tokyo, Japan). In Situ Hybridization and RT-PCR Analysis of Gene Expression—Plasmids containing cDNA clones of zebrafish gata1, scl (stem cell leukemia gene), and myeloperoxidase were provided by Dr. Todd Evans (Albert Einstein College of Medicine), and a gata2 cDNA clone was provided by Dr. Michael Trautman (Indiana School of Medicine). Plasmid DNA was linearized by restriction enzyme digestion to generate template for riboprobe synthesis. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) and T7, Sp6 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and T3 polymerases (Roche Applied Science). Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed on embryos fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde as previously described (51Liu Q. Marrs J.A. Raymond P.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 410: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The embryos were mounted in glycerol and examined using a Leica MZ12 dissecting microscope equipped with Axiovision imaging software (52Babb S.G. Marrs J.A. Dev. Dynamics. 2004; 230: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using first strand cDNA prepared from 5 μg of total RNA isolated from embryos of the indicated developmental stage. Analysis of zCXXC1 and β-actin expression was performed using the following primer pairs: zCXXC1 forward, 5′-TTGTTAGCTGTCTGCCCACGG-3′; zCXXC1 reverse, 5′-CACATTTCGCTGTCCATCGC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-GCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGC-3′; and β-actin reverse, 5′-GGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAAC-3′. Embryonic Vascular Development—Transgenic zebrafish expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the fli-1 promoter, TG(fli1:EGFP)y1 (53Lawson N.D. Weinstein B.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar) were purchased from the zebrafish international resource center (Eugene, OR) and used to visualize developing vascular structures. Injected embryos were imaged using a Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with a Leica DFC480 imaging system and software (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). Analysis of Cytosine Methylation—Global genomic cytosine methylation was analyzed using a methyl acceptance assay as described (15Carlone D.L. Lee J.H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 54Balaghi M. Wagner C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of genomic DNA, isolated as described previously (55Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17908) Google Scholar), was incubated with 2 μCi of [3H]methyl-S-adenosyl L methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 15 Ci/mmol) and 3 units of SssI methylase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 30°C. In vitro methylated DNA was isolated by filtration through Whatman DE-81 ion exchange filter, and incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by one-tailed t tests, with a p value of <0.05 interpreted as statistical significance. Identification and Characterization of a Zebrafish Homolog of the CXXC1 Gene Encoding CFP—Homologs of mammalian CFP1 have been identified in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (1Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 56Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Based upon DNA alignment between sequences available from the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute Ensembl zebrafish data base (contig 12623.1 on chromosome 11) and the murine CXXC1 genomic DNA (57Carlone D.L. Hart S.R.L. Ladd P.D. Skalnik D.G. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the zebrafish CXXC1 gene was identified (zCXXC1). The zCXXC1 cDNA sequence was predicted from expressed sequence tag clones within the NCBI Genbank™ data base (accession numbers TC142796, TC142797, and TC130677) and confirmed by determining the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone recovered by RT-PCR of RNA isolated from 24-hpf zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish CFP1 protein (Genbank™ accession number NP_956627) shares ∼60% identity and ∼70% similarity with murine CFP1 (Fig. 1). Mammalian CFP1 contains several protein domains, including two plant homology domains, a CXXC DNA-binding domain, acidic and basic domains, and a coiled-coil domain. The plant homology domain has been identified in over 40 chromatin-associated proteins (58Bienz M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 59Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and often mediates protein-protein interactions (60Fuks F. Hurd P.J. Deplus R. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 62O'Connell S. Wang L. Robert S. Jones C.A. Saint R. Jones R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43065-43073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The CXXC domain of CFP1 is required for binding to DNA sequences that contain unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (1Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); the acidic domain functions as a transcription activation domain (63Fujino T. Hasegawa M. Shibata S. Kisimoto T. Imai S.I. Takano T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); and the acidic, basic, and coiled-coil domains are required for subnuclear localization to euchromatic nuclear speckles (2Lee J.H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All of the domains of the mammalian CFP1 protein are conserved in the zCFP1 protein. The expression pattern of zCFP1 in developing zebrafish embryos was analyzed by both RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. RT-PCR analysis detects expression of the zCXXC1 gene at all developmental stages examined between 2 hpf and 7 days post-fertilization (Fig. 2A). Using the zCCCX1 cDNA described above, a digoxigenin-labeled zCXXC1 probe corresponding to the first 460 nucleotides of the transcript was generated and hybridized with zebrafish embryos at 12, 18, and 24 hpf (Fig. 2B). The sense control probe is shown as a negative control. These studies reveal that zCFP1 is widely expressed throughout embryonic zebrafish development. Zebrafish Injected with zCXXC1 Morpholino Oligonucleotide Exhibit Developmental Defects—To examine the functional role of CFP1 in zebrafish, two nonoverlapping antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were designed against the zCXXC1 mRNA and injected into 1-2 cell embryos. A control morpholino oligonucleotide that does not target any known transcript was similarly injected and used as a negative control. Zebrafish embryos were examined at 24, 48, and 96 hpf. Injection of the zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide resulted in abnormal yolk sac extension morphology compared with embryos injected with the control morpholino oligonucleotide (Fig. 3). Embryos treated with the zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide were also smaller at 48 and 96 hpf (Fig. 3, C-F) and exhibited cardiac edema (Fig. 3, E and F). The abnormal yolk sac extension was observed in 98% of embryos injected with the zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide but in only 3% of embryos injected with the control morpholino oligonucleotide (Table 1). Cardiac edema was observed in 66% of embryos injected with the zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide but in only 11% of embryos injected with the control (Table 1). Injection of the zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide resulted in increased mortality of the embryos, with 23% of injected embryos being dead at 24 hpf (Table 1) and greater than 50% of embryos dying by 96 hpf (data not shown). A similar phenotype was observed following injection of a second independent zCXXC1 morpholino oligonucleotide, with 71% of embryos exhibiting a yolk sac extension defect and 59% showing cardiac edema, thus confirming the specificity of the effect (Table 1). Furthermore, the severity of the phenotype was dose-dependent (Table 2).TABLE 1zCXXC1 MO injection disrupts embryonic developmentDeathYolk sac extension defectCardiac edemaControl MO7 ± 3.5 (48)3 ± 2.8 (48)11 ± 3.8 (48)zCXXC1 MO23 ± 6.3 (60)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) difference compared with control MO-treated embryos.,bAverage of three experiments ± S.E.98 ± 2.0 (122)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) difference compared with control MO-treated embryos.66 ± 11.2 (122)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) difference compared with control MO-treated embryos.zCXXC1 MO212 ± 3.1 (24)cAverage of two experiments ± S.E.71 ± 1.8 (24)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) difference compared with control MO-treated embryos.,cAverage of two experiments ± S.E.59 ± 4.9 (24)aStatistically significant (p < 0.05) difference compared with control MO-treated embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2069749743,"In liver, glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate, the final step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways. Mutations in the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase) give rise to glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a, which is characterized in part by hypoglycemia, growth retardation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic glycogen accumulation. Recently, a novel G6Pase isoform was identified, designated UGRP/G6Pase-β. The activity of UGRP relative to G6Pase in vitro is disputed, raising the question as to whether G6P is a physiologically important substrate for this protein. To address this issue we have characterized the phenotype of UGRP knock-out mice. G6P hydrolytic activity was decreased by ∼50% in homogenates of UGRP–/– mouse brain relative to wild type tissue, consistent with the ability of UGRP to hydrolyze G6P. In addition, female, but not male, UGRP–/– mice exhibit growth retardation as do G6Pase–/– mice and patients with GSD type 1a. However, in contrast to G6Pase–/– mice and patients with GSD type 1a, UGRP–/– mice exhibit no change in hepatic glycogen content, blood glucose, or triglyceride levels. Although UGRP–/– mice are not hypoglycemic, female UGRP–/– mice have elevated (∼60%) plasma glucagon and reduced (∼20%) plasma cholesterol. We hypothesize that the hyperglucagonemia prevents hypoglycemia and that the hypocholesterolemia is secondary to the hyperglucagonemia. As such, the phenotype of UGRP–/– mice is mild, indicating that G6Pase is the major glucose-6-phosphatase of physiological importance for glucose homeostasis in vivo. In liver, glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate, the final step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways.

G6P hydrolytic activity was decreased by ∼50% in homogenates of UGRP–/– mouse brain relative to wild type tissue, consistent with the ability of UGRP to hydrolyze G6P. In addition, female, but not male, UGRP–/– mice exhibit growth retardation as do G6Pase–/– mice and patients with GSD type 1a. However, in contrast to G6Pase–/– mice and patients with GSD type 1a, UGRP–/– mice exhibit no change in hepatic glycogen content, blood glucose, or triglyceride levels. Although UGRP–/– mice are not hypoglycemic, female UGRP–/– mice have elevated (∼60%) plasma glucagon and reduced (∼20%) plasma cholesterol. We hypothesize that the hyperglucagonemia prevents hypoglycemia and that the hypocholesterolemia is secondary to the hyperglucagonemia. As such, the phenotype of UGRP–/– mice is mild, indicating that G6Pase is the major glucose-6-phosphatase of physiological importance for glucose homeostasis in vivo. In liver, glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) 2The abbreviations used are: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit; GSD, glycogen storage disease; KOS, knockout shuttle; ES, embryonic stem; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit; GSD, glycogen storage disease; KOS, knockout shuttle; ES, embryonic stem; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. to glucose and inorganic phosphate, the final step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways (1Cherrington A.D.

Glucose-6-phosphatase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is postulated to exist as a multi-component enzyme system in which a glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit has its catalytic site directed toward the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and a G6P transporter serves to deliver G6P from the cytosol to the active site of the catalytic subunit (3Mithieux G.

It also postulates the existence of transporters for inorganic phosphate and glucose that return the reaction products back to the cytosol, but neither transporter has yet been identified. In contrast, the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase or G6PC) (7Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

Mutations within G6Pase cause glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a, which is characterized by severe hypoglycemia in the post-absorptive state, hepatomegaly associated with excessive glycogen deposition, growth retardation, hepatic adenomas, hyperuricemia, anemia, proteinuria or microalbuminuria, kidney calcifications, osteopenia, increased alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase activities, and increased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (11Chou J.Y.

Interestingly, the spectrum of clinical problems that arise varies between GSD type 1a patients, indicating the influence of modifier genes that affect the actual phenotype (12Talente G.M.

Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Mutations in the G6P transporter give rise to GSD type 1b, which has a similar phenotype to that of GSD type 1a but also additional complications possibly related to independent functions of the G6P transporter in other tissues (11Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although extracts from all tissues can hydrolyze G6P, enzymatic activity that is selective for G6P and that shows a latency consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum location is highest in liver but is also detected in kidney, intestine, brain, and islets (3Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Foster J.D. Pederson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Although glucose-6-phosphatase activity and G6Pase mRNA are detectable in islets, the activity displays distinct kinetic behavior and inhibitor profiles compared with that assayed in hepatic extracts, an observation that might be explained by the existence of a distinct G6Pase isoform in islets, present in addition to the known G6Pase isoform (13Arden S.D.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is expressed in all tissues examined to date. The human IGRP and UGRP genes encode proteins that share a similar size (355 amino acids, 40,552 daltons and 346 amino acids, 38,709 daltons, respectively) and sequence (50 and 36% identity, respectively) to human G6Pase (357 amino acids, 40,487 daltons). The homology extends over the full length of these molecules including the putative transmembrane domains. The exon/intron structures of all three genes are also similar, suggesting that they are evolutionarily related (16Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol.

Overexpression of IGRP by transient transfection of fibroblast or endocrine cell lines has been reported either to not affect the rate of G6P hydrolysis in tissue homogenates (13Arden S.D. Zahn T.

Questions thus arise as to whether the physiologically important substrate that UGRP hydrolyzes is something other than G6P or whether a low rate of G6P hydrolysis by UGRP might nevertheless influence glucose production in vivo because of the wide tissue distribution of the enzyme. To address these possibilities, this study describes the generation and characterization of UGRP knock-out mice. The results demonstrate that, although deletion of UGRP reduces glucose-6-phosphatase activity in tissue extracts, the phenotype of UGRP knock-out mice is mild, indicating that G6Pase is the major glucose-6-phosphatase of physiological importance for glucose homeostasis in vivo. Animal Care—The animal facilities at Vanderbilt University and Lexicon Genetics meet the standards published by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and all protocols were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center or Lexicon Genetics Animal Care and Use Committees. Generation of the UGRP Targeting Vector—The ugrp targeting vector was constructed by using the λ knock-out shuttle (λKOS) system as described previously (27Wattler S. Kelly M. Nehls M. Bio Techniques. 1999; 26 (1158, 1160): 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Lambda KOS phage library, arrayed into 96 superpools, was screened by PCR using exon 1-specific primers (UGRP-1, 5′-AAGGTTCCTCGACTTGCACC, and UGRP-2, 5′-CTCAGCAATGAAGGTGATCC). The PCR-positive phage superpools were plated and screened by filter hybridization using the 253-bp amplicon derived from primers UGRP-1 and UGRP-2 as a probe. A genomic clone, pKOS18, was isolated from the library screening and confirmed by sequence and restriction analysis. Gene-specific arms (UGRP-3, 5′-CCCTACAACGGGCTCCAGGCTAGAGGACTCCTGATTCACC, and UGRP-4, 5′-CCCAAAGGGATAAGGGGACCAGGATGCCCGAAGGCTTCTC) were appended by PCR to a yeast selection cassette containing the URA3 marker. The yeast selection cassette and pKOS18 were co-transformed into yeast, and clones that had undergone homologous recombination to replace a 228-bp region containing the 218-bp exon 1 and 10 bp of the first intron (17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the yeast selection cassette were isolated. The yeast cassette was subsequently replaced with a LacZ/Neo selection cassette, by utilizing an SfiI site engineered to the ends of the yeast cassette and the LacZ/Neo cassette, to complete the ugrp targeting vector. The design of this targeting vector is such that the UGRP promoter drives LacZ expression, whereas the polyoma enhancer/herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter drives Neo expression. Generation of UGRP Knock-out Mice—The targeting vector (25 μg) was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 107 129SvEvBrd-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES clones that were G418- and FIAU-resistant were isolated, amplified, and screened for homologous recombination events by Southern blot analysis. Briefly, EcoRI-digested DNA was hybridized to a 3′ external probe corresponding to a 364-bp region downstream of the 3′ homologous arm. This probe was generated using wild type ES cell genomic DNA, designated Lex2 (see Fig. 1), as the template with primers UTT012-17 (5′-GGCCACTGCATGATCACAG) and UTT012-18 (5′-ACTTGGTGAGGGAAATGTGC). The Southern blot of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI produces a 20-kbp wild type band and a 4-kbp targeted band. The single targeting event was also confirmed by hybridizing SpeI-digested ES DNA with a neo probe (data not shown). Cells from the targeted clone, designated 1B2, were microinjected into C57BL/6J albino blastocysts, resulting in the generation of chimeric mice. Breeding Strategy for UGRP Knock-out Mice—F1 chimeric (129SvEvBrd × C57BL/6J) mice were interbred to generate F2 wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous knock-out mice. The F2 heterozygous mice were then bred with F1 hybrid (C57BL/6J × 129SvEvBrd) mice. Two male and two female heterozygous mice from this breeding, along with their offspring, were then interbred to generate a mouse colony used in the phenotypic characterization of the effect of UGRP gene deletion. PCR Genotyping of UGRP Knock-out Mice—Mouse tail DNA was genotyped using PCR to distinguish the wild type and targeted alleles. Primers UTT012-1 (5′-AAGGTTCCTCGACTTGCACC) and UTT012-23 (5′-TGAGGCGGAGACTGTATTTG) were used to amplify a 497-bp product from the wild type allele, whereas primers UTT012-23 and Neo3a (5′-GCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC) were used to amplify a 376-bp product from the targeted allele. Tail DNA was isolated and purified by standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch EF Maniatis EF. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The wild type and targeted allele fragments were amplified using 100 ng of genomic DNA and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with a PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 100 μl under the following reaction conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. UGRP and G6Pase mRNA Expression Analyses—UGRP and G6Pase gene expression were analyzed by RNA blotting. Liver and kidney tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after isolation and stored at –80°C. Total RNA was then isolated using the ToTALLY RNA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples (20 μg) were separated on 1% agarose gels containing 18% formaldehyde and then transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary transfer using 10× SSC buffer. The blots were hybridized for 16 h at 65 °C in ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech) with a 32P-radiolabeled randomly primed probe corresponding to either the full-length mouse UGRP open reading frame (ORF) or the full-length mouse G6Pase ORF. The UGRP ORF was isolated from a previously described pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO plasmid (17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as a BamHI-NotI fragment. A mouse G6Pase cDNA in the pCMV-SPORT6 vector (Image clone number 4237115) was purchased from Open Biosystems. The G6Pase ORF was isolated as an XhoI-EcoRV fragment. The UGRP and G6Pase ORFs (25 ng) were labeled by random oligonucleotide priming with [α-32P]dATP using the Stratagene Prime-It II random primer labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (final specific radioactivity, ∼0.6 Ci·nmol–1). After hybridization, the blots were washed for 40 min at 55 °C in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and then in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for up to 2 h prior to visualization by autoradiography. The blots were then stripped by washing in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 100 °C for 20 min and reprobed with a labeled mouse β-actin probe to correct for variation in mRNA loading. A mouse β-actin cDNA in the pCMV-SPORT6 vector (Image clone number 2812162) was purchased from Open Biosystems. The full-length β-actin ORF was isolated as a HindIII-EcoRI fragment and labeled as described above. The data were quantitated through the use of a Packard Instant Imager. For some experiments ∼3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 400 μg of kidney total RNA using the Ambion MicroPoly(A) kit; 0.75 μg of purified RNA was then separated by electrophoresis as described above. Phenotypic Analysis of UGRP Knock-out Mice—The mice were fed a standard rodent chow (LabDiet 5001; 23% protein and 4.5% fat; PMI Nutrition International) and were analyzed at 4 months of age. After a 5 h fast mice were weighed. One hour later mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and blood samples (∼200 μl) were isolated from the retro-orbital venous plexus. Blood glucose concentrations were determined using 3 μl of whole blood and an Accu-Check Advantage monitor (Roche Applied Science). EDTA (5 μl; 0.5 m) was added to the remaining samples that were then spun to isolate plasma. Trasylol (aprotinin; 5 μl; Bayer Health Care) was added to the plasma to prevent proteolysis of glucagon. Cholesterol and fatty acids were assayed using a cholesterol reagent kit (Raichem) and a nonesterified fatty acid C Kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triglyceride and glycerol were assayed using a serum triglyceride determination kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin and glucagon levels were quantitated using radioimmunoassays (29Brissova M. Nicholson W.E. Shiota M. Powers A.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 23-45PubMed Google Scholar) by the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center Hormone Assay Core. Glycogen content was determined using the enzymatic method of Chan and Exton (30Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Staining—Pancreatic tissue dissected from female wild type and UGRP knock-out mice was fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 4°C. The tissues were rinsed in PBS for 15 min at 4°C and then stored overnight in PBS at 4 °C. The tissues were then sequentially equilibrated with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 3 h, 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS/(OCT) embedding media (1:1) for 2 h and then embedded in OCT on dry ice for cyrosectioning (7 μm). The slides were baked at 37 °C for 10 min and hydrated in PBS for 10 min, and antigen retrieval was performed using 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 2 min in a microwave oven. The sections were then washed in PBS and blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature. Double immunofluoresence labeling of insulin and glucagon was undertaken with guinea pig insulin and mouse glucagon antibodies (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:100 with overnight incubation at 4 °C in a humid chamber. Subsequently, the sections were washed in PBS and incubated with Cy2 anti-guinea pig and Cy3 anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Immunolabs, CA). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. The slides were rinsed and mounted in 30% glycerol in PBS for visualization. At least 10 islets from a single or 20th consecutive pancreatic section were examined and scored from all groups of mice (n = 6). Images of individual islets were recorded with an Olympus BX51 microscope using a Pixera 600 digital color camera and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Individual islet area was determined, and the nuclei stained with Hoechst 33258 were counted manually. Subsequently, the Cy3 stained glucagon-positive cells were counted in a double blind manner by two independent observers. Statistical Analyses—The data were analyzed for differences from the control values, as specified in the figure legends. The statistical comparisons were calculated using a Student's t test: two samples assuming equal variance. The level of significance was as indicated in the figure legends (two-sided test). Generation of UGRP Knock-out Mice—A modified mouse UGRP allele in which exon 1 and 10 bp of the first intron (17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were replaced by a LacZ/Neo cassette was created by gene targeting in ES cells (Fig. 1A). The design of the targeting vector was such that the UGRP promoter drives LacZ expression, whereas the polyoma enhancer/herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter drives Neo expression. Correct gene targeting was confirmed by Southern blot (data not shown) and PCR (Fig. 1B) analysis. ES cells containing this targeted allele were then used to generate mice. Genotype analysis of 194 3-week old pups generated by cross-breeding heterozygous UGRP–/+ mice demonstrated that 43 mice were UGRP+/+, 101 were UGRP–/+, and 50 were UGRP–/–, consistent with a pattern of Mendelian inheritance. The ratio of male to female mice was 88:106. Cross-breeding experiments revealed that male and female homozygous UGRP–/– mice are fertile, indicating that UGRP expression in testis, prostate, and ovary (17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is not essential for reproduction. Biochemical analyses confirmed that the UGRP gene was not expressed in UGRP–/– mice. Thus, RNA blotting demonstrated the absence of UGRP mRNA (Fig. 1C) and Western blot analyses of brain and testis extracts from wild type and UGRP–/– mice, using an anti-UGRP 13-amino acid C-terminal peptide antibody (17Boustead J.N.

Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), showed the loss of a 30-kDa component (data not shown) that corresponds in size to UGRP as previously demonstrated in transfected COS 7 cells (17Boustead J.N.

Phosphatase activity was assessed in brain, a tissue in which mouse UGRP is relatively abundantly expressed at the mRNA level (17Boustead J.N. Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). UGRP activity was calculated as the difference between activities obtained with the wild type and knock-out mouse tissue. Deletion of UGRP resulted in a highly significant decrease in glucose-6-phosphate hydrolytic activity (3.8 ± 0.6 versus 1.4 ± 0.5 nmol/min/mg, n = 4; p < 0.01) consistent with the ability of UGRP to hydrolyze G6P (19Shieh J.J.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, assays of transfected COS cell extracts in the same experiments showed little change in G6P hydrolytic activity in UGRP transfectants compared with the vector-only control (4.0 ± 0.6 versus 2.8 ± 0.8 nmol/min/mg, n = 4). Under the same conditions, when G6Pase was expressed at levels equivalent to that of UGRP (data not shown), G6Pase transfectants showed an activi"

We have used random saturation mutagenesis to identify essential residues in the N terminus of the human complement factor 5a receptor (C5aR). In a library of N-terminal mutant C5aR molecules screened for activation by C5a, residues 24-30 of the C5aR showed a marked propensity to mutate to cysteine, most likely indicating that sulfhydryl groups at these positions are appropriately situated to form disulfide interactions with the unpaired Cys27 of human C5a. This presumptive spatial constraint allowed the ligand to be computationally docked to the receptor to form a model of the C5a/C5aR interaction. When the N-terminal mutant C5aR library was rescreened with C5a C27R, a ligand incapable of disulfide interactions, no individual position in the N terminus was essential for receptor signaling. However, the region 19-29 was relatively highly conserved in the functional mutants, further demonstrating that this region of the C5aR makes a productive physiologic interaction with the C5a ligand.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; C5a, complement factor 5a; C5aR, complement factor 5a receptor; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; TM, transmembrane helix; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. transduce signals from a wide variety of biological stimuli, including small molecules, lipids, peptides, proteins, and environmental cues such as odorants and light (1Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). As the largest family of cell-surface receptors, they have provided fertile ground for pharmacologic modulation. GPCRs share a secondary structure consisting of seven transmembrane helices (TMs 1-7) joined by three intracellular and three extracellular loops, along with N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1). The receptors serve as binary switches that, when activated by ligand, exhibit guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward heterotrimeric G proteins (2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Because they are large transmembrane proteins, GPCRs are difficult to study by direct structural methods such as x-ray crystallography. A series of crystal structures of bovine rhodopsin has allowed major progress in the understanding of GPCR structure (3Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) but has not made clear the mechanism by which these receptors serve as switches, because rhodopsin has only been crystallized in its resting state. The mechanism of GPCR activation has, however, been productively explored using a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques. Overall, ligand binding by GPCRs appears to induce a rigid-body movement of TM6 away from TM3, exposing new receptor surfaces that allow coupling to downstream effectors (8Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 11Bissantz C. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2003; 23: 123-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has studied the human complement factor 5a receptor (C5aR) (12Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) as a model system because it, like rhodopsin and many other clinically important receptors, belongs to the large family A of GPCRs (13Horn F. Bettler E. Oliveira L. Campagne F. Cohen F.E. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The C5aR has 19% amino acid identity with rhodopsin and has loop and transmembrane helix lengths similar to those of rhodopsin. Furthermore, the C5aR can be expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, making it amenable to genetic studies. In addition to its role as a model receptor, the C5aR has intrinsic biological interest. The vertebrate anaphylatoxin C5a is produced upon activation of the serum complement cascade and is the principal chemotactic agent for recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. The C5aR is also responsible for histamine release from mast cells, degranulation of eosinophils, vasodilation, vascular permeabilization, and other components of the acute inflammatory response (14Wetsel R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The central role of the C5aR in inflammation has made it a candidate therapeutic target in lupus (15Bao L. Osawe I. Puri T. Lambris J.D. Haas M. Quigg R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and rheumatoid arthritis (16Wang Y. Rollins S.A. Madri J.A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8955-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), among other autoimmune disorders, and in sepsis (17Allegretti M. Moriconi A. Beccari A.R. Di Bitondo R. Bizzarri C. Bertini R. Colotta F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Optimal anti-C5aR therapeutics will require a good understanding of the structural basis for the ligand binding ability, switch mechanism, and interaction with downstream effectors of the receptor. The two-site model of C5a/C5aR binding (18Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) proposes that two separate binding sites contribute to ligand affinity. One binding site involves the C terminus of C5a (approximately residues 67-74) and a pocket formed by the TMs of the C5aR. In support of this claim, mutations in the ligand C-terminal tail inhibit ligand binding and receptor activation (19Mollison K.W. Mandecki W. Zuiderweg E.R. Fayer L. Fey T.A. Krause R.A. Conway R.G. Miller L. Edalji R.P. Shallcross M.A. Lane B. Fox J.L. Greer J. Carter G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Synthetic hexapeptides derived from the tail of C5a can compete with the full-length ligand and serve as full agonists (18Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Kawai M. Quincy D.A. Lane B. Mollison K.W. Or Y.S. Luly J.R. Carter G.W. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating that the tail interacts with the receptor. Receptor residues Ile116, Arg206, and Val286 have been identified as points of interaction with the C5a C-terminal tail (21Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3394-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22DeMartino J.A. Konteatis Z.D. Siciliano S.J. Van Riper G. Underwood D.J. Fischer P.A. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15966-15969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Evidence for a second site of receptor/ligand interaction comes from the observation that high-affinity C5a sites are lost when the C5aR N terminus is truncated (23DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subjected to point mutations (24Mery L. Boulay F. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or substituted by the corresponding region of the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptor (25Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately half of the binding energy for C5a appears to be derived from interactions with the receptor N terminus (25Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies showed that a peptide identical to the first 34 amino acids of C5aR retained its ability to bind C5a and that proton resonances in receptor positions 21-30 were most strongly affected by the binding event (26Chen Z. Zhang X. Gonnella N.C. Pellas T.C. Boyar W.C. Ni F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10411-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although these data implicate the N terminus of the C5aR in ligand binding, it remains unclear which region of C5a is involved in the interaction. In the two-site model for C5aR function, the N terminus of the receptor captures the ligand and positions it to interact with the TM bundle but does not directly participate in the switch mechanism. A receptor/ligand interaction at the second site is required to actuate the switch. A similar model has been proposed for other family A receptors, including the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (27Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Endocrine. 2005; 26: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), vasopressin receptor (29Kojro E. Eich P. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13537-13544Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and neuropeptide Y receptor (30Walker P. Munoz M. Martinez R. Peitsch M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2863-2869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For small-molecule ligands that are too small to span two binding sites, the binding affinity of the receptor usually lies entirely in the TM domain, not in an extracellular region. Prior work from our laboratory has illustrated the value of random saturation mutagenesis in the structure/function analysis of GPCRs (31Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12010-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This technique makes use of a high-throughput reverse-genetic screen to examine the role of each amino acid position while relying on a minimum of a priori assumptions. In the present study, we subjected the N terminus of the C5aR to random saturation mutagenesis to identify residues that are essential for interacting with the ligand. No individual residue was found to be essential; however, our analysis revealed a structural constraint that allowed us to model the binding of C5a to its receptor. Yeast Strains—Yeast strain BY1142 (31Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) has the genotype MATα far1Δ1442 tbt1-1 Pfus1-HIS3 can1 ste14::trp1::LYS2 ste3Δ1156 gpa1 (41)-Gαi3 lys2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2. In this strain, all but the first 41 residues of the endogenous yeast Gα subunit Gpa1 are replaced by human Gαi3, creating a chimeric α subunit that can be activated by mammalian receptors but can also signal to downstream components of the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway tivated protein kinase mating cascade is engineered so that G protein activation causes transcription of the Pfus1-HIS3 reporter. Thus, G protein or receptor activity allows the yeast to grow on histidine-deficient medium. Strain BY1173 has the genotype MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1 gpa1Δ::ade2Δ::3xHA far1Δ::ura3Δ fus1::Pfus1-HIS3 LEU2::Pfus1-LacZ sst2Δ::ura3Δ ste2Δ::G418R trp1::GPA1/Gαi1 (36Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H. Watson M.A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); in this strain, the final 5 residues of Gpa1 are replaced by the corresponding residues of human Gαi1, again to provide a signaling assay for mammalian receptors. The integrated Pfus1-LacZ reporter causes G protein activation to elicit β-galactosidase expression. Yeast were transformed by the standard lithium acetate procedure and grown at 30 °C. Library Construction and Screening—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce an NcoI site near the N terminus of C5aR and a silent MluI site near position 32. The introduction of NcoI required an N2D mutation in C5aR; this is a conservative change that preserves receptor function and ligand affinity. To eliminate the possibility of wild-type contamination of the N-terminal mutant library, a noncoding “stuffer” sequence was first subcloned between NcoI and MluI, and the resulting plasmid was used for library construction. The oligonucleotide 5′-ATACCATGGACTCTTTTAATTATACTACTCCAGATTATGGTCATTATGATGATAAAGATACTCTAGATCTAAATACTCCAGTTGATAAAACTTCTAATACTCTACGCGTAG-3′ was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) with a palindromic 3′ sequence and a 20% mutation doping rate at the underlined positions, corresponding to residues 2-32 of the receptor. To preserve the NcoI site, only nucleotides 2 and 3 of the codon for Asp2 were mutagenized. The mutant oligonucleotide was self-annealed, filled in with Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs), and subcloned into the NcoI/MluI sites of C5aR to create a library of ∼2 × 105 mutant receptors (pBN1232) in an ADE2 vector. To screen the library, yeast BY1142 was cotransformed with pBN1232 and with the C5a ligand plasmid pBN444 (URA3 vector), then grown under selection. Approximately 105 transformants were screened by the yeast growth assay described below. Thirty colonies exhibiting ligand-dependent growth on 3-AT were selected for further analysis. Plasmids were isolated from these colonies by standard methods, sequenced (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and resubjected to the growth assay to confirm their phenotypes. Library Statistical Analysis—Before screening, characteristics of the N-terminal mutant library were verified by sequencing randomly selected clones. Mutations were evenly spaced along the region under study. The randomly selected receptors contained an average of 18.3 nucleotide changes (18.1%) and 11 amino acid changes (36.7%). Assuming a binomial distribution of mutations, 54.9% of the total codons in the library were unmutated, 36.4% contained precisely one nucleotide change, 8.0% had two changes, and 0.6% had three changes. At positions 24, 26, 27, and 29 of the C5aR, the native codons were such that two nucleotide changes were required for cysteine to arise, yet cysteine occurred 25 times at these positions in the selected receptors. To find the number of cysteines that would have been expected here by chance, we noted that two-nucleotide mutations allowed any given triplet codon to change to 27 of the 63 remaining codons. Two of these codons represented cysteine, so P(cysteine|occurrence of a two-nucleotide mutation) = 2/27 = 0.074. The probability of observing a cysteine was P(cysteine|occurrence of a two-nucleotide mutation) × P(occurrence of a two-nucleotide mutation) = 0.074 × 0.080 = 0.0059. Our 29 mutant receptors sampled these positions 4 × 29 = 116 times, so the expected number of cysteines at these positions was 116 × 0.0059 = 0.69. We repeated this analysis for position 30, where a single nucleotide change (TCT to TGT) was required to introduce a cysteine. A single-nucleotide mutation made nine mutant codons accessible, only one of which (in this case) encoded cysteine, so P(cysteine|occurrence of a single-nucleotide mutation) = 1/9 = 0.111). At position 30, the expected probability of cysteine was P(cysteine|occurrence of a single-nucleotide mutation) × P(occurrence of a single-nucleotide mutation) = 0.111 × 0.364 = 0.040. Our mutant receptors sampled this position 29 times, so the expected number of cysteines at position 30 was 29 × 0.040 = 1.2. (The possibility of a two-nucleotide transition to cysteine contributes negligibly to this calculation, adding an additional 0.1 expected cysteine in 29 receptors.) Sequence Conservation Scoring—Conservation at each position of C5aR was determined using the Scorecons server (www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/valdar/scorecons_server.pl) (37Valdar W.S. Proteins. 2002; 48: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) with the default parameters of α = 1 for symbol diversity, β = 0.5 for stereochemical diversity, and γ = 3 for gaps. Ligand Mutagenesis—A C27R mutation was introduced into the C5a ligand by PfuTurbo (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis followed by plasmid sequencing. YFP Tagging of Receptors—Three receptors from the N series (N2, N13, and N55) were selected for further analysis. These were tagged with YFP at their C terminus by subcloning the KpnI-XhoI fragment of the mutant C5aR plasmid into the XhoI-KpnI fragment of a wild-type C5aR-YFP plasmid. The resulting tag allowed receptors to be detected by Western blotting or, in vivo, by fluorescence microscopy. For Western blotting, log-phase yeast growing in liquid culture were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by vortexing for 5 min with 0.5-mm glass beads in 1× SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polylvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antiserum at 1:200 dilution (sc-8334; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Yeast Growth Assay—To assess the strength of receptor signaling, a yeast growth assay was used. For each receptor/ligand combination, three single colonies of yeast expressing a ligand (C5a, C5a C27R, or empty vector) and receptor were replica-plated onto Ura/His drop-out plates containing 3-AT (1-100 mm) and minimal adenine. 3-AT is a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product, so the concentration of 3-AT tolerated is an indicator of the strength of GPCR signaling. A color selection method allowed us to confirm that growth was receptor-dependent. White colony color indicated continued adenine prototrophy. Colonies that lost their receptor/ADE2 plasmid became reliant on scarce environmental adenine, therefore either failing to grow or producing a red pigment that was cause for exclusion from our selection. β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast BY1173 transformed with appropriate receptor and ligand plasmids (or empty vector) was grown in suspension at 30 °C under selective conditions. To assess yeast density after overnight growth, the A600 of each culture was measured using a Spectronic-20 spectrophotometer (Bausch & Lomb). All of the cultures had an A600 of ∼0.7. For each culture, a standard quantity of yeast (10 μl divided by the A600) was seeded into a 96-well microtiter plate containing lysis/substrate buffer at final concentrations of 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside, and 25 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The quantity of yeast was sufficiently small that there was no turbidity visible in the wells. The assay plate was sealed and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, color development was halted by the addition of Na2CO3 to 0.2 m, and A570 was measured on a Bio-Rad model 680 microplate reader. Molecular Modeling—The C5aR was modeled as a three-dimensional bundle of TMs connected by extracellular loops, as was described previously (34Klco J.M. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12010-12019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The obtained structure was extended outward at the N terminus by manually adding a fragment corresponding to residues 24-37 of C5aR in a position presumably allowing contacts with residue 27 of C5a. Using the Swiss PDB Viewer (www.expasy.org/spdbv/) (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar), a structure of C5a taken from Protein Data Bank entry 1KJS (39Zhang X. Boyar W. Toth M.J. Wennogle L. Gonnella N.C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was docked to the C5aR to satisfy the following constraints: (i) proximity between Cys27 of C5a and residues 24-30 of the C5aR; (ii) outward orientation of the side chain of Asn64; and (iii) burial of the C terminus of C5a in its known binding pocket in the TM bundle. To place the ligand Gly73 in proximity to receptor Val286 and Ile116 (21Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

The resulting docked model was subjected to energy minimization using the program SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) to remove clashes between residues. Random Mutagenesis of the C5aR N Terminus—The N terminus of the C5a receptor consists of ∼37 amino acid residues situated upstream of the first transmembrane domain (12Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). To identify N-terminal residues that play a role in either ligand binding or activation of C5aR, we made use of a random mutagenesis strategy (31Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O.

Randomly doped oligonucleotides were subcloned into nucleotide positions 5-96 of the human C5aR open reading frame to construct a library of mutant receptors. To screen the mutant receptors for signaling ability, we used a yeast strain (BY1142) that has been engineered to provide a receptor signaling assay. In wild-type yeast, the pheromone receptor Ste2p activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that culminates in cell cycle arrest and yeast mating. BY1142 lacks the FAR1 gene required for cell cycle arrest and instead contains an integrated Pfus1-HIS3 reporter; thus, yeast expressing a functional receptor exhibit histidine prototrophy upon receptor activation. The strength of receptor signaling can be assessed by replica-plating colonies of yeast on media containing increasing concentrations of 3-AT, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. To provide a signal to activate the mutant receptors, we coexpressed the receptor library with the human C5a ligand fused to a pre-pro-α factor secretory sequence. C5a is a 74-amino acid polypeptide that, when directed through the secretory pathway of yeast, is retained in the periplasmic space and is able to activate receptors in an autocrine manner. We selected 29 mutant receptors (the “N” series of receptors) that retained the ability to be activated by C5a despite containing an average of 11.2 amino acid changes relative to the wild-type sequence (Fig. 2). None of the 29 receptors was functional when coexpressed with an empty vector in place of C5a, demonstrating that they are not constitutively active. Amino acid changes in the functional N-terminal C5aR mutants were evenly distributed in the region between residues 3 and 32, the boundaries of our mutagenesis. There were 326 individual amino acid changes in the functional mutants; of these, 254 (77.9%) involved only one nucleotide change, making each of them relatively likely to arise in the unscreened mutant library. In random mutagenesis screens, amino acid positions that do not tolerate mutations or that allow only conservative changes are considered to be “preserved” and are inferred to play a structural or functional role. We evaluated the preservation of each position in the C5aR N terminus using a scoring algorithm (Scorecons (37Valdar W.S. Proteins. 2002; 48: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar)) that considers both the substitution rate and the degree to which those substitutions preserve the character of the amino acid side chain. For this analysis, the amino acids are classified as being aliphatic (AVLIMC), aromatic (FWYH), polar (STNQ), positive (KR), negative (DE), or prone to special conformations (GP) (41Mirny L.A. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Important caveats for this analysis are, first, that these categories do not fully capture the context-dependent chemical behavior of each amino acid, and second, that the preservation analysis is necessarily sensitive to the details of the algorithm that is used. As an additional measure of preservation, we defined a residue as being “strictly preserved” if it tolerated only conservative mutations (i.e. mutations entailing a substitution score ≥ 1 in the PAM250 matrix (42Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar)) or a single nonconservative change in the absence of other changes. This measure of preservation has been used in our previous mutagenesis studies of the C5aR (31Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R.

There were no strictly preserved residues in the N terminus of C5aR; the most highly preserved residue was Asp2, but only two nucleotides of this codon had been subjected to mutagenesis. Thr19, Ser3, Tyr6, Thr8, and Asn5 were the next most preserved amino acids, in descending order. The absence of strictly preserved positions stands in marked contrast to the other regions of the C5aR, each of which contains at least one strictly preserved position (31Baranski T.J. Herzmark P.

Hydrophobic interactions are often involved in protein tertiary structure. If this were the case for the C5aR N terminus, we would expect to find certain positions to tolerate only hydrophobic side chains. As in our previous studies, hydrophobic residues (Ala, Cys, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val) were defined as those for which the free amino acid preferentially partitions into the organic phase of an octanol/water mixture (43Fauchère J.L. Charton M. Kier L.B. Verloop A. Pliska V. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In our screen of the N terminus using C5a as the ligand, there were no positions that required hydrophobic residues for function (Fig. 2). Because no residue of the N terminus was strictly preserved by random mutagenesis screening, we asked whether other factors could account for the functionality of the mutants. Remarkably, the vast majority of the functional mutants (25 of 29 or 86.2%) incorporated one or more cysteines at positions 24-30 (circled in Fig. 2). At most of these positions, amino acids 24, 26, 27, and 29, accounting for 25 of 35 cysteines in this region, two nucleotide changes were necessary for cysteine to arise. In the absence of selective pressure, we would have expected to see a total of 0.69 cysteines at these positions in a set of 29 receptors (see “Experimental Procedu"

To address this issue, we have measured different molecular markers of nitrosative stress in three stably transfected cell lines derived from the human lung epithelial line A549: two lines that overexpress rat HO-1 (L1 and A4), and a control line with the empty vector (Neo). Compared with the control Neo cells, L1 and A4 cells had, respectively, 5.8- and 3.8-fold greater HO activity accompanied by increased resistance to NO-induced necrosis. Compared with the Neo control, the HO-1-overexpressing cells also showed significantly less lipid peroxide formation and decreased perturbation of transition metal oxidation and coordination states following a cytotoxic NO exposure. These effects were blocked by the HO-1 inhibitors Zn- and Sn-protoporphyrin IX. In contrast, HO-1 overexpression did not significantly affect total reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, the levels of the nucleobase deamination products in DNA (xanthine, inosine, and uracil) following NO exposure, or NO-induced protein nitration. While increased HO-1 activity prevented NO-induced fluctuations in transition metal homeostasis, addition of an iron chelator decreased NO toxicity only slightly. Our results indicate that lipid peroxidation is a significant cause of NO-induced necrosis in human lung epithelial cells, and that the increased NO survival of L1 cells is due at least in part to decreased lipid peroxidation mediated by HO-1-generated biliverdin or bilirubin.

Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Low nanomolar concentrations of NO produced by endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS play a role in physiological processes including smooth muscle relaxation (endothelial NOS) (2Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal signaling (endothelial NOS and neuronal NOS implicated) (3O'Dell T.J. Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H.

High concentrations of NO produced by inducible NOS in neutrophils and macrophages contribute to killing of bacteria, pathogens, and tumor cells during an inflammatory response (5Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). In contrast to its beneficial role in cell signaling and immune function, NO production has been implicated for a role in several different disease states including cancer (6Hofseth L.J. Hussain S.P. Wogan G.N. Harris C.C. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 955-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), atherosclerosis (7Rubbo H. O'Donnell V. Toxicology. 2005; 208: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), arthritis (8Van't Hof R.J. Ralston S.H. Immunology. 2001; 103: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and the neuropathologies amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson disease (9Duncan A.J. Heales S.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2005; 26: 67-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The contribution of NO to these disease states is thought to depend on its ability to form highly reactive secondary species such as peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and nitrous anhydride (N2O3), following reaction with superoxide (O2·¯ ) and molecular oxygen, respectively (10Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These secondary products of NO can react with a variety of cellular structures including proteins (10Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R.S. Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), lipids (12O' Donnell V.B. Freeman B.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and DNA (10Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). NO also directly binds protein heme and Fe-S centers to modulate or inhibit enzyme activity (13Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Colton C.A. Citrin D. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Bouton C. Drapier J.C. Science STKE. 2003; 182: pe17Google Scholar). Because of these reactions, NO is hypothesized to have a detrimental effect on cellular metal homeostasis. Support for this hypothesis comes from whole cell spectroscopy studies, which indicate the formation of nitrosylated-heme and dinitrosyl-iron (DNIC) complexes in NO-treated cells (15Ueno Y. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cellular exposure to NO also leads to protein tyrosine nitration mediated by the secondary product nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) (10Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R.S. Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and perhaps other mechanisms (16Brennan M.L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17415-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In addition, cysteine nitrosylation generates 3-nitrosothiols in as many as 115 proteins upon NO treatment (17Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to NO damages membranes through lipid peroxidation and nitration, which yield lipid hydroperoxides, nitro-epoxy lipids, and nitrated lipids (12O' Donnell V.B. Freeman B.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). One mechanism of DNA damage by NO involves nitrosative base deamination (18Dong M. Wang C. Deen W.M. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Dong M. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In these reactions, the secondary product, N2O3, directly attacks the heterocyclic amines of DNA bases to form diazonium ions, which, among other reactions, can hydrolyze to complete the deamination; however, other mechanisms are possible (20Glaser R. Wu H. Lewis M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7346-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, adenine, cytosine, and 5-methylcytosine are converted to inosine (dI), uracil (dU), and thymine, respectively, while guanine gives rise to two products: xanthine (dX) and oxanine (dO). Lymphoblastoid cells exposed to toxic levels of NO gas showed only a modest (2–4-fold) increase in dX, dI, and dU, while dO was undetected (19Dong M. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A 6-fold increase in dX formation was also observed in the genomic DNA of stimulated macrophages (21DeRojas-Walker T. Tamir S. Ji H. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Other major products of ONOO– induced DNA damage are 8-nitroguanine, 8-oxoguanine, and nitroimidazole, while deoxyribose oxidation occurs to a lesser extent (10Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Tretyakova N.Y. Burney S. Pamir B. Wishnok J.S. Dedon P.C. Wogan G.N. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutation Res. 2000; 447: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The many targets for NO-induced damage, and the diversity of lesions, likely underlie its relation to a wide variety of diseases. In the face of NO generation, cells may express antioxidant molecules and defense enzymes to prevent or reverse the cellular damage described above. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was recently implicated in basal (23Bishop A. Demple B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 325: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and inducible (24Bishop A. Marquis J.C. Cashman N.R. Demple B. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) resistance to NO toxicity in mouse motor neurons. In addition, an inhibitor of HO-1 (tin protoporphyrin-IX, SnPPIX) blocks adaptive resistance to NO toxicity in both mouse hepatocytes (25Kim Y.M. Bergonia H. Lancaster Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and L929 cells (26Choi B.M. Pae H.O. Chung H.T. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HO-1 is the first enzyme in heme catabolism, producing CO, Fe2+, and biliverdin, which in turn can be reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (27Yoshida T. Migita C.T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both biliverdin and bilirubin are antioxidants that can prevent H2O2/O2·¯ -induced lipid peroxidation and cell death (28Kapitulnik J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CO was identified as a signaling molecule (29Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) in the prevention of NO toxicity in HeLa cells (30Reiter T.A. Demple B. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and L929 fibroblasts (26Choi B.M. Pae H.O. Chung H.T. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At present it is unknown how HO-1 prevents NO-induced toxicity. HO-1 may provide resistance by preventing or decreasing NO modification of specific cellular targets. In this report, we explore whether and how HO-1 overexpression prevents NO-induced modifications in human pulmonary epithelial cells. For these studies, we primarily utilized stable HO-1-overexpressing cell lines rather than the transient induction of HO-1 by chemical agents, which typically are toxic, elicit oxidative stress, and induce a complex genetic response in the exposed cells. Thus, the overexpressing lines allow the assessment of HO-1 function specifically, without the confounding background of other effects. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human lung epithelial cells (A549) stably transfected with a neomycin selection plasmid, pcDNA 3-neo (Neo cells), or with both this selection plasmid and a rat HO-1 expression plasmid (L1 and A4 cells) were kind gifts of Prof. Augustine Choi and Prof. Patty Lee (31Lee P.J. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Choi A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10393-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The rat HO-1 expression plasmid contains a 4.3-kbp EcoRI/AluI fragment with the human β-actin promoter, 5′-untranslated region, and first intron, a 1-kbp XhoI/HindIII fragment with the rat HO-1 cDNA, and a 1-kbp HindIII/KpnI fragment containing the 3′-untranslated region and polyadenylation sequence of mouse HO-1 (31Lee P.J. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Choi A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10393-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) (Ham's F12-10% FBS), penicillin at 25 international units/ml, and streptomycin at 25 μg/ml (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The cells were cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in a humidified incubator. HO-1 Immunoblotting—The cells were grown to ∼80% confluency in Ham's F12-10% fetal bovine serum in 150-cm2 plates, washed once in 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into 3 ml cold PBS, and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet lysed according to a published protocol (30Reiter T.A. Demple B. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lysate samples (130 μg of total protein) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted for HO-1 and β-actin according to a published protocol (30Reiter T.A. Demple B. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1075-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat HO-1 lacking its transmembrane domain (Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA) was used as a control. The Western blot shown is representative of two independent experiments. A separate experiment was performed to determine the ability of NaAsO2 to induce HO-1 protein expression in Neo cells. For each sample, ∼ 2.4 × 106 cells were left untreated or treated with up to 25 μm NaAsO2 for 8 h prior to harvest. Lysate samples (30 μg of total protein per lane) were electrophoresed and immunoblotted for HO-1 and β-actin as described above. HO Activity Assays—Two 150-cm2 plates (containing a total of ∼36 × 106 cells per sample) were washed twice in PBS; scraped into 2 ml of cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Aldrich); and centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture, and sonicated at 0–4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants collected. Assays were performed according to the protocol described by Ryter et al. (32Ryter S.W. Kvam E. Tyrrell R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 369-391PubMed Google Scholar), using a final protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Mean HO activities ± 0.5 S.D. are reported as pmol of bilirubin (mg of protein)–1h–1. NO Toxicity Assays—On the day prior to the assays, the cells (230,000 per ml) were plated into individual wells of 6-well plates (2 ml/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, the cells were either left untreated, or treated with 1–4 mm spermine-NONOate (SPERNO, Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland), an NO donor with a decay half-life of 39 min at pH 7.4, according to the supplier. A 2 mm SPERNO challenge provides a steady state concentration of ∼9 μm NO at pH 7.4 for 2 h. This concentration of NO corresponds to ∼1 μm NO measured at sights of inflammation in vivo (reference in Ref. 18Dong M. Wang C. Deen W.M. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following a 6-h challenge, the medium was removed by aspiration, the cells trypsinized (300 μl of trypsin at 2.5 g/liter), followed by a 4-fold dilution into trypan blue (0.4%, Sigma Aldrich). A hemacytometer was used to count both viable (Trypan Blue-excluding) and nonviable cells. The mean percentage of viable cells (n = 4) ± 0.5 S.D. based on two independent experiments is reported. Student's paired t tests were performed to compare L1 and A4 samples to like-challenged Neo samples. Additional NO toxicity experiments were performed on Neo cells following pretreatment with NaAsO2. Neo cells were plated as described above and left untreated or treated with up to 25 μm NaAsO2 (8 h) prior to a 6-h challenge with 2 mm SPERNO. Following the challenge, cell viability was determined using trypan blue staining as described above. The mean percentage of viable cells (n = 4) ± 0.5 S.D. is reported. Student's paired t tests were performed to compare untreated and 25 μm NaAsO2 pretreated, like-challenged samples. Separate experiments were performed to test the effect of SnPPIX (Frontier Scientific Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT), bilirubin (Frontier Scientific), and desferroximine mesylate (DFO, Sigma Aldrich) on NO toxicity. These experiments were performed as described above, except the cells were left untreated or pretreated with either 50 μm SnPPIX (2 h), 15 μm bilirubin (10 min), or 100 μm DFO (2 h), prior to a 6-h challenge with 3 mm SPERNO. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue staining as described above. The mean percentage of viable cells (n = 4) ± 0.5 S.D. is reported. Student's paired t tests were performed on: Neo cells ± bilirubin pretreatment; L1 cells ± SnPPIX pretreatment; and A4 cells ± SnPPIX pretreatment. Lipid Peroxide Assays—For each sample, ∼36 × 106 cells grown to ∼80% confluency on two 150-cm2 plates were chal-lenged with 2 mm SPERNO for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested at 4 °C by collecting in the same tube: the cell medium; a 3-ml metal free-PBS wash (MF-PBS); 3 ml of cell suspension (following scraping in MF-PBS); and a 3-ml of MF-PBS wash of the scraped plates. These samples were then centrifuged at 320 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once in 5 ml of MF-PBS, and resuspended in 550 μl of cold MF-PBS. The samples were then sonicated three times for 5-s bursts, and the lysate was used directly for both protein assays (using Coomassie Blue) and lipid peroxide assays using the Lipid Hydroperoxide (LPO) Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the lipid hydroperoxides were extracted from lysates in deoxygenated chloroform and added to the kit chromophore for detection at 500 nm. A standard curve was prepared from serial dilutions of 50 μm 13-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid. The lipid peroxide measurements (nmol per sample) were normalized to a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. The mean lipid peroxide values (in nmol) ± 0.5 S.D. are reported with an n of 7, 8, and 6 for Neo, L1, and A4 cells, respectively. Student's paired t tests were performed to compare the L1 and A4 samples to the Neo samples. Additional experiments were performed to determine the effect of NaAsO2 pretreatment on NO-induced lipid peroxide formation in Neo cells. These experiments were performed as described above, except the samples received the following treatments: 1) 12-h challenge with 2 mm SPERNO; 2) 8-h pretreatment with 25 μm NaAsO2 and 12-h recovery; 3) 8-h pretreatment with 25 μm NaAsO2 and 12-h challenge with 2 mm SPERNO; 4) the same treatment as (3O'Dell T.J.

Lipid peroxide values were normalized to a protein concentration of 3.0 mg/ml. The mean nmol of lipid peroxide (n of 7, 7, 5, 7, and 5 for (1Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar), respectively) is reported for each treatment ± 0.5 S.D. Student's t tests were performed to compare: NO-challenged cells ± NaAsO2 pretreatment; NaAsO2 pretreated, NO-challenged cells ± SnPPIX treatment; and NaAsO2 and SnPPIX-treated cells ± SPERNO challenge. Separate experiments were performed to test the effect of bilirubin and SnPPIX on NO-induced lipid peroxidation in Neo and L1 cells. These experiments were performed as described above, except that the samples were left untreated or pretreated with 15 μm bilirubin (15 min, Neo cells) or 50 μm SnPPIX (2 h, L1 cells) prior to the NO challenge. The mean lipid peroxide values (n = 6) ± 0.5 S.D. are shown. Student's paired t tests were used to compare NO-challenged Neo cells ± bilirubin pretreatment and NO-challenged L1 cells ± SnPPIX pretreatment. Whole Cell Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy—Neo and L1 cells were grown to ∼80% on three 150-cm2 confluency plates. The cells in each plate were trypsinized in 2 ml trypsin (2.5 g/liter) and combined to provide a cell stock. Each cell stock was diluted 20-fold and counted using a hemacytometer. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer (Sigma Aldrich). Each cell pellet was resuspended in Krebs-Ringer buffer to provide a final stock concentration of 40 × 106 cells/ml. Samples were aliquoted into individual EPR tubes (250 μl per tube) and were either left untreated; challenged with 2 mm SPERNO for 45 min; or pretreated for 15 min with 50 μm zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX, Frontier Scientific) prior to SPERNO challenge. All sample treatments were performed at 37 °C and stopped by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. EPR measurements were recorded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Chemistry Instrumentation Facility. Whole cell EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Model ESP-300 equipped with a flow cryostat. Spectra were recorded under the following conditions: microwave frequency, 9.38 GHz; modulation amplitude and frequency, 5.7 G and 100 kHz; and microwave power, 1.0 milliwatt. The spectra shown, offset for clarity, are examples of three independent experiments. Protein Nitration Assays—For each sample, two 60-mm plates (∼1.4 × 106 cells, ∼80% confluency) were left untreated or treated with 2 mm SPERNO for up to 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysates prepared as described above. Protein lysate aliquots (containing 100 μg of total protein) from each sample were electrophoresed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed sequentially with rabbit anti-3-nitro-tyrosine polyclonal (Stressgen) and mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma Aldrich). Lysates from Neo and L1 cells, and Neo and A4 cells were used for individual experiments. Quantification of the Y-NO2 signal intensity included a correction for protein loading by normalization to β-actin. The increase in the Y-NO2 signal in lysates from the treated L1 and A4 cells is reported relative to the intensity of the signal in matched Neo samples from the same experiment. The results shown are representative of two experiments. DNA Base Deamination Assays—Deoxynucleoside deamination products from Neo and L1 cells treated with NO were quantitatively evaluated by LC/MS/MS immediately after exposure by a previously reported method (18Dong M. Wang C. Deen W.M. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Neo and L1 (∼2 × 107) were grown in 175-cm2 flasks, treated with 0–2 mm (z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO, Alexis Biochemicals) for 3 h, and harvested for genomic DNA purification using a genomic-tip 100/G kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DETA-NO is a NO donor with a decay half-life of 20 h at pH 7.4, according to the supplier. A 2 mm DETA-NO challenge is estimated to produce a steady state concentration of ∼13 μm NO at pH 7.4 for 18 h. Following cell treatment and harvest, genomic DNA was purified following the manufacturer's instructions except for the addition of deaminase inhibitors coformycin (National Cancer Institute) and tetrahydrouridine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) to the cell lysis buffer at final concentrations of 5 μg/ml and 125 μg/ml, respectively. Genomic DNA (50 μg) was hydrolyzed by the combination of three enzymes (nuclease P1, phosphodiesterase I, and alkaline phosphatase) in the presence of appropriate amounts of isotope-labeled internal standards and deaminase inhibitors. Nuclease P1 and bovine alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and phosphodiesterase I from USB Corporation (Cleveland, OH). The resulting deaminated nucleosides were resolved by HPLC on a Hewlett Packard model 1100, equipped with a 1040 diode array detector. The fractions containing dX, dO, dI, and dU with 15N-labeled internal standards were collected for subsequent LC/MS/MS quantification in an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with MRM (multiple reactions monitoring) positive mode. In view of the implied role of HO-1 in basal (23Bishop A. Demple B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 325: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and inducible (24Bishop A. Marquis J.C.

Med. 2003; 34: 1136-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) resistance to NO toxicity, we tested whether specific biochemical or cellular indicators could be associated with these effects. We used three stably transfected human lung epithelial cell lines derived from A549: one line was derived by transfection with a control vector (Neo line), and two clones expressing rat HO-1 (L1 and A4 lines). We first verified the HO-1 protein expression and activity levels in the transfected cell lines. A ∼35-kDa band representing HO-1 was identified in cell lysates (Fig. 1A). This assignment was verified by the ability of the recombinant protein to block the immunoreactivity of the protein during development (supplementary Fig. S1). As measured by immunoblotting, compared with Neo cells, the L1 and A4 cells clearly overexpressed the HO-1 polypeptide (6.0- and 3.2-fold compared with Neo cells, respectively) (Fig. 1A). The increased HO-1 protein levels were reasonably consistent with the 5.8- and 3.8-fold higher HO activity in lysates of L1 and A4 cells, respectively, compared with lysates from Neo cells (Fig. 1B). The combined results suggest that the induced HO-1 in the L1 and A4 cells is active. Confirming the role of HO-1 in cellular NO resistance, L1 and A4 cells were significantly more resistant to a 6-h SPERNO exposure than were Neo cells (Fig. 2). The rescuing effect of elevated HO-1 protein was also seen at 48 h post-exposure (supplemental Fig. S2). Because PARP cleavage in these cells does not occur before 16 h of exposure (supplemental Fig. S3), increased HO-1 levels seem to protect against both necrosis (observed at 6 h) and apoptotic cell death (48 h). Low NO concentrations can terminate lipid peroxidation (33O' Donnell V.B. Chumley P.H. Hogg N. Bloodsworth A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15216-15223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), while high concentrations favor formation of ONOO–, which mediates oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (34Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Because of the NO resistance mediated by HO-1 and the potential toxicity of lipid peroxidation, we examined NO-induced lipid peroxidation in the transfected cell lines (Fig. 3). Following a 12-h challenge with 2 mm SPERNO, both HO-1 overexpressing cell lines had accumulated less (about 2-fold) lipid peroxide than did Neo cells (p values of 0.007 and 0.04 for L1 and A4 cells, respectively, compared with Neo cells). Thus, HO-1 suppresses an important molecular marker of the oxidative damage exerted by high levels of NO. In additi"

Despite the evolutionary conservation of these proteins, some degree of variability among organisms was observed, which might reflect functional specialization. l-Cyst(e)ine lyase (C-DES), a pyridoxal 5′-phosphatedependent enzyme identified in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, was reported to use preferentially cystine over cysteine with production of cysteine persulfide, pyruvate, and ammonia. In this study, we demonstrate that C-DES sequences are present in all cyanobacterial genomes and constitute a new family of sulfur-mobilizing enzymes, distinct from cysteine desulfurases. The functional properties of C-DES from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 were investigated under pre-steady-state and steady-state conditions. Single wavelength and rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic data indicate that the internal aldimine reacts with cystine forming an external aldimine that rapidly decays to a transient quinonoid species and stable tautomers of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base. In the presence of cysteine, the transient formation of a dipolar species precedes the selective and stable accumulation of the enolimine tautomer of the external aldimine, with no formation of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base under reducing conditions.

Effective sulfur mobilization from cystine might represent a mechanism that allows adaptation of cyanobacteria to different environmental conditions and to light-dark cycles. Sulfur is required for the synthesis and modification of a variety of biomolecules such as Fe-S clusters, thiamine, biotin, lipoic acid, and thiouridine (1Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol.

Among others, cysteine desulfurases are a well characterized family of enzymes that catalyze the removal of sulfur from cysteine with the formation of alanine. The first member of this group of enzymes to be studied was the NifS (cysteine desulfurase) protein from Azotobacter vinelandii (9Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which now represents the prototype of a large family encompassing all three domains of life, the NifS-like proteins.

The cyanobacterium Synechocystis is an oxygenic photosynthetic microorganism and constitutes an interesting system for the investigation of enzymes involved in the response to oxidative stress (27Li H.

The number and function of proteins involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters in Synechocystis and the gene organization of their coding sequences suggest the existence of distinct pathways for Fe-S cluster assembly in cyanobacteria with respect to those identified in other organisms (11Mihara H.

PCC6714 and has been given the name of cyst(e)ine C-S lyase (C-DES) (36Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). C-DES is a homodimeric PLP-dependent enzyme distantly related to the NifS family and belongs to fold type I (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike cysteine desulfurases, C-DES does not have a conserved cysteine residue in the active site (11Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and was proposed to catalyze a typical β-elimination reaction on both l-cysteine and l-cystine with formation of hydrogen sulfide and cysteine persulfide, respectively, pyruvate and ammonia (36Leibrecht I.

A detailed description of the reaction mechanism, including the observation of intermediates in the presence of either of the two substrates, is still lacking. A tentative catalytic mechanism was proposed on the basis of the enzyme three-dimensional structure (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work, we have carried out spectroscopic measurements to determine the reaction mechanism of C-DES with l-cystine and l-cysteine. In addition, an analysis of sequences of C-DES homologues, retrieved in genomic data bases, has allowed the identification of conserved residues that might have a specific role in cyanobacterial enzymes. Chemicals—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were used as received. l-Cysteine was dissolved into a deoxygenated buffer just prior to use in order to minimize the oxidation to cystine. l-Cystine stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the powder in 1 n HCl to a final concentration of about 200 mm. The stock solution was diluted prior to use in the reaction buffer, and the pH was adjusted as needed.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was expressed and purified as described previously (38Lang T. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The enzyme was kept at -80 °C as a stock solution in 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.5. The absorption of a 1% C-DES solution at 280 nm is 14.5 (38Lang T. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which corresponds to a molar extinction coefficient at 426 nm of 7756 m-1 cm-1. Sequence Analysis and Multiple Sequence Alignments—The amino acid sequence of C-DES from Synechocystis was used to search nonredundant sequence data bases using BLAST software (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Retrieved sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The sequence conservation pattern was visualized using the program ESPript (42Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric Measurements—Absorbance spectra were collected in 50 mm Bicine buffer, pH 8. Temperature was maintained at 20 ± 0.5 °C with a circulating water bath. Spectra in the presence of substrates were taken either in deoxygenated conditions (i.e. under helium flux) or, when feasible, in the presence of DTT, to prevent cysteine oxidation and the development of turbidity as a consequence of S0 precipitation. Spectra were corrected for buffer contribution. The dependence of the absorbance at a defined wavelength on substrate concentration was fitted to a binding isotherm, as shown in Equation 1, A=A0+B·[L]Kd+[L](Eq. 1) where A and A0 are absorbance values at a given ligand concentration and in the absence of ligand, respectively; B is the total amplitude; [L] is the concentration of the ligand, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Rapid Scanning and Single Wavelength Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Kinetic experiments were carried out in 50 mm Bicine buffer, pH 8. A 34 μm C-DES solution was mixed with either 4 mm cysteine or 2 mm cystine solutions. The temperature of the loading syringes and the stopped-flow cell compartment was maintained at 20 ± 0.5 °C with a circulating water bath. Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic measurements were carried out using an SX-18 MV apparatus (Applied Photophysics) equipped with a 150-watt Xenon lamp and coupled to an MS 125TM 1/8-m spectrograph and Instaspec II photodiode array (Lot-Oriel). Spectra in the presence of cystine were collected between 320 and 550 nm every 4 ms and while in the presence of cysteine between 336 and 500 nm every 1.2 ms and Single wavelength stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed with the same apparatus, using a 75-watt Xenon lamp as a light source and a photomultiplier as a detector. Kinetic traces were collected at 345, 362, and 420 nm in the presence of cysteine and at 338, 362, 420, and 470 nm in the presence of cystine. 1200-1400 data points were recorded on a logarithmic scale with a total acquisition time of about 500 ms and 2 s for cysteine and cystine, respectively. For both set ups the instrumental dead time was 1.56 ms. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Data Analysis—Single wavelength kinetic traces were fitted independently and simultaneously using a sum of exponential functions, as shown in Equation 2, A=∑iAi·et-t0τi+A0(Eq. 2) where A and A0 are the absorbance values at a given time and at time t→ ∞, respectively; Ai values are pre-exponential factors, and τi values are the relaxation times. The time-resolved difference spectra, obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the free enzyme to the RSSF spectral set, were analyzed by singular value decomposition (SVD) (43Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 44Henry E.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 652-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the program MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA). Each experiment provided a (m × n) data matrix (the A matrix), where m is the number of wavelengths, and n is the number of spectra collected. The data matrix was resolved into a product of three matrices, usually named U, S, and V, as shown in Equation 3. A=U×S×VT(Eq. 3) The (m × n) U matrix consists of n orthonormal eigenvectors; S is a square diagonal matrix, and VT isa(n × n) matrix whose rows are also orthonormal. The columns of U are basis spectral components that combine to yield each observed spectrum with a contribution weighted by its singular value and a time evolution derived from the corresponding row in VT matrix. It is important to stress that each column of U does not represent the spectrum of a pure component (45Hendler R.W. Shrager R.I. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The first criterion for the selection of usable components is the magnitude of the singular values, the higher values being the meaningful ones. The selected components can be further screened by evaluating the autocorrelations of the corresponding columns of U and V and rejecting the component if either autocorrelation falls below 0.8 (43Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The columns of V were fitted to sums of exponentials (Equation 2). Identification of C-DES Homologues—A Blast search of nonredundant sequence data bases with Synechocystis C-DES as a query gave low scoring matches with sequences from bacteria, fungi, and plants. Most of these sequences showed identities to C-DES lower than 30% and are annotated as SufS or NifS homologues. A low similarity of C-DES to NifS proteins has been reported previously (38Lang T. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), allowing the inclusion of C-DES into the NifS family following the relaxed definition of Ouzounis and Sander (46Ouzounis C. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The alignment of A. vinelandii NifS sequence with that of C-DES is reported in Fig. 1 (group 2). Interestingly, the search gave highly significant matches with entries from cyanobacteria. Sixteen sequences displayed a similarity higher than 50% and an identity higher than 40%, up to 55%. The 16 high scoring matches are annotated as cysteine/cystine lyases (including putative proteins and homologues; 12 entries), class V aminotransferases (two entries), selenocysteine lyase (see Ref. 46Ouzounis C. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or isopenicillin-N epimerase. A representative selection of sequences is reported in Fig. 1 (group 1). Analysis of the C-DES three-dimensional structure (Fig. 2) (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the CASTp program (47Binkowski T.A. Naghibzadeh S. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3352-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) revealed that many of the conserved residues belong to the active site (Fig. 2) and are involved in cofactor and substrate/product binding (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In particular, the active site lysine that binds the cofactor (Lys-223 in the Synechocystis sequence) is conserved among all the sequences, together with a string of surrounding residues. Asp-197 and Gln-200, which are responsible for the stabilization of the electronic distribution in the delocalized π-system of the cofactor (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), are present not only in sequences of C-DES homologues but also in NifS-like proteins. Phe-25, His-114, Ala-199, and Thr-276, which are part of the cofactor-binding site (Fig. 2) and anchor the phosphate group to the protein matrix, and Arg-360 and Arg-369, which bind the two carboxylates of the substrate cystine (8Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), are all conserved among cyanobacterial sequences (Fig. 1). Significantly, the multiple alignment reveals the absence of the catalytic cysteine residue that is conserved among NifS-like proteins (Cys-325 in NifS from A. vinelandii, red square below the sequence in Fig. 1) and suggests a distinct catalytic mechanism for cysteine/cystine lyases. Furthermore, the comparison between the two groups of sequences (Fig. 1) allows the identification of residues that, being conserved only among C-DES homologues, may have a specific role in cyanobacterial enzymes. Among others, two cysteine residues (Cys-92 and Cys-112 in the sequence of C-DES from Synechocystis) are present only in C-DES-like proteins (Fig. 1), and one of the two arginines responsible for the binding of the two carboxylates of cystine (Arg-360) is absent in group I NifS-like proteins. Cys-112 is localized in an ancillary pocket in communication with the active site through a tunnel that allows the entry of a water molecule as well as of a persulfide group (Fig. 2, B-D). The presence of C-DES homologues in all sequenced cyanobacterial genomes indicates the evolutionary conservation of the distinctive properties of this enzyme, which might respond to specific metabolic requirements of photosynthetic organisms. Steady-state Spectra of C-DES with Substrates and Substrate Analogues—The absorption spectrum of native C-DES (Fig. 3) shows a major peak centered at 426 nm, attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the internal aldimine (Scheme 1) (39Kaiser J.T. Bruno S. Clausen T. Huber R. Schiaretti F. Mozzarelli A. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The peak is asymmetric, with a shoulder around 400 nm. A minor peak, centered at around 500 nm, is because of a catalytically inert species generated during the heterologous overproduction in Escherichia coli. 3D. Kessler, unpublished observations. Reaction with cystine (Fig. 3A) leads to the accumulation of a species absorbing at around 470 nm, attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base (Scheme 1A) (39Kaiser J.T. Bruno S. Clausen T. Huber R. Schiaretti F. Mozzarelli A. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A broad increase in the absorbance at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm hampers the accurate identification of specific bands and is likely because of the accumulation of reaction products, i.e. cysteine persulfide and pyruvate, which absorb below 350 nm (7Cavallini D. Federici G. Barboni E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 48Pioselli B. Bettati S. Demidkina T.V. Zakomirdina L.N. Phillips R.S. Mozzarelli A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was observed that spectra recorded on C-DES crystals suspended in a solution containing cystine exhibited a well defined peak at 338 nm, tentatively assigned to the enolimine tautomer of the external aldimine, with a possible contribution from the enolimine tautomer of the α-aminoacrylate (39Kaiser J.T.

https://openalex.org/W2004699357,"Rad26, the yeast homologue of human Cockayne syndrome group B protein, and Rpb9, a nonessential subunit of RNA polymerase II, have been shown to mediate two subpathways of transcription-coupled DNA repair in yeast. Here we show that Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated repair in the yeast GAL1 gene is differently modulated by different promoter elements. The initiation site and efficiency of Rad26-mediated repair in the transcribed strand are determined by the upstream activating sequence (UAS) but not by the TATA or local sequences. The role of UAS in determining the Rad26-mediated repair is not through loading of RNA polymerase II or the transcriptional regulatory complex SAGA. However, both the UAS and the TATA sequences are essential for confining Rad26-mediated repair to the transcribed strand. Mutation of the TATA sequence, which greatly reduces transcription, or deletion of the TATA or mutation of the UAS, which completely abolishes transcription, causes Rad26-mediated repair to occur in both strands. Rpb9-mediated repair only occurs in the transcribed strand and is efficient only in the presence of both TATA and UAS sequences. Also, the efficiency of Rpb9-mediated repair is dependent on the SAGA complex. Our results suggest that Rad26-mediated repair can be either transcription-coupled, provided that a substantial level of transcription is present, or transcription-independent, if the transcription is too low or absent. In contrast, Rpb9-mediated repair is strictly transcription-coupled and is efficient only when the transcription level is high.

Sancar A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 183-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One NER pathway, the so-called global genomic repair (GGR), removes lesions throughout the genome including those in the nontranscribed strand (NTS) of an active gene. In mammalian cells, GGR is dependent on xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (2Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GGR is dependent on Rad7 and Rad16 (5Verhage R. Zeeman A.M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Another NER pathway, termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), is responsible for rapid repair in the transcribed strand (TS) of an active gene. An RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion in the TS may serve as the initial signal for TCR (6Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis, 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2006: 360-377Google Scholar). The TCR mechanism in Escherichia coli is best understood (7Park J.S. Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotes, the detailed biochemical mechanism of TCR has been elusive. In mammalian cells, it has been shown that the Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) and B (CSB) proteins are required for TCR (9Lommel L. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and Rpb9, a nonessential subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), have been shown to mediate two subpathways of TCR, respectively. It seems that the Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated TCR subpathways have different efficiencies in different regions of a gene. Rpb9-mediated TCR operates more effectively in the coding region than in the region upstream of the transcription start site, whereas Rad26-mediated TCR operates equally well in the two regions (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, in log-phase cells, the relative contributions of Rad26 and Rpb9 to TCR may be different from one gene to another. In the constitutive URA3 gene, TCR seems to be exclusively mediated by Rad26 except for a short region close to the transcription start site (16Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. Tasseron-de van de Putte P. Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the constitutive gene RPB2, Rad26 is partially required (15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Bhatia P.K. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. Friedberg E.C. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and both Rad26 and Rpb9 contribute to TCR (15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the galactose-induced GAL1–10 genes, Rad26 is almost dispensable, especially in the coding region, indicating that TCR in these genes is primarily mediated by Rpb9 (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both Rad26-mediated and Rpb9-mediated TCR seem to be confined to the TS of the galactose-induced GAL1–10 genes, initiating at upstream sites that are ∼100 nucleotides from the upstream activating sequence (UAS) (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the initiation sites of the Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated TCRs are not correlated with either the transcription start sites or the key promoter elements, the TATA boxes (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At present, it is largely unknown how initiation and efficiency of Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated repairs are regulated in a gene. In this study, we present evidence that the initiation site and efficiency of Rad26-mediated repair in the TS of the GAL1 gene are determined by the UAS but not by TATA, local sequences, or even active transcription. However, the UAS, TATA, and a substantial level of transcription are essential for confining the Rad26-mediated repair to the TS. In contrast, the Rpb9-mediated repair is always confined to the TS and is efficient only in the presence of UAS, TATA, and a high level of transcription. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The wild-type yeast strain Y452 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-1, leu2-3, leu2-112, cir°) and its isogenic rad16, rad16 rpb9, and rad16 rad26 deletion mutants were created as described previously (15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rad7, rad7 spt7, rad7 rad26 spt7 deletion mutants are derivatives of wild-type strain BJ5465 (MATa ura3-52 trp-1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1) (20Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Nucleotides (with respect to the starting codon ATG) +214 to +1454, +58 to +2297, and +11 to +4900 were deleted for the RAD7, RAD26, and SPT7 genes, respectively. PCR primers used for amplifying different GAL1–10 fragments are listed in Table 1. A 2-kb normal GAL1–10 fragment, encompassing the UAS and 5′ portions (0.7 kb) of each of the genes, was PCR-amplified using primers 1 and 2. Primer pairs 1 and 4 and 2 and 3 were used to amplify two fragments, which were digested with StyI and ligated to create a GAL1–10 fragment with the GAL1 TATA mutated from ATATAAA (21Yocum R.R.

Primer pairs 1 and 6 and 2 and 5 were used to amplify another two fragments, which were digested with SphI and ligated to create a GAL1–10 fragment with the UAS mutated (Table 2). Primer 1 was paired with primers 7, 8, 9, and 10 to amplify the GAL1–10 fragments with deletion from the GAL1 gene down to +14, –72, –111, and –185, respectively. All the GAL1–10 fragments were digested with HindIII and inserted in the HindIII site of shuttle vector pRS415 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The cells were incubated in the same medium at 28 °C for various times in the dark. Total DNA was isolated from the cells following repair incubation, using a glass beads method (15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mapping of NER—DNA fragments of interest were strand specifically end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the procedure described previously (23Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of total DNA was digested with restriction endonuclease(s) to release the plasmid-borne GAL1 fragments of interest and incised at CPD sites with an excess amount of purified T4 endonuclease V (Epicentre). To specifically label the plasmid-borne GAL1 fragments, the incised total DNA was mixed with a DNA ladder (e.g. 2-Log DNA ladder from New England Biolabs), resolved on a native agarose gel. The band corresponding to the sizes of the plasmid-borne GAL1 fragments were purified from the gel using the DNA ladder as carrier. Excess copies of biotinylated oligonucleotides, which are complementary to the 3′ ends of the fragments to be labeled, were mixed with the sample. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min to denature the DNA and then cooled to an annealing temperature. The annealed fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen), and the other fragments were removed by washing the beads at the annealing temperature. The attached fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), resolved on sequencing gels. The dried gels were exposed to a phosphorimager screen (GE Healthcare or Bio-Rad). Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured to late log phase under the same conditions as those used for NER analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a hot acidic phenol method, as described (25Collart M.A. Oliviero S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004: 13.12.1-13.12.2Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 7.31-7.34Google Scholar) followed by transfer to Hybond N+ membranes (GE Healthcare). For analysis of transcription driven by the plasmid-borne GAL1 promoter with different mutations or deletions, the pRS415 vector fragment (see Fig. 1A, indicated by the open arch inside the vector circle) was inserted into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pGEM-3Z (Promega). Radioactive RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription of the pRS415 fragment using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 7.31-7.34Google Scholar). Membranes were first hybridized with the respective probes. After exposure to phosphorimager screens, the probes were stripped off by boiling the membranes in 1% SDS. The 25 S rRNA on the stripped membranes was rehybridized with probes generated from a 2.9-kb 25 S DNA and exposed to phosphorimager screens. The signal intensities of the 25 S rRNA were served as loading controls. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was carried out as described previously with minor modifications (27Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose to late log phase (A600 ≈ 1.0). Chromatin cross-linking was achieved by the addition of 1.1 ml of 36.5% formaldehyde to 40 ml of culture (final concentration 1%). After 10 min of incubation, the action of formaldehyde was quenched with glycine (125 mm final concentration). Cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors) and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear the DNA to an average size of 500 bp and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and subjected to repeated centrifugation until no visible pellet can be seen at the bottom of tube. An aliquot from each of the clarified lysates was saved as input control. The rest of the clarified lysates were incubated with or without affinity-purified anti-Rpb1 antibody 8WG16 (Neoclone) at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-coated agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the samples, and the incubation was continued for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with buffer A, twice with buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors), twice with buffer C (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors), and twice with TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Bead-bound chromatin fragments were eluted by incubating the beads in buffer D (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA) at 65 °C for 30 min. The elution was repeated one more time, and the eluates were pooled. Cross-links were reversed by incubating the eluates at 65 °C overnight. The inputs and the eluates were treated with proteinase K and extracted once with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25/24/1), and once with chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24/1). The DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by PCR. The pRS415 sequence of 210 bp located immediately downstream of the GAL1 sequence in the different plasmid constructs (Fig. 1A, indicated by the open arch inside the plasmid circle) was amplified using primers 5′-GGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGC-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTACCTCACTCATTAGGCACCCC-3′. To provide an internal control of pol II loading onto a gene, a 109-bp fragment in the coding region of the ACT1 gene was amplified using primers, 5′-CTGAGGTTGCTGCTTTGGTTATTG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTCTACCGACGATAGATGGG-3′. The PCR products were resolved on an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The band intensities on the gel were quantified using AlphaEase 4.0 software (Innotech). The signal intensities of the amplified pRS415 sequence of 210 bp were normalized to those of the ACT1 sequence. Modulation of Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated Repair in the TS of the GAL1 Gene by TATA and UAS Elements—The GAL1 gene is essential for yeast cells to grow in galactose media because it encodes a galactokinase that phosphorylates galactose to galactose-1-phosphate in the first step of galactose catabolism (29Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 197-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To examine the modulation of Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated repair by different gene elements, we created a number of plasmids bearing the GAL1 gene with different mutations or deletions. A 2-kb GAL1–10 region encompassing the shared UAS and ∼700-bp coding region of each of the genes (Fig. 1A) was amplified by PCR. The GAL1 TATA mutation was achieved by changing the original sequence ATATAAA (21Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West Jr., R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) to CCATGGA. The UAS mutation was achieved by changing the cognitive triplet sequences of CGG, AGG, or CGC located at both ends of the four palindromic binding sites of the transcriptional activator Gal4 (Table 2) (31Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The GAL1–10 fragments with normal, mutated GAL1 TATA or UAS sequences were inserted in the HindIII site of plasmid pRS415 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The plasmid constructs were transformed into GAL+ rad16 cells to eliminate GGR and specifically analyze Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated repairs in the plasmid-borne GAL1 gene. Total RNA was isolated from the cells cultured in the galactose medium to induce the GAL1 gene (29Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 197-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Transcription driven by the plasmid-borne GAL1 promoter was analyzed by Northern blots. To distinguish transcription on the plasmid constructs from that on the genomic GAL1 gene, the pRS415 sequence located immediately downstream of the GAL1 sequence (Fig. 1A, indicated by the open arch inside the plasmid circle) was used as a Northern blot probe. A transcript of ∼3 kb can be seen from the normal GAL1 construct (Fig. 1B, arrow; lanes 1, 4, and 7). The transcription level in the mutated GAL1 TATA construct is much lower than that in the normal GAL1 construct (Fig. 1B. compare lanes 1 and 2, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8). Quantification of the data (not shown) suggests that mutation of the GAL1 TATA reduced the transcription level 50–100-fold. Essentially no transcription can be detected in the UAS mutated construct (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 6, and 9). These results indicate that the GAL1 TATA is required for high levels of transcription, whereas the UAS is indispensable for transcription. Total DNA was isolated from the transformed cells following UV irradiation and repair incubation in the galactose medium. To specifically analyze Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated repairs in the plasmid-borne GAL1 fragments, the 2-kb plasmid-borne GAL1–10 fragments (Fig. 1A) were gel-purified following digestion of the total DNA with HindIII and incised at CPDs with an excess amount of T4 endonuclease V (32Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The gel-purified fragments were further restricted to release the GAL1 fragment of interest and strand specifically end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP (23Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The labeled fragments were resolved on a DNA sequencing gel and exposed to a phosphorimager screen. In rad16, rad16 rpb9, rad16 rad26, and rad16 rad26 rpb9 cells, the repair patterns in the plasmid-borne normal GAL1 gene (Fig. 2, A–D) were very similar to those in the genomic GAL1 gene (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the transcription levels and repair patterns are similar in the plasmid-borne and genomic GAL1 genes. In rad16 cells, where both the Rad26-mediated and the Rpb9-mediated repairs are active, and in rad16 rpb9 cells, where only the Rad26-mediated repair is active (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), mutation of the GAL1 TATA resulted in no significant repair deficiency in the TS of the GAL1 gene (Fig. 2, compare A and E and B and F). Furthermore, the mutation did not change the initiation site of repair, which is ∼180 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site and ∼100 nucleotides from the UAS (Fig. 2, A, B, E, and F). In contrast, in rad16 rad26 cells, where only the Rpb9-mediated repair is active (14Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14418-14426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), mutation of the GAL1 TATA essentially abolished repair in the TS of the GAL1 gene (Fig. 2, compare C and G). These results indicate that the initiation site and efficiency of Rad26-mediated repair in the TS of the GAL1 gene are largely independent of the TATA element and transcription level. In contrast, the Rpb9-mediated repair is dependent on the gene element and a high level of transcription. Repair was observed in the UAS-mutated GAL1 gene in rad16 and rad16 rpb9 cells, although it was much less efficient in the transcribed region (Fig. 2, H and I, marked by hatched bar on the right of the gels) of the gene. Furthermore, the UAS mutation abolished an apparent initiation site for this repair as repair seemed to occur throughout the GAL1–10 region analyzed (Fig. 2, H and I, region marked with brace; data not shown). However, the UAS mutation essentially eliminated repair in rad16 rad26 cells (Fig. 2J). These results suggest that the UAS and transcription may not be absolutely required for Rad26-mediated repair but may be required for Rpb9-mediated repair. Furthermore, the UAS may determine the initiation site of the Rad26-mediated repair in the TS of the GAL1 gene. Modulation of Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated Repair in the NTS of the GAL1 Gene by TATA and UAS Elements—In all the rad16 cells examined, no repair can be seen in the NTS of the normal GAL1 construct (Fig. 3, A–C). However, mutation of either TATA or UAS resulted in repair in the NTS of the GAL1 gene in rad16 and rad16 rpb9 cells (Fig. 3, compare A, D, and G and B, E, and H) but not in rad16 rad26 cells (Fig. 3, compare C, F, and I). These results suggest that the TATA and UAS elements and a substantial level of transcription are essential for preventing the Rad26-mediated repair from occurring in the NTS of the GAL1 gene. However, the Rpb9-mediated repair does not operate in the NTS of the gene in all the conditions. The Role of Local DNA Sequences in Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated Repair—The studies described above suggest that the initiation of Rad26-mediated repair may be determined by the UAS but is independent of the TATA element. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Rad26-mediated repair does not seem to be significantly affected by active transcription. However, a low level of transcription still occurred in the GAL1 TATA mutated construct (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 5, and 8). It is possible that the mutated TATA or a nearby local sequence may be able to partially compensate for the TATA element, resulting in a low level of transcription and the initiation of Rad26-mediated repair. To examine this possibility, a series of GAL1–10 fragments, encompassing ∼700 bp of the GAL10 coding sequence, the UAS, and different lengths of the GAL1 sequence (Fig. 4A) were amplified by PCR. These PCR fragments were inserted in the HindIII site of plasmid pRS415 (Fig. 1A). Plasmid constructs bearing the different GAL1–10 fragments were transformed into yeast cells. Total RNA was isolated from the transformed cells cultured in the galactose medium. Transcription driven by the GAL1 gene promoter borne on the plasmid constructs was analyzed by Northern blots, using the vector sequence located immediately downstream of the GAL1 sequence (Fig. 1A, indicated by the open arch inside the plasmid circle) as a probe. Strong transcription can be seen when the GAL1 gene was deleted down to +14 (relative to the transcription start site) (GAL1Δ+14) (Fig. 4B, lanes 4, 8, and 12). A further deletion, which left the TATA element intact but had the GAL1 transcription start site removed (i.e. deletion down to –72, GAL1Δ–72), also showed strong transcription (Fig. 4B, lanes 3, 7, and 11). However, deletion down to –111 or –185, each of which removed the TATA element, caused undetectable transcription from the sequence (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10). Total DNA was isolated from the transformed cells following UV irradiation and repair incubation. The plasmid fragments encompassing the UAS, part of the GAL1 sequence and a 74"
