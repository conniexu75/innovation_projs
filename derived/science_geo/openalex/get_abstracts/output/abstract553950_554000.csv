https://openalex.org/W2275879522,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a key activator of inflammation, primes the NLRP3-inflammasome for activation by inducing pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 expression. NF-κB, however, also prevents excessive inflammation and restrains NLRP3-inflammasome activation through a poorly defined mechanism. We now show that NF-κB exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by inducing delayed accumulation of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. External NLRP3-activating stimuli trigger a form of mitochondrial (mt) damage that is caspase-1- and NLRP3-independent and causes release of direct NLRP3-inflammasome activators, including mtDNA and mtROS. Damaged mitochondria undergo Parkin-dependent ubiquitin conjugation and are specifically recognized by p62, which induces their mitophagic clearance. Macrophage-specific p62 ablation causes pronounced accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive IL-1β-dependent inflammation, enhancing macrophage death. Therefore, the ""NF-κB-p62-mitophagy"" pathway is a macrophage-intrinsic regulatory loop through which NF-κB restrains its own inflammation-promoting activity and orchestrates a self-limiting host response that maintains homeostasis and favors tissue repair."

From the remaining fraction of CNS-PNETs, we identify four new CNS tumor entities, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and distinct histopathological and clinical features. These new molecular entities, designated “CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2),” “CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC),” “CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1),” and “CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR),” will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by poorly differentiated CNS tumors.

The CNS comprises many different pluripotent and differentiated cell types that vary greatly in abundance during human lifespan. This is reflected by a broad diversity of CNS tumor entities, some of which are relatively common, whereas others develop rarely, and many of them occur at defined ages. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the CNS (CNS-PNETs) are highly malignant neoplasms that predominantly affect children but may also arise in adolescents and adults. Histologically, CNS-PNETs are characterized by small, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated embryonal cells with a propensity for both glial and neuronal differentiation (Louis et al., 2007Louis D.N. Ohgaki H. Wiestler O.D. Cavenee W.K. WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. IARC Press, 2007Google Scholar), but the neuropathological diagnosis is challenging due to a lack of defining molecular markers and histological overlap with other high-grade neuroepithelial tumors. The original concept related medulloblastoma (i.e., PNET of the cerebellum) to embryonal tumors of the cerebrum (supratentorial PNET) (Rorke, 1983Rorke L.B. The cerebellar medulloblastoma and its relationship to primitive neuroectodermal tumors.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1983; 42: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but issues with the clinicopathological utility of classifying non-cerebellar CNS-PNETs have generated significant controversy over decades (Rorke et al., 1997Rorke L.B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Zimmerman R.A. Sutton L.N. Biegel J.A. Goldwein J.W. Packer R.J. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system.Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 765-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This resulted in considerable uncertainty regarding accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment for affected patients (Jakacki et al., 2015Jakacki R.I. Burger P.C. Kocak M. Boyett J.M. Goldwein J.

The 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumors lists CNS-PNET NOS (not otherwise specified) and four histological CNS-PNET variants distinguished by morphological features: CNS neuroblastoma, CNS ganglioneuroblastoma, medulloepithelioma (ME), and ependymoblastoma (EB) (Louis et al., 2007Louis D.N. Ohgaki H. Wiestler O.D. Cavenee W.K. WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. IARC Press, 2007Google Scholar).

To provide a better framework for accurate diagnosis and treatment, we performed a comprehensive molecular characterization of a large cohort of institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs, aiming to fully elucidate their underlying molecular and biological spectrum. We generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of “CNS-PNET.” Unsupervised clustering, including 211 well-characterized “reference” tumors representing other CNS tumor entities, reliably separated samples into clusters defined by histological entities and known molecular subgroups (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1D ; Table S1). CNS-PNETs did not form a distinct cluster, but mostly grouped with clusters of reference CNS tumors. In total, 196/323 (61%) of CNS-PNETs clustered with ETMRs (36/323, 11%), MYCN-amplified high-grade gliomas (HGGMYCN, 28/323, 9%), IDH/H3F3A wild-type HGG from receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) subgroups (HGGRTK, 28/323, 9%), IDH mutant HGG (HGGIDH, 17/323, 5%), H3F3A G34 mutant HGG (HGGG34, 17/323, 5%), supratentorial ependymomas (EPN, 15/323, 5%), AT/RTs (14/323, 4%), H3F3A K27 mutant diffuse midline gliomas (HGGK27, 10/323, 3%), pineal tumors (PIN, 8/323, 2%), Ewing sarcomas (EWS, 5/323, 2%), choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC, 2/323, 1%), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA, 1/323, <1%), or meningiomas (MNG, 1/323, <1%) (Figures 1A–1C, S1A, and S1B). Some CNS-PNETs also grouped with medulloblastoma subtypes (MBWNT, MBSHH, MBGrp3, MBGrp4, 11/323, 3%), including one metastasis of a primary brainstem lesion with PNET histology. However, available radiological reports of these MB-like cases did not indicate a cerebellar lesion. Three further samples (1%) clustered with non-neoplastic hemispheric brain tissue samples, suggesting high normal cell content.Figure S1Molecular Classification of CNS-PNETs by DNA Methylation Profiling, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Unsupervised clustering and heatmap of DNA methylation levels of 323 CNS-PNET samples alongside 211 reference samples representing CNS tumors of known histology and molecular subtype using the 10,000 most variably methylated probes (corresponding to Figure 1A).

Some of the remaining CNS-PNETs (50/323, 15%) formed small, inhomogeneous clusters (<5 tumors) or represented distant outliers that failed to group with each other or any of the reference tumor entities, possibly representing exceedingly rare entities. A larger fraction of remaining CNS-PNETs (77/323, 24%) formed four separate clusters clearly distinct from reference entities. As elucidated below, these represent four new CNS tumor entities that we termed “CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation” (CNS NB-FOXR2; 44/323, 14%), “CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration” (CNS EFT-CIC; 12/323, 4%), “CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration” (CNS HGNET-MN1; 11/323, 3%), and “CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration” (CNS HGNET-BCOR; 10/323, 3%). Unsupervised clustering restricted to CNS-PNET samples recapitulated cluster associations established in the overall analysis (Figures S1C and S1E). For a subset of tumors (109 reference samples; 59 CNS-PNET), transcriptomic profiling allowed assignment into gene expression-based subgroups that correlated well with DNA methylation clusters (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1F). To validate the re-classification of CNS-PNETs sharing concordant DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles with reference tumor entities, we analyzed these samples for hallmark molecular features previously established for their assigned reference tumor entities. Only CNS-PNET samples from the ETMR cluster consistently harbored the C19MC amplicon (33/36, 92% of samples with available data; p < 0.001) and displayed high LIN28A protein expression (17/17, 100%; p < 0.001), which has been proposed as a potent diagnostic marker for ETMR (Korshunov et al., 2012Korshunov A.

All analyzed CNS-PNET samples from the AT/RT cluster displayed SMARCB1 mutations and/or deletions (14/14, 100%; p < 0.001) and loss of the SMARCB1 protein product INI-1 (5/5, 100%; p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). Targeted sequencing confirmed mutations in IDH1 in 15/15 CNS-PNETs (100%; p < 0.001) from the HGGIDH cluster, G34 mutations of H3F3A in 17/17 CNS-PNETs (100%; p < 0.001) from the HGGG34 cluster, and K27 mutations of H3F3A in 4/7 CNS-PNETs (57%; p < 0.001) from the HGGK27 cluster (Figure 2C). Within the HGGMYCN cluster, 20/28 CNS-PNETs (71%; p < 0.001) displayed amplification of the MYCN locus (Figure 2D). Co-amplification of MYCN and ID2 was observed in 12/28 (43%; p < 0.001) samples, therefore broadening a previously defined molecular subgroup of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) to include supratentorial tumors with HGG or PNET histopathology (Buczkowicz et al., 2014Buczkowicz P. Hoeman C. Rakopoulos P. Pajovic S. Letourneau L. Dzamba M. Morrison A. Lewis P. Bouffet E. Bartels U. et al.Genomic analysis of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas identifies three molecular subgroups and recurrent activating ACVR1 mutations.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Where tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; 4/4), MYCN and ID2 were co-amplified in the same tumor cell nuclei (Figure 2D). CNS-PNETs within the HGGRTK clusters showed diverse, broad chromosomal copy-number alterations, and half (14/28, 50%) harbored focal amplifications and/or deletions of known oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes (Figures S2A and S2B). In the three CNS-PNETs from the EWS cluster, the presence of a EWSR1 re-arrangement was detected by RNA sequencing or FISH analysis (data not shown). There was insufficient material to investigate CNS-PNETs from the EPN clusters for the presence of RELA or YAP1 fusions. Patient information (age at diagnosis, tumor location, and survival) of CNS-PNETs from aforementioned clusters matched clinical features of their reference entities and subgroups (Figures 2E–2H and S2C–S2G).Figure S2Molecular, Clinical, and Histopathological Characteristics of Re-classified CNS-PNET Groups, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Chromosomal gains (red) and losses (blue) in CNS-PNETs re-classified to the HGGRTK group.(B) Focal amplifications and deletions in CNS-PNETs re-classified to the HGGRTK group.(C–F) Tumor location and patient age at diagnosis of CNS-PNETs re-classified into HGGRTK (C), EPN (D), MB (E), and EWS, CTRL, PXA, MNG, CPC, and PINEAL (F) DNA methylation clusters.

Scale bars in panels H-P represent 50 μm. Where available, the histology of CNS-PNETs with DNA methylation profiles and molecular markers associated with other CNS tumor entities (n = 71) was re-evaluated by an expert panel of neuropathologists. In most instances, the tumors demonstrated histological features either supporting their molecular re-classification or ambiguous histology for which the entity suggested by the molecular re-classification would be included in the differential diagnosis (Tables S2A–S2C). Among the tumors re-classified into other CNS tumor entities were small-cell tumors displaying classic features attributed to CNS-PNET (Figures S2H–S2M). These features were not restricted to the ETMR group but were also prominent in the HGGG34 and HGGMYCN groups, in which specific examples demonstrated hallmark features of anaplasia, including cell wrapping and prominent nucleoli, while other tumors demonstrated diffuse infiltrative growth more typical of HGG. Rare examples of tumors re-classified into a HGG group demonstrated robust neuronal antigen expression, highlighting the insufficiency of glial and neuronal antigen expression alone to reliably discriminate these malignant small-cell CNS tumors (Figures S2N–S2P). Our initial clustering analysis of CNS-PNETs identified four new molecular entities designated “CNS NB-FOXR2,” “CNS EFT-CIC,” “CNS HGNET-MN1,” and “CNS HGNET-BCOR.” To explore whether these molecular entities were also diagnosed other than CNS-PNET, we compared DNA methylation patterns of each entity with an in-house collection of >10,000 profiles from a broad variety of pediatric and adult CNS tumors (data not shown). Subsequent clustering analysis identified 59 tumors with diverse histological diagnoses that now grouped with one of the four new CNS tumor entities (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A–S3C ; Table S3). While the enlarged CNS NB-FOXR2 (n = 46) and CNS EFT-CIC (n = 15) clusters represented entities with almost exclusive CNS-PNET histology (Figures 3A and 3B), the CNS HGNET-MN1 cluster (n = 41) included 16 tumors histologically diagnosed as astroblastoma (ABM)—rare WHO-defined glial tumors—supporting the concept that they are distinct from conventional diffuse glial neoplasms (Louis et al., 2007Louis D.N. Ohgaki H. Wiestler O.D. Cavenee W.K. WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. IARC Press, 2007Google Scholar). The CNS HGNET-BCOR cluster (n = 34) was expanded by a variety of CNS tumor histologies. Again, molecular subgroup assignment by transcriptomic profiling recapitulated DNA methylation-based clusters (Figures 3A and S3A) and allowed the identification of three additional tumors included in further gene expression analyses.Figure S3Molecular and Clinical Characteristics of New CNS Tumor Entities, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Unsupervised clustering and heatmap of DNA methylation levels of 77 CNS-PNET samples alongside 159 reference samples and 59 additional samples representing CNS tumors of varying histology using the 10,000 most variably methylated probes.

The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by ℓ1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.ork, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions.

https://openalex.org/W2281452758,"Cross-sectional studies suggested that obesity is promoted by the gut microbiota. However, longitudinal data on taxonomic and functional changes in the gut microbiota of obese patients are scarce. The aim of this work is to study microbiota changes in the course of weight loss therapy and the following year in obese individuals with or without co-morbidities, and to asses a possible predictive value of the gut microbiota with regard to weight loss maintenance.Sixteen adult patients, who followed a 52-week weight-loss program comprising low calorie diet, exercise and behavioral therapy, were selected according to their weight-loss course. Over two years, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed and microbiota from stool samples was functionally and taxonomically analyzed using DNA shotgun sequencing.Overall the microbiota responded to the dietetic and lifestyle intervention but tended to return to the initial situation both at the taxonomical and functional level at the end of the intervention after one year, except for an increase in Akkermansia abundance which remained stable over two years (12.7x103 counts, 95%CI: 322-25100 at month 0; 141x103 counts, 95%CI: 49-233x103 at month 24; p = 0.005). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome (0.64, 95%CI: 0.34-0.95) than in the ""healthy obese"" (0.27, 95%CI: 0.08-0.45, p = 0.04). Participants, who succeeded in losing their weight consistently over the two years, had at baseline a microbiota enriched in Alistipes, Pseudoflavonifractor and enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway compared to patients who were less successful in weight reduction.Successful weight reduction in the obese is accompanied with increased Akkermansia numbers in feces. Metabolic co-morbidities are associated with a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Most interestingly, microbiota differences might allow discrimination between successful and unsuccessful weight loss prior to intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2282205924,"We revisit the results of the recent Reproducibility Project: Psychology by the Open Science Collaboration. We compute Bayes factors—a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis—for a large subset (N = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75% of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor < 10). The majority of the studies (64%) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15%), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10%), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable."

These findings provide insight into the functional plasticity of a K+-selective filter and also refine our understanding of K2P channels and the mechanisms by which ion channels can sense voltage. In the animal kingdom three main families of K+ channels define K+-dependent cellular excitability, namely, the voltage-gated (Kv), inwardly rectifying (Kir), and the background or leak two-pore domain (K2P) K+ channels. Kv channels contribute to membrane repolarization; they are gated open by membrane depolarization, which is sensed by a positively charged “S4-helix” within a canonical voltage-sensing domain (VSD). Kir channels stabilize the resting membrane potential (RMP) and exhibit a strong voltage-dependent behavior because they are blocked by polyamines like spermine upon depolarization. By contrast, K2P channels have traditionally been viewed as voltage-independent “background” K+ channels where their strong outward rectification is thought to arise from the asymmetric K+ gradient across the membrane as predicted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation (Goldstein et al., 2001Goldstein S.A.

J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801PubMed Google Scholar). This outward rectification has important implications for the role of K2P channels in the central and peripheral nervous system because it not only stabilizes the RMP but also contributes to repolarization and even enables action potential generation in the absence of classical Kv channels (MacKenzie et al., 2015MacKenzie G.

Such properties are greatly enhanced in some K2P channels (in particular TREK-1 and TASK-3) because of additional time- and voltage-dependent activation (Bockenhauer et al., 2001Bockenhauer D.

However, K2P channels lack a VSD, and the mechanisms that underlie this voltage-gating behavior remain unclear. There are 15 members of the human K2P family that can be divided into six subfamilies based on their structural and functional properties (Goldstein et al., 2005Goldstein S.A. Bayliss D.A. Kim D.

Recent crystal structures demonstrate that, unlike other classical tetrameric K+ channels, K2P channels assemble as dimers with a pseudotetrameric pore (Brohawn et al., 2012Brohawn S.G. del Mármol J.

Long S.B. Crystal structure of the human two-pore domain potassium channel K2P1.Science. 2012; 335: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Extensive studies over the last two decades have revealed that these channels represent major regulators of cellular excitability and are involved in a wide range of physiological functions, including vasodilation, neuroprotection, anesthesia, sleep, chemo- and nutrient sensing, aldosterone and insulin secretion, nociception, and pressure and temperature sensing (Enyedi and Czirják, 2010Enyedi P.

The neuronal background K2P channels: focus on TREK1.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Requisite for such functional diversity is their regulation by a wide variety of stimuli, including PUFAs (e.g., arachidonic acid, AA), lysophospholipids, DAG, phosphoinositides (e.g., PIP2), phosphorylation, volatile anesthetics, pH changes, temperature, and mechanical forces (Enyedi and Czirják, 2010Enyedi P.

For some of these stimuli, the molecular determinants have been partially identified and involve a gating machinery located within the selectivity filter (SF) (Bagriantsev et al., 2011Bagriantsev S.N.

But exactly what happens within the filter during K2P channel gating remains unknown. Here, we show that voltage-dependent gating is a property common to nearly all K2P channels. It originates from the unique functional plasticity of the selectivity filter and represents a significant component of their outward rectification. These results expand our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie voltage sensing in ion channels and the functional role that K2P channels may play in cellular excitability. To obtain a comprehensive picture of this voltage-dependent gating, we measured currents in response to 300-ms voltage steps (from −100 to +100 mV) for various members of the K2P channel family in excised giant membrane patches under symmetrical K+ conditions (Figures 1 and S1). TWIK-1 channels display linear current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) and no sign of time- or voltage-dependent activation (Figure 1A). In marked contrast, all other tested K2P channels (TRAAK, TREK-2, TREK-1, TRESK, TALK-2, TASK-1, TASK-2, and TASK-3) showed prominent outward rectification as a result of a time- and voltage-dependent activation process (Figures 1B–1E and S1A–S1D). In TRAAK, for instance, only very small currents were observed at negative potentials, but large outward currents developed for voltage steps positive to the reversal potential (Erev.). This voltage activation proceeded with a time constant (τ) of 4 ± 1 ms that was strikingly voltage independent (i.e., similar for potentials between +20 to +100 mV; Figures 1B and S1E).Figure S1Voltage Gating in TREK-1, TRESK, TASK-1, and TASK-2 Channels and K2P Channel Gating Kinetics, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–D) Current responses to a family of 300 ms voltage steps from −100 to +100 mV from and to a holding potential of −80 mV recorded from inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes in symmetrical K+ (120 mM [K+]int./120 mM [K+]ext.) expressing TREK-1, (B) TRESK, (C) TASK-1 and (D) TASK-2 channels.

(E) Summary of time constants for voltage activation obtained for different channels and voltages. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Most remarkable, however, was the appearance of large inward (i.e., tail) currents upon repolarization to −80 mV that indicate a large rise in open probability (PO). These tail currents increased in parallel with the amplitudes of the outward currents and decayed with a time constant of 4 ± 2 ms (Figure 1B). Similar tail currents were observed for TREK-1 and TREK-2 (Figures 1C and S1A), TALK-2 (Figure 1E), TASK-2 (Figure S1D), and TASK-3 channels (Figure 1D). The degree of outward rectification was less prominent in TRESK and TASK-1 as these channels conducted larger inward currents at negative potentials. Nevertheless, TRESK and TASK-1 also showed significant time-dependent voltage activation with corresponding tail currents seen upon repolarization (Figures S1B and S1C). The degree of outward rectification and fold change in tail current amplitudes upon depolarization are summarized for all tested channels in Figures 1F and 1G. This establishes that time- and voltage-dependent activation is a prominent feature within the K2P superfamily. Interestingly, the only K2P channel that behaved like a “classical” leak channel with a linear I-V curve was TWIK-1. This next raises the question of what mechanisms underlie this voltage-dependent activation. It has previously been reported that extracellular Mg2+ can block inward TREK-1 currents at hyperpolarized potentials (Maingret et al., 2002Maingret F. Honoré E. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. Molecular basis of the voltage-dependent gating of TREK-1, a mechano-sensitive K(+) channel.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, we found that extracellular divalent cations only had minor effects on voltage activation and tail currents (Figures S2A–S2C). The voltage-dependent gate in classical Kv channels is located at the entrance to the intracellular pore (Yellen, 1998Yellen G. The moving parts of voltage-gated ion channels.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We therefore employed two established protocols to probe for a functional lower gate, i.e., state-dependent pore cysteine modification and state-dependent pore blocker binding (Figures S3A–S3C) (Piechotta et al., 2011Piechotta P.L. Rapedius M. Stansfeld P.J. Bollepalli M.K. Ehrlich G. Andres-Enguix I. Fritzenschaft H. Decher N. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. Baukrowitz T.

State-independent intracellular access of quaternary ammonium blockers to the pore of TREK-1.Channels (Austin). 2012; 6: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, chemical modification of a pore residue in TREK-1 occurs with a similar rate regardless of whether the channels are activated or closed by voltage (Figure S3C). Furthermore, we found that a high-affinity quaternary ammonium (QA+) pore blocker has free access to its binding site deep within the pore even when TREK-1 channels are closed at hyperpolarized potentials (Figure S3B). These results indicate that the voltage-gating mechanism likely resides within or close to the selectivity filter (Figure S1D). To investigate the involvement of the filter, we mutated residues within either the first (P1) or second (P2) pore loops of TREK-1 channels. As expected, mutating the conserved GFG motif of the filter resulted in non-functional channels, but all other mutants generated macroscopic currents (Figure 2A). Strikingly, two mutations completely removed this voltage-dependent gating behavior, namely, mutations of the highly conserved threonine within the consensus K+-selective motif (TIGFG) in both P1 and P2 (Figure 2B). These two mutants (T157C and T266C) displayed linear I-Vs and instantaneous current-voltage responses that completely lacked the prominent tail currents observed in the WT channel (Figure 2C). In contrast, the other mutations within P1 and P2 had no obvious effect on voltage gating and did not change the large rectification coefficient of 47 ± 4 (Figure 2A) that defines outward rectification in WT TREK-1. Remarkably, similar results were also obtained when the corresponding threonines (in P1 and P2) were mutated in TRAAK, TASK-1, TASK-2, and TASK-3 channels (Figures 2D–2F), suggesting these highly conserved residues are important for the voltage-gating mechanism within the K2P channel superfamily. Intriguingly, the hydroxyl group within these threonines is the only side chain within the filter that interacts directly with K+ ions. The filter contains four K+ binding sites (S1–S4), and mutating these residues is therefore expected to change ion occupancy at these sites within the filter. Indeed, in the KcsA K+ channel, the equivalent mutation (T75C) reduces K+ binding to the S4 site, presumably because sulfur coordinates K+ less well than oxygen (Zhou and MacKinnon, 2004Zhou M. MacKinnon R. A mutant KcsA K(+) channel with altered conduction properties and selectivity filter ion distribution.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the ion occupancy of the K2P channel filter, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a double bilayer setup as recently used to simulate ion permeation in other K+ channels, such as KcsA and Kv1.2 (Köpfer et al., 2014Köpfer D.A. Song C. Gruene T. Sheldrick G.M. Zachariae U. de Groot B.L. Ion permeation in K+ channels occurs by direct Coulomb knock-on.Science. 2014; 346: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Using the crystal structure of TRAAK (Brohawn et al., 2013Brohawn S.G. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Domain-swapped chain connectivity and gated membrane access in a Fab-mediated crystal of the human TRAAK K+ channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 2129-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 200 permeation events over a 10 μs simulation (20 events/μs) were detected under positive voltage. Analysis of these events suggests that ion permeation occurs by a similar mechanism as previously reported for KcsA (Köpfer et al., 2014Köpfer D.A. Song C. Gruene T. Sheldrick G.M. Zachariae U. de Groot B.L. Ion permeation in K+ channels occurs by direct Coulomb knock-on.Science. 2014; 346: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the average ion occupancy during permeation was 2.7 ± 0.6 and thus was similar to KcsA (Köpfer et al., 2014Köpfer D.A. Song C. Gruene T. Sheldrick G.M. Zachariae U. de Groot B.L. Ion permeation in K+ channels occurs by direct Coulomb knock-on.Science. 2014; 346: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The four K+ binding sites (S1–S4) in the filter showed about similar occupancy (S1 = 58%, S2 = 97%, S3 = 65%, and S4 = 46%; Figure 2G) in TRAAK. In silico exchange of the two threonines by cysteines at the P1 site (i.e., T103C) led to a loss of K+ binding to the S1 and S4 site, as well as a large reduction in permeation events (1.25 events/μs). However, introduction of a single exchange (i.e., T103C of just one of the two threonines in P1) increased the number of permeation events (11.4 events/μs), although the ion occupancy at the S1 and S4 site remained low (Figure 2H). This confirms that mutation of the S4 threonine causes a major change in filter ion occupancy similar to that reported for KcsA (Zhou and MacKinnon, 2004Zhou M. MacKinnon R. A mutant KcsA K(+) channel with altered conduction properties and selectivity filter ion distribution.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Combined with our functional mutagenesis data shown above, these results suggest that the ion binding in the filter represents a critical step in this voltage-gating mechanism. To further explore the role of the filter, we next investigated the ion dependence of voltage activation. Strikingly, replacement of intracellular K+ by Rb+ increased the voltage-dependent activation of TREK-1 around 100-fold, resulting in large outward currents and large tail currents (Figure 3A). The voltage dependence of the increase in tail currents (reflecting the slope of the increase in Po) was not altered in comparison to K+ (Figure 3B). Importantly, the potentiation of currents by Rb+ only occurred upon substitution with intracellular Rb+ (Figure 3A) and therefore with outward Rb+ permeation. These results not only suggest that Rb+ potentiates voltage activation but that the direction of ion-flux is also critical, i.e., K2P channels appear to be gated by a one-way, non-return, or “check valve”-like ion-flux mechanism through which outward movement of ions gates the filter open, while inward permeation gates the filter closed (Figure 3D). In agreement with this, we found that changing the reversal potential by altering the extracellular K+ concentration caused a parallel shift in the voltage dependence of activation for TRAAK, TREK-2, and TASK-3 (Figures 3C and S5C). We also measured voltage activation for different K2P channels (TRAAK, TREK-1, TREK-2, TALK-2, TASK-3, and TRESK) with various intracellular permeant ions (Figures 3E and S4A–S4E ). In TRAAK we found that, similar to TREK-1, voltage activation was potentiated by Rb+. Furthermore, although Cs+ was poorly permeable (producing only small outward currents), it evoked large tail currents for potentials positive to the reversal potential. Importantly, this demonstrates that it is the ion binding step within the filter and not the permeating rate that determines voltage activation. With intracellular Na+ the tail currents were small in all tested K2P channels (Figures 3E and S4A–S4E), as were the tail currents using intracellular NMDG+ (data not shown). In TASK-3 and TRESK channels only a small potentiation by intracellular Rb+ or Cs+ was observed (Figures S4D and S4E). For TRAAK and TREK-1 channels, we found that intracellular Tl+ behaved similar to K+, i.e., its effects were markedly less pronounced than those of Cs+ or Rb+ (Figures 3E and S4A). Intriguingly, this ionic profile for voltage gating correlates with differences in ion occupancies observed crystallographically within the filter of KcsA. In these structures, K+ and Tl+ bind with similar occupancy to all four sites (S1–S4), whereas Cs+ and Rb+ bind with a different profile to only three sites that overlap predominantly with S1, S3, and S4 (Zhou and MacKinnon, 2003Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. The occupancy of ions in the K+ selectivity filter: charge balance and coupling of ion binding to a protein conformational change underlie high conduction rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To investigate the relative occupancy of these ions in a K2P channel, we simulated permeation in TRAAK with Rb+ and Cs+. These simulations clearly show a different distribution compared to K+ (Figure 3F), with preferential occupancy of S1, S3, and S4 by Cs+ and Rb+. Binding of these ions to the S2 site was strongly reduced. Furthermore, the reduction in occupancy of the S2 site caused a marked increase in S4 occupancy for Rb+ compared to K+ (Figure 3F). Further evidence for the effect of permeant ions on the filter comes from studies of blockers, such as tetrapentylammonium (TPA+), that interact with the threonine side chains of the S4 site and should therefore directly compete with ions for binding to this site (Piechotta et al., 2011Piechotta P.L. Rapedius M. Stansfeld P.J. Bollepalli M.K. Ehrlich G. Andres-Enguix I. Fritzenschaft H. Decher N. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. Baukrowitz T. The pore structure and gating mechanism of K2P channels.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3607-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We reasoned that upon switching from K+ to Rb+, TPA+ affinity may drop as a result of increased occupancy of S4 by Rb+ and thus increase competition with TPA+. Indeed, with intracellular Rb+ (and extracellular K+) we found that TPA+ affinity dropped at the point at which permeation switches from K+ to Rb+, i.e., at voltages positive to the Erev. (Figure 3G). However, in symmetrical K+ voltage dependence of TPA+ inhibition was neither seen upon current inversion nor was TPA+ affinity voltage dependent when the filter conducted either Rb+ or K+ (Figure 3G). This provides direct functional validation of the MD simulations and suggests that Rb+ potentiation of voltage activation results from a change in filter ion occupancy. In Kv channels, the gating charge that is coupled to pore opening is determined by plotting the tail current amplitudes (i.e., the relative increase in PO) against the activating pre-pulse voltages. The slope of a standard Boltzmann fit to the derived G-V plots represents the equivalent gating charge and thus the fraction of energy used to open the channel when charge is translocated across the entire electric field of the membrane. For comparison, we determined the equivalent gating charge for Kv2.1 channels and, similar to previous measurements (Scholle et al., 2004Scholle A. Dugarmaa S. Zimmer T. Leonhardt M. Koopmann R. Engeland B. Pongs O. Benndorf K. Rate-limiting reactions determining different activation kinetics of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 channels.J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), found it to be 4.6 ± 0.3 elementary charges (e0) (Figures 4B and 4C ). To fit the G-V plots of K2P channels with a Boltzmann function requires the tail current amplitudes to saturate with a change in voltage. For K+ (and Tl+), no saturation was seen. However, for Rb+ and Cs+ saturating G-V curves were observed revealing an equivalent gating charge between 1.8 and 2.6 e0 for all the K2P channels tested (TRAAK, TREK-1, TREK-2, TALK-1, TALK-2, and TRESK; Figures 4A–4C). When averaged for all these channels, the gating charge was about 2.2 e0. This value represents the lower limit of charge movement coupled to the channel opening reaction (Sigg and Bezanilla, 1997Sigg D. Bezanilla F. Total charge movement per channel. The relation between gating charge displacement and the voltage sensitivity of activation.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). If we assume the membrane electric field is focused on the filter (Contreras et al., 2010Contreras J.E. Chen J. Lau A.Y. Jogini V. Roux B. Holmgren M.

Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The open pore conformation of potassium channels.Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), then a charge equivalent to at least 2.2 e0 must be translocated across the filter to convert it into the open conformation (Figure 4F). For this to occur, we must assume that the inactive filter (i.e., at −80 mV) represents an “ion-depleted” state containing only one (or zero) ions and may therefore be similar to the “C-type-inactivated” state observed in KcsA (Boiteux and Bernèche, 2011Boiteux C.

Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Structural mechanism of C-type inactivation in K(+) channels.Nature. 2010; 466: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Our model then predicts that upon depolarization, 3–4 additional ions are forced into the filter by the electric field and that this ion translocation step is reflected in our measurement of the equivalent gating charge (Figure 4F). Furthermore, because the time course of activation is voltage independent, a second gating step must follow this ion translocation step, and this is represented by the slower, time-dependent conformational change of the filter into the active (i.e., conductive) state (Figure 4F). To further validate this model, we investigated the relationship between the direction of ion flow and voltage activation by measuring the V1/2 value at varying extracellular K+ concentrations for several different K2P channels (TRAAK, TREK-1, and TREK-2). We found that V1/2 shifted in parallel with the reversal potential (i.e., the voltage point at which ion-flux reverses), regardless of whether the intracellular or extracellular ion concentration was changed (Figures 4D, 4E, S5A, and S5B ). This clearly demonstrates that it is not the transmembrane voltage per se that drives K2P channel gating, but the electrochemical driving"

In piRNA biogenesis, single-stranded piRNA intermediates are loaded into PIWI-clade proteins and cleaved by Zucchini/MitoPLD, yielding precursor piRNAs (pre-piRNAs). Pre-piRNAs that are longer than the mature piRNA length are then trimmed at their 3' ends. Although recent studies implicated the Tudor domain protein Papi/Tdrkh in pre-piRNA trimming, the identity of Trimmer and its relationship with Papi/Tdrkh remain unknown. Here, we identified PNLDC1, an uncharacterized 3'-5' exonuclease, as Trimmer in silkworms. Trimmer is enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and binds to Papi/Tdrkh. Depletion of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh additively inhibits trimming, causing accumulation of ∼35-40-nt pre-piRNAs that are impaired for target cleavage and prone to degradation. Our results highlight the cooperative action of Trimmer and Papi/Tdrkh in piRNA maturation."

Homeostatic control of glycemic levels is pivotal not only for preventing seizures, unconsciousness, and brain injury induced by hypoglycemia, but also for protecting the brain from glucose toxicity in diabetes. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) has been recognized as a key region in the regulation of glucose metabolism (Grayson et al., 2013Grayson B.E. Seeley R.J. Sandoval D.A.

Glucose-sensing neurons of the VMH are either activated or inhibited by increased glucose levels, and their responses to changes in glucose levels have been shown to be important for the counter-regulatory responses to restore euglycemia following insulin-induced hypoglycemia (Borg et al., 1994Borg W.P.

Alteration in mitochondrial dynamics, i.e., mitochondrial fission and fusion, has been observed in metabolic tissues of human and rodent models of diabetes. Whether mitochondrial dynamics in neuronal populations of the VMH is involved in control of systemic glucose homeostasis is still ill defined. To test whether mitochondrial dynamics occur in VMH neurons in response to glucose, we measured mitochondrial size, density, and coverage after glucose or saline administration. We found that systemic glucose administration decreased mitochondrial size (Figure 1A) and increased mitochondrial density (Figure 1B) in VMH neurons. However, the total mitochondrial area in the cytosol was not changed (Figure 1C), indicating that glucose promotes mitochondrial fragmentation (Figures S1A and S1B). Mitochondrial fission is regulated by dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1), of which the active, phosphorylated form is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria (Figure 1D). Western blot analysis showed that glucose administration significantly increased the ratio of pDRP1/DRP1 compared to saline-injected controls (Figures 1E and 1F), confirming glucose-induced mitochondrial fission in VMH neurons.Figure S1Mitochondria in SF1 Neurons of Saline- and Glucose-Treated Mice, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Representative electron micrographs showing mitochondria (asterisks) in SF1 neurons of control mice injected with either saline (A) or glucose (B).(C and D) Representative electron micrographs showing mitochondria (asterisks) in SF1 neurons of Ucp2KO mice injected with either saline (C) or glucose (D).(E and F) Representative electron micrographs showing mitochondria (asterisks) in SF1 neurons of Ucp2KOKISf1 mice injected with either saline (E) or glucose (F).(G and H) Representative electron micrographs showing mitochondria (asterisks) in SF1 neurons of Ucp2KISf1 mice treated with saline or glucose.Bar scale in (A) (for all micrographs) represents 500 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A and B) Representative electron micrographs showing mitochondria (asterisks) in SF1 neurons of control mice injected with either saline (A) or glucose (B).

UCP2 is also robustly expressed in the VMH (Richard et al., 1998Richard D. Rivest R. Huang Q. Bouillaud F. Sanchis D. Champigny O. Ricquier D. Distribution of the uncoupling protein 2 mRNA in the mouse brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, we next tested whether the presence of UCP2 impacts VMH DRP1 phosphorylation in response to a glucose load. To this end, we generated whole-body Ucp2 knockout (Ucp2KO) mice and Ucp2KO mice with selective re-expression of UCP2 in the VMH (Ucp2KOKISf1). We first generated mice in which a UCP2 coding sequence with CAG promoter and a lox P floxed stop codon (LSL) were inserted into the ROSA26 locus (Ucp2KIfl/fl, Gt(ROSA26-LSL-UCP2-GFP; Figure S2A). Ucp2KIfl/fl animals were crossed with Ucp2KO mice (Ucp2KOKIfl/fl). These mice were then crossed with Sf1-cre mice (Dhillon et al., 2006Dhillon H. Zigman J.M. Ye C. Lee C.E. McGovern R.A. Tang V.

In contrast to the increased ratio of pDRP1/DRP1 in control mice, no significant changes were observed in glucose-treated Ucp2KO mice (Figure 2A). On the other hand, glucose administration to Ucp2KO mice with selective re-expression of UCP2 in the VMH (Ucp2KOKISf1 mice; Figures S2B and S2D–S2G) significantly increased the pDRP1/DRP1 ratio to levels similar to those observed in control mice (Figure 2A). The pDRP1/DRP1 ratio of saline-treated mice was comparable between the three groups (Figure 2A). Furthermore, saline-injected mice with selective overexpression of UCP2 in SF1 neurons (Ucp2KISf1 mice; Figures S2A, S2C, and S2H–S2K) showed a greater pDRP1/DRP1 ratio compared to saline-treated controls (Figure 2B), and glucose administration to Ucp2KISf1 mice induced a further increase in the pDRP1/DRP1 ratio compared to their saline group, which was also significantly greater than that observed in glucose-treated controls (Figure 2B). These results show that UCP2 is critical for DRP1 phosphorylation in the VMH in response to elevated glucose load.Figure 2UCP2 in SF1 Neurons Regulates DRP1 Activation and Mitochondrial Fission in Response to GlucoseShow full caption(A) Representative western blot and densitometry results for phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616 (pDRP1), total DRP1 (DRP1), and β-actin in VMH samples from control, Ucp2KO, and Ucp2KOKISf1 mice 30 min after saline (n = 4 per group) or glucose injection (n = 4 per group).

All data represent the mean ± SEM; ∗ = p < 0.05; ∗∗∗ = p < 0.001 compared to their saline group; see also Figures S1 and S2. Next, we interrogated whether the control of DRP1 by UCP2 affects mitochondrial adaptations in the VMH in response to glucose. We found that the glucose-administration-triggered alterations in mitochondrial size and density in SF1-positive VMH neurons were not present in Ucp2KO mice (Figures 2C, 2D, S1C, and S1D). On the other hand, glucose administration significantly reduced mitochondrial size while increasing mitochondrial number in VMH-SF1 neurons of Ucp2KOKISf1 (Figure 2F, 2G, S1E, and S1F) and of Ucp2KISf1 mice (Figures 2I, 2J, S1G, and S1H), reaching levels similar or greater than those of control mice, respectively. No difference in mitochondrial coverage was found between groups (Figures 2E, 2H, and 2K). These results, together with the findings on DRP1 phosphorylation, unmasked that UCP2 promotes mitochondrial fission in the VMH in response to systemic glucose load. We next examined the effect of glucose load on VMH neuronal activation assessed by cfos immunolabeling. Baseline cfos labeling in saline-injected groups was similar (Figures 3A–3D ). However, after peripheral glucose administration, reduced cfos labeling in SF1 neurons was observed in the VMH of Ucp2KO mice (18.5 ± 4.3 cell count/section; p = 0.005) compared to controls (51.6 ± 2.8 cell count/section; Figures 3E, 3F, 3I and 3J). On the other hand, selective re-expression of UCP2 in VMH neurons restored cfos activation in Ucp2KOKISf1 mice (45.5 ± 9.54 cell count/section; Figures 3G and 3K). Furthermore, Ucp2KISf1 mice showed a greater increase in cfos immunoreactivity compared to control mice (87.4 ± 12.6 cell count/section; p = 0.02; Figures 3H, 3L and 3M). In addition, when we analyzed the three subdivisions of the VMH, dorsomedial (dmVMH), central (cVMH), and ventrolateral (vlVMH), Ucp2KISf1 mice showed a significant increase in cfos staining in all divisions of the VMH (Figure 3M). UCP2 was shown to regulate neuronal activity, in part, by controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Coppola et al., 2007Coppola A. Liu Z.W. Andrews Z.B. Paradis E. Roy M.C. Friedman J.M.

Glucose administration induced a significant elevation of ROS levels in SF1 neurons of Ucp2KO mice compared to controls (Figures 3N, 3O, and 3R). VMH re-expression of UCP2 was sufficient to reduce ROS to the levels observed in control mice (Figures 3N, 3P, and 3R). Glucose administration induced a significant reduction of ROS levels also in VMH neurons of Ucp2KISf1 mice, a reduction that was significantly greater than that observed in control mice (Figures 3N, 3Q and 3R). These results indicate that UCP2 enables VMH neuronal activation in response to a glucose load, in part, by reducing ROS levels. The VMH plays an important role in glucose metabolism. To test whether UCP2 in the VMH has relevance to systemic glucose control, we analyzed glucose homeostasis in control, Ucp2KO, and Ucp2KOKISf1 mice (Figure 4). Ucp2KO mice displayed decreased glucose tolerance compared to control mice (Figure 4A). Selective re-expression of UCP2 in the VMH of Ucp2KOKISf1 mice restored glucose tolerance to a level that was not statistically different from that of control mice (Figure 4A). No differences in circulating insulin levels were observed between groups (Figure 4B). Furthermore, analyses of body weight (Figure S3A) and composition (Figures S3B and S3C) and histological analysis of pancreatic β-cells (Figures S3D–S3H) showed no difference between groups.Figure S3Phenotypical Characterization of the Ucp2KO and Ucp2KOKISf1 Mice, Related to Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4Show full caption(A–C) Body weight (A), body fat mass (B) and body lean mass (C) in male control (n = 7), Ucp2KO (n = 7) and Ucp2KOKISf1 mice (n = 7).(D–F) Representative micrographs of islet stained by eosin hematoxylin in control (D), Ucp2KO (E) and Ucp2KOKISf1 (F) mice.(G and H) Quantification of islet mass.

Bar scale in D (for E and F) represents 50 μm. To assess insulin action, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed (Figures 4C–4M). Compared to control and Ucp2KOKISf1 animals, Ucp2KO mice showed significantly lower glucose infusion rate (GIR) to maintain euglycemia (Figures 4C–4E), revealing that UCP2 in VMH neurons is required to regulate insulin sensitivity. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) in Ucp2KO mice was higher than controls, and selective VMH re-expression of UCP2 in Ucp2KOKISf1 mice partially restored EGP to the level of controls (Figures 4F and 4G). In addition to the liver, whole body glucose utilization (rate of disappearance; Rd) and rate of glycolysis were significantly lower in Ucp2KO mice than controls and Ucp2KOKISf1 mice (Figures 4H and 4I). Consistent with this, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake in muscles and brown adipose tissue (BAT) was significantly lower in Ucp2KO mice compared to controls (Figures 4J–4M), and re-expression of UCP2 in SF1 neurons restored them to control levels (Figures 4J–4M). To further analyze the role of VMH UCP2 in glucose homeostasis, we next performed glucose measurements in Ucp2KISf1 and control mice. No differences in energy metabolism were observed between Ucp2KISf1 mice and their controls (Figures S4A–S4H), including lack of changes in body weight and length (Figures S4A and S4B), body fat mass and lean mass (Figures S4C and S4D), food intake (Figure S4E), and energy expenditure in Ucp2KISf1 (Figures S4F–S4H). However, in line with the effect of VMH-UCP2 deletion on glucose homeostasis, significant differences in glucose metabolism were observed between Ucp2KISf1 mice and their controls, whereby Ucp2KISf1 mice had significantly lower glucose levels during glucose tolerance test (GTT) compared to controls (Figure 5A). Measurements of circulating insulin levels during GTT showed no significant differences between the experimental groups (Figure S4I), indicating that the increased glucose tolerance was not due to increased insulin secretion. Analysis of insulin sensitivity by insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that Ucp2KISf1 mice were significantly more sensitive to insulin than the controls (Figure 5B), indicating that overexpression of UCP2 in the VMH enhances insulin sensitivity without changing body weight and composition and insulin secretion. In agreement with this, Ucp2KISf1 mice had lower gluconeogenic capacity than control mice in a pyruvate tolerance test (PTT; Figure S4J), which was associated with lower mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the liver (Figure S4K). Finally, to determine whether the effect of increased UCP2 expression on glucose metabolism was specific to hyperglycemia, we assessed the effect of glucoprivation, by 2DG injection, in control and Ucp2KISf1 mice. No effect of 2DG on glucose metabolism was observed between the groups (Figure S4L).Figure 5UCP2 Overexpression Selectively Affects VMH-GE NeuronsShow full caption(A and B) Graphs showing results from glucose tolerance test (GTT; i.p., 2g/kg BW glucose; A), and insulin tolerance test (i.p., 1U/kg BW insulin; B), of control (n = 7-9) and Ucp2KISf1 mice (n = 7-9).(C and D) Graphs showing the percent of glucose excited (GE; C) and glucose inhibited (GI; D) SF1 neurons of control (n = 7) and Ucp2KISf1 (n = 8) mice.(E and F) Representative tracers from a GE (E) and a GI (F) neuron from a Ucp2KISf1 mouse and a control mouse, respectively.(G and H) Representative tracers of GE neurons from control (G) and Ucp2KISf1 mice (H), respectively, showing that their responses to glucose are dependent of KATP channels.(I) Graph showing the percent change of firing rate of dmVMH-GE neurons after the addition in the media of diazoxide (300 μM), a KATP channel opener. n = 10 cells/5 control mice; n = 11 cells/5 Ucp2KISf1 mice.(J) Graph showing the percent of SF1-GE neurons in the dmVMH of control (8 cells out of 10 in 5 mice total) and Ucp2KISf1 mice (9 cells out of 11 in 5 mice total) that were inhibited by diazoxide (300 μM).All data represent the mean ± SEM; (A–C), ∗ = p < 0.05 and ∗∗ = p < 0.01 compared to control mice; (I), ∗ = p < 0.05 compared to control in 2.5 mM glucose; # = p < 0.05 compared to Ucp2KISf1 in 2.5 mM glucose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A and B) Graphs showing results from glucose tolerance test (GTT; i.p., 2g/kg BW glucose; A), and insulin tolerance test (i.p., 1U/kg BW insulin; B), of control (n = 7-9) and Ucp2KISf1 mice (n = 7-9).

Altogether, these data unmasked that UCP2 in VMH neurons is necessary for appropriate physiological regulation of insulin sensitivity in both muscle and liver. The data above argue for the importance of VMH mitochondrial fission and associated neuronal activation enabled by UCP2 in the physiological control of systemic glucose metabolism. In the VMH, neuronal subpopulations were identified that are either excited or inhibited by glucose (Chan and Sherwin, 2013Chan O. Sherwin R. Influence of VMH fuel sensing on hypoglycemic responses.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24: 616-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To interrogate whether UCP2 impacts these subpopulations of neurons, we quantified glucose-excited (GE) and glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons in the VMH-SF1 neurons of control and Ucp2KISf1 mice. We performed this measurement in the dmVMH since this subdivision showed a larger number of GE neurons as assessed by cfos immunolabeling (Figure 3M). We observed that, in Ucp2KISf1 mice, the GE neuronal subpopulation was significantly larger (10 GE cells/28 total cells/8 mice) than that of control animals (6 GE cells/32 total cells/7 mice; Figures 5C and 5E). On the other hand, no differences were found in the GI subpopulation of the dmVMH between transgenic and control animals (control: 2 GI cells/32 total cells/7 mice; Ucp2KISf1: 3 GI cells/28 total cells/8 mice; Figures 5D and 5F). Furthermore, to determine whether UCP2-mediated increased neuronal excitability to glucose was dependent on KATP channels, we studied the effect of diazoxide, a KATP channel opener, on glucose-induced increase of firing rate in dmVMH neurons (Figures 5G–5J). Diazoxide application to excited dmVMH-SF1-GE neurons significantly reduced the firing rates of the majority of these neurons in control (8 cells/10 total cells/5 mice; Figures 5G, 5I, and 5J) and Ucp2KISf1 mice (9 cells/11 total cells/5 mice; Figures 5H–5J). Altogether, these observations indicate that systemic glucose control regulated by UCP2 in the VMH is mediated by VMH-GE neurons. To test this, we selectively interfered with VMH neuronal activation in response to glucose load in freely moving mice using an inhibiting “designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs” (DREADD) approach (Krashes et al., 2011Krashes M.J. Koda S. Ye C. Rogan S.C. Adams A.C. Cusher D.S. Maratos-Flier E. Roth B.L. Lowell B.B. Rapid, reversible activation of AgRP neurons drives feeding behavior in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). We injected inhibitory DREADD (AAV-hM4Di-mCherry) into the VMH of control (expressing cre in SF1 neurons) and Ucp2KISf1 mice, allowing selective and reversible inactivation of SF1 neurons by application of Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 0.3 mg/kg body weight [BW], intraperitoneally [i.p.]). After virus injection into the VMH, locally restricted expression of “the virus” was specified by mCherry fluorescence (Figures 6A, 6B , and S5). Thirty minutes after CNO-driven activation of the inhibitory DREADD, glucose was injected and circulating glucose levels measured. Compared to the vehicle-injected mice 30 min prior to glucose administration, control and Ucp2KISf1 mice injected first with CNO and then with glucose (Figures 6C and 6D) displayed a significant increase in circulating gl"

Thus, our data implicate DEAH-box ATPases in acting at a distance by pulling substrate RNA from the catalytic core of the spliceosome. Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machine comprising over eighty conserved proteins and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). In the first chemical step of splicing, branching, the 2′ hydroxyl of the branch site adenosine (brA) attacks the 5′ splice site phosphate, cleaving the 5′ exon from the intron and forming a lariat intermediate. In the second step, exon ligation, the 3′ hydroxyl of the 5′ exon attacks the 3′ splice site phosphate, joining the exons and excising the lariat intron. Both reactions are enabled by a single catalytic core that is composed of snRNA (Fica et al., 2013Fica S.M. Tuttle N. Novak T. Li N.S. Lu J. Koodathingal P. Dai Q. Staley J.P. Piccirilli J.A. RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing.Nature. 2013; 503: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Hang et al., 2015Hang J. Wan R. Yan C. Shi Y. Structural basis of pre-mRNA splicing.Science. 2015; 349: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Within this core, U6 snRNA positions metal ions that participate directly in catalysis (Fica et al., 2013Fica S.M. Tuttle N. Novak T. Li N.S. Lu J. Koodathingal P. Dai Q. Staley J.P. Piccirilli J.A. RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing.Nature. 2013; 503: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), while the U2 and U6 snRNAs form a base-pairing network that specifies and juxtaposes the reactive splice sites (Hang et al., 2015Hang J. Wan R. Yan C. Shi Y. Structural basis of pre-mRNA splicing.Science. 2015; 349: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it remains obscure how the spliceosome accommodates two reactions in a single catalytic core and ensures the fidelity of splice site choice. The spliceosome faces a formidable challenge in identifying and juxtaposing the appropriate splice sites to ensure faithful gene expression (Semlow and Staley, 2012Semlow D.R. Staley J.P. Staying on message: ensuring fidelity in pre-mRNA splicing.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spliceosome must utilize optimal splice sites defined by short nucleotide motifs and discriminate against competing suboptimal splice sites, the utilization of which would corrupt the mRNA. The splice sites are first sampled during spliceosome assembly, which involves the stepwise addition of snRNPs (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). After the 5′ splice site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, the branch site is recognized by the U2 snRNP through base pairing, with bulging of the nucleophilic adenosine, and then the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP binds. This assembly pathway and downstream steps require dramatic protein and snRNA rearrangements that depend on eight members of the SF2 superfamily of nucleic acid-dependent ATPases (Figure S1A; Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar), which function ubiquitously throughout RNA-dependent processes to remodel RNP complexes (Jankowsky, 2011Jankowsky E. RNA helicases at work: binding and rearranging.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Following addition of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the assembled but inactive spliceosome is activated in two stages. First, the SF2 ATPase Brr2 disrupts base pairing between U6 and U4 snRNA to permit formation of interactions within U6 and between U6 and U2 snRNA, giving rise to the pre-catalytic spliceosome (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Then the SF2 ATPase Prp2 promotes a more subtle rearrangement required for branching (Krishnan et al., 2013Krishnan R. Blanco M.R. Kahlscheuer M.L. Abelson J. Guthrie C. Walter N.G.

Following branching, the SF2 ATPase Prp16 and the Slu7/Prp18 heterodimer act sequentially to reposition the substrate and enable 3′ splice site recognition for exon ligation (James et al., 2002James S.A.

After exon ligation, the SF2 ATPase Prp22 releases the mRNA from the spliceosome (Company et al., 1991Company M. Arenas J. Abelson J. Requirement of the RNA helicase-like protein PRP22 for release of messenger RNA from spliceosomes.Nature. 1991; 349: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and the SF2 ATPase Prp43 acts with Brr2 to release the lariat intron and disassemble the spliceosome (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). At least five SF2 ATPases also promote the fidelity of splicing by discriminating against suboptimal splice sites (Semlow and Staley, 2012Semlow D.R. Staley J.P. Staying on message: ensuring fidelity in pre-mRNA splicing.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These ATPases likely enable kinetic proofreading by competing with on-pathway events, triggering spliceosomal rearrangements that effectively “reject” suboptimal splice sites. Despite the importance of spliceosomal SF2 ATPases, the molecular mechanisms by which these ATPase function and their consequences for splice site selection remain largely uncharacterized. Indeed, the functions and mechanisms of only a few SF2 ATPases have been defined in molecular terms (Jankowsky, 2011Jankowsky E. RNA helicases at work: binding and rearranging.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Distinct SF2 families appear to perform different functions and by distinct mechanisms (Ozgur et al., 2015Ozgur S. Buchwald G. Falk S. Chakrabarti S. Prabu J.R. Conti E. The conformational plasticity of eukaryotic RNA-dependent ATPases.FEBS J. 2015; 282: 850-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The spliceosomal SF2 members belong to the DEAD-box family or the DExH-box families, which include the Ski2-like, DEAH-box, and viral NS3/NPH-II families. By directly binding and distorting a duplex, DEAD-box ATPases unwind double-stranded RNA. The DExH-box families are also thought to unwind RNA but by translocating through a duplex, 3′ to 5′ along a single strand of RNA. Indeed, Ski2-like ATPases include a duplex-melting element. However, this element is not conserved in DEAH-box or NS3/NPH-II ATPases (Jankowsky, 2011Jankowsky E. RNA helicases at work: binding and rearranging.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, Prabu et al., 2015Prabu J.R. Müller M. Thomae A.W. Schüssler S. Bonneau F. Becker P.B. Conti E. Structure of the RNA helicase MLE reveals molecular mechanisms for uridine specificity and RNA-ATP coupling.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), raising questions about their functions and mechanisms. At the catalytic stage of splicing, the DEAH-box ATPases Prp16 and Prp22 also contribute to the fidelity of branching and exon ligation, respectively (Semlow and Staley, 2012Semlow D.R. Staley J.P. Staying on message: ensuring fidelity in pre-mRNA splicing.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting repositioning of an optimal substrate after branching, Prp16 rejects suboptimal branch sites by competing with branching to remodel the spliceosome into an inactive conformation (Burgess and Guthrie, 1993Burgess S.M. Guthrie C. A mechanism to enhance mRNA splicing fidelity: the RNA-dependent ATPase Prp16 governs usage of a discard pathway for aberrant lariat intermediates.Cell. 1993; 73: 1377-1391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P.

Cell. 2010; 39: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By genetics, Prp16 appears to both reject a suboptimal substrate and promote an optimal substrate in a similar manner (Hilliker et al., 2007Hilliker A.K. Mefford M.A. Staley J.P. U2 toggles iteratively between the stem IIa and stem IIc conformations to promote pre-mRNA splicing.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Mefford and Staley, 2009Mefford M.A. Staley J.P.

The Isy1p component of the NineTeen complex interacts with the ATPase Prp16p to regulate the fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Prp16 rejects a suboptimal substrate and promotes an optimal substrate remains unclear. In addition to promoting mRNA release after exon ligation, Prp22 rejects a suboptimal 3′ splice site by competing with exon ligation to remodel the spliceosome into an inactive conformation (Mayas et al., 2006Mayas R.M. Maita H. Staley J.P. Exon ligation is proofread by the DExD/H-box ATPase Prp22p.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because of these two roles, we proposed that Prp22 effects both activities by translocating upstream from the 3′ exon to disrupt interactions between the spliceosome and the substrate, interactions that differ before and after exon ligation due to the changing connectivity of the substrate (Mayas et al., 2006Mayas R.M. Maita H. Staley J.P. Exon ligation is proofread by the DExD/H-box ATPase Prp22p.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Indeed, mRNA release requires that Prp22 interact with the 3′ exon (Schwer, 2008Schwer B. A conformational rearrangement in the spliceosome sets the stage for Prp22-dependent mRNA release.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Prp22 rejects a suboptimal 3′ splice site remains undefined and evidence for translocation before or after exon ligation is lacking. The rejection of a splice site by Prp16 or Prp22 can be followed by the termination of splicing and discard of the substrate by the spliceosome disassembly factor Prp43 (Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P. Novak T. Piccirilli J.A. Staley J.P. The DEAH box ATPases Prp16 and Prp43 cooperate to proofread 5′ splice site cleavage during pre-mRNA splicing.Mol.

Spliceosome discards intermediates via the DEAH box ATPase Prp43p.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 10020-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, rejection by Prp16 or Prp22 can also be followed by rebinding of the substrate (Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P. Novak T. Piccirilli J.A. Staley J.P. The DEAH box ATPases Prp16 and Prp43 cooperate to proofread 5′ splice site cleavage during pre-mRNA splicing.Mol.

Exon ligation is proofread by the DExD/H-box ATPase Prp22p.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), though the function of this rebinding is unknown. Here, using budding yeast, we have investigated the function and mechanism of DEAH-box ATPases during the catalytic stage of splicing. Unexpectedly, we discovered that rejection of suboptimal splice sites by the ATPases Prp16 and Prp22 enables the spliceosome to select alternative splice sites. Utilizing single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we found that these ATPases generally promote splice site rejection and substrate repositioning by disengaging splice sites. Finally, we revealed evidence that these ATPases reject suboptimal substrates and promote optimal substrates by translocating along substrate RNA downstream of the catalytic core, but not necessarily through interactions targeted for disruption. Overall, our results support a model in which these DEAH-box ATPases function by pulling on the RNA substrate to destabilize substrate-spliceosome interactions, thereby enabling the spliceosome to sample alternative interactions with the substrate. To investigate the mechanism of Prp16-mediated branch site rejection, we designed a splicing substrate that would allow assembly of catalytically active spliceosomes but preclude branching. Specifically, we incorporated deoxyadenosine at the canonical branch site of a UBC4 pre-mRNA, eliminating the nucleophilic 2′ hydroxyl (d-brA; Figure 1A). Despite our design, in yeast whole-cell extract the d-brA substrate branched (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 5) using an alternative branch site (see below; c.f. Query et al., 1994Query C.C. Moore M.J. Sharp P.A. Branch nucleophile selection in pre-mRNA splicing: evidence for the bulged duplex model.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, depletion of Prp16, which is canonically required only for exon ligation (Figure 1B, lanes 2–4), completely abolished branching of the d-brA substrate, and wild-type, but not ATPase-defective, recombinant (r)Prp16 rescued branching (Figure 1B, lanes 6–8). Thus, the activation of alternative branch sites required Prp16. To test whether Prp16 was sufficient to activate alternative branch sites, we depleted Prp16 from extract, assembled spliceosomes on the d-brA substrate and isolated the stalled spliceosomes from extract by gradient fractionation. Note that by smFRET, the pre-mRNA adopted a conformation indistinguishable from the catalytically active conformation (see below), implying that spliceosomes stalled solely due to the lack of the 2′ hydroxyl nucleophile. Importantly, wild-type, but not ATPase-defective, rPrp16 chased the isolated spliceosomes through branching; rSlu7/rPrp18 chased the spliceosomes further through exon ligation (Figure 1C). Thus, Prp16 was sufficient to activate alternative branch sites within assembled spliceosomes. Interestingly, branching of the d-brA substrate yielded distinct lariat intermediates (Figures 1B and 1C) resulting from branching at alternative adenosines 1 and 4 nt upstream of the consensus branchpoint (Figure 1D). Because branching at −4 has not been observed in the context of canonical U2-branch site base pairing (Smith et al., 2009Smith D.J. Konarska M.M. Query C.C. Insights into branch nucleophile positioning and activation from an orthogonal pre-mRNA splicing system in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), branching at −4 implies that Prp16 destabilized the branch site-U2 interaction, allowing the splicing substrate to re-align with U2. Indeed, the sequence flanking this alternative branch site is complementary to U2 and bulges the nucleophilic adenosine (Figure 1D), and mutations that eliminate the complementarity precluded formation of the faster-migrating lariat intermediate (Figure S1B). Thus, we infer that in rejecting a branch site, Prp16 triggers unwinding of the U2-branch site interaction and thereby enables the selection of alternative branch sites (see Discussion). While depletion of Prp16 stalls the d-brA substrate before branching, the spliceosome nevertheless juxtaposes the deoxyadenosine branch site with the 5′ splice site (see below), suggesting that Prp16 not only disrupts the U2-branch site interaction but also antagonizes juxtaposition of the branch site with the 5′ splice site. To test the possibility that Prp16 antagonizes splice site juxtaposition, we monitored splice site proximity by smFRET (Abelson et al., 2010Abelson J. Blanco M. Ditzler M.A. Fuller F. Aravamudhan P. Wood M. Villa T. Ryan D.E. Pleiss J.A. Maeder C. et al.Conformational dynamics of single pre-mRNA molecules during in vitro splicing.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2013; 20: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which enables an assessment of substrate conformation in crude preparations with limiting amounts of substrate in multiple conformations. We assembled spliceosomes on UBC4 splicing substrates labeled with a fluorescent acceptor just upstream of the 5′ splice site and a fluorescent donor just downstream of the branch site (BS labeled; Figure 2A; Table S1; Krishnan et al., 2013Krishnan R. Blanco M.R. Kahlscheuer M.L. Abelson J. Guthrie C. Walter N.G. Biased Brownian ratcheting leads to pre-mRNA remodeling and capture prior to first-step splicing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To facilitate the assignment of a FRET state to a specific intermediate, we enriched for distinct intermediates by (1) stalling particular intermediates through inactivation of individual SF2 ATPases (Figure S1A), (2) isolating these intermediates from cell extract by gradient fractionation, and (3) immobilizing these intermediates on slides for total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy through specific affinity tags on individual spliceosomal components (Figure 2A). We then sampled emission trajectories (Figure 2A; Table S2) to generate histograms that describe the frequency with which spliceosomes at a particular intermediate stage occupy a given FRET state. We first defined reference FRET states by assessing juxtaposition of the branch site and 5′ splice site during spliceosome assembly and activation. The splicing substrate exhibited (1) a zero FRET state in assembled but catalytically inactive spliceosomes (Figure 2B), (2) a low (0.29) FRET state in pre-catalytic spliceosomes (Figure 2C), and (3) a high (0.75) FRET state in spliceosomes stalled at the branching stage (Figure 2D); FRET peaks for a specific intermediate varied with an SD of ±0.04. These FRET states were static (Figure S2A; Table S2), precluding direct analysis of substrate dynamics but still allowing assessment of substrate conformation in distinct spliceosomal subpopulations. Consistent with previous studies, and thereby validating our approach (Blanco et al., 2015Blanco M.R. Martin J.S. Kahlscheuer M.L. Krishnan R. Abelson J. Laederach A. Walter N.G.

Biol. 2013; 20: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these increasing FRET states indicate stepwise juxtaposition of the branching reactants. To test the consequences of Prp16-mediated rejection on the juxtaposition of the branch site with the 5′ splice site, we utilized a model system for investigating proofreading in vitro (Figure S2B). In this system, spliceosomes stall just before branching due to U6 snRNA phosphorothioate substitutions that compromise the coordination of catalytic metals (Fica et al., 2013Fica S.M. Tuttle N. Novak T. Li N.S. Lu J. Koodathingal P. Dai Q. Staley J.P. Piccirilli J.A. RNA catalyses nuclear pre-mRNA splicing.Nature. 2013; 503: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); this stalling is due in part to rejection by Prp16 (Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P. Novak T. Piccirilli J.A. Staley J.P. The DEAH box ATPases Prp16 and Prp43 cooperate to proofread 5′ splice site cleavage during pre-mRNA splicing.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because these substitutions, unlike branch site mutations, permit efficient spliceosome assembly in vitro, we assayed substrate juxtaposition during Prp16-dependent rejection of one such substitution, U80-PS(SP), in which the pro-SP phosphate oxygen at nucleotide U80 was substituted with sulfur (Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P. Novak T. Piccirilli J.A. Staley J.P. The DEAH box ATPases Prp16 and Prp43 cooperate to proofread 5′ splice site cleavage during pre-mRNA splicing.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As expected, isolated spliceosomes reconstituted with U6 U80-PS(SP) and assembled on BS-labeled substrate did not catalyze branching in Mg2+ but did in Cd2+, which restored metal binding to U80-PS(SP) (Figure S2C). U6 U80-PS(SP) spliceosomes that were stalled before (in Mg2+) and after (in Cd2+) branching both exhibited high FRET states (0.73 and 0.76, respectively; Figures 2F and 2E, respectively, and Figure 2H), indicating that substrate juxtaposition is not appreciably altered by branching. Spliceosomes stalled before branching by the d-brA branch site also exhibited a high FRET state (0.70; Figure S2D). These data imply that spliceosomes containing either the d-brA or U6 U80-PS(SP) perturbation stall with the reactants poised for chemistry (Figure 1; Koodathingal et al., 2010Koodathingal P. Novak T. Piccirilli J.A. Staley J.P. The DEAH box ATPases Prp16 and Prp43 cooperate to proofread 5′ splice site cleavage during pre-mRNA splicing.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Next, we activated Prp16-dependent rejection by incubating isolated U6 U80-PS(SP) spliceosomes, stalled in Mg2+ before branching, with ATP and then immobilized spliceosomes on slides and washed to remove ATP and unbound splicing factors, quenching the reaction. Strikingly, activation of Prp16-mediated rejection shifted U80-PS(SP)-stalled spliceosomes from the high FRET state to a near-zero FRET state (0.07; Figures 2G and 2I); this shift was blocked by the ATPase-deficient mutant rPrp16-K379A (Figure S2E). These findings further support a model in which Prp16 rejects a branch site by disrupting the U2-branch-site interaction and, as a consequence, disengaging the branch site from the 5′ splice site. To determine the consequences of Prp16 action on the juxtaposition of the 5′ exon with the branch site after branching, we stalled Prp16-depleted spliceosomes just after branching, isolated these spliceosomes by gradient fractionation, added back rPrp16 and ATP (Figure S2F), and then immobilized the spliceosomes for TIRF microscopy, washing away ATP and unbound factors. Strikingly, wild-type, but not mutated, rPrp16 shifted a subpopulation of spliceosomes assembled on BS-labeled substrate from the high FRET state exhibited by the branching conformation (Figure 2J) to a near-zero FRET state indicative of an open substrate conformation (0.07; Figures 2K and 2N; Figure S2G), paralleling the Prp16-dependent formation of a low FRET state before branching (compare Figures 2F and 2G). Thus, after branching, Prp16 appears to function in an ATP-dependent manner to separate the products of the branching reaction, just as it appears to function before branching to separate the reactants. Because genetics have implicated unwinding of the branch site-U2 interaction after branching (Kannan et al., 2013Kannan R. Hartnett S. Voelker R.B. Berglund J.A. Staley J.P. Baumann P. Intronic sequence elements impede exon ligation and trigger a discard pathway that yields functional telomerase RNA in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Prp16 may separate the branching products by disrupting this interaction, just as it does before branching (see Discussion). To test for evidence that the Prp16-dependent, near-zero FRET state, intermediate conformation is functional, we added rSlu7 and rPrp18 to the spliceosomes activated as above with rPrp16 and ATP, to drive mRNA formation (Figure S2F). Indeed, rSlu7/rPrp18 shifted a subpopulation of spliceosomes from the near-zero FRET state back to a high FRET state (0.63; Figures 2L and 2O), characteristic of the exon ligation conformation (0.67; Figure 2M; Figure S1A), and with an efficiency expected given the degree of mRNA formation (Figure S2F). Note that the high FRET state at exon ligation implies that the branch site is an integral component of the catalytic core at this stage, consistent with the deleterious effects of branch site mutations at exon ligation. Overall, our data support a model in which Prp16 drives separation of the branch site and 5′ exon, thereby allowing Slu7 and Prp18 to establish a proximal configuration of the branch site and 5′ exon in the exon ligation conformation, a configuratio"

Precursor piRNA transcripts are bound by Piwi, which is thought to direct Zucchini/MitoPLD to cleave the primary transcript at a position 3′ downstream of the PIWI-bound region. In flies, Zucchini often generates ∼26-nt intermediates that are compatible with Piwi binding (Han et al., 2015Han B.W. Wang W. Li C. Weng Z. Zamore P.D.

Here, we show that PARN-1, a conserved exonuclease, is required for 3′-end processing of piRNA in C. elegans. Recombinant PARN-1 protein possesses 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activity in vitro. Depletion of PARN-1 specifically compromises 3′ trimming of piRNAs while 5′ end processing and methylation of 3′ ends are unaffected. PARN-1 is restricted to the adult germline and co-localizes with PRG-1 in germline nuage structures called P granules. Intriguingly, in parn-1 mutants, untrimmed piRNAs associate with PRG-1 and accumulate to levels similar to those observed for wild-type (WT) piRNAs. Although the expression levels of piRNAs remain unchanged in parn-1 animals, Piwi-dependent mRNA silencing is reduced, as is the production of Piwi-dependent 22G-RNAs on mRNA targets. Together, our findings demonstrate that the highly conserved PARN-1 protein is required for piRNA trimming and suggest that piRNA length is precisely regulated to promote Piwi/piRNA surveillance functions in the C. elegans germline. To identify RNases responsible for 3′ end trimming, we took a candidate approach. We used northern blotting to search for changes in piRNA length in animals depleted for expression of candidate nucleases. This search identified PARN-1 as specifically required for piRNA expression in C. elegans (Figures 1A and S1A). Animals bearing a presumptive null allele of parn-1(tm869), which deletes most of the catalytic domain and shifts the open reading frame (Nousch et al., 2013Nousch M. Techritz N. Hampel D.

Mutations in another parn gene, parn-2, had no effect on piRNAs and failed to enhance the piRNA defect of parn-1 mutants (Figures 1A and S1B). Expression of a parn-1::gfp transgene restored expression of piRNAs of appropriate length (Figure S1B).Figure S1Analysis of Small RNAs in parn-1 Mutants, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Northern blot analysis of 21U-RNAs upon RNAi-mediated depletion of candidate nucleases.

A C. elegans Piwi, PRG-1, regulates 21U-RNAs during spermatogenesis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 861-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that the longer parn-1 mutant piRNAs are also stabilized by PRG-1, our northern blots revealed that prg-1; parn-1 double mutants lack piRNAs (Figure 1A). To look more broadly at small-RNA biogenesis in parn-1 mutants, we cloned and deep sequenced small RNAs. We employed three different small-RNA cloning methods. To enrich for 5′-monoP species such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, we employed a direct ligation method to add a 5′ adaptor. To recover small RNAs with capped or 5′ triphosphorylated (5′ triP) ends, we applied two additional protocols, one involving pre-treatment with 5′ Polyphosphatase, which removes the γ and β phosphates from 5′-triP RNA, and a second involving pre-treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) to convert 5′ capped or polyphosphate RNA into 5′-monoP RNA. Using all of these methods, we found that overall piRNA abundance was comparable between WT and parn-1 strains (Figures 1B and S1C). Interestingly, the piRNAs in parn-1 mutants were extended by 2–4 nts at their 3′ ends but exhibited 5′ ends that map precisely to the 5′ uridine of WT mature piRNAs (Figures 1C and 1D). This finding was further confirmed by inspecting specific piRNA loci (Figure 1E). No changes in the length distribution of other small RNA species, such as miRNAs, were observed (Figures 1A and S1D). As expected, piRNA levels were dramatically reduced in prg-1 single mutant and prg-1; parn-1 double mutant animals (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). Although our northern blots suggest that untrimmed piRNAs are more abundant than WT piRNAs (Figures 1A and 2C ), our deep-sequencing data do not support this conclusion. It is possible that the stronger signals on northern blots do not reflect increased levels but rather stronger hybridization, perhaps due to pairing between the additional 3′ nucleotides in the longer piRNAs and the flanking sequences present in the Starfire probes (Integrated DNA Technologies). Altogether, our findings suggest that PARN-1 is required for 3′ trimming, but not for 5′ processing. To ask whether the untrimmed piRNAs associate with PRG-1, we recovered PRG-1 immunoprecipitation (IP) complexes from parn-1 extracts and analyzed PRG-1-bound small RNAs through deep sequencing. We found that the longer piRNAs co-precipitated with PRG-1 and confirmed their extended 3′ ends and their 5′ uridine (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). The majority of piRNA species exhibited significant enrichment in the PRG-1 IP complex, and the levels of the untrimmed piRNA species correlated well with that of their corresponding WT counterparts (Figures 2B, S2C, and S2D). Similarly, we found that the expression levels of PRG-1 protein appeared similar in WT and parn-1 mutant animals as assayed by western blotting (Figure S2E). To examine the methylation status of piRNA 3′ ends, we performed β-elimination experiments. While RNAs containing 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups react with sodium periodate, RNA species with terminal 2′-O-methylation are resistant to this treatment. The β-elimination reaction removes the last nucleotide leaving a phosphate group at the 3′ terminus. The resulting size change can be monitored by PAGE. Interestingly, we found that piRNAs were methylated in WT and parn-1 animals, but not in the henn-1 methyltransferase mutant (Figure 2C) (Billi et al., 2012Billi A.C. Alessi A.F. Khivansara V. Han T.

A control miRNA known to have terminal 2′ hydroxyl showed the expected size shift in both WT and in parn-1 mutants (Figure 2C). To determine whether resistance to sodium periodate treatment is a general feature of these longer piRNAs, we deep sequenced both β-eliminated and untreated small RNAs harvested from WT, parn-1, and henn-1 strains. This treatment leaves a 2′-phosphate at the 3′ end of RNAs containing 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups, rendering them poor substrates for 3′ adaptor ligation. Thus, non-modified RNA species are eliminated, while RNAs with terminal 2′-O-methylation are expected to be enriched in deep-sequencing libraries generated from periodate-treated samples. We found that periodate treatment enriched the abundance of piRNAs by 5- to 6-fold in both WT and parn-1 animals when compared to untreated samples (Figure 2D). These enrichments were not observed in henn-1 mutants (Figure 2D). Thus, although untrimmed at their 3′ ends, the piRNAs in parn-1 animals are properly loaded onto PRG-1 and exhibit 5′ and 3′ end structures typical of WT piRNAs. We next examined parn-1 mRNA expression and PARN-1 protein localization. Using qPCR, we found that parn-1 mRNA was expressed"
https://openalex.org/W2291645046,"Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a genetically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty loci that modify risk for AD. Despite the identification of these loci, little progress has been made in identifying the functional variants that explain the association with AD risk. Thus, we sought to determine whether the novel LOAD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter expression of LOAD GWAS genes and whether expression of these genes is altered in AD brains. The majority of LOAD GWAS SNPs occur in gene dense regions under large linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, making it unclear which gene(s) are modified by the SNP. Thus, we tested for brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between LOAD GWAS SNPs and SNPs in high LD with the LOAD GWAS SNPs in all of the genes within the GWAS loci. We found a significant eQTL between rs1476679 and PILRB and GATS, which occurs within the ZCWPW1 locus. PILRB and GATS expression levels, within the ZCWPW1 locus, were also associated with AD status. Rs7120548 was associated with MTCH2 expression, which occurs within the CELF1 locus. Additionally, expression of several genes within the CELF1 locus, including MTCH2, were highly correlated with one another and were associated with AD status. We further demonstrate that PILRB, as well as other genes within the GWAS loci, are most highly expressed in microglia. These findings together with the function of PILRB as a DAP12 receptor supports the critical role of microglia and neuroinflammation in AD risk."

However, no standards regarding input material have been defined. This study therefore aimed to determine the effect of the type of input material (e.g. formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) versus fresh frozen (FF) tissue) on NGS derived results. Moreover, this study aimed to explore a standardized analysis pipeline to support consistent clinical decision-making. Method We used the Ion Torrent PGM sequencing platform in combination with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 to sequence frequently mutated regions in 50 cancer related genes, and validated the NGS detected variants in 250 FFPE samples using standard diagnostic assays. Next, 386 tumour samples were sequenced to explore the effect of input material on variant detection variables. For variant calling, Ion Torrent analysis software was supplemented with additional variant annotation and filtering. Results Both FFPE and FF tissue could be sequenced reliably with a sensitivity of 99.1%. Validation showed a 98.5% concordance between NGS and conventional sequencing techniques, where NGS provided both the advantage of low input DNA concentration and the detection of low-frequency variants. The reliability of mutation analysis could be further improved with manual inspection of sequence data. Conclusion Targeted NGS can be reliably implemented in cancer diagnostics using both FFPE and FF tissue when using appropriate analysis settings, even with low input DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2273916944,"To distinguish between complex somatosensory stimuli, central circuits must combine signals from multiple peripheral mechanoreceptor types, as well as mechanoreceptors at different sites in the body. Here, we investigate the first stages of somatosensory integration in Drosophila using in vivo recordings from genetically labeled central neurons in combination with mechanical and optogenetic stimulation of specific mechanoreceptor types. We identify three classes of central neurons that process touch: one compares touch signals on different parts of the same limb, one compares touch signals on right and left limbs, and the third compares touch and proprioceptive signals. Each class encodes distinct features of somatosensory stimuli. The axon of an individual touch receptor neuron can diverge to synapse onto all three classes, meaning that these computations occur in parallel, not hierarchically. Representing a stimulus as a set of parallel comparisons is a fast and efficient way to deliver somatosensory signals to motor circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2279040869,"Image segmentation of retinal blood vessels is a process that can help to predict and diagnose cardiovascular related diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are known to affect the retinal blood vessels' appearance. This work proposes an unsupervised method for the segmentation of retinal vessels images using a combined matched filter, Frangi's filter and Gabor Wavelet filter to enhance the images. The combination of these three filters in order to improve the segmentation is the main motivation of this work. We investigate two approaches to perform the filter combination: weighted mean and median ranking. Segmentation methods are tested after the vessel enhancement. Enhanced images with median ranking are segmented using a simple threshold criterion. Two segmentation procedures are applied when considering enhanced retinal images using the weighted mean approach. The first method is based on deformable models and the second uses fuzzy C-means for the image segmentation. The procedure is evaluated using two public image databases, Drive and Stare. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well for vessel segmentation in comparison with state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W2275486710,"The isolation and study of cell-specific populations in the central nervous system (CNS) has gained significant interest in the neuroscience community. The ability to examine cell-specific gene and protein expression patterns in healthy and pathological tissue is critical for our understanding of CNS function. Several techniques currently exist to isolate cell-specific populations, each having their own inherent advantages and shortcomings. Isolation of distinct cell populations using magnetic sorting is a technique which has been available for nearly 3 decades, although rarely used in adult whole CNS tissue homogenate. In the current study we demonstrate that distinct cell populations can be isolated in rodents from early postnatal development through adulthood. We found this technique to be amendable to customization using commercially available membrane-targeted antibodies, allowing for cell-specific isolation across development and animal species. This technique yields RNA which can be utilized for downstream applications-including quantitative PCR and RNA sequencing-at relatively low cost and without the need for specialized equipment or fluorescently labeled cells. Adding to its utility, we demonstrate that cells can be isolated largely intact, retaining their processes, enabling analysis of extrasomatic proteins. We propose that magnetic cell sorting will prove to be a highly useful technique for the examination of cell specific CNS populations."

Unlike NMO and MS, there is a paucity of literature on immunopathology and CSF cytokine/chemokines in MOG Ab associated demyelination. Aim To study the differences in immunopathogenesis based on cytokine/chemokine profile in MOG Ab-positive (POS) and -negative (NEG) groups. Methods We measured 34 cytokines/chemokines using multiplex immunoassay in CSF collected from paediatric patients with serum MOG Ab POS [acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM = 8), transverse myelitis (TM = 2) n = 10] and serum MOG Ab NEG (ADEM = 5, TM = 4, n = 9) demyelination. We generated normative data using CSF from 20 non-inflammatory neurological controls. Results The CSF cytokine and chemokine levels were higher in both MOG Ab POS and MOG Ab NEG demyelination groups compared to controls. The CSF in MOG Ab POS patients showed predominant elevation of B cell related cytokines/chemokines (CXCL13, APRIL, BAFF and CCL19) as well as some of Th17 related cytokines (IL-6 AND G-CSF) compared to MOG Ab NEG group (all p<0.01). In addition, patients with elevated CSF MOG antibodies had higher CSF CXCL13, CXCL12, CCL19, IL-17A and G-CSF than patients without CSF MOG antibodies. Conclusion Our findings suggest that MOG Ab POS patients have a more pronounced CNS inflammatory response with elevation of predominant humoral associated cytokines/chemokines, as well as some Th 17 and neutrophil related cytokines/chemokines suggesting a differential inflammatory pathogenesis associated with MOG antibody seropositivity. This cytokine/chemokine profiling provides new insight into disease pathogenesis, and improves our ability to monitor inflammation and response to treatment. In addition, some of these molecules may represent potential immunomodulatory targets."

Nevertheless, a clear consensus for the mechanism by which the CTD influences channel function and the means by which it might influence the channel pore remains unknown. Here, we show that the BacNaV CTD has an integral role in controlling channel voltage-dependent behavior and that variation in neck composition and structure cause functional diversity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the neck has a temperature-dependent unfolding transition that is directly coupled to channel opening. These results establish that a discrete ion channel domain can serve as a temperature response element. The BacNaV CTD location is shared with many VGIC superfamily member helical bundle domains (Howard et al., 2007Howard R.J. Clark K.A. Holton J.M. Minor Jr., D.L.

This architectural commonality suggests that the principles uncovered here set a framework for understanding how four-helix bundle CTDs can modulate VGIC superfamily member function. To probe BacNaV CTD function, we focused on two BacNaVs having different activation signatures, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii NaVAe1 and Silicibacter pomeroyi NaVSp1. NaVSp1 displays robust voltage-dependent activity (Koishi et al., 2004Koishi R. Xu H. Ren D. Navarro B. Spiller B.W. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. A superfamily of voltage-gated sodium channels in bacteria.J.

Biol. 2014; 426: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). We deleted the NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 CTDs at the hinge between the pore module and CTD (ending at NaVAe1 His245 and NaVSp1 His224, respectively) (Figure S1A) (Shaya et al., 2014Shaya D. Findeisen F.

Sato C. The C-terminal coiled-coil of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac is not essential for tetramer formation, but stabilizes subunit-to-subunit interactions.Prog. Biophys. Mol.

However, CTD deletion had robust effects on voltage-dependent activation, causing large left shifts in V1/2 relative to the references (V1/2 = 19.1 ± 1.9 and 32.1 ± 1.1 mV, for NaVAe1ΔCTD and a functional mutant bearing a neck triple glycine substitution NaVAe1GGG [Shaya et al., 2014Shaya D.

Thus, CTD deletion produces NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 channels that are more readily opened by voltage.Figure S1BacNaV Chimeras and Deletions, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) BacNaV deletion and chimera sequence map.

Biol. 2014; 426: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because CTD deletion had such a strong effect on NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 function, we created a series of chimeras (Figure S1A) to define whether the effects caused by the CTD arise from the neck, coiled-coil, or both. CTD exchange between NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 yielded channels, NaVAe1SpCTD and NaVSp1AeCTD, that phenocopied the properties of the CTD parent; NaVAe1SpCTD was functional (V1/2 = 38.8 ± 2.5 mV) whereas NaVSp1AeCTD showed no activity (Figure 1B; Table S1). Exchanging the NaVAe1 coiled-coil into NaVAe1SpCTD to make an NaVAe1 chimera bearing the NaVSp1 neck and NaVAe1 coiled-coil, NaVAe1SpNeck, produced a channel having voltage-dependent gating that was essentially identical to NaVAe1SpCTD (V1/2 = 32.7 ± 2.0 and 38.8 ± 2.5 mV for NaVAe1SpNeck and NaVAe1SpCTD, respectively) (Figures 1C and 1G; Table S1). Substitution of the NaVSp1 neck into NaVSp1AeCTD produced a NaVSp1 chimera having the NaVAe1 coiled-coil, NaVSp1AeCC that displayed voltage-dependent gating identical to NaVSp1 (V1/2 = 26.1 ± 1.0 and 28.9 ± 1.3 mV, for NaVSp1AeCC and NaVSp1 respectively) (Figures 1C and 1H; Table S1). Taken together, these results demonstrate that coiled-coil identity has minimal functional effects, and the neck is the principal source of the differences in NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 voltage-dependent behaviors. Although the coiled-coil did not influence channel voltage-dependent properties, it seemed possible that its ability to constrain the neck C-terminal end might be important for the neck to affect gating. Therefore, we examined NaVAe1 and NaVSp1 mutants in which the neck was intact but the coiled-coil was deleted, NaVAe1ΔCC and NaVSp1ΔCC. Both yielded channels having a V1/2 indistinguishable from complete CTD deletion (19.1 ± 1.9 and 17.4 ± 1.7 mV for NaVAe1ΔCC and NaVAe1ΔCTD; −7.4 ± 2.8 and −9.7 ± 1.9 mV for NaVSp1ΔCC and NaVSp1ΔCC, respectively) (Figures 1D, 1G, and 1H; Table S1). Thus, together with the chimera results, these data indicate that the coiled-coil is required to constrain the C-terminal end of the neck, although its identity has minimal effect on function. Because we were unable to measure currents from NaVAe1 and NaVSp1AeCTD (Figures 1A and 1B), channels that have a wild-type NaVAe1 neck, we tested whether these proteins had plasma membrane expression to resolve whether the lack of activity came from an absence of surface expression or from channels that could not be opened. We placed an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag on NaVAe1, NaVSp1AeCTD, and NaVSp1 and used a surface biotinylation assay to assess plasma membrane expression. Streptavidin capture of the surface-biotinylated fraction followed by anti-HA antibody detection showed clear signals for all three channels. By contrast, this fraction had no signal for the intracellular control, GFP, when probed with an anti-GFP antibody. Thus, the non-functional channels, NaVAe1 and NaVSp1AeCTD, are indeed expressed on the plasma membrane (Figure 1I). Moreover, similar to the effects on NaVAe1 (Shaya et al., 2014Shaya D. Findeisen F. Abderemane-Ali F. Arrigoni C. Wong S. Nurva S.R. Loussouarn G. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure of a prokaryotic sodium channel pore reveals essential gating elements and an outer ion binding site common to eukaryotic channels.J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), inclusion of a triple-glycine substitution in the neck domain of NaVSp1AeCTD generated a functional channel (NaVSp1AeCTD/GGG V1/2 = 5.75 ± 2.6 mV; Figures 1F and 1H; Table S1). Together with the results of the chimeras and previous neck mutants (Shaya et al., 2014Shaya D. Findeisen F. Abderemane-Ali F. Arrigoni C. Wong S. Nurva S.R. Loussouarn G. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure of a prokaryotic sodium channel pore reveals essential gating elements and an outer ion binding site common to eukaryotic channels.J. Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 467-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that NaVAe1 and NaVSp1AeCTD fail to produce currents because the NaVAe1 neck produces a V1/2 that is outside of the measureable voltage range of our experiments. Our data demonstrate that the CTD functions as a regulatory module whose intrinsic properties enable it to exert diverse effects on BacNaV voltage-dependent gating. The neck influence is strong on voltage-dependent activation and contrasts with its modest effects on voltage-dependent inactivation (Figures 1, S1B, and S1C; Table S1), a process for which the pore domain is important (Pavlov et al., 2005Pavlov E.

https://openalex.org/W2277601536,"Human familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD) is characterized by low HDL, accumulation of an abnormal cholesterol-rich multilamellar particle called lipoprotein-X (LpX) in plasma, and renal disease. The aim of our study was to determine if LpX is nephrotoxic and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of FLD renal disease. We administered a synthetic LpX, nearly identical to endogenous LpX in its physical, chemical and biologic characteristics, to wild-type and Lcat-/- mice. Our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated an apoA-I and LCAT-dependent pathway for LpX conversion to HDL-like particles, which likely mediates normal plasma clearance of LpX. Plasma clearance of exogenous LpX was markedly delayed in Lcat-/- mice, which have low HDL, but only minimal amounts of endogenous LpX and do not spontaneously develop renal disease. Chronically administered exogenous LpX deposited in all renal glomerular cellular and matrical compartments of Lcat-/- mice, and induced proteinuria and nephrotoxic gene changes, as well as all of the hallmarks of FLD renal disease as assessed by histological, TEM, and SEM analyses. Extensive in vivo EM studies revealed LpX uptake by macropinocytosis into mouse glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and mesangial cells and delivery to lysosomes where it was degraded. Endocytosed LpX appeared to be degraded by both human podocyte and mesangial cell lysosomal PLA2 and induced podocyte secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-6 in vitro and renal Cxl10 expression in Lcat-/- mice. In conclusion, LpX is a nephrotoxic particle that in the absence of Lcat induces all of the histological and functional hallmarks of FLD and hence may serve as a biomarker for monitoring recombinant LCAT therapy. In addition, our studies suggest that LpX-induced loss of endothelial barrier function and release of cytokines by renal glomerular cells likely plays a role in the initiation and progression of FLD nephrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2289064549,"Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is an economically important virus disease affecting wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), but little is known about its effect on wine chemistry and sensory composition of wines. In this study, impacts of GLD on fruit yield, berry quality and wine chemistry and sensory features were investigated in a red wine grape cultivar planted in a commercial vineyard. Own-rooted Merlot vines showing GLD symptoms and tested positive for Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 and adjacent non-symptomatic vines that tested negative for the virus were compared during three consecutive seasons. Number and total weight of clusters per vine were significantly less in symptomatic relative to non-symptomatic vines. In contrast to previous studies, a time-course analysis of juice from grapes harvested at different stages of berry development from symptomatic and non-symptomatic vines indicated more prominent negative impacts of GLD on total soluble solids (TSS) and berry skin anthocyanins than in juice pH and titratable acidity. Differences in TSS between grapes of symptomatic and non-symptomatic vines were more pronounced after the onset of véraison, with significantly lower concentrations of TSS in grapes from symptomatic vines throughout berry ripening until harvest. Wines made from grapes of GLD-affected vines had significantly lower alcohol, polymeric pigments, and anthocyanins compared to corresponding wines from grapes of non-symptomatic vines. Sensory descriptive analysis of 2010 wines indicated significant differences in color, aroma and astringency between wines made from grapes harvested from GLD-affected and unaffected vines. The impacts of GLD on yield and fruit and wine quality traits were variable between the seasons, with greater impacts observed during a cooler season, suggesting the influence of host plant × environment interactions on overall impacts of the disease."

Recently, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to show that individual differences in gray matter (GM) volume relate to cognitive heterogeneity in PD. VBM does, however, not differentiate between cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area (SA), which might be independently affected in PD. We therefore re-analyzed our cohort using the surface-based method FreeSurfer, and investigated (i) CTh, SA, and (sub)cortical GM volume differences between 93 PD patients and 45 matched controls, and (ii) the relation between these structural measures and cognitive performance on six neuropsychological tasks within the PD group. We found cortical thinning in PD patients in the left pericalcarine gyrus, extending to cuneus, precuneus and lingual areas and left inferior parietal cortex, bilateral rostral middle frontal cortex, and right cuneus, and increased cortical surface area in the left pars triangularis. Within the PD group, we found negative correlations between (i) CTh of occipital areas and performance on a verbal memory task, (ii) SA and volume of the frontal cortex and visuospatial memory performance, and, (iii) volume of the right thalamus and scores on two verbal fluency tasks. Our primary findings illustrate that i) CTh and SA are differentially affected in PD, and ii) VBM and FreeSurfer yield non-overlapping results in an identical dataset. We argue that this discrepancy is due to technical differences and the subtlety of the PD-related structural changes."

The discovery of novel immunostimulatory molecules would enhance the repertoire of tools available for interrogating innate immune effector mechanisms, and provide additional venues for vaccine adjuvant development. A multiplexed, reporter gene-based high-throughput assay capable of detecting agonists of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, NOD1 and NOD2 was utilized in screening 123,943 compounds, in which amphotericin B (AmpB) and nystatin were identified as prominent hits. The polyene antifungal agents act as TLR2- and TLR4-agonists. The TLR4-stimulatory activity of AmpB was similar to that of monophosphoryl lipid A, suggestive of TRIF-biased signaling. The adjuvantic activity of AmpB, at a dose of 100 micrograms, was comparable to several other candidate adjuvants in rabbit models of immunization. These results point to its potential applicability as a safe and effective adjuvant for human vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2277265137,"The domestic dog shows a wide range of morphologies, that humans have selected for in the process of creating unique breeds. Recent studies have revealed correlations between changes in morphology and behaviour as reported by owners. For example, as height and weight decrease, many undesirable behaviours (non-social fear, hyperactivity and attention seeking) become more apparent. The current study aimed to explore more of these correlations, but this time used reports from trained observers. Phenotypic measurements were recorded from a range of common dog breeds (n = 45) and included cephalic index (CI: the ratio of skull width to skull length), bodyweight, height and sex. These data were then correlated with results from the Dog Mentality Assessment (DMA), which involves trained observers scoring a dog’s reaction to stimuli presented over 10 standardised subtests. Each subtest is designed to evoke a behavioural response. Backward elimination and weighted step-wise regression revealed that shorter dogs demonstrated more aggressive tendencies, reacting defensively toward both assistants dressed as ghosts (p = 0.045), and to a dummy (p = 0.008). Taller dogs were more affectionate when greeting and being handled by humans (p = 0.007, p = <0.001, respectively). Taller dogs were also more cooperative (p = <0.001), and playful (p = 0.001) with humans than shorter dogs. Heavier dogs were more inquisitive toward a dummy (p = 0.011), to the source of a metallic noise (p = 0.010) and to an assistant (p = 0.003). Heavier dogs were also more attentive to the ghosts (p = 0.013). In comparison, lighter dogs were cautious of a dummy (p = <0.001) and fearful of the sound of a gunshot (p = <0.001). Lighter dogs were also cautious of, and demonstrated prolonged fearfulness toward, the source of metallic noise (p = <0.001, p = <0.034, respectively). With a far larger sample and the advantage of third-party reporting (which overcomes potential owner bias), the current findings build on previous studies in this field, further supporting covariance between morphology and behaviour."

Likewise, bachelor's degree pupils (OR; 2, p = 0.045), urban area residents (OR; 2.44; p = 0.002) and pharmacy students (OR; 2.9, p<0.005) exhibited higher propensities of antibiotic self-use-notable classes include, b-lactams (45.9%) followed by macrolides (26.5%) and augmentin (28.94%), respectively. Surprisingly, pharmacy and non-pharmacy students had higher odds of using antibiotics in common cold (OR; 3.2, p<0.005) and pain (OR; 2.37, p = 0.015), respectively. Unlike non-pharmacy students, pharmacy students were likely to select alternative therapy, such as Joshanda (OR; 2.22, p = 0.011) and were well acquainted with antibiotic hazards, with 77% reduction in risk of antibiotics re-use. In conclusion, university students exhibited antibiotic self-prescribing trends in conditions that does not warrant their use, thus are irrational users. The pharmacy education confers very little benefit to rational self-prescribing practices among students, while non-pharmacy students are more vulnerable to repeated antibiotic usage. Thus, the educational and training modules should be designed for university students to disseminate targeted information regarding the potential hazards of antibiotic self-use and importance of consultation with qualified and registered medical doctor/pharmacist before starting with antibiotics."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with diverse regulatory functions during embryonic development, normal life, and disease in higher organisms. However, research on the role of lncRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and in particular heart failure is still in its infancy. The exceptionally well conserved nuclear lncRNA Metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat-1) is a regulator of mRNA splicing and highly expressed in the heart. Malat-1 modulates hypoxia-induced vessel growth, activates ERK/MAPK signaling, and scavenges the anti-hypertrophic microRNA-133. We therefore hypothesized that Malat-1 may act as regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and failure during cardiac pressure overload induced by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) in mice.


Results 
Absence of Malat-1 did not affect cardiac hypertrophy upon pressure overload: Heart weight to tibia length ratio significantly increased in WT mice (sham: 5.78±0.55, TAC 9.79±1.82 g/mm; p<0.001) but to a similar extend also in Malat-1 knockout (KO) mice (sham: 6.21±1.12, TAC 8.91±1.74 g/mm; p<0.01) with no significant difference between genotypes. As expected, TAC significantly reduced left ventricular fractional shortening in WT (sham: 38.81±6.53%, TAC: 23.14±11.99%; p<0.01) but to a comparable degree also in KO mice (sham: 37.01±4.19%, TAC: 25.98±9.75%; p<0.05). Histological hallmarks of myocardial remodeling, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased interstitial fibrosis, reduced capillary density, and immune cell infiltration, did not differ significantly between WT and KO mice after TAC. In line, the absence of Malat-1 did not significantly affect angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and overall remodeling. Above that, pressure overload by TAC significantly induced mRNA levels of the hypertrophy marker genes Nppa, Nppb and Acta1, to a similar extend in both genotypes. Alternative splicing of Ndrg2 after TAC was apparent in WT (isoform ratio; sham: 2.97±0.26, TAC 1.57±0.40; p<0.0001) and KO mice (sham: 3.64±0.37; TAC: 2.24±0.76; p<0.0001) and interestingly differed between genotypes both at baseline and after pressure overload (p<0.05 each).


Conclusion 
These findings confirm a role for the lncRNA Malat-1 in mRNA splicing. However, no critical role for Malat-1 was found in pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice, despite its reported role in vascularization, ERK/MAPK signaling, and regulation of miR-133."
https://openalex.org/W2274893553,"Withania somnifera Dunal, is one of the most commonly used medicinal plant in Ayurvedic and indigenous medicine traditionally owing to its therapeutic potential, because of major chemical constituents, withanolides. Withanolide biosynthesis requires the activities of several enzymes in vivo. Cycloartenol synthase (CAS) is an important enzyme in the withanolide biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing cyclization of 2, 3 oxidosqualene into cycloartenol. In the present study, we have cloned full-length WsCAS from Withania somnifera by homology-based PCR method. For gene function investigation, we constructed three RNAi gene-silencing constructs in backbone of RNAi vector pGSA and a full-length over-expression construct. These constructs were transformed in Agrobacterium strain GV3101 for plant transformation in W. somnifera. Molecular and metabolite analysis was performed in putative Withania transformants. The PCR and Southern blot results showed the genomic integration of these RNAi and overexpression construct(s) in Withania genome. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of WsCAS gene was considerably downregulated in stable transgenic silenced Withania lines compared with the non-transformed control and HPLC analysis showed that withanolide content was greatly reduced in silenced lines. Transgenic plants over expressing CAS gene displayed enhanced level of CAS transcript and withanolide content compared to non-transformed controls. This work is the first full proof report of functional validation of any metabolic pathway gene in W. somnifera at whole plant level as per our knowledge and it will be further useful to understand the regulatory role of different genes involved in the biosynthesis of withanolides."
https://openalex.org/W2282047860,"γδ T cells can either enhance or inhibit an adaptive immune response, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Given that CD73 is the main enzyme responsible for conversion of AMP into the immunosuppressive molecule adenosine, we investigated its role in the regulatory function of γδ T cells in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). We found that γδ T cells expressed different amounts of CD73 during the different stages of EAU and that low CD73 expression on γδ T cells correlated with enhanced Th17 response-promoting activity. Functional comparison of CD73-deficient and wild-type B6 (CD73+/+) mice showed that failure to express CD73 decreased both the enhancing and suppressive effects of γδ T cells on EAU. We also demonstrated that γδ T cells expressed different amounts of CD73 when activated by different pathways, which enabled them to either enhance or inhibit an adaptive immune response. Our results demonstrate that targeting CD73 expression on γδ T cells may allow us to manipulate their pro- or anti-inflammatory effect on Th17 responses."

Although bioinformatics analysis predicts that miR-126 can bind with the insulin receptor substrate-2(IRS-2) mRNA at the ""seed sequence"", but there are still no definitely reports to support it. In this study, we provided evidences that IRS-2 was one of the target genes of miR-126. And miR-126 has a proliferation inhibiting effects in INS-1 β cells, mainly through the suppression of IRS-2.The 3'-UTR of IRS-2 regulated by miR-126 was analyzed by the luciferase assay and western blot. Furthermore, proliferation of INS-1 β cells stimulated by glucose was tested, and the association between IRS-2 and miR-126 were analyzed.We found that mutation of only three of the 6 ""seed sequences"" can eliminate the inhibition effect of miR-126. In INS-1 β cells, administration of miR-126 suppresses the proliferation, together with the unbalanced down-regulation of IRS-2 and IRS-1. Over-expression of IRS-2 can reverse the proliferation effect of miR-126, while not of IRS-1. These results suggested that miR-126 inhibited the β-cell proliferation via the inhibition of IRS-2 instead of IRS-1.Additionally, we also found that high glucose and insulin could stimulate the rapid production of endogenous miR-126 within 6 hours, together with the short term suppression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 expression, and intensify the unbalanced expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2.IRS-2 was one of the targets of miR-126. MiR-126 inhibited the β-cell proliferation through IRS-2 instead of IRS-1. MiR-126 may take part in the glucose homeostasis both through its target IRS-2 and IRS-1.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in fine-tuning of the circadian system. However, little is known about the direct regulation of the clock genes by specific miRNAs. In this study, we found that miR-27b-3p exhibits rhythmic expression in the metabolic tissues of the mice subjected to constant darkness. MiR-27b-3p's expression is induced in livers of unfed and ob/ob mice. In addition, the oscillation phases of miR-27b-3p can be reversed by restricted feeding, suggesting a role of peripheral clock in regulating its rhythmicity. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (also known as Bmal1) may be a direct target of miR-27b-3p. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-27b-3p suppressed Bmal1 3' UTR activity in a dose-dependent manner, and mutagenesis of their binding site abolished this suppression. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-27b-3p dose-dependently reduced the protein expression levels of BMAL1 and impaired the endogenous BMAL1 and gluconeogenic protein rhythmicity. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-27b-3p plays an important role in the posttranscriptional regulation of BMAL1 protein in the liver. MiR-27b-3p may serve as a novel node to integrate the circadian clock and energy metabolism.-Zhang, W., Wang, P., Chen, S., Zhang, Z., Liang, T., Liu, C.

The 126 strains were studied using a polyphasic approach that included phenotypic characterizations and phylogenetic multilocus sequence analysis. The pathogenicity of these strains against 3 cultivars of citrus is demonstrated in greenhouse and field studies. The strains were initially grouped phenotypically and by their partial rpoD gene sequences into 11 coherent groups in the Pseudomonas fluorescens phylogenetic lineage. Fifty-three strains that are representatives of the 11 groups were selected and analyzed by partial sequencing of their 16S rRNA and gyrB genes. The individual and concatenated partial sequences of the three genes were used to construct the corresponding phylogenetic trees. The majority of the strains were identified at the species level: P. lurida (5 strains), P. monteilii (2 strains), P. moraviensis (1 strain), P. orientalis (16 strains), P. simiae (7 strains), P. syringae (46 strains, distributed phylogenetically in at least 5 pathovars), and P. viridiflava (2 strains). This is the first report of pathogenicity on citrus of P. orientalis, P. simiae, P. lurida, P. moraviensis and P. monteilii strains. The remaining 47 strains that could not be identified at the species level are considered representatives of at least 5 putative novel Pseudomonas species that are not yet described."

Serum biochemical profiles of dogs in which all measurements fell within the existing reference intervals were retrieved from a large veterinary database. Serum biochemical profiles from 3045 dogs were retrieved, of which 1495 had an accompanying normal glucose concentration. Sixty pure breeds plus a mixed breed control group were represented by at least 10 individuals. All analytes, except for sodium, chloride and glucose, showed variation with age.

Neutering status significantly impacted all analytes except albumin, sodium, calcium, urea, and glucose. Principal component analysis of serum biochemical data revealed 36 pure breeds with distinctive phenotypes. Furthermore, comparative analysis identified 23 breeds with significant differences from the mixed breed group in all biochemical analytes except urea and glucose. Eighteen breeds were identified by both principal component and comparative analysis. Tentative reference intervals were generated for breeds with a distinctive phenotype identified by comparative analysis and represented by at least 120 individuals.

Patients Adult UC patients receiving ≥240mg during adalimumab treatment induction, subsequently maintained on adalimumab. Outcomes Frequency and pattern of adalimumab use and dose escalation during maintenance treatment and associated healthcare costs (prescriptions and hospital visits). Results 191 UC patients completed adalimumab treatment induction. 83 (43.46%) dose escalated during maintenance treatment by ≥100% (equivalent to weekly dosing) (median time to dose escalation: 139 days). 56 patients (67.47%) subsequently de-escalated by ≥50% (median time to dose de-escalation: 21 days). Mean all-cause healthcare costs for all patients ≤12 months of index were £13,892. Dose escalators incurred greater mean healthcare costs than non-escalators ≤12 months of index (£14,596 vs. £13,351). Prescriptions accounted for 96.49% of UC-related healthcare costs (£11,090 of £11,494 in all patients). Conclusions Within the cohort, 43.46% of UC patients escalated their adalimumab dose by ≥100% and incurred greater costs than non-escalators. The apparent underestimation of adalimumab dose escalation in previous studies may have resulted in underestimated costs in healthcare systems."

We examined variants in all functional HLA-DR beta genes in RA and SLE patients and controls, down to the amino-acid level, to better understand disease association with the HLA-DR locus. To this end, we improved an existing HLA reference panel to impute variants in all protein-coding HLA-DR beta genes. Using the reference panel, HLA variants were inferred from high-density SNP data of 9,271 RA-control subjects and 5,342 SLE-control subjects. Disease association tests were performed by logistic regression and log-likelihood ratio tests. After imputation using the newly constructed HLA reference panel and statistical analysis, we observed that HLA-DRB1 variants better accounted for the association between MHC and susceptibility to RA and SLE than did the other three HLA-DRB variants. Moreover, there were no secondary effects in HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4, or HLA-DRB5 in RA or SLE. Of all the HLA-DR beta chain paralogs, those encoded by HLA-DRB1 solely or dominantly influence susceptibility to RA and SLE."

The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms."

Low lean body mass index was seen in 32% (95% CI: 22-44). Obesity prevalence as assessed from fat mass index was 43% (95% CI: 32-55). Coexistence of low lean body mass index and obesity was seen in 10% (95% CI: 5-19). The prevalence of protein-energy wasting and obesity varied considerably, depending on nutritional assessment methodology.Our data indicate that protein-energy wasting is uncommon, whereas low lean body mass index and obesity are frequent conditions among patients in maintenance dialysis. A focus on how to increase and preserve lean body mass in dialysis patients is suggested in the future. In order to clearly distinguish between shortage, sufficiency and abundance of protein and/or fat deposits in maintenance dialysis patients, we suggest the simple measurements of lean body mass index and fat mass index."
https://openalex.org/W2275719054,"Introduction Pulmonary vascular endothelial activation has been implicated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), yet little is known about the presence and role of endothelial activation markers in the alveolar space in ARDS. We hypothesized that endothelial activation biomarkers would be differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS compared with healthy volunteers, and that biomarker concentrations would be associated with ARDS severity. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from 26 intubated patients with ARDS undergoing evaluation for clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia and five healthy volunteers. Patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage a median of five days after intubation. Healthy volunteers also underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Endothelial activation biomarkers (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [sVCAM-1], soluble endothelial selectin [sESEL], angiopoietin-1 [Ang-1] and angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2]) were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia was confirmed with microbiologic culture data. Results Patients with ARDS had significantly higher median sVCAM-1 concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with healthy volunteers (985 vs 119 pg/mL, p = 0.03). Additionally, there was a trend toward greater bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sVCAM-1 concentrations among patients with moderate/severe compared to mild ARDS (1395 vs 209 pg/mL, p = 0.06). We did not detect significant differences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of sESEL, Ang-1 or Ang-2 between patients with ARDS and healthy volunteers. Median bronchoalveolar lavage fluid biomarker levels did not differ between patients with and without microbiologically-confirmed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Conclusions sVCAM-1 concentrations were significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ARDS compared to healthy controls, and tended to be higher in moderate/severe ARDS compared to mild ARDS. Our findings add to the growing evidence supporting the concept that endothelial activation plays an important mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Further studies are necessary to characterize the role and/or clinical significance of sVCAM-1 and other endothelial activation markers present in the alveolar space in ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W2284420391,"Epilepsy is not a regular topic in many countries' schools. Thus many people harbor misconceptions about people suffering from this disease. It was our aim to a) examine what grade ten students know and believe about epilepsy, and b) to develop and test a teaching unit to improve their knowledge and attitude. The test group comprised eight grade ten classes from six different Austrian high schools (54 girls and 51 boys aged 14-17), the control group (no intervention) five grade ten classes from the same schools (26 girls and 37 boys aged 14-17). The teaching unit consisted of three 45-min lessons using different methods and material. Changes in knowledge about and attitude towards epilepsy as a result of the intervention were psychometrically assessed in a pre-test intervention post-test design (along with a follow-up assessment two months after the intervention) by means of a questionnaire capturing different facets of epilepsy-related knowledge and attitude. Across all knowledge/attitude domains, students of the test group had a significantly improved knowledge about and a more positive attitude towards epilepsy and people suffering from it after the teaching unit. However, starting levels were different between the five knowledge/attitude domains tested. Medical background knowledge was lowest and consequently associated with the highest increase after the intervention. This study shows that epilepsy-related knowledge of many grade ten high school students is fragmentary and that some harbor beliefs and attitudes which require improvement. Our comprehensive but concise teaching unit significantly increased knowledge about epilepsy and positively influenced attitude towards individuals with epilepsy. Thus we recommend implementing this unit into regular school curricula."
https://openalex.org/W2284864226,"A goal of biomechanics and motor control is to understand the design of the human musculoskeletal system. Here we investigated human functional morphology by making predictions about the muscle volume distribution that is optimal for a specific motor task. We examined a well-studied and relatively simple human movement, vertical jumping. We investigated how high a human could jump if muscle volume were optimized for jumping, and determined how the optimal parameters improve performance. We used a four-link inverted pendulum model of human vertical jumping actuated by Hill-type muscles, that well-approximates skilled human performance. We optimized muscle volume by allowing the cross-sectional area and muscle fiber optimum length to be changed for each muscle, while maintaining constant total muscle volume. We observed, perhaps surprisingly, that the reference model, based on human anthropometric data, is relatively good for vertical jumping; it achieves 90% of the jump height predicted by a model with muscles designed specifically for jumping. Alteration of cross-sectional areas-which determine the maximum force deliverable by the muscles-constitutes the majority of improvement to jump height. The optimal distribution results in large vastus, gastrocnemius and hamstrings muscles that deliver more work, while producing a kinematic pattern essentially identical to the reference model. Work output is increased by removing muscle from rectus femoris, which cannot do work on the skeleton given its moment arm at the hip and the joint excursions during push-off. The gluteus composes a disproportionate amount of muscle volume and jump height is improved by moving it to other muscles. This approach represents a way to test hypotheses about optimal human functional morphology. Future studies may extend this approach to address other morphological questions in ethological tasks such as locomotion, and feature other sets of parameters such as properties of the skeletal segments."

https://openalex.org/W2287971490,"Background Detailed spatial location information is important in accurately estimating personal exposure to air pollution. Global Position System (GPS) has been widely used in tracking personal paths and activities. Previous researchers have developed time-activity classification models based on GPS data, most of them were developed for specific regions. An adaptive model for time-location classification can be widely applied to air pollution studies that use GPS to track individual level time-activity patterns. Methods Time-activity data were collected for seven days using GPS loggers and accelerometers from thirteen adult participants from Southern California under free living conditions. We developed an automated model based on random forests to classify major time-activity patterns (i.e. indoor, outdoor-static, outdoor-walking, and in-vehicle travel). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the contribution of the accelerometer data and the supplemental spatial data (i.e. roadway and tax parcel data) to the accuracy of time-activity classification. Our model was evaluated using both leave-one-fold-out and leave-one-subject-out methods. Results Maximum speeds in averaging time intervals of 7 and 5 minutes, and distance to primary highways with limited access were found to be the three most important variables in the classification model. Leave-one-fold-out cross-validation showed an overall accuracy of 99.71%. Sensitivities varied from 84.62% (outdoor walking) to 99.90% (indoor). Specificities varied from 96.33% (indoor) to 99.98% (outdoor static). The exclusion of accelerometer and ambient light sensor variables caused a slight loss in sensitivity for outdoor walking, but little loss in overall accuracy. However, leave-one-subject-out cross-validation showed considerable loss in sensitivity for outdoor static and outdoor walking conditions. Conclusions The random forests classification model can achieve high accuracy for the four major time-activity categories. The model also performed well with just GPS, road and tax parcel data. However, caution is warranted when generalizing the model developed from a small number of subjects to other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2285002350,"Incidental thyroid lesions are frequently found on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (CE-MR) angiography. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas detected by CE-MR angiography and to evaluate their clinical significance by correlation with ultrasound (US) and cytopathological results.We retrospectively reviewed 3,299 consecutive CE-MR angiography examinations performed at our institution between January 2010 and March 2013. Two radiologists evaluated the CE-MR angiography imaging in consensus regarding the presence, location, and vascularity of thyroid incidentaloma. We correlated these findings with follow-up US and cytopathologic results.The prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas detected by CE-MR angiography was 4.6% (152/3,299 patients). CE-MR angiography showed hypervascularity in 86.8% (145/167), isovascularity in 8.4% (14/167), and hypovascularity in 4.8% (8/167) of thyroid nodules compared to vascularity of thyroid parenchyma. Among the patients with thyroid incidentaloma, 34 patients (22.4%) were followed by US examination, and all 36 nodules on CE-MR angiography were detected on follow-up US. Of these nodules, 9 (25%) nodules were classified as probably benign, 26 (72.2%) as indeterminate, and 1 (2.8%) as suspicious malignant nodule. Among the 16 nodules with available cytopathologic results, 12 nodules were benign, 2 nodules were follicular neoplasm, and 2 nodules showed non-diagnostic results.Incidental thyroid nodules were found in 4.6% of CE-MR angiography examinations. Because the high incidence of indeterminate US feature among thyroid incidentaloma, when a thyroid incidentaloma is detected on CE-MR angiography, further evaluation with US should be performed."
https://openalex.org/W2275464418,"Weak intracellular penetration of antibiotics makes some infections difficult to treat. The Trojan horse strategy for targeted drug delivery is among the interesting routes being explored to overcome this therapeutic difficulty. Chlamydia trachomatis, as an obligate intracellular human pathogen, is responsible for both trachoma and sexually transmitted diseases. Chlamydia develops in a vacuole and is therefore protected by four membranes (plasma membrane, bacterial inclusion membrane, and bacterial membranes). In this work, the iron-transport protein, human serum-transferrin, was used as a Trojan horse for antibiotic delivery into the bacterial vacuole. Amoxicillin was grafted onto transferrin. The transferrin-amoxicillin construct was characterized by mass spectrometry and absorption spectroscopy. Its affinity for transferrin receptor 1, determined by fluorescence emission titration [KaffTf-amox = (1.3 ± 1.0) x 108], is very close to that of transferrin [4.3 x 108]. Transmission electron and confocal microscopies showed a co-localization of transferrin with the bacteria in the vacuole and were also used to evaluate the antibiotic capability of the construct. It is significantly more effective than amoxicillin alone. These promising results demonstrate targeted delivery of amoxicillin to suppress Chlamydia and are of interest for Chlamydiaceae and maybe other intracellular bacteria therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2275771993,"With increasing emphasis on expanding home-based dialysis, there is a need to understand adherence outcomes. This study set out to examine the prevalence and predictors of nonadherence among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A cross sectional sample of 201 peritoneal dialysis patients recruited between 2010–2011 from Singapore General Hospital completed measures of quality of life, medication beliefs, self-efficacy and emotional distress. Nonadherence rates were high; 18% for dialysis, 46% for medication and 78% for diet. Intentional nonadherence was more common for dialysis (p = .03), whereas unintentional nonadherence was more common for medication (p = .002). Multivariate models indicated significant associations for higher education (intermediate vs low OR = 3.18, high vs low OR = 4.70), lower environment quality of life (OR = 0.79), dialysis self-efficacy (OR = 0.80) with dialysis nonadherence; higher education (OR = 2.22), self-care peritoneal dialysis (OR = 3.10), perceived necessity vs concerns over medication (OR = 0.90), self-efficacy (OR = 0.76) with nonadherence to medication. The odds for nonadherence to diet were higher among patients who were younger (OR = 0.96), of Chinese ethnicity (OR = 2.99) and those reporting better physical health (OR = 1.30) and lower self-efficacy (OR = 0.49). Nonadherence is common in peritoneal dialysis. Self-efficacy and beliefs about medication are promising targets for interventions designed to improve adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2283141946,"A large proportion of mutants with altered pigment features have been obtained via exposure to heavy-ion beams, a technique that is efficient for trait improvement in the breeding of plants and algae. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which the photosynthetic pigments are altered by heavy-ion irradiation. In our study, the photosynthetic characteristics of progenies from carbon-ion irradiated Selenastrum capricornutum were investigated. Five progenies deficient in chlorophyll a were isolated after carbon-ion exposure. Photosynthetic characteristics, photoprotection capacity and gene expression of the light-harvesting complex in these progenies were further characterized by the measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, ФPSII, NPQ, ETR), the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle, the amount of lutein and quantitative real-time PCR. High maximum quantum yield of photosystem II at day 10 and high thermal dissipation ability were observed in progenies #23 and #37 under normal culture condition. Progenies #18, #19 and #20 showed stronger resistance against high levels of light steps than the control group (612-1077 μmol photons m -2 s -1, p< 0.05). The progenies #20 and #23 exhibited strong photoprotection by thermal dissipation and quenching of 3Chl* after 24 h of high light treatment. The mRNA levels of Lhcb5, Lhcbm5 and Lhcbm1 of the light-harvesting complex revealed markedly differential expression in the five progenies irradiated by carbon-ion beams. This work indicates that photosynthetic efficiency, photoprotection ability and the expression of light-harvesting antennae in unicellular green algae can be markedly influenced by irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report on changes in the photosynthetic pigments of green algae after treatment with carbon-ion beams."
https://openalex.org/W2287600415,"Orientation distribution functions (ODFs) are widely used to resolve fiber crossing problems in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). The characteristics of the ODFs are often assessed using a visual criterion, although the use of objective criteria is also reported, which are directly borrowed from classic signal and image processing theory because they are intuitive and simple to compute. However, they are not always pertinent for the characterization of ODFs. We propose a more general paradigm for assessing the characteristics of ODFs. The idea consists in regarding an ODF as a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, projecting the 3D point cloud onto an angle-distance map, constructing an angle-distance matrix, and calculating metrics such as length ratio, separability, and uncertainty. The results from both simulated and real data show that the proposed metrics allow for the assessment of the characteristics of ODFs in a quantitative and relatively complete manner."
