https://openalex.org/W2030692398,"One of the common neurological complications in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a subacute encephalopathy with progressive dementia. By using the techniques of cocultivation for virus isolation, in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy, the identity of an important cell type that supports replication of the AIDS retrovirus in brain tissue was determined in two affected individuals. These cells were mononucleated and multinucleated macrophages that actively synthesized viral RNA and produced progeny virions in the brains of the patients. Infected brain macrophages may serve as a reservoir for virus and as a vehicle for viral dissemination in the infected host."
https://openalex.org/W1506640894,"Novel sulfated glucuronic acid-containing glycolipids have been identified in the nervous system. These glycolipids are highly antigenic and share antigenic determinants with several nervous system glycoproteins, such as neural cell adhesion molecules, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and ependymins. The structure of the major antigenic glycolipid from human peripheral nerve was determined by chemical and enzymatic degradation, incorporation studies, sugar analysis after permethylation, pertrimethylsilylation, and gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques as well as fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of the native antigen. The following structure was established for the major antigenic glycolipid. sulfate-3-GlcA beta(1---3)Gal beta(1----4)GlcNAc beta(1----3)Gal beta(1----4)Glc beta(1----1)-ceramide. The major fatty acids in the ceramide were 18:0, 18:1, 24:0, and 24:1, with C18-sphingenine as the long chain base."
https://openalex.org/W2039372097,"Insulin action may involve the intracellular generation of low molecular weight substances that modulate certain key enzymes. The production of two substances that regulate the activity of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase was evaluated in cultured myocytes by incorporation of radiolabeled precursors. Insulin caused the rapid hydrolysis of a chemically undefined membrane glycolipid, resulting in the production of two related complex carbohydrates as well as diacylglycerol. Both the glycolipid precursor and the aqueous products were monitored by labeling with radioactive inositol and glucosamine. Depletion of the labeled precursor and the appearance of labeled water-soluble products and diacylglycerol occurred within 30 seconds after hormone treatment and was followed by rapid resynthesis of the precursor. The aqueous products that were radioactively labeled appeared chromatographically and electrophoretically identical to phosphodiesterase modulating activities produced by insulin from the same cells. The purified radiolabeled and bioactive substances had similar chemical properties. Hydrolysis of the glycolipid precursor and subsequent generation of products could be reproduced by incubation of extracted lipids with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These studies suggest that insulin stimulates an endogenous, selective phospholipase C activity that hydrolyzes a novel glycolipid, resulting in the generation of a complex carbohydrate-phosphate substance containing inositol and glucosamine that may mediate some of the actions of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1985143680,"When B lymphocytes from normal human peripheral blood were incubated for 1 hour with the retrovirus that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the B cells showed marked proliferation and differentiation. Proliferative responses to the virus peaked on day 4 and appeared to be independent of accessory cells. This finding was repeated with three separate viral isolates, one of which was from a patient from Zaire. The magnitude of the observed responses was comparable to that seen with standard polyclonal B-cell activators. This phenomenon may be at least partially responsible for the polyclonal B-cell activation seen in patients with AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1608877318,"The morphogenesis of lambda proheads is governed by the products of at least four bacteriophage-coded genes (B, C, E and Nu3) and two host-coded genes (groES (mopB) and groEL (mopA)). Earlier genetic experiments indicated that the phenotypes of some of the groES- mutations could be suppressed by mutations in the groEL gene, suggesting an interaction between the two groE proteins in vivo (Tilly, K., and Georgopoulos, C. P. (1982) J. Bacteriol. 149, 1082-1088). The Mr 15,000 groES protein was overproduced and purified to homogeneity by monitoring its presence after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both gel filtration on an AcA34 sizing column and glycerol gradient centrifugation indicate that the groES protein possesses an oligomeric structure of Mr 80,000. In agreement, electron microscopic pictures of the purified groES protein show that it possesses a symmetrical ring-like structure. The sequence of the first five amino acids and the overall composition of the purified protein match those predicted by the nucleotide sequence of the groES gene. The following results implicate a physical association between the groES and groEL proteins in vitro. The groES protein inhibits the weak ATPase activity of the groEL protein, with a maximal effect seen at a 1:1 molar ratio; the two proteins cosediment during glycerol gradient centrifugation in the presence of ATP and Mg2+; and the groES protein binds specifically to a groEL-affinity column. These results help explain why mutations in either of the groE genes exhibit similar phenotypes with respect to both lambda and bacterial growth."
https://openalex.org/W2069118865,"Kinetic experiments have conclusively shown that electron transfer can take place over large distances (greater than 10 angstroms) through protein interiors. Current research focuses on the elucidation of the factors that determine the rates of long-range electron-transfer reactions in modified proteins and protein complexes. Factors receiving experimental and theoretical attention include the donor-acceptor distance, changes in geometry of the donor and acceptor upon electron transfer, and the thermodynamic driving force. Recent experimental work on heme proteins indicates that the electron-transfer rate falls off exponentially with donor-acceptor distance at long range. The rate is greatly enhanced in proteins in which the structural changes accompanying electron transfer are very small."
https://openalex.org/W1511221661,"In a previous study, we found that atriopeptin I was much weaker (EC50 greater than 500 nM) than atrial natriuretic factor (ANF-(8-33)) (EC50 = 0.3 nM) at increasing cyclic GMP in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we used the cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate to investigate whether the differences in activity were due to the presence of multiple ANF receptors. When 98% of the ANF-binding sites on endothelial cells were occupied by tyrosine-atriopeptin I after cross-linking, there was no difference in the concentration-response curve to ANF-(8-33) with regard to cyclic GMP accumulation. In contrast, when 96% of the binding sites were occupied by cross-linked ANF-(8-33), a 60% decrease in the maximal cyclic GMP response was observed after the readdition of ANF-(8-33). These results suggest that ANF-(8-33) is binding to an additional site that atriopeptin I does not effectively bind. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-ANF to intact endothelial cells resulted in the labeling of two sites of Mr approximately 66,000 and approximately 130,000. Approximately 94% of the 125I-ANF binding sites had an Mr approximately 66,000. Labeling of this site was inhibited by both tyrosine-atriopeptin I (KI = 0.9 nM) and ANF-(8-33) (KI = 0.09 nM). Although 0.1 microM tyrosine-atriopeptin (AP I) inhibited labeling of the 66,000-dalton site to nearly the same degree as ANF-(8-33), it produced only a 4-fold increase in cyclic GMP compared to a 400-fold increase with ANF-(8-33). These results suggest that the 66,000-dalton site is not coupled to guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP formation. Tyrosine-AP I (KI greater than 10 nM) was much weaker at competing for the 130,000-dalton site than ANF-(8-33) (KI = 0.075 nM). Because the EC50 for cyclic GMP stimulation for tyrosine-AP I (greater than 100 nM) and ANF-(8-33) (0.4 nM) is closer to the KI values for the 130,000-dalton protein, this site probably mediates the marked stimulation of cyclic GMP. Our results demonstrate that endothelial cells contain two binding sites for ANF-(8-33) and suggest that only the less abundant site (Mr approximately 130,000) is the receptor coupled to the activation of guanylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1479851678,"In order to gain insight into the mechanisms that determine the selectivity of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway, the protein substrate binding site of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system was identified and examined. Previous studies had shown that the ligase system consists of three components: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-carrier protein (E2), and a third enzyme, E3, the mode of action of which has not been defined. E3 from rabbit reticulocytes was further purified by a combination of affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, and gel filtration procedures. A 180-kDa protein was identified as the subunit of E3. Two independent methods indicate that E3 has the protein binding site of the ubiquitin ligase system. These are the chemical cross-linking of 125I-labeled proteins to the E3 subunit and the functional conversion of enzyme-bound labeled proteins to ubiquitin conjugates in pulse-chase experiments. The trapping of E3-bound protein for labeled product formation was allowed by the slow dissociation of E3 X protein complex. The specificity of binding of different proteins to E3, examined by both methods, showed a direct correlation with their susceptibility to degradation by the ubiquitin system. Proteins with free alpha-NH2 groups, which are good substrates, bind better to E3 than corresponding proteins with blocked NH2 termini, which are not substrates. Oxidation of methionine residues to sulfoxide derivatives greatly increases the susceptibility of some proteins to ligation with ubiquitin, with a corresponding increase in their binding to E3. However, a protein derivative which was subjected to both amino group modification and oxidation binds strongly to the enzyme, even though it cannot be ligated to ubiquitin. It thus seems that the substrate binding site of E3 participates in determining the specificity of proteins that enter the ubiquitin pathway of protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1556605629,"To identify nuclear functions required for cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis in yeast, recessive nuclear mutants that are deficient in cytochrome c oxidase were characterized. In complementation studies, 55 independently isolated mutants were placed into 34 complementation groups. Analysis of the content of cytochrome c oxidase subunits in each mutant permitted the definition of three phenotypic classes. One class contains three complementation groups whose strains carry mutations in the COX4, COX5a, or COX9 genes. These genes encode subunits IV, Va, and VIIa of cytochrome c oxidase, respectively. Mutations in each of these structural genes appear to affect the levels of the other eight subunits, albeit in different ways. A second class contains nuclear mutants that are defective in synthesis of a specific mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit (I, II, or III) or in both cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and apocytochrome b. These mutants fall into 17 complementation groups. The third class is represented by mutants in 14 complementation groups. These strains contain near normal amounts of all cytochrome c oxidase subunits examined and therefore are likely to be defective at some step in holoenzyme assembly. The large number of complementation groups represented by the second and third phenotypic classes suggest that both the expression of the structural genes encoding the nine polypeptide subunits of cytochrome c oxidase and the assembly of these subunits into a functional holoenzyme require the products of many nuclear genes."
https://openalex.org/W1487416285,"The two-step isomerization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) to Ins-1,3,4-P3 via the intermediate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-P4) was studied in intact RINm5F cells and in subcellular fractions. Muscarinic stimulation with carbamylcholine leads to a rapid (2 s) rise in both Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-P4, whereas Ins-1,3,4-P3 was produced only after a lag of at least 5 s. In cells with depleted Ca2+ stores, the rise in Ins-1,4,5-P3 was nearly tripled, and that of Ins-1,3,4-P3 markedly diminished as compared to control cells. Raising the free Ca2+ concentration from 10(-7) to 10(-5) M increased inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-3-kinase activity in cytosolic fractions by 2 1/2-fold (EC50 for Ca2+ approximately 0.8 microM) but had no effect on the activity of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-5-phosphomonoesterase. At 10(-7) M Ca2+ these two enzymes displayed comparable activity when assayed at concentrations of Ins-1,4,5-P3 occurring in stimulated cells; however, at 10(-5) M Ca2+, kinase activity predominates. These results suggest that Ins-1,4,5-P3 counter-regulates its own levels through the activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and that the increase in [Ca2+]i may account for the transience of the rise in Ins-1,4,5-P3 seen during muscarinic stimulation of RINm5F cells."
https://openalex.org/W1484971105,"A ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1) complex has been purified from the plasma membrane of aerobically grown Paracoccus denitrificans by extraction with dodecyl maltoside and ion exchange chromatography of the extract. The purified complex contains two spectrally and thermodynamically distinct b cytochromes, cytochrome c1, and a Rieske-type iron-sulfur protein. Optical spectra indicate absorption peaks at 553 nm for cytochrome c1 and at 560 and 566 nm for the high and low potential hemes of cytochrome b. The spectrum of cytochrome b560 is shifted to longer wavelength by antimycin. The Paracoccus bc1 complex consists of only three polypeptide subunits. On the basis of their relative electrophoretic mobilities, these have apparent molecular masses of 62, 39, and 20 kDa. The 62- and 39-kDa subunits have been identified as cytochromes c1 and b, respectively. The 20-kDa subunit is assumed to be the Rieske-type iron-sulfur protein on the basis of its molecular weight and the presence of an EPR-detectable signal typical of this iron-sulfur protein in the three-subunit complex. The Paracoccus bc1 complex catalyzes reduction of cytochrome c by ubiquinol with a turnover of 470 s-1. This activity is inhibited by antimycin, myxothiazol, stigmatellin, and hydroxyquinone analogues of ubiquinone, all of which inhibit electron transfer in the cytochrome bc1 complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The electron transfer functions of the Paracoccus complex thus appear to be similar, and possibly identical, to those of the bc1 complex of eukaryotic mitochondria. The Paracoccus bc1 complex has the simplest subunit composition and one of the highest turnover numbers of any bc1 complex isolated from any species to date. These properties suggest that the structural requirements for electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c are met by a small number of peptides and that the extra peptides occurring in the mitochondrial bc1 complexes serve some other function(s), possibly in biogenesis or insertion of the complex into that organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1516730660,"Elevated plasma levels of factors with cardiac glycoside-like activity have been implicated in the response to volume expansion in animals and in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases. We recently described four fractions (IR1, EI1, EI2, EI3) from normal human plasma that inhibit NaK-ATPase, displace ouabain from the enzyme, and exhibit digoxin-like immunoreactivity (Kelly, R. A., O'Hara, D. S., Canessa, M. L., Mitch, W. E., and Smith, T. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11396-11405). In this report, we identify the active component of these plasma fractions as long-chain nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and lysophospholipids. These lipids were present in fractions EI1, EI2, and EI3 in quantities sufficient to account for all of the NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity. The digoxin-like immunoreactivity in fraction IR1 could be attributed to hydrocortisone and other endogenous steroids. To explore the nature of the lipid-NaK-ATPase interactions, we examined the effects of various ATP or sodium concentrations on the NaK-ATPase activity measured in the presence of NEFA. Varying sodium did not affect the inhibition of NaK-ATPase by linoleic acid. At less than 0.15 mM ATP, linoleic acid stimulated NaK-ATPase, but at higher ATP concentrations, the enzyme was progressively inhibited. In summary, NEFA and lysophospholipids, at levels similar to those occurring in human plasma, may account for all of the NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity observed in human plasma fractions. These lipids probably do not directly regulate NaK-ATPase in vivo under normal physiologic conditions, but may alter the sodium pump in disease states characterized by abnormalities in lipid metabolism or plasma protein binding."
https://openalex.org/W1523578031,"The role of Ca2+ in the adrenergic stimulation of pinealocyte cAMP and cGMP was investigated. In this tissue alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation, which by itself is without effect, potentiates beta 1-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP and cGMP 30- to 100-fold. The present results indicate that chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or inhibition of Ca2+ influx with inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers (La3+, Co2+, Mn2+) markedly reduces the cyclic nucleotide response to norepinephrine, a mixed alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic agonist, but not to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. In addition, the potentiating effects of alpha 1-adrenergic agonists were mimicked by agents which elevate cytosolic Ca2+, including K+ (EC50 = 2 X 10(-2) M), ouabain (EC50 = 2 X 10(-6) M), ionomycin (EC50 = 3 X 10(-6) M), and A23187 (EC50 = 2 X 10(-6) M); each potentiated the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation but had no effect alone. Together these results indicate that an alpha 1-adrenoceptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx is essential for norepinephrine to increase pinealocyte cAMP and cGMP."
https://openalex.org/W1602276313,"Extracellular release of superoxide anion (O-2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during the respiratory burst of porcine and human neutrophils was studied by using diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase as a trapping agent for these oxygen derivatives. The method permitted simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and formation of both O-2 and H2O2 in a single reaction mixture. When neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate in the presence of the heme-substituted peroxidase, a rapid accumulation of compound III, a complex of the enzyme with O-2, was observed accompanying an increase in oxygen consumption. During the process, amounts of compound III formed and oxygen consumed were stoichiometric, and no compound II, an indicator of H2O2 formation, was observed. These results establish that neutrophils stimulated with the phorbol ester produce exclusively O-2 as the primary oxygen metabolite and release it into the extracellular medium. When a limited amount of opsonized zymosan was used as the stimulus, compound III formation was also observed but it ceased at an early stage of oxygen consumption. When a sufficient amount of azide was included in the system, however, formation of compound II was noted in the later stage of oxygen consumption. The findings suggest that O-2, formed during phagocytosis, is converted to H2O2 within phagosomes and then diffuses out into the extracellular medium when its decomposition by catalase and/or peroxidases is blocked by azide."
https://openalex.org/W1583540770,"The cytochrome a and a3 sites in uninhibited, detergent-solubilized cytochrome c oxidase have been studied under a wide range of conditions using thin-layer spectroelectrochemistry. The observed absorbance changes at the alpha and Soret absorbance maxima have been used together to estimate the extents of reduction of cytochromes a and a3, using the absorbance properties of these cytochromes deduced from previous measurements employing ligand inhibition of cytochrome a3. The resulting Nernst plots, combined with the results of parallel studies on the carbon monoxide-inhibited enzyme (Ellis, W. R., Jr., Wang, H., Blair, D. F., Gray, H. B., and Chan, S. I. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 161-167; Wang, H., Blair, D. F., Ellis, W. R., Jr., Gray, H. B., and Chan, S. I. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 167-171), indicate that the cytochrome a site participates in anticooperative thermodynamic interactions which involve all three of the other metal sites in the protein. Using an analysis which resolves the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the cytochromes from the effects of the intersite interactions, the pH, temperature, and ionic strength dependences of the cytochrome reduction potentials have been measured. The standard entropy of reduction of cytochrome a in the native enzyme is large and negative, in agreement with measurements on the carbon monoxide-inhibited enzyme. The reduction potential of cytochrome a is only moderately (less than -30 mV/pH unit) dependent upon pH, which implies that its reduction is linked to the uptake, on the average, of only about 0.5 protons at pH 7.0, and significantly less at the higher pH values relevant to the mitochondrial matrix. The thermodynamic properties of cytochrome a3 were found to be different in the two enzyme batches studied: in one batch, the cytochrome a3 reduction potential decreased steeply (about -56 mV/pH unit) with increasing pH, indicating stoichiometric (1 H+/e-) coupling of protonation to reduction. In the other batch, the cytochrome a3 potential was insensitive to pH below pH 7.5 and decreased at higher pH values in a manner suggesting coupling to an ionizable group with pKa near 7.8. The temperature dependence of the cytochrome a3 reduction potential indicates that its standard entropy of reduction is more positive than that of myoglobin, another high-spin metalloprotein heme, and significantly more positive than that of cytochrome a.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1586693810,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and multipotential colony-stimulating factor (multi-CSF or interleukin 3) are two members of a family of hemopoietic growth and differentiation factors. Using biologically active radioiodinated derivatives and chemical cross-linking (predominantly with the homobifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate) followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, receptors for these two factors have been identified. The G-CSF receptor was identified as a single subunit protein of Mr approximately 150,000 while two molecular species able to specifically cross-link to 125I-multi-CSF were identified of Mr approximately 75,000 and 60,000. For both CSFs specificity of formation of cross-linked species was demonstrated by showing that the homologous unlabeled CSF (but not other CSFs) competed for formation of the complexes with the appropriate dose-response relation, by showing that saturation occurred over the appropriate range of 125I-CSF concentration and by showing that the cellular specificity of CSF binding paralleled that for cross-linked complex formation. The formation of cross-linked complexes was dependent on the concentration and type of chemical cross-linker, especially for cross-linking of 125I-multi-CSF. Based on a number of criteria it is suggested that the two species cross-linked to 125I-multi-CSF do not represent receptors of different affinity but, rather, two noncovalently associated subunits of a receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1517257916,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the active domain of the heat-stable inhibitor protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Cheng, H.-C., Kemp, B. E., Pearson, R. B., Smith, A. J., Misconi, L., Van Patten, S. M., and Walsh, D. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 989-992) were tested as inhibitors of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The peptides themselves were not substrates. cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity was assayed using histone H2B and two synthetic peptide substrates. Consistent with previous observations of other peptide inhibitors of this enzyme (Glass, D. B. (1983) Biochem. J. 213, 159-164), the inhibitory peptides had no effect on the phosphorylation of histone H2B, but they competitively inhibited cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of the two peptide substrates. The parent inhibitor peptide, PKI(5-24)amide, and a series of analogs had Ki (or IC50) values for cGMP-dependent protein kinase in the range of 15-190 microM. In contrast to their effects on the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the inhibitory peptides were substantially less potent with cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and potency was reduced by the presence of the NH2-terminal residues (residues 5-13). We conclude that the two protein kinases share a recognition of the basic amino acid cluster within the pseudosubstrate region of the peptide, but that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase does not recognize additional NH2-terminal determinants that make the inhibitor protein extremely potent toward the cAMP-dependent enzyme. Even- when tested at high concentrations and with peptide substrates, the native inhibitor protein did not inhibit cGMP-dependent protein kinase under assay conditions in which the peptides derived from it were inhibitory. Thus, the native inhibitor protein appears to have structural features which block interaction with the cGMP-dependent enzyme and enhance its selectivity for cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1524778592,"A locus containing two hsp16 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans has been characterized by DNA sequencing. Each gene encodes a 16-kDa polypeptide which is expressed following heat induction. The two genes, designated hsp16-2 and hsp16-41, are arranged in divergent orientations, and each contains a single intron of 46 and 58 base pairs, respectively. Although both gene transcripts are spliced efficiently in vivo, hsp16-41 corresponds to a previously isolated cDNA which contains an unspliced intron sequence. The 5'-noncoding regions of both genes contain TATA boxes preceded 18 or 19 nucleotides upstream by a heat shock regulatory sequence. The 3'-noncoding regions contain polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) either downstream (hsp16-2) or immediately adjacent (hsp16-41) to a sequence capable of forming a hairpin. This pair of hsp16 genes is flanked by three copies of an approximately 200-bp dispersed repetitive element (two copies on one side and a single one on the other side of the locus) which occurs in at least 70 copies throughout the C. elegans genome, and has been designated CeRep-16. Together with data described previously (Russnak, R. H., and Candido, E. P. M. (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 1268-1278), the results presented here define a family of four distinct, related small heat shock protein genes. These are arranged in divergently transcribed pairs at two loci. The hsp16-48/41 genes code for one class of HSP16, 143-amino acid residues long, while the hsp16-1/2 genes encode the other class, which is 2 amino acid residues longer. Thus each locus codes for the two major types of HSP16. The two loci differ in a number of respects, including the presence of a tandem inverted duplication of two heat shock protein genes at one locus, and of repetitive elements at the other. Sequence comparisons allow us to propose a scheme for the evolution of the four genes and reveal conserved features of noncoding regions which may be involved in the regulation of their transcription, RNA processing, or translation. Using locus-specific hybridization probes, we have found that the genes at locus hsp16-2/41 are expressed at levels approximately 20-40-fold higher than those at locus hsp16-1/48."
https://openalex.org/W2018231215,"To identify DNA sequences that function in the control of DNA replication, we designed a hybrid replicon consisting of linked SV40 and BPV DNA sequences. In the composite SV40-BPV plasmid negative control encoded by BPV is dominant over the uncontrolled replication encoded by the positive factor, SV40 T antigen. Using a transient replication assay, we show that replication control requires three BPV elements. Two cis-acting sequences are closely linked to BPV replication origins. A third trans-acting element is encoded within the 5′ part of the BPV E1 open reading frame (ORF) and is separable from the positive replication factor encoded within the 3′ part of the same ORF. The controlled replication of SV-BPV composite replicons has enabled us to create permanent COS cell lines that stably maintain these plasmids as episomes."
https://openalex.org/W2092930172,"Cells transformed with bovine papilloma virus type 1 mutants in the E6 or E6/7 genes are resistant to high-copy-number amplification of wild-type DNA after supertransfection. Transient and stable replication assays demonstrate this effect. If the supertransfected DNA has a mutation in a newly defined gene (M), this cellular immunity to high-copy-number replication is overcome, resulting in transient replication of the input DNA. In contrast, the resident plasmid does not participate in amplification and is maintained at a constant low copy number. Cotransformation of M- mutants and wild-type DNA into these cells leads to shutoff of replication of both genomes. Thus, M- mutants define a trans-acting negative modulator that regulates viral replication. This function is distinct from the positive factors required for replication. We propose a model that explains why the loss of E6 and E6/7 function leads to immunity of the infected cell."
https://openalex.org/W1496687300,"The nucleotide sequence of serA, the structural gene of Escherichia coli which codes for D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, has been determined. The structural gene contains 1233 nucleotides which code for the 409 amino acids of the subunit of the tetrameric enzyme, as well as the initiator methionine, which is cleaved from the mature protein, and the termination codon. The majority of the primary structure of the enzyme has been confirmed by automated Edman degradation of peptide fragments produced by a variety of cleavage agents. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase with other NAD-dependent oxidoreductases reveals less than 20% homology, although conservation of certain specific residues in the coenzyme binding domain appears to be evident."
https://openalex.org/W1524540558,"The effects of guanine nucleotides, thrombin, and platelet cytosol (100,000 X g supernatant) on the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides by phospholipase C was examined in isolated platelet membranes labeled with [3H]inositol. Guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) (10 microM) caused a 2-fold stimulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, compared to background. GTP gamma S (10 microM) plus thrombin (1 unit/ml) stimulated the release of inositol triphosphate, inositol diphosphate, and inositol phosphate 500, 300, and 250%, respectively, compared to GTP gamma S alone. Cytosol prepared from unlabeled platelets slightly increased the release of inositol phosphates from [3H]inositol-labeled membranes. Addition of cytosol plus GTP gamma S (10 microM), however, resulted in a 300% enhancement of the release of inositol phosphates compared to membranes incubated with thrombin and GTP gamma S. The stimulatory effects of cytosol and GTP gamma S on polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis were also observed when membranes were replaced by sonicated lipid vesicles prepared from a total platelet lipid extract. These data suggest that PIP2 hydrolysis in platelets is catalyzed by a soluble phospholipase C which is regulated by a GTP-binding regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1567248738,"Treatment of cells with interferons induces various mRNAs and the corresponding proteins. We have described previously the isolation of a mouse cDNA clone (cDNA clone 202) which specifies an mRNA whose level is increased 20-fold in beta-interferon-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The increase is a consequence of an increased rate of transcription. The mRNA encodes a 56,000-dalton protein. We report here the isolation of a genomic clone including the 5' terminus of the 202 gene with the interferon-responsive region. Experiments involving primer extension and protection from cleavage by S1 nuclease revealed the existence of multiple 5' termini of 202 mRNAs in Ehrlich ascites tumor and Ltk- cells. Treatment with beta-interferon increased the level of these 202 mRNAs with different 5' termini nonuniformly. A 0.8-kilobase DNA segment from the 202 gene (including its 5' flanking region and its 5'-terminal exon) was ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, and the resulting construct was transfected into mouse Ltk- cells. Treatment of these cells with beta-interferon increased the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene 5-10-fold. Within the first, untranslated exon of the 202 gene, we found a 29-nucleotide long sequence that is partially homologous to sequences which occur upstream from interferon-inducible human HLA and metallothionein IIA genes (Friedman, R. L., and Stark, G. R. (1985) Nature 314, 637-639)."
https://openalex.org/W1615094203,"Calcium-dependent protease II (CDP-II) from bovine heart is a heterodimer with subunit molecular weights of 80,000 and 26,000. Previous studies have demonstrated that the protease requires 350 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal activity and that the large subunit contains both the catalytic and Ca2+ binding functions of the enzyme. The function of the small subunit has been unclear. We have examined the effect of Ca2+ on structural and catalytic properties of CDP-II in the presence and absence of substrate proteins. When incubated with Ca2+ in the absence of substrate, CDP-II undergoes a series of autoproteolytic cleavages that sequentially reduce the small subunit's molecular weight from 26,000 to 24,000 to 22,000 to 17,000. During this time there is no detectable change in the 80-kDa subunit, which remains associated with the autolyzed small subunit. The rate of autoproteolysis is dependent on temperature and on the concentration of Ca2+ (half-maximal rate at approximately 600 microM Ca2+). The first cleavage appears to be unimolecular because its rate is unaffected by CDP-II concentration or by the presence of exogenous protein substrates. Subsequent cleavages result in the formation of the 80-kDa/17-kDa heterodimer and appear to occur by bimolecular reactions; rates of these reactions were slowed by decreasing CDP-II concentrations and by the presence of protein substrates. Autoproteolysis of the small subunit has two distinct functional consequences, each of which is associated with different forms of the autolyzed protease. Our results indicate that the 80-kDa/26-kDa form of CDP-II represents an inactive proenzyme and that the initial Ca2+-dependent cleavage of the 26-kDa subunit results in activation of the protease. The activated enzyme hydrolyzes protein substrates with a Ca2+ concentration requirement of 350 microM for half-maximal rates. The further autoproteolysis, which results in the formation of the 80-kDa/17-kDa heterodimer, serves to reduce the Ca2+ concentration requirement for protease activity by 25-fold. Thus, these results provide evidence for specific roles of the small subunit in the regulation of CDP-II activity."

Quantitative DNaseI protection footprinting analysis was used to ensure that saturation conditions for specific DNA-binding were achieved. Glycerol density gradient centrifugation was used to quantitate Mr 94,000 binding to specific and nonspecific DNA sites. One Mr 94,000 entity was bound per specific DNA site. A modified GR purification procedure resulted in increased amounts of Mr 72,000 polypeptide (1.6:1, 94,000:72,000 molar ratio), compared to previous GR preparations. Glycerol gradient centrifugation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the specific GR X DNA complex contained similar amounts of Mr 94,000 and Mr 72,000 polypeptide. It is as yet uncertain if the Mr 72,000 polypeptide is a functional subunit of GR or a co-purifying contaminant only."
https://openalex.org/W1591746443,"The activating factor FA of the ATP.Mg-dependent protein phosphatase FcM was purified to near homogeneity from pig brain by a procedure involving chromatography on phosphocellulose, phosvitin-Sepharose 4B, and Blue Sepharose CL-6B. A specific myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase was found to co-purify with FA in a constant ratio throughout purification. It also proved impossible to separate the two activities on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and 5-20% sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Kinetic study indicated that MBP, presumably a substrate for FA, could compete with FcM for FA and thereby prevent the FA-mediated activation of the FcM activity. All the results taken together demonstrate that MBP kinase and FA are localized on the same protein. This, together with the data that FA, by activating the ATP.Mg-dependent phosphatase, promotes the dephosphorylation of [32P]MBP, phosphorylated by FA itself, suggests the evidence for a protein bearing two opposing activities involved in the regulation of brain functions. Moreover, since FA is tightly associated with the purified brain myelin membrane, the results further support the notion that FA may well be an endogenous protein kinase responsible for the cyclic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the central nervous system myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1548710898,"A large-scale purification procedure for brain-derived growth factors, without chromatography in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid, has been developed. Two related brain-derived growth factors have been purified to homogeneity from bovine brain using this procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50, sulfated Sephadex G-50, and heparin-Sepharose 4B. Brain-derived growth factor A (BDGF-A, molecular weight approximately 16,000) and brain-derived growth factor B (BDGF-B, molecular weight approximately 17,000) were eluted from heparin-Sepharose 4B at 1.2 and 1.6 M NaCl, respectively. Both BDGF-A and BDGF-B have a pI value of 5.7, have the same specific mitogenic activity, and react with mouse anti-BDGF-A antiserum. Both growth factors have a broad spectrum of mitogenic activity (vascular and aorta endothelial cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, epithelial cells, glial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells), with a half-maximum effect at 10-20 pM. The binding of BDGF to bovine aorta endothelial cells and Swiss mouse 3T3 cells has been characterized. Binding of 125I-BDGF-A to these cells reached equilibrium in less than 15 min. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding of 125I-BDGF-A to endothelial cells and 3T3 cells showed a single class of high-affinity receptor with Kd values of 20 +/- 5 and 13 +/- 3 pM and receptor numbers/cell of 7,000 +/- 1,000 and 20,000 +/- 3,000, respectively. BDGF-B competed for 125I-BDGF-A binding in the same manner as unlabeled BDGF-A, suggesting that BDGF-A and BDGF-B bind to the same receptor. Basic pituitary fibroblast growth factor appeared to be a weak inhibitor, whereas platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor had no effect on 125I-BDGF-A binding. Protamine, histone, polylysine, and polyarginine are potent inhibitors of the mitogenic activity of BDGF-A and BDGF-B and of binding of 125I-BDGF-A to responsive cells. The half-time (t1/2) of internalization and degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-BDGF is 3 h."

No other cell type has been experimentally transformed by EBV, either by intact virions or naked viral DNA and subgenomic fragments. Two immortalized human T-lymphoblastoid cell lines have now been established by transfecting cord blood lymphocytes with purified B95-8 viral DNA enclosed in fusogenic Sendai virus envelopes (RSVE) and then exposing the cells to EBV from a P3HR-1 cell subclone. One of these lines, which has been fully characterized, is termed HBD-1. This line is positive for EBV DNA and expresses surface OKT11, OKT4, and Tac receptors, but not M-1, mu immunoglobulin chains, EBV receptors, or B-1 surface markers. The cells contain fully rearranged T-cell receptor genes and germline immunoglobulin genes. The karyotype of the cells is normal, they do not require interleukin-2 for growth, and do not contain human T-lymphotropic virus type I. However, the HBD-1 cells contain incomplete EBV genomes and express several EBV-determined antigens, including the early antigen type D, membrane antigens, but not EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA). This association of the EBV genome with permanently growing hematopoietic cells of non B-cell lineage should prove useful in studies on the mechanism of EBV-mediated cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1487309988,"BamHI endonuclease and methylase were found to exhibit a kinetic preference for linear pBR322 DNA substrates containing the recognition site in a central location. The Km values for substrates having the recognition site in a terminal location were approximately 3-fold greater than those with a centrally located site. This phenomenon may be partially due to facilitated transfer of the enzymes to the recognition site over nonspecific flanking sequences. The exploitation of facilitated transfer by these enzymes has been inferred from studies demonstrating kinetic preferences for longer DNA substrates. The reaction rates of the endonuclease were 9-fold greater with full-length pBR322 DNA than with a 74-base pair derivative. The methylase exhibits a kinetic preference for longer substrates but only under conditions of comparatively higher DNA concentrations. In addition, the methylase has the property of increasing long chain preference with increasing salt concentrations up to 120 mM. Increasing salt concentrations decreased the endonuclease's preference for longer substrates. Nonspecific inhibition studies revealed qualitative and quantitative differences between the two enzymes under catalytic conditions. These studies suggest that BamHI endonuclease and methylase interact with nonspecific DNA in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W1505021935,"Using the pH-sensitive absorbance of 5 (and 6)-carboxy-4',5'- dimethylfluorescein, we investigated the regulation of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) in monkey kidney epithelial cells (BSC-1). In the absence of HCO3-, pHi is 7.15 +/- 0.1, which is not significantly different from pHi in 28 mM HCO3-, 5% CO2 (7.21 +/- 0.07). After an acid load, the cells regulate pHi in the absence of HCO3- by a Na+ (or Li+)-dependent, amiloride-inhibitable mechanism (indicative of Na+/H+ antiport). In 28 mM HCO3-, while still dependent on Na+, this regulation is only blocked in part by 1 mM amiloride. A partial block is also observed with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) (1 mM). With cells pretreated with DIDS, 1 mM amiloride nearly totally inhibits this regulation. Cl- had no effect on pHi regulation in the acidic range. In HCO3(-)-free saline, Na+ removal leads to an amiloride-insensitive acidification, which is dependent on Ca2+. In 28 mM HCO3-, Na+ (and Ca2+) removal led to a pronounced reversible and DIDS-sensitive acidification. When HCO3- was lowered from 46 to 10 mM at constant pCO2 (5%), pHi dropped by a DIDS-sensitive mechanism. Identical changes in pHo (7.6 to 6.9) in the nominal absence of HCO3- led to smaller changes of pHi. In the presence but not in the absence of HCO3-, removal of Cl- led to a DIDS-sensitive alkalinization. This was also observed in the nominal absence of Na+, which leads to a sustained acidification. It is concluded that in nominally bicarbonate-free saline, the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport is the predominant mechanism of pHi regulation at acidic pHi, while being relatively inactive at physiological values of pHi. In bicarbonate saline, two other mechanisms effect pHi regulation: a DIDS-sensitive Na+-HCO3- symport, which contributes to cytoplasmic alkalinization, and a DIDS-sensitive Cl-/HCO3- exchange, which is apparently independent of Na+."
https://openalex.org/W1497187833,"Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase is a copper- and ascorbate-dependent enzyme that converts peptides with COOH-terminal glycine residues into the corresponding alpha-amidated product peptides. The relatively selective copper chelator N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) and its disulfide dimer, disulfiram (Antabuse), were used to determine whether the availability of copper affects the production of two alpha-amidated pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived peptides, alpha-melanotropin (alpha MSH) and joining peptide. When mouse pituitary corticotropic tumor cells (AtT-20) were grown in medium containing micromolar concentrations of disulfiram or DDC, alpha-amidation of newly synthesized joining peptide was specifically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In rats injected twice with disulfiram or DDC, the ability of the intermediate pituitary to alpha-amidate newly synthesized alpha MSH and joining peptide was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner; at disulfiram doses equivalent to those used in alcohol abuse therapy (4 mg/kg/day), only about 10% of the newly synthesized peptides were correctly alpha-amidated. Chronic treatment of rats with DDC or disulfiram produced a dose-dependent increase in the pituitary content of glycine-extended alpha MSH and joining peptide; the total amount of pro-ACTH/endorphin-related material was unaltered. After 11 days of treatment with 4 mg/kg/day disulfiram, about one-third of the pituitary alpha MSH and joining peptide were present in the glycine-extended rather than the alpha-amidated form; pituitary extracts normally contain almost entirely alpha-amidated peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1553990168,"S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was purified from bovine liver and digested with endopeptidase Lys-C; the resulting peptides were chromatographically separated. Peptides containing either methionine or tryptophan were subjected to sequence analysis. An oligonucleotide mixture of 48 sequences, which was 17 nucleotides in length, was synthesized based on one of these peptide sequences. This synthetic oligonucleotide mixture was labeled and used to screen a bovine cDNA library in phage lambda gt11. A clone was identified which contained a 1350-nucleotide insert. This insert contained nucleotide sequences coding for amino acid sequences of two of the peptides that were analyzed, thus proving that this cDNA clone codes for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. A subcloned fragment from the coding region of the cDNA was used as a probe to analyze the expression of this gene in mitogen-activated lymphocytes. Northern blots revealed two message species of 2.4 and 3.6 kilobases in length. Both mRNAs were coordinately expressed and were present in polysomes. The levels of these mRNAs increased approximately 4-fold by 9 h after activation of the cells. The magnitude of the increase in these messages is to be compared with an 8- to 10-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of the protein. The apparent increase in translational efficiency of this message upon lymphocyte activation was confirmed by analyzing polysomes from these cells. In resting lymphocytes, the average size of polysomes containing mRNA coding for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was 1.4 ribosomes per mRNA, and this value increased to 2.7 in stimulated cells. Thus, it appears that the increase in translational efficiency of this mRNA arises from an elevated rate of translational initiation, leading to more ribosomes per polysome encoding this particular message. This is not a general effect on the expression of all proteins, since there is no change in the translational efficiency of cytoplasmic actin upon activation of lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1594435659,"A gastrin binding protein (GBP) has been identified in detergent extracts of porcine gastric mucosal membranes by covalent cross-linking to 125I-[Nle15]gastrin with disuccinimidyl suberate. The apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked complex (80,000) is uneffected by reduction suggesting that the GBP is not composed of disulfide-bonded subunits. Subtraction of the molecular weight of 125I-gastrin indicates that the molecular weight of the GBP is 78,000. A similar molecular weight has been observed previously for the gastrin receptor (74,000) on intact canine parietal cells and plasma membranes therefrom, and for the receptor for the related hormone cholecystokinin (76,000-85,000) on pancreatic acinar membranes under reducing conditions. The similarity in molecular weight between the gastrin receptor and the solubilized GBP suggests that the latter protein is probably the gastrin receptor. However, the concentration (2 microM) of [Nle15]gastrin required for 50% inhibition of cross-linking of gastrin to the GBP solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 is 200-fold greater than the value (10 nM) observed for the gastrin receptor on isolated canine gastric parietal cells. A lower concentration (0.3 microM) of [Nle15]gastrin was required to inhibit cross-linking in a milder detergent (0.4% digitonin, 0.08% cholate). Thus, the reduced affinity for gastrin of the putative solubilized form of the gastrin receptor appears to be a result of detergent extraction."
https://openalex.org/W1639333376,"Two forms of DNA-dependent ATPase activity were previously purified from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized (Plevani, P., Badaracco, G., and Chang, L. M. S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4957-4963). Here, an additional DNA-dependent ATPase (ATPase III) has been purified from S. cerevisiae to near homogeneity. This ATPase differs from those described previously in its chromatographic properties, molecular weight, reaction properties and immunological relatedness. Its molecular weight is about 63,000 in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and orthophosphate in the presence of DNA as an effector. In addition, yeast DNA polymerase I, which is a true DNA replicase of yeast, is stimulated severalfold by this ATPase. Neither yeast DNA polymerase II nor prokaryotic DNA polymerases are stimulated. This stimulation is intrinsic to the ATPase activity, since both activities copurified in the last four steps of purification, showed the same heat stability and showed dependence on and hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase III preparation also contains a DNA-unwinding (DNA helicase) activity, which unwinds double-stranded DNA in the presence of ATP. In the S. cerevisiae radiation-sensitive mutant rad3, no significant ATPase III activity could be detected, suggesting that the RAD3 gene, which codes for a different polypeptide, regulates the expression of ATPase III activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533084129,"The reconstituted pBR322 DNA replication system has been used to identify a mechanism for the processing and segregation of daughter DNA molecules by Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (Topo I) during the terminal stages of DNA replication. At low concentrations of Topo I (sufficient to confer specificity to the replication system for DNA templates containing a ColE1-type origin of DNA replication), the major products of the replication reaction were: multigenome-length, linear, double-stranded DNA molecules (an aberrant product); multiply interlinked, catenated, supercoiled DNA dimers; and a last Cairns-type replication intermediate. Thirty- to fifty-fold higher concentrations of Topo I led to the appearance of form II and form I pBR322 DNA as the only synthetic products. A model was developed in which Topo I, bound to a single-stranded gap on the parental H strand DNA just upstream of the origin of DNA replication, catalyzed the decatenation of the intermolecular linkages between the two daughter DNA molecules that were generated by primosome-catalyzed unwinding of the residual nonreplicated parental duplex DNA in the last Cairns-type intermediate. At low concentrations of Topo I, however, the intermolecular linkages persisted and, within the context of this replication system, were not removed by DNA gyrase. In support of this model it was demonstrated that: there was a single-stranded gap between the nonreplicated parental duplex region and the 5' end of the nascent leading-strand DNA; the number of intermolecular linkages in the catenated supercoiled DNA dimers was inversely related to the concentration of Topo I; the supercoiled DNA dimers did not serve as a precursor of the final form I DNA product; and maturation of the last Cairns-type replication intermediate to form I DNA was not affected by the presence of coumermycin, a potent inhibitor of the activities of DNA gyrase."
https://openalex.org/W1599584934,"In order to characterize the driving forces for the concentrative uptake of unconjugated bile acids by the hepatocyte, the effects of pH gradients on the uptake of [3H]cholate by rat basolateral liver plasma membrane vesicles were studied. In the presence of an outwardly directed hydroxyl gradient (pH 6.0 outside and pH 7.5 inside the vesicle), cholate uptake was markedly stimulated and the bile acid was transiently accumulated at a concentration 1.5- to 2-fold higher than at equilibrium (overshoot). In the absence of a pH gradient (pH 6.0 or 7.5 both inside and outside the vesicle), uptake was relatively slower and no overshoot was seen. Reductions in the magnitude of the transmembrane pH gradient were associated with slower initial uptake rates and smaller overshoots. Cholate uptake under pH gradient conditions was inhibited by furosemide and bumetanide but not by 4, 4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic stilbene (SITS), 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), or probenecid. In the absence of a pH gradient, an inside-positive valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential caused a slight increase in cholate uptake which was insensitive to furosemide. Moreover, in the presence of an outwardly directed hydroxyl gradient, uphill cholate transport was observed even under voltage clamped conditions. These findings suggest that pH gradient-driven cholate uptake was not due to associated electrical potentials. Despite an identical pKa to that of cholate, an outwardly directed hydroxyl gradient did not drive uphill transport of three other unconjugated bile acids (deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate), suggesting that a non-ionic diffusion mechanism cannot account for uphill cholate transport. In canalicular vesicles, although cholate uptake was relatively faster in the presence of a pH gradient than in the absence of a gradient, peak uptake was only slightly above that found at equilibrium under voltage clamped conditions. These findings suggest a specific carrier on the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte which mediates hydroxyl/cholate exchange (or H+-cholate co-transport). A model for uphill cholate transport is discussed in which the Na+ pump would ultimately drive Na+/H+ exchange which in turn would drive hydroxyl/cholate exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1481306928,"Transverse tubule (TT) membrane vesicles contain a very active Mg-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3). Concanavalin A (ConA) and other lectins were found to activate the TT Mg-ATPase from chicken skeletal muscle up to 25-fold yielding specific activities greater than 800 mumol/h/mg. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase and the sarcolemma Na,K-ATPase were unaffected by ConA. 125I-Labeled lectin binding to the TT membrane Mr 102,000 glycoprotein supports the contention that this protein is identical with or is intimately associated with the TT Mg-ATPase. The ATPase exhibited non-Michaelis-Menton kinetics with both apparent negative cooperativity (n = 0.723; S0.5, Mg-ATP = 14 microM) and substrate inhibition (Ki, Mg-ATP = 10.2 mM), both of which were eliminated in the presence of ConA. Under the same conditions, ConA also abolished the unusual temperature dependence and potent Triton X-100 inhibition. The similarities in ConA suppression of both Triton and substrate inhibition suggest that these ligands may be interacting through a non-catalytic site and that Triton is serving as a nucleotide-mimetic agent. The unique kinetic responses are consistent with a homotropic substrate modifier mechanism wherein the enzyme can be viewed as possessing a single catalytic and a single regulatory site on a single polypeptide chain. It is proposed that ConA interferes either with ligand interaction at a putative regulatory site or blocks communication between a regulatory site and the catalytic site. The possible nature of the regulatory site and its modulation by a ConA-like, endogenous, skeletal muscle lectin and their combined role in excitation-contraction coupling is discussed."

Desensitization was accompanied by sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptors, which became less accessible to the hydrophilic antagonist 3H-labeled 4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazole-2-one hydrochloride ([3H]CGP-12177) and redistributed from the heavier density plasma membrane fraction to a lighter density membrane fraction. Prior treatment of the cells with concanavalin A or phenylarsine oxide blocked sequestration of the receptors but not desensitization of the agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase. The membranes from such pretreated cells were exposed to alkali to inactivate adenylate cyclase, and the receptors were transferred to a foreign adenylate cyclase by membrane fusion with polyethylene glycol. beta receptors from desensitized cells exhibited a reduced ability to maximally stimulate the foreign adenylate cyclase, but remained accessible to [3H]CGP-12177 in the fused membranes. When isoproterenol-treated cells were washed free of agonist, there was a time-dependent recovery of agonist responsiveness and [3H]CGP-12177-binding sites. Using the fusion technique, the receptors recovered their functional activity in the resensitized cells. In concanavalin A-treated cells, desensitization and resensitization appeared to occur in the absence of receptor sequestration. Finally, membranes from desensitized cells pretreated with concanavalin A were fused with polyethylene glycol and assayed for agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase. There was no reversal of the desensitized state. Thus, the primary, essential step in the desensitization process is a reduction in functional activity of the beta-adrenergic receptor. In contrast, sequestration of the receptors is not a prerequisite, but a secondary event during desensitization."

The enzyme, at a concentration of 20 ng/100 microliters cleaved human beta-lipotropin to yield gamma-lipotropin, a beta-melanotropin linked to beta-endorphin intermediate and beta-endorphin, whereas at an enzyme concentration of 40 ng/100 microliters, the substrate was completely cleaved to yield beta-endorphin and beta-melanotropin. These products were identified by their immunological properties and size on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 125I-beta-endorphin product was further shown by high pressure liquid chromatography to contain two forms; the major form co-eluted with 125I-Arg0-beta h-endorphin and the minor form with 125I-beta h-endorphin. No COOH-terminal shortened forms of beta-endorphin were detected. The products formed indicate cleavages at two of the three pairs of basic residues of human beta-lipotropin, at Lys37-Lys38 and Lys57-Arg58, but not at Lys86-Lys87. The cleavage at Lys57-Arg58 occurred primarily in between these basic residues. The Km values for the cleavage of the Lys37-Lys38 and Lys57-Arg58 pairs were 1.9 and 2.5 microM, respectively.

From their susceptibility to the proteolytic enzyme subtilisin, we conclude that the two mutationally altered proteins adopt structural features adequate for biological activity and similar to the conformation that cAMP elicits or stabilizes in wild-type catabolite gene activator protein. We note, however, that their conformation is not unique and can be modulated by cAMP.

We found that a 50-, 100-, or 300-fold excess of liposome-reconstituted apoE, apoC, or apoA-I, respectively, abolished the specific binding of IDL to the low affinity binding sites. Only apoE liposomes had an effect on the high affinity component; at a 100-fold excess no specific binding of IDL could be detected. Liposomes by themselves or associated with erythrocyte membrane proteins had virtually no effect on the binding of IDL. Taken together our results suggest that apoE is the only ligand that can compete efficiently for the sites that bind rat IDL with a high affinity. These sites may be the expression of both the remnant and the LDL receptors. The binding to the low affinity component probably represents weak interactions between IDL and unspecified-lipoprotein binding sites, which can be entirely masked by human low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins-3, or liposome-reconstituted apoA-I, apoE, or apoC at appropriate concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1573793864,"In testicular Leydig cells, forskolin causes the expected stimulation of cAMP and testosterone production and potentiates gonadotropin-induced responses, when present in concentrations of 1-10 microM. In addition, when added at lower doses that did not affect cAMP generation and testosterone responses (100 nM), forskolin caused an increase in sensitivity to hormonal stimulation for all cAMP pools (extracellular, intracellular, and receptor-bound) and a 70% reduction in the ED50 for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation of testosterone production. Forskolin-induced increases in receptor-bound cAMP were less effective than those elicited by hCG in stimulating steroidogenesis. In contrast to the well-known stimulatory actions of forskolin, low doses of the diterpene (in the picomolar to nanomolar range) markedly inhibited the production of cAMP and testosterone. Such inhibitory actions of low-dose forskolin were prevented by preincubation of Leydig cells with pertussis toxin before addition of forskolin and/or hCG. Low concentrations of forskolin also inhibited adenylate cyclase activation by GTP and luteinizing hormone, and this effect was prevented by pretreatment of cell membranes with pertussis toxin. These studies have defined the stimulatory effects of forskolin on Leydig-cell cAMP pools, including potentiation of the hormonal increase in receptor-bound cyclic AMP by forskolin, and have provided additional evidence for the functional importance of cAMP compartmentalization during hormonal stimulation of steroidogenesis. We have also demonstrated a novel, high-affinity inhibitory action of forskolin upon adenylate cyclase activity and cyclic AMP generation, an effect that appears to be mediated by the Ni guanine nucleotide regulatory subunit of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1517877140,"The mechanism by which 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone (BrNAP) inactivates cytochrome P-450c, which involves alkylation primarily at Cys-292, is shown in the present study to involve an uncoupling of NADPH utilization and oxygen consumption from product formation. Alkylation of cytochrome P-450c with BrNAP markedly stimulated (approximately 30-fold) its rate of anaerobic reduction by NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, as determined by stopped flow spectroscopy. This marked stimulation in reduction rate is highly unusual in that Cys-292 is apparently not part of the heme- or substrate-binding site, and its alkylation by BrNAP does not cause a low spin to high spin state transition in cytochrome P-450c. Under aerobic conditions the rapid oxidation of NADPH catalyzed by alkylated cytochrome P-450c was associated with rapid reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide via superoxide anion. The intermediacy of superoxide anion, formed by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, established that alkylation of cytochrome P-450c with BrNAP uncouples the catalytic cycle prior to introduction of the second electron. The generation of superoxide anion by decomposition of the Fe2+ X O2 complex was consistent with the observations that, in contrast to native cytochrome P-450c, alkylated cytochrome P-450c failed to form a 430 nm absorbing chromophore during the metabolism of 7-ethoxycoumarin. Alkylation of cytochrome P-450c with BrNAP did not completely uncouple the catalytic cycle such that 5-20% of the catalytic activity remained for the alkylated cytochrome compared to the native protein depending on the substrate assayed. The uncoupling effect was, however, highly specific for cytochrome P-450c. Alkylation of nine other rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 isozymes with BrNAP caused little or no increase in hydrogen peroxide formation in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1534444313,"Mutants have been constructed by deleting regions of the gene rpsA for ribosomal protein S1, which had been cloned in plasmid pACYC184. The mutant genes were analyzed for their ability to complement an S1 amber mutant containing a temperature-sensitive suppressor. Another series of mutants was constructed using the tac promoter plasmid pKK223-3, and the effect of the mutant proteins was analyzed in a strain wild type for rpsA. The gene products of all mutants were identified by the immunoblotting technique. Plasmids with a mutant rpsA gene which do not or only poorly complement the S1 amber mutation cause drastic growth reduction, whereas the overall protein synthesis is affected to different extents depending on the site of the deletion. Mutants which express S1 fragments comprising at least the NH2-terminal 100 amino acids stimulate or inhibit the synthesis of certain cellular proteins. The amount of chromosomal coded S1 was reduced by each mutant plasmid. Our data suggest that S1 has a general regulatory role during protein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W63806217,"Three partial reactions of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were measured in the presence and absence of small subunits using the enzyme from the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus ACMM 323, whose small subunits may be reversibly dissociated from its octameric, large-subunit core. These partial reactions were: the exchange of the proton at C-3 of the substrate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, with the medium which is indicative of C-2, C-3 enolization; the hydrolysis of the 6-carbon reaction intermediate, 3-keto-2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate; and the decarboxylation of the 6-carbon intermediate, which is catalyzed only by the deactivated, divalent metal-ion-free carboxylase. None of these partial reactions was catalyzed by the small-subunit-depleted, large-subunit octamer to an extent greater than that expected from the residual small subunit content (about 3%), implying that small subunits are required for all three reactions. Clearly, the small subunit's influence is not restricted to any single stage of the catalytic sequence. Under conditions where it was possible to demonstrate tight binding of the reaction-intermediate analog, 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, to the large-subunit octamer, no binding of the 6-carbon intermediate could be detected. We suggest that either the tight-binding form of the 6-carbon intermediate is the hydrated gem-diol, not the ketone, or the large subunits by themselves intrinsically possess a trace of catalytic activity which discharges any bound intermediate before it can be measured."
https://openalex.org/W1597508878,"The breakpoints of the deletion responsible for the Hbb(th-1) mouse model of beta-thalassemia have been isolated. A 3709 (+/- 2)-base pair (bp) region, including the entire beta major globin gene and 2 kilobases of 5' flanking region, is deleted. A novel 66 (+/- 2)-bp sequence, ending in a stretch of 25 dA:dT base pairs, was found to bridge the deletion. A region of the normal murine genome, containing the first 43 bp of the deletion-associated insert (DAI), but lacking the 25-bp dA:dT sequence, was isolated. All normal mice tested contain this DAI-like element and several inbred strains contain an additional DAI-like element. The sequence spanning the Hbb(th-1) deletion may be a reverse transcript of this region."
https://openalex.org/W1681109972,"Thyroidal induction of the plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase is a characteristic of mammalian tissues that exhibit a thermogenic response to this hormone. To facilitate analysis of the pathways mediating this response, we defined the conditions needed for reproducible thyroidal induction of this enzyme, as well as mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, in established cell lines in tissue cultures. In confluent monolayers of nontransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (C3H/10T1/2), triiodothyronine modulated Na,K-ATPase and cytochrome c oxidase activities in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Similar increases in Na,K-ATPase activity were obtained in other rodent embryo cells (SWISS/3T3 and NIH/3T3) and in human fibroblasts (WI-38). In contrast, neoplastic transformation of all of these cell lines resulted in loss of inducibility of Na,K-ATPase by thyroid hormone, regardless of the initiating mechanism (i.e. spontaneous, x-ray, chemicals, viruses)."
