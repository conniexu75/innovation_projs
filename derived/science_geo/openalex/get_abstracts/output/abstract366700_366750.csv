https://openalex.org/W1991037959,"To date, all methods to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) require the use of genetic materials and/or potentially mutagenic molecules. Here we report the generation of stable iPSCs from human fibroblasts by directly delivering four reprogramming proteins (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) fused with a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). These protein-induced human iPSCs (p-hiPSCs) exhibited similarity to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in morphology, proliferation, and expression of characteristic pluripotency markers. p-hiPSC lines produced with these recombinant proteins were successfully maintained for more than 35 passages and differentiated into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both in vitro and in teratomas. This system eliminates the potential risks associated with the use of viruses, DNA transfection, and potentially harmful chemicals and in the future could potentially provide a safe source of patient-specific cells for regenerative medicine. Over a decade ago, Wilmut and colleagues showed that adult somatic cells could be reprogrammed back to an undifferentiated embryonic state using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) (Wilmut et al., 1997Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (3911) Google Scholar). However, since that time, attempts to generate patient-specific cells using SCNT have proven unsuccessful (Chung et al., 2009Chung Y. Bishop C.E. Treff N.R. Walker S.J. Sandler V.M. Becker S. Klimanskaya I. Wun W.S. Dunn R. Hall R.M. et al. Cloning Stem Cells, 2009https://doi.org/10.1089/clo.2009.0004Google Scholar, French et al., 2008French A.J. Adams C.A. Anderson L.S. Kitchen J.R.

In 2006, a new and less controversial method of reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency was reported by viral expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

This and subsequent studies confirmed that mouse and human somatic cells can be reprogrammed to the pluripotent state via viral transduction with the same or similar sets of reprogramming factors (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N.

Although the therapeutic potential of iPSCs has been demonstrated in animal models of sickle cell anemia and Parkinson's disease (Hanna et al., 2007Hanna J. Wernig M. Markoulaki S. Sun C.W.

USA. 2008; 105: 5856-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), these cells contain multiple viral vector integrations that make them unsuitable for human clinical trials. The use of genome-integrating viruses could cause insertional mutagenesis and unpredictable genetic dysfunction (Okita et al., 2007Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar, Yamanaka, 2007Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To address whether it is possible to generate hiPSCs without the use of viral or DNA vectors, we attempted to deliver four reprogramming proteins—Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc—directly into somatic cells. A major hurdle for intracellular delivery of macromolecules such as proteins is their limited ability to cross the cellular membrane (Belting et al., 2005Belting M. Sandgren S. Wittrup A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 505-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In 1988, Frankel and Pabo found that the human immunodeficiency virus transactivator of transcription (HIV-TAT) protein can overcome this hurdle with a short basic segment residing at amino acids 48–60 that allows this protein to penetrate the cell membrane and activate HIV-specific genes (Frankel et al., 1988Frankel A.D. Bredt D.S. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 240: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, Frankel and Pabo, 1988Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). This and other naturally occurring peptides capable of overcoming the cell membrane barrier contain a high proportion of basic amino acids (e.g., arginine or lysine) and are known as CPPs (El-Sayed et al., 2009El-Sayed A. Futaki S. Harashima H. AAPS J. 2009; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, Ziegler et al., 2005Ziegler A. Nervi P. Durrenberger M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In order to test our hypothesis that CPP-anchored reprogramming proteins may directly reprogram human somatic cells without genetic manipulation and/or chemical treatments, we first examined whether red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused with a 9 arginine (RFP-9R) (Wender et al., 2000Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) could penetrate into COS-7 cells and human newborn fibroblasts (HNFs). RFP-9R was efficiently delivered into both cell types within a few hours, even when in the context of whole-cell extracts (see Figure S1 available online). We then generated stable HEK293 cell lines that could express each of the four human reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) fused with 9R and the myc tag. High expression of these proteins was confirmed in HEK293 cell lines by western blotting analyses (Figure S2). When HNFs were treated with cell extracts from the HEK293 cell lines, efficient intracellular translocation of each recombinant protein was observed within 8 hr (Figure 1A). Notably, in contrast to RFP-9R, which was translocated to the cytoplasm, it appeared that most recombinant reprogramming proteins were translocated to the nucleus, while some remained in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In an initial series of experiments, 5 × 105 HNFs were treated with combined total extracts of four HEK293 cell lines for 16 hr (see “Protocol 1” in Figure S3). After washing, cells were incubated for 6 days in ES media 1 and then transferred onto mouse embryonic feeders (MEFs). The transferred cells were incubated with ES media 2 for up to 4 weeks. Despite numerous attempts, we did not observe the formation of reprogrammed colonies using this protocol. We next treated with the same total extracts for 16 hr followed by washing and incubation with ES media 1 for 8 hr/day for 6 days (“Protocol 2” in Figure S3). By day 7, most cells did not survive, and no colonies formed after further incubation on MEF. One potential reason for the lack of success is that, in contrast to virus- or other DNA-based methods, the reprogramming factors were not provided continuously and thus were in short supply. Therefore, we tested whether repeated protein treatment cycles (16 hr protein treatment followed by 6 day incubation in ES media 1) (Figure 1B) could yield hiPSCs. Using this approach, after three or four rounds of treatment, several colonies with iPSC-like morphology were observed (Figure 1C), although none of these colonies showed alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, suggesting only rudimentary reprogramming. When this procedure was repeated for further cycles, the number of iPSC-like colonies significantly increased, and approximately half of the resulting colonies were AP positive starting from the sixth cycle (Figure 1D). In contrast, no such colonies were formed at any stage when extracts of naive HEK293 cells were used. AP-positive colonies with iPSC-like morphology were handpicked and transferred onto MEFs in the presence of ES media 2 and ES media 3 for 7 days each. Five hiPSC-like colonies were established, and two of them were maintained and characterized in this study. These two cell lines (p-hiPS01 and p-hiPS02) have been successfully maintained for more than 35 passages and exhibit morphology similar to that of hESCs, characterized by large nuclei and scant cytoplasm (Figure 1C). Overall, the establishment of these hiPSC-like colonies took about 8 weeks, approximately double that seen with viral transduction (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A. Yabuuchi A. Huo H.

At present, the efficiency of hiPSC generation is significantly lower using this protein-based protocol (about 0.001% of input cells; Figure 1D), compared to virus-based protocols (about 0.01% of input cells) (Park et al., 2008Park I.H.

In order to determine whether the p-hiPSCs have hESC-like properties, we examined them for expression of markers of pluripotency. As shown in Figure 1C, both cell lines prominently expressed ESC markers, including AP, Oct4, Nanog, tumor-rejection antigen (TRA)1-60, stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3, and SSEA-4. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed that both lines expressed endogenous mRNAs of ESC markers: Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, reduced expression 1 (Rex1), growth and differentiation factor 3 (Gdf3), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) levels were dramatically higher than those of HNF cells (up to 100-fold, and comparable to hESCs) (Figure 2A). The expression patterns of ESC pluripotency markers were indistinguishable from hESCs (H9), strongly suggesting that appropriate epigenetic reprogramming had occurred in the p-hiPSCs. Bisulfite sequencing analyses further showed that the promoter regions of the pluripotency genes Nanog and Oct4 were significantly demethylated in both p-hiPSC lines and the hESC H9 line, whereas the same regions were densely methylated in the parental HNF cells (Figure 2C). hiPSC lines from the starting HNFs were also generated using retroviral vectors expressing the same four reprogramming factors (Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A. Yabuuchi A. Huo H. Ince T.A. Lerou P.H. Lensch M.W. Daley G.Q. Nature. 2008; 451: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2302) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K.

These cells displayed similar characteristics and properties as the p-hiPSCs (Figure S4), and one of them (rv-hiPS01) was used as a control. When global gene expression was compared using the Affymetrix Array U133 Plus 2.0, analyzing over 47,000 human transcripts, both p-hiPSC and rv-hiPS01 showed high similarity to hES H9, but not to HNFs (Figure 2B, Figure S5). Since hES H9 and rv-hiPS01 were used as control cell lines, it was important to rule out the possibility that the new p-hiPSCs were derived from contaminating cells. RT-PCR analyses detected all four transgene mRNAs in rv-hiPS01 cells, but not in p-hiPS01 and p-hiPS02 cell lines (Figure S6). Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting demonstrated that the patterns of both p-hiPSC lines and rv-hiPS01 cells were identical to the parental HNF cells but different from those of the hES (H9) cells and HEK293 cells (Figure S7), thus confirming that both p-hiPSC lines are derived from HNF cells. Both p-hiPSC lines exhibited the same karyotype as the starting HNF cells (Figure S8). When the p-hiPSCs were allowed to form embryoid bodies (EBs) by suspension culture, they readily differentiated into cells of all three germ layers (Figure 2D, Figure S8). After 8 days, well-formed EB structures were observed from both p-hiPSC clones. When these EB-like structures were incubated on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in ITSFn media for 15–25 days, they differentiated to a wide range of cell types, including neural, muscle, and endodermal cells, among others. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated the existence of different cell types positive for hepatocyte necrosis factor 3β (HNF 3β, endoderm marker), α-fetoprotein (AFP, endoderm marker), smooth-muscle actin (SMA, mesoderm marker), desmin (mesoderm marker), Tuj1 (ectoderm marker), nestin (ectoderm marker), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, ectoderm marker) (Figure 2D, Figure S8). In addition, teratoma formation was observed after transplantation of p-hiPSCs under the kidney capsule of nude mice for 6–8 weeks. These teratomas contained tissues from all three germ layers including neural tissues (ectoderm), epidermal tissues (ectoderm), striated muscle (mesoderm), adipose tissue (mesoderm), cartilage (mesoderm), respiratory epithelium (endoderm), and intestinal-like epithelial tissues (endoderm) (Figure 2E, Figure S8), confirming that both p-hiPSC clones exhibit pluripotency both in vitro and in vivo. Protein-based hiPSC technology offers a new and potentially safe method for generating patient-specific stem cells that does not require the destruction of ex utero embryos. This system completely eliminates genome manipulation and DNA transfection, resulting in human iPSCs suitable for drug discovery, disease modeling, and future clinical translation. In this regard, the present study demonstrates the “proof of concept” that human iPSCs can be generated by direct protein delivery without genetic manipulation. Other studies suggest that it may be possible to replace and/or further reduce the number of factors required for reprogramming (Huangfu et al., 2008Huangfu D. Osafune K. Maehr R. Guo W.

To minimize/avoid chromosomal disruption, adenovirus and plasmid transfection have been successfully used to generate iPSCs in the mouse system (Kaji et al., 2009Kaji K. Norrby K. Paca A.

Also, Thomson and his colleagues reported generation of hiPSCs by transfection with nonintegrating episomal vectors (Yu et al., 2009Yu J. Hu K. Smuga-Otto K. Tian S. Stewart R. Slukvin I.I. Thomson J.A. Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). In addition, piggyBac transposon (Kaji et al., 2009Kaji K. Norrby K. Paca A. Mileikovsky M. Mohseni P.

While the transgenes can be excised by inducible gene expression once reprogramming is established (Soldner et al., 2009Soldner F. Hockemeyer D. Beard C. Gao Q. Bell G.W. Cook E.G. Hargus G. Blak A.

Wang W. Liu P. Gertsenstein M. et al.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), residual sequences and chromosomal disruptions may still result in harmful alterations that could pose clinical risks. The DNA vector-free, direct protein transduction system described here eliminates limitations that may be caused by viral or any other DNA-based reprogramming methods. However, the generation of p-hiPSCs is very slow and inefficient and requires further optimization. In particular, the whole-protein extracts used in the present study limited the concentrations of factors delivered into the target cells, thus suggesting that p-hiPSCs may be more efficiently generated using purified reprogramming proteins. Recently, Ding and his colleagues reported the generation of mouse iPSCs by combining the use of recombinant reprogramming proteins and the small molecule valproic acid (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou H. Wu S. Joo J.Y. Zhu S. Han D.W. Lin T. Trauger S. Bien G. Yao S. Zhu Y. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). In this study, mouse iPSCs were not generated when only recombinant proteins were used. In contrast, the system described here generated human iPSCs with direct delivery of reprogramming proteins in the absence of any chemical treatment. One possible explanation for these differences is that we used reprogramming proteins expressed in mammalian cells, while Ding and colleagues used refolded proteins after expression in E. coli. Since chemicals such as valproic acid and/or genetic manipulation may induce mutations, it has been suggested that whole genomic sequencing would be necessary if such methods are used to generate iPSCs (Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the system described here eliminates the potential risks associated with chromosomal integrations and/or mutations and may allow the translation of hiPSC technology into the clinic.

https://openalex.org/W2030714059,"Multiple members of the let-7 family of miRNAs are often repressed in human cancers, thereby promoting oncogenesis by derepressing targets such as HMGA2, K-Ras and c-Myc. However, the mechanism by which let-7 miRNAs are coordinately repressed is unclear. The RNA-binding proteins LIN28 and LIN28B block let-7 precursors from being processed to mature miRNAs, suggesting that their overexpression might promote malignancy through repression of let-7. Here we show that LIN28 and LIN28B are overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines (overall frequency approximately 15%), and that overexpression is linked to repression of let-7 family miRNAs and derepression of let-7 targets. LIN28 and LIN28b facilitate cellular transformation in vitro, and overexpression is associated with advanced disease across multiple tumor types. Our work provides a mechanism for the coordinate repression of let-7 miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associates activation of LIN28 and LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W1971496676,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has enabled the derivation of patient-specific pluripotent cells and provided valuable experimental platforms to model human disease. Patient-specific iPS cells are also thought to hold great therapeutic potential, although direct evidence for this is still lacking. Here we show that, on correction of the genetic defect, somatic cells from Fanconi anaemia patients can be reprogrammed to pluripotency to generate patient-specific iPS cells. These cell lines appear indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells from healthy individuals. Most importantly, we show that corrected Fanconi-anaemia-specific iPS cells can give rise to haematopoietic progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineages that are phenotypically normal, that is, disease-free. These data offer proof-of-concept that iPS cell technology can be used for the generation of disease-corrected, patient-specific cells with potential value for cell therapy applications. The feasibility of deriving patient-specific iPS cells and their value as experimental models for specific diseases were reported almost a year ago. Patient-specific iPS cells are also thought to have great therapeutic potential, though direct evidence was lacking. Raya et al. now show that iPS cells from Fanconi anaemia patients can, after correction of the genetic defect, be reprogrammed to generate patient-specific iPS cells that can give rise to disease-free haematopoietic progenitors of myeloid and erythroid lineages. These cells have potential value for cell therapy. The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) is thought to hold great therapeutic potential. Here, somatic cells from Fanconi anaemia patients are reprogrammed to pluripotency after correction of the genetic defect, generating patient-specific iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034379782,"During sleep, neural patterns reflecting previously acquired information are replayed in the hippocampus. Here, the authors report that there is reactivation of learning-related patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex during sleep following rule acquisition that coincided with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for memory consolidation. During sleep, neural patterns reflecting previously acquired information are replayed. One possible reason for this is that such replay exchanges information between hippocampus and neocortex, supporting consolidation. We recorded neuron ensembles in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to study memory trace reactivation during SWS following learning and execution of cross-modal strategy shifts. In general, reactivation of learning-related patterns occurred in distinct, highly synchronized transient bouts, mostly simultaneous with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes (SPWRs), when hippocampal ensemble reactivation and cortico-hippocampal interaction is enhanced. During sleep following learning of a new rule, mPFC neural patterns that appeared during response selection replayed prominently, coincident with hippocampal SPWRs. This was learning dependent, as the patterns appeared only after rule acquisition. Therefore, learning, or the resulting reliable reward, influenced which patterns were most strongly encoded and successively reactivated in the hippocampal/prefrontal network."
https://openalex.org/W2099272214,"Background Two decades of research showing that increasing plant diversity results in greater community productivity has been predicated on greater functional diversity allowing access to more of the total available resources. Thus, understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek, MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness, 2) variation in 10 individual traits, 3) functional group richness, 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity, 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method, 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach, and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure, summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity, the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further, a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer, seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models. Conclusions Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity. Further, these results reveal that functional differences among species involve a complex suite of traits and that perhaps phylogenetic relationships provide a better measure of the diversity among species that contributes to productivity than individual or small groups of traits."

We found strong evidence for susceptibility loci on chromosome 5 (per allele OR = 1.37 (95% CI = 1.19–1.58), P = 3 × 10−13), chromosome 6 (OR = 1.50 (95% CI = 1.28–1.75), P = 10−13) and chromosome 12 (OR = 2.55 (95% CI = 2.05–3.19), P = 10−31). KITLG, encoding the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, which has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of TGCT and the biology of germ cells, may explain the association on chromosome 12."
https://openalex.org/W1986960957,"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) have been expected to have a strong underlying genetic component. We conducted a genome-wide scan among 277 TGCT cases and 919 controls and found that seven markers at 12p22 within KITLG (c-KIT ligand) reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in discovery). In independent replication, TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major allele at rs3782179 and rs4474514 (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13; OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13, respectively). We found associations with rs4324715 and rs6897876 at 5q31.3 near SPRY4 (sprouty 4; P < 5.0 x 10(-6) in discovery). In independent replication, risk of TGCT was increased nearly 40% per copy of the major allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14-1.64; OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16-1.66, respectively). All of the genotypes were associated with both seminoma and nonseminoma TGCT subtypes. These results demonstrate that common genetic variants affect TGCT risk and implicate KITLG and SPRY4 as genes involved in TGCT susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2124839923,"Efficient recognition of odorous objects universally shapes animal behavior and is crucial for survival. To distinguish kin from nonkin, mate from nonmate and food from nonfood, organisms must be able to create meaningful perceptual representations of odor qualities and categories. It is currently unknown where and in what form the brain encodes information about odor quality. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate (pattern-based) techniques, we found that spatially distributed ensemble activity in human posterior piriform cortex (PPC) coincides with perceptual ratings of odor quality, such that odorants with more (or less) similar fMRI patterns were perceived as more (or less) alike. We did not observe these effects in anterior piriform cortex, amygdala or orbitofrontal cortex, indicating that ensemble coding of odor categorical perception is regionally specific for PPC. These findings substantiate theoretical models emphasizing the importance of distributed piriform templates for the perceptual reconstruction of odor object quality."

We applied this technology to the V3 loop-coding region of env in samples collected from 4 chronically HIV-infected subjects in whom CCR5 antagonist (vicriviroc [VVC]) therapy failed. Between 25,000-140,000 amplified sequences were obtained per sample. Profound baseline V3 loop sequence heterogeneity existed; predicted CXCR4-using populations were identified in a largely CCR5-using population. The V3 loop forms associated with subsequent virologic failure, either through CXCR4 use or the emergence of high-level VVC resistance, were present as minor variants at 0.8-2.8% of baseline samples. Extreme, rapid shifts in population frequencies toward these forms occurred, and deep sequencing provided a detailed view of the rapid evolutionary impact of VVC selection. Greater V3 diversity was observed post-selection. This previously unreported degree of V3 loop sequence diversity has implications for viral pathogenesis, vaccine design, and the optimal use of HIV-1 CCR5 antagonists."

We tested the hypothesis that cell-free administration of paracrine factors secreted by cultured EPC may achieve an angiogenic effect equivalent to cell therapy.EPC-derived conditioned medium (EPC-CM) was obtained from culture expanded EPC subjected to 72 hours of hypoxia. In vitro, EPC-CM significantly inhibited apoptosis of mature endothelial cells and promoted angiogenesis in a rat aortic ring assay. The therapeutic potential of EPC-CM as compared to EPC transplantation was evaluated in a rat model of chronic hindlimb ischemia. Serial intramuscular injections of EPC-CM and EPC both significantly increased hindlimb blood flow assessed by laser Doppler (81.2+/-2.9% and 83.7+/-3.0% vs. 53.5+/-2.4% of normal, P<0.01) and improved muscle performance. A significantly increased capillary density (1.62+/-0.03 and 1.68+/-0.05/muscle fiber, P<0.05), enhanced vascular maturation (8.6+/-0.3 and 8.1+/-0.4/HPF, P<0.05) and muscle viability corroborated the findings of improved hindlimb perfusion and muscle function. Furthermore, EPC-CM transplantation stimulated the mobilization of bone marrow (BM)-derived EPC compared to control (678.7+/-44.1 vs. 340.0+/-29.1 CD34(+)/CD45(-) cells/1x10(5) mononuclear cells, P<0.05) and their recruitment to the ischemic muscles (5.9+/-0.7 vs. 2.6+/-0.4 CD34(+) cells/HPF, P<0.001) 3 days after the last injection.Intramuscular injection of EPC-CM is as effective as cell transplantation for promoting tissue revascularization and functional recovery. Owing to the technical and practical limitations of cell therapy, cell free conditioned media may represent a potent alternative for therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2007507372,"Self-incompatibility is an important mechanism in many plant species, used to prevent inbreeding by ensuring rejection of 'self' pollen. It is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus, comprising pollen (male) and pistil (female) S determinants. Wheeler et al. have cloned three alleles of a highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS, from the common poppy Papaver rhoeas, which has no homologues in existing databases. PrpS is a transmembrane protein that appears to function as the pollen S-locus determinant. This adds to our knowledge of the evolution of cell–cell recognition systems. Self-incompatibility is an important mechanism used in many species to prevent inbreeding by ensuring rejection of 'self' pollen. The cloning of three alleles of a highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS (Papaver rhoeas pollen S), now provides evidence that it encodes the pollen S locus determinant and adds to our knowledge of the evolution of cell–cell recognition systems. Higher plants produce seed through pollination, using specific interactions between pollen and pistil. Self-incompatibility is an important mechanism used in many species to prevent inbreeding; it is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus1,2. ‘Self’ (incompatible) pollen is discriminated from ‘non-self’ (compatible) pollen by interaction of pollen and pistil S locus components, and is subsequently inhibited. In Papaver rhoeas, the pistil S locus product is a small protein that interacts with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network, resulting in pollen inhibition and programmed cell death3,4,5,6,7. Here we have cloned three alleles of a highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS (Papaver rhoeas pollen S), from Papaver and provide evidence that this encodes the pollen S locus determinant. PrpS is a single-copy gene linked to the pistil S gene (currently called S, but referred to hereafter as PrsS for Papaver rhoeas stigma S determinant). Sequence analysis indicates that PrsS and PrpS are equally ancient and probably co-evolved. PrpS encodes a novel ∼20-kDa protein. Consistent with predictions that it is a transmembrane protein, PrpS is associated with the plasma membrane. We show that a predicted extracellular loop segment of PrpS interacts with PrsS and, using PrpS antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that PrpS is involved in S-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. Identification of PrpS represents a major advance in our understanding of the Papaver self-incompatibility system. As a novel cell–cell recognition determinant it contributes to the available information concerning the origins and evolution of cell–cell recognition systems involved in discrimination between self and non-self, which also include histocompatibility systems in primitive chordates and vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2122006586,"Background The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) was a randomized controlled trial, which showed that it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes by lifestyle changes. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the lifestyle intervention had an effect on the ten-year mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in the DPS participants originally randomized either into an intervention or control group. Furthermore, we compared these results with a population-based cohort comprising individuals of varying glucose tolerance states. Methods and Findings Middle-aged, overweight people with IGT (n = 522) were randomized into intensive intervention (including physical activity, weight reduction and dietary counseling), or control “mini-intervention” group. Median length of the intervention period was 4 years and the mean follow-up was 10.6 years. The population-based reference study cohort included 1881 individuals (1570 with normal glucose tolerance, 183 with IGT, 59 with screen-detected type 2 diabetes, 69 with previously known type 2 diabetes) with the mean follow-up of 13.8 years. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity data were collected from the national Hospital Discharge Register and Causes of Death Register. Among the DPS participants who consented for register linkage (n = 505), total mortality (2.2 vs. 3.8 per 1000 person years, hazard ratio HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.21–1.58) and cardiovascular morbidity (22.9 vs. 22.0 per 1000 person years, HR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.72–1.51) did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups. Compared with the population-based cohort with impaired glucose tolerance, adjusted HRs were 0.21 (95% CI 0.09–0.52) and 0.39 (95% CI 0.20–0.79) for total mortality, and 0.89 (95% CI 0.62–1.27) and 0.87 (0.60–1.27) for cardiovascular morbidity in the intervention and control groups of the DPS, respectively. The risk of death in DPS combined cohort was markedly lower than in FINRISK IGT cohort (adjusted HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17–0.54), but there was no significant difference in the risk of CVD (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64–1.21). Conclusions Lifestyle intervention among persons with IGT did not decrease cardiovascular morbidity during the first 10 years of follow-up. However, the statistical power may not be sufficient to detect small differences between the intervention and control groups. Low total mortality among participants of the DPS compared with individuals with IGT in the general population could be ascribed to a lower cardiovascular risk profile at baseline and regular follow-up.

In the present study, we investigated the phosphoinositide dependence of Orai1 channel activation in the PM and of STIM1 movements from the tubular to PM-adjacent endoplasmic reticulum regions during Ca2+ store depletion. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) levels were changed either with agonist stimulation or by chemically induced recruitment of a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase domain to the PM, whereas PtdIns4P levels were decreased by inhibition or down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks).

Patch clamp analysis of cells overexpressing STIM1 and Orai1 proteins confirmed that phospholipase C activation or PI4K inhibition greatly reduced ICRAC currents.

According to current views, a decrease in the ER Ca2+ concentration is sensed by the luminal EF-hand of the single-transmembrane STIM proteins causing their multimerization. This oligomerization occurs in the tubular ER, where it promotes the interaction of the cytoplasmic C termini of STIM with PM components and association with the PM-localized Orai channels, causing both their clustering and activation in the PM (reviewed recently in Refs. 11Hewavitharana T.

Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), whereas the latter requires its C-terminal membrane-adjacent cytoplasmic tail to be fully activated by the STIM proteins (15Li Z.

Both STIM1 and -2 contain a polybasic segment in their C termini, and such regions are often responsible for the PM localization of proteins (mostly of the small GTP-binding protein class) via interaction with anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (17Heo W.D.

However, the role of this domain in STIM1 function(s) remains controversial.

TIRF analysis was performed at room temperature in an Olympus IX81 microscope-based through-the-lens dual-launch TIRF system equipped with a Hammamatsu EM-CCD camera and a PlanApo 60×/1.45 objective. Excitation with 488 or 568 nm lasers were used for the YFP or Fluo4 and mRFP, respectively, and scans were performed at every 10 s. For data acquisition OpenLab Software (Improvision) was used, and the pictures were exported as TIFF files for processing with the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Quantification of the membrane intensities was determined after defining the regions of individual cells and thresholding. Because of the large variations in the intensities of individual cells due to different footprint size and translocation responses, these responses were normalized and their maximal Tg-induced translocation taken as 100%. These recordings were then averaged and their S.E. calculated and plotted against time. For calcium experiments cells were loaded with Fura2/AM (3 μm) for 45 min, room temperature). Calcium measurements with Fura2 were performed in modified Krebs-Ringer solution (see Ref. 27Várnai P. Tóth B. Tóth D.J. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol.

[Ca2+]i measurements in suspension were performed at 34 °C in a PTI DeltaScan fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International). All voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200 B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Ramp generation and data acquisition were done with a PC equipped with a Digidata 1322A A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 10 (Axon Instruments). The standard HEPES-buffered saline solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 15 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with NaOH). Fire-polished pipettes fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) with 3–5-megohm resistance were filled with the following (mm): 100 cesium methanesulfonate, 20 BAPTA (dissolved in 0.3 m CsOH), 10 HEPES, 10 NaCl, and 6 MgATP (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). In all experiments, the pipette also contained 25 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3, hexasodium salt; Sigma). Voltage ramps (−100 to +100 mV) of 250 ms were recorded every 2 s immediately after gaining access to the cell from a holding potential of 0 mV, and the currents were normalized based on cell capacitance. Leak currents were subtracted by taking an initial ramp current before ICRAC developed and subtracting this from all subsequent ramp currents. Access resistance was typically between 5 and 10 megohms. Wortmannin (Wm) and angiotensin II (AngII) were applied in some experiments using a gravity-driven microperfusion system, RSC-200 (Bio-Logic SAS, Claix, France). First we wanted to determine whether isolated changes in PtdIns(4,5)P2 could alter STIM1 movements or the activation of Orai1-mediated Ca2+ influx in intact cells. To this end, we used the recently described chemically (rapamycin) induced recruitment of the 5-phosphatase domain of the type IV phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase enzyme (5-PTase domain) to rapidly reduce PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in the PM (28Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This method allows changing the level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 without setting off the signaling cascade downstream of PLC activation. For these studies we used COS-7 cells, as they show very robust elimination of PtdIns(4,5)P2 upon rapamycin treatment (28Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the PM-targeted FRB construct and the mRFP-FKBP12-fused 5-phosphatase domain, which is cytosolic under basal conditions but becomes recruited to the PM after the addition of rapamycin causing rapid depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 from the membrane. This process can be followed in TIRF experiments, where both the recruitment of the phosphatase and the release of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 reporter PLCδ1PH-GFP from the membrane can be monitored simultaneously (see Ref. 31Balla T. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In previous studies we showed that PtdIns(4,5)P2 elimination from the PM by this method does not prevent Tg-induced STIM1 translocation to PM-adjacent regions (27Várnai P. Tóth B. Tóth D.J. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29678-29690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, analysis of STIM1 translocation from many cells in TIRF experiments required normalization to the maximum translocation. Therefore, those experiments could not demonstrate whether STIM1 translocation was altered in the PtdIns(4,5)P2-depleted state. To overcome this problem, we first induced YFP-STIM1 translocation toward the PM by addition of ATP and Tg, and only when translocation has fully developed did we induce PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion by recruitment of the 5-phosphatase domain to the PM with rapamycin. Fig. 1A shows that under these conditions, we could see a some reduction in the YFP-STIM1 intensity at the TIRF plane after 5-phosphatase domain recruitment but only a slight change when the construct containing only the mRFP-FKBP12 protein without the 5-phosphatase was recruited to the membrane (Fig. 1B). In parallel experiments, the translocation response of the PLCδ1PH-GFP was also followed using the same sequence of stimulation. This showed that ATP/Tg only slightly reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, which showed a large decrease only after rapamycin addition (see on Fig. 3). These experiments indicated that PM PtdIns(4,5)P2 may contribute to the stabilization of STIM1-PM interaction.FIGURE 3Inhibition of PtdIns4P production by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. A, COS-7 cells were labeled with [32P]phosphate in phosphate-free medium for 3 h. LY294002 was added in increasing concentrations for 10 min before harvesting the cells with perchloric acid precipitation. After extraction, phospholipids were separated by TLC as detailed elsewhere (30Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Radioactive spots were detected and quantified by a PhosphorImager. A representative TLC is shown in A; the dose-response curve of the inhibition was calculated from two experiments performed in duplicates (B). The inhibitory potency of LY294002 for Ca2+ signaling is also plotted (B, red circles and dashed line). C, detection of PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the PM by the OSH2-2xPH-GFP and PLCδ1PH-GFP domains, respectively, with TIRF analysis. COS-7 cells were transfected with a PM-targeted FRB construct and the mRFP-FKBP12-5-phosphatase in addition to the appropriate PH domain construct. Rapamycin-induced (Rapa) recruitment of 5-phosphatase (red) caused a small but consistent reduction in the membrane localization of OSH2-2xPH-GFP (green), probably reflecting to a small extent the PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding of this domain. Phosphatase recruitment caused rapid decrease in PLCδ1PH-GFP localization (blue) indicating PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion. (The 5-phosphatase trace from the PLCδ1PH-GFP experiment was omitted for clarity, but it was almost identical to that shown in the red trace). The addition of LY294002 (100 μm) induced an immediate and gradual loss of OSH2-2xPH-GFP from the membrane. The addition of 10 μm ionomycin (Iono) at the end of the experiment was used to achieve complete removal of the OSH2-2xPH-GFP protein by massive PLC activation. TIRF data are normalized where the maximum and minimum (after ionomycin) fluorescent intensities recorded in the footprint of cells were considered to be 100 and 0%, respectively. Means ± S.E. derived from 25 cells are shown as recorded in 4–5 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also determined the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 removal on the cytosolic Ca2+ signal after store depletion. For this, [Ca2+]i was monitored with Fura2 in COS-7 cells expressing the 5-phosphatase recruitment system either alone or with mRFP-STIM1 and untagged Orai1 to boost SOCE. The endogenous P2Y purinergic receptors of COS-7 cells were stimulated with ATP together with Tg to rapidly release and deplete the ER Ca2+ stores and activate SOCE. This was followed by rapamycin addition to recruit the 5-phosphatase and deplete PtdIns(4,5)P2. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of rapamycin failed to affect either the endogenous SOCE or the one enhanced by overexpression of STIM1/Orai1. These results suggested that change in the PM PtdIns(4,5)P2 was not a major factor in the regulation of SOCE in these cells, despite its minor effect on STIM1 translocation. Previous data had shown that PI3K inhibitors inhibit SOCE at concentrations that could also inhibit PI4Ks (26Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PtdIns4P might be a regulatory factor of SOCE activity, the PI 3K inhibitor LY294002 was added to the cells at concentrations that inhibit type III PI4Ks (32Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our experience with the use of Wm in microscopy studies suggests that this inhibitor is not reliable because illumination with 488 nm (or shorter wavelengths) on the microscope stage rapidly inactivates this compound 4P. Varnai and T. Balla, unpublished observation. (also see Ref. 33Warashina A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For this reason we used LY294002 in these experiments, first studying its effects on the movements of STIM1 in TIRF experiments. LY294002 was added after STIM1 translocation had already been induced by ATP/Tg treatment and PtdIns(4,5)P2 had been eliminated by recruitment of the 5-phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of LY294002 (30–300 μm) to such pretreated COS-7 cells failed to affect the STIM1 signal in the TIRF plane, suggesting that PtdIns4P is not a factor in keeping STIM1 at the PM. (A delayed increase in the TIRF signal was observed in both channels after LY294002 addition in this set of studies, and we attributed it to changes in the attachment of the cells or a slight change in focus.) In contrast, LY294002 addition rapidly inhibited both endogenous SOCE and that enhanced by Orai1/STIM1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Importantly, this effect was also observed without prior elimination of PtdIns(4,5)P2 when LY294002 was applied to naive, untransfected COS-7 cells (data not shown). To demonstrate the effects of LY294002 treatment on PtdIns4P, two approaches were used. First, [32P]phosphate-labeled COS-7 cells were treated with increasing doses of LY294002 and the labeled phospholipids analyzed by TLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, a 10-min LY294002 treatment reduced the level of labeled PtdIns4P in a dose-dependent manner without a similar decrease in labeled [32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2, essentially mimicking the effects of 10 μm Wm as described previously in bovine adrenal and HEK293 cells (29Balla A. Kim Y.J. Varnai P. Szentpetery Z. Knight Z. Shokat K.M. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A slight increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 already at a lower LY294002 concentration was also observed. This was attributed to the inhibition of PI3Ks and thence sparing PtdIns(4,5)P2 usage via that pathway. The potency of LY294002 to inhibit PtdIns4P synthesis was almost identical to that for inhibition of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3B). Because 32P could label PtdIns4P pools other than those found in the PM, we also wanted to show that LY294002 acted on the PM pool of PtdIns4P. For this we used the PtdIns4P reporter OSH2–2xPH-GFP (34Roy A. Levine T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44683-44689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that has proven to be a reasonable probe for following changes in PM PtdIns4P levels (29Balla A. Kim Y.J. Varnai P. Szentpetery Z. Knight Z. Shokat K.M. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In these TIRF experiments, we used the same treatment regime as in previous experiments in order to assess the lipid changes evoked by the ATP/Tg treatment. These studies showed negligible changes in OSH2–2xPH-GFP localization by ATP/Tg, but recruitment of the 5-phosphatase to the PM caused a slight decrease in the membrane-bound fraction of the OSH2–2xPH-GFP (Fig. 3C). This can be attributed to a weak PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding of this reporter, as it was shown to also bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro (36Yu J.W. Mendrola J.M. Audhya A. Singh S. Keleti D. DeWald D.B. Murray D. Emr S.D. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Note the rapid decrease in the localization of the PLCδ1PH-GFP probe reporting on PtdIns(4,5)P2 changes. Curiously, we were unable to detect an increased PtdIns4P after 5-phosphatase recruitment with any of the PtdIns4P binding reporter constructs (FAPP1-PH, OSH1-PH, OSBP-PH, OSH2-PH) for reasons that are yet to be understood. 5M. Korzeniowski, Z. Szentpetery, and T. Balla, unpublished observations. Nevertheless, a very significant fraction of OSH2–2xPH-GFP remained associated with the PM after PtdIns(4,5)P2 elimination, which was then rapidly released after the addition of 100 μm LY294002 (Fig. 3C). These experiments showed that LY294002 eliminates most of the PtdIns4P from the PM within 5 min of incubation. Thus, although PtdIns(4,5)P2 level in the PM had only a small impact on STIM1 oligomerization and PM interaction in store-depleted cells, LY294002 had a major impact on SOCE that correlated with PtdIns4P rather than PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion. To study the effects of PtdIns4P manipulations directly on ICRAC, electrophysiological measurements were performed in HEK293 cells stably expressing the Ca2+-mobilizing AT1a angiotensin receptors (HEK-AT1). Cells were transiently transfected with YFP-STIM1 alone or in combination with Orai1. Experiments were performed only with cells exhibiting comparable YFP (STIM1) fluorescence. The pipette solution contained 25 μm InsP3 and 20 mm BAPTA, and 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ was present in the bath solution. These conditions allowed depletion of the ER Ca2+ store to activate Ca2+ influx. Voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV of 250 ms were applied every 2 s immediately after gaining access to the cell from a holding potential of 0 mV. Fig. 4A illustrates a typical pattern of response to application of the voltage ramp in cells transfected with both Orai1 and STIM1. The time course of whole cell current activated by depletion of the ER calcium store, estimated at −80 mV potential, is shown in Fig. 4B. In cells expressing both proteins, the current developed fully within 50 to 100 s, with a peak amplitude of 30.7 ± 3.1 pA/pF; (n = 31). Once the current was developed, in a fraction of the cells it stayed unchanged for at least 300 s (Fig. 4B, black trace), whereas in the majority of the cells a slow and linear decay of current was consistently obs"
https://openalex.org/W2077173577,"Tissue fibrosis and chronic inflammation are common causes of progressive organ damage, including progressive renal disease, leading to loss of physiological functions. Recently, it was shown that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is expressed in the kidney and activated by endogenous danger signals. The expression and function of TLR2 during renal fibrosis and chronic inflammation has however not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we studied TLR2 expression in human and murine progressive renal diseases and explored its role by inducing obstructive nephropathy in TLR2(-/-) or TLR2(+/+) mice. We found that TLR2 is markedly upregulated on tubular and tubulointerstitial cells in patients with chronic renal injury. In mice with obstructive nephropathy, renal injury was associated with a marked upregulation and change in distribution of TLR2 and upregulation of murine TLR2 danger ligands Gp96, biglycan, and HMGB1. Notably, TLR2 enhanced inflammation as reflected by a significantly reduced influx of neutrophils and production of chemokines and TGF-beta in kidneys of TLR2(-/-) mice compared with TLR2(+/+) animals. Although, the obstructed kidneys of TLR2(-/-) mice had less interstitial myofibroblasts in the later phase of obstructive nephropathy, tubular injury and renal matrix accumulation was similar in both mouse strains. Together, these data demonstrate that TLR2 can initiate renal inflammation during progressive renal injury and that the absence of TLR2 does not affect the development of chronic renal injury and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053591561,"Leading edge protrusion of migrating cells involves tightly coordinated changes in the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. It remains unclear whether polymerizing actin filaments push and deform the membrane, or membrane deformation occurs independently and is subsequently stabilized by actin filaments. To address this question, we employed an ability of the membrane-binding I-BAR domain of IRSp53 to uncouple the membrane and actin dynamics and to induce filopodia in expressing cells. Using time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy of IRSp53-I-BAR-expressing B16F1 melanoma cells, we demonstrate that cells are not able to protrude or maintain durable long extensions without actin filaments in their interior, but I-BAR-dependent membrane deformation can create a small and transient space at filopodial tips that is subsequently filled with actin filaments. Moreover, the expressed I-BAR domain forms a submembranous coat that may structurally support these transient actin-free protrusions until they are further stabilized by the actin cytoskeleton. Actin filaments in the I-BAR-induced filopodia, in contrast to normal filopodia, do not have a uniform length, are less abundant, poorly bundled, and display erratic dynamics. Such unconventional structural organization and dynamics of actin in I-BAR-induced filopodia suggests that a typical bundle of parallel actin filaments is not necessary for generation and mechanical support of the highly asymmetric filopodial geometry. Together, our data suggest that actin filaments may not directly drive the protrusion, but only stabilize the space generated by the membrane deformation; yet, such stabilization is necessary for efficient protrusion."
https://openalex.org/W1991811946,"Polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes that activate tobacco lung carcinogens may generate inter-individual differences in lung cancer risk. Previous studies had limited sample sizes, poor exposure characterization, and a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in candidate genes. We analyzed 25 SNPs (some previously untested) in 2101 primary lung cancer cases and 2120 population controls from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study from six phase I metabolic genes, including cytochrome P450s, microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and myeloperoxidase. We evaluated the main genotype effects and genotype-smoking interactions in lung cancer risk overall and in the major histology subtypes. We tested the combined effect of multiple SNPs on lung cancer risk and on gene expression. Findings were prioritized based on significance thresholds and consistency across different analyses, and accounted for multiple testing and prior knowledge. Two haplotypes in EPHX1 were significantly associated with lung cancer risk in the overall population. In addition, CYP1B1 and CYP2A6 polymorphisms were inversely associated with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma risk, respectively. Moreover, the association between CYP1A1 rs2606345 genotype and lung cancer was significantly modified by intensity of cigarette smoking, suggesting an underling dose-response mechanism. Finally, increasing number of variants at CYP1A1/A2 genes revealed significant protection in never smokers and risk in ever smokers. Results were supported by differential gene expression in non-tumor lung tissue samples with down-regulation of CYP1A1 in never smokers and up-regulation in smokers from CYP1A1/A2 SNPs. The significant haplotype associations emphasize that the effect of multiple SNPs may be important despite null single SNP-associations, and warrants consideration in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our findings emphasize the necessity of post-GWAS fine mapping and SNP functional assessment to further elucidate cancer risk associations."

A polymorphism in the SLC30A8 gene is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, although the molecular mechanism through which this phenotype is manifest is incompletely understood. Such polymorphisms may exert their effect via impacting expression level of the gene product. We used an shRNA-mediated approach to reproducibly downregulate ZnT8 mRNA expression by >90% in the INS-1 pancreatic beta cell line. The ZnT8-downregulated cells exhibited diminished uptake of exogenous zinc, as determined using the zinc-sensitive reporter dye, zinquin. ZnT8-downregulated cells showed reduced insulin content and decreased insulin secretion (expressed as percent of total insulin content) in response to hyperglycemic stimulus, as determined by insulin immunoassay. ZnT8-depleted cells also showed fewer dense-core vesicles via electron microscopy. These data indicate that reduced ZnT8 expression in cultured pancreatic beta cells gives rise to a reduced insulin response to hyperglycemia. In addition, although we provide no direct evidence, these data suggest that an SLC30A8 expression-level polymorphism could affect insulin secretion and the glycemic response in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2089483355,"Clostridium perfringens type A, is both a ubiquitous environmental bacterium and a major cause of human gastrointestinal disease, which usually involves strains producing C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). The gene (cpe) encoding this toxin can be carried on the chromosome or a large plasmid. Interestingly, strains carrying cpe on the chromosome and strains carrying cpe on a plasmid often exhibit different biological characteristics, such as resistance properties against heat. In this study, we investigated the genetic properties of C. perfringens by PCR-surveying 21 housekeeping genes and genes on representative plasmids and then confirmed those results by Southern blot assay (SB) of five genes. Furthermore, sequencing analysis of eight housekeeping genes and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis were also performed. Fifty-eight C. perfringens strains were examined, including isolates from: food poisoning cases, human gastrointestinal disease cases, foods in Japan or the USA, or feces of healthy humans. In the PCR survey, eight of eleven housekeeping genes amplified positive reactions in all strains tested. However, by PCR survey and SB assay, one representative virulence gene, pfoA, was not detected in any strains carrying cpe on the chromosome. Genes involved in conjugative transfer of the cpe plasmid were also absent from almost all chromosomal cpe strains. MLST showed that, regardless of their geographic origin, date of isolation, or isolation source, chromosomal cpe isolates, i) assemble into one definitive cluster ii) lack pfoA and iii) lack a plasmid related to the cpe plasmid. Similarly, independent of their origin, strains carrying a cpe plasmid also appear to be related, but are more variable than chromosomal cpe strains, possibly because of the instability of cpe-borne plasmid(s) and/or the conjugative transfer of cpe-plasmid(s) into unrelated C. perfringens strains."
https://openalex.org/W2114577185,"Forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs) play a pivotal role in controlling cellular proliferation and survival. The cellular level of these factors is tightly regulated through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, the ubiquitin ligases responsible for the degradation of FoxO1 and the relevance of this regulation to smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and survival have not been fully identified. Here we showed that overexpression of C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) promoted ubiquitination and degradation of FoxO1 in SMCs in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Both the U-box (containing ubiquitin ligase activity) and the charged (essential for FoxO1 binding) domains within CHIP were required for CHIP-mediated FoxO1 down-regulation. Moreover, interaction and ubiquitination of FoxO1 by CHIP depended on phosphorylation of FoxO1 at Ser-256. Furthermore, overexpression of CHIP repressed FoxO1-mediated transactivation and its proapoptotic function following tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment. In contrast, knockdown of CHIP by small interfering RNA enhanced FoxO1-mediated transactivation and its effect on SMC proliferation and survival. Taken together, our data indicate that CHIP is a negative regulator of FoxO1 activity through ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and inhibition of CHIP may serve as a potential therapeutic target for reducing proliferative arterial diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2126451794,"Postsynaptic receptor localization is crucial for synapse development and function, but the underlying cytoskeletal mechanisms remain elusive. Using Xenopus neuromuscular junctions as a model, we found that actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin regulated actin-dependent vesicular trafficking of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to the postsynaptic membrane. Active ADF/cofilin was concentrated in small puncta adjacent to AChR clusters and was spatiotemporally correlated with the formation and maintenance of surface AChR clusters. Notably, increased actin dynamics, vesicular markers and intracellular AChRs were all enriched at the sites of ADF/cofilin localization. Furthermore, a substantial amount of new AChRs was detected at these ADF/cofilin-enriched sites. Manipulation of either ADF/cofilin activity through its serine-3 phosphorylation or ADF/cofilin localization via 14-3-3 proteins markedly attenuated AChR insertion and clustering. These results suggest that spatiotemporally restricted ADF/cofilin-mediated actin dynamics regulate AChR trafficking during the development of neuromuscular synapses."

T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation rapidly activates LFA-1, which provides unique LFA-1-dependent signals to promote T cell activation.

Upon TCR stimulation, the nascent immunological synapse is initiated with surface receptor clustering and cytoskeleton rearrangement, then followed by mature synapse formation after prolonged stimulation (8Dustin M.L.

In the mature immunological synapse, LFA-1 forms a ring-like pattern at the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC), which surrounds the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) containing TCR/CD3/lipid rafts (10Monks C.R.

Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The structure of the mature synapse is stable for hours and thought to be important for sustained TCR signaling (12Dustin M.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 987: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Sims T.N. Dustin M.L. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Purbhoo M.A. Irvine D.J.

LFA-1 functions via pSMAC to stabilize the cSMAC and is associated with the induction of T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and lytic granule migration toward cSMAC (1Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Huppa J.B. Gleimer M. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although LFA-1-containing pSMAC is self-evident in lipid bilayer systems and cell lines, whether it is required for T cell activation under physiological conditions remains controversial (15Huppa J.B. Gleimer M. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). TCR stimulation rapidly induces the functional activity of LFA-1, which then provides unique LFA-1-dependent signals to promote T cell activation (16Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The process can be divided into two steps. First, the intracellular signaling from TCR regulating LFA-1 activation is known as “inside-out” signaling; second, activated LFA-1, as a signaling receptor, can feedback to transduce the intracellular signal, the “outside-in” signaling (1Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Kinashi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that TCR stimulation activates LFA-1 through affinity and/or avidity regulation, as supported by increased adhesion to ICAM-1 and pSMAC formation (16Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 17Kinashi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The “inside-out” signal process has been investigated extensively (18Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 19Billadeau D.D.

The TCR proximal signal molecules, Lck, ZAP-70, and PI3K, are known to be important for TCR signaling to LFA-1 activation (22Mueller K.L. Daniels M.A. Felthauser A. Kao C. Jameson S.C. Shimizu Y. J.

Immunol. 2002; 32: 1670-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of LFA-1 “outside-in” signaling have been explored only recently. Perez et al. (27Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LFA-1 and ICAM-1 ligation activates the downstream Erk1/2 MAPK signaling pathway upon TCR stimulation, which ultimately leads to the qualitative modulation of CD4+ T cell activation through distinct LFA-1-dependent signals. Another recent study provided compelling evidence that LFA-1 reshapes the Ras MAPK pathway downstream of TCR (28Mor A. Campi G. Du G. Zheng Y. Foster D.A. Dustin M.L. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular pathways that regulate these processes are poorly defined. Especially, the evidence in support of a distinctive role for LFA-1 in the T cell signaling pathway has lagged behind; whether the function of LFA-1 is to enhance TCR signaling through the immunological synapse and/or deliver distinct signal in T cell activation and whether LFA-1 is indispensable for or merely assists the existing TCR signal pathway. Furthermore, whether and how TCR proximal signal molecules regulate LFA-1 function remains unknown. Further studies are required to understand the LFA-1 and TCR signaling network. In this study, we found that LFA-1 directly participates in CD8+ T cell activation. Upon TCR stimulation, LFA-1 regulates both TCR-mediated and LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathways. First, the presence of LFA-1, not ligand binding, is required for the sustained Erk1/2 signaling and TCR/CD3 clustering on the surface of CD8+ T cells, subsequently leading to MTOC reorientation, cell cycle progression, and mitosis. Second, LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 enhances Erk1/2 signaling, which promotes T cell activation with increased IL-2 production and cell proliferation. This LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway integrates with the existing TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway to enhance T cell activation. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Animal Production Area at NCI Frederick. CD11a KO mice (C57BL/6 background) were kindly provided by Dr. Christie Ballantyne (Baylor College of Medicine). The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The monoclonal antibodies specific to mouse CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (H129.19), CD8 (53-6.7), CD28 (37.51), IL-2 (JES6-5H4), IFN-γ (XMG1.2), and Ki-67 (B56) were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); TNF-α (MP6-XT22) was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA), and TCR-β was from Invitrogen Detection Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant mouse ICAM-1/Fc chimera was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The rabbit anti-mouse phospho-p44/22 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. The secondary Abs AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-hamster IgG (H+L), AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG, AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG, AlexaFluor 647 cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), and Prolong Anti-FadeTM mounting medium were purchased from Invitrogen Detection Technologies. The anti-β-tubulin (TUB2.1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The piceatannol, LY294002, cytochalasin D, and latrunculin were from EMD Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany), and PP-1 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The single cell suspension was prepared from spleen and lymph nodes from C57BL/6 mice or CD11a KO mice by a standard method. CD8+ T cells were purified with mouse CD8a+ T Lymphocyte Enrichment Set-DM from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). In brief, 5 μl of biotin-antibody mixture including biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD4 (GK1.5), CD11b (M1/70), CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2), CD49b (HMα2), and TER-119/erythroid cells (TER-119) were mixed with 1 × 106 cells for 10 min on ice. Then, 5 μl of the BDTM IMag Streptavidin Particles Plus-DM were added to the single cell suspension, and CD8+ T cells were negatively selected with the BDTM IMagnet. The purified CD8+ T cells were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium in 24-well microtiter plates and stimulated with coated anti-CD3 antibody in the presence or absence of coated ICAM-1 for indicated times. The intracellular staining was performed with the Fix & Perm cell permeabilization reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) with a minor modification. For each sample, 1 × 106 cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1%NaN3, 1% fetal bovine serum). Cells were first incubated with various cell surface markers for 20 min, then washed and resuspended in reagent A (fixation medium). The rabbit anti-mouse phospho-p44/22 MAPK antibody was diluted in reagent B (permeabilization medium) and added onto cells. Then, cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG. For intracellular IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α staining, 10 μg/ml Brefeldin A was added for the last 8 h of stimulation. To detect intracellular cytokine production, cells were fixed (reagent A) and permeabilized (reagent B), then stained with AlexaFluor 647-conjugated IL-2, PE-Cy7-conjugated IFN-γ, and Pacific Blue-conjugated TNF-α antibody. Multicolor flow cytometry data were acquired with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Fluorescence staining and image analysis of CD8+ T cells were prepared as described below. For cytoskeleton inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 m cytochalasin D or 100 μm latrunculin A. For lipid raft experiments, cells were pretreated with 25 μg/ml AlexaFluor 647-conjugated CTB. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then stained with specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated with fluorescence dyes. The secondary antibody goat anti-hamster IgG AlexaFluor 594 (1:400) was used to observe the localization of CD3 on the cell surface. The anti-mouse CD8 AlexaFluor 488 (1:100), anti-mouse TCR-β AlexaFluor 647 (1:50), and anti-mouse CD11a AlexaFluor 488 (1:400) were used for cell surface staining. The rabbit anti-mouse phospho-p44/22 MAPK followed by secondary antibody AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG in permeabilization medium were used to detect p-Erk1/2. The anti-β-tubulin Cy3 (1:200) was used to stain MTOC. After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were loaded onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and mounted Prolong Anti-FadeTM. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica TCS SE RS spectral laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with the appropriate filters and a ×63 objective lens. Image analysis was performed using Leica Confocal Software (Leica Microsystems). Cells were examined with z stacks of 0.2 μm and at least 20 iterations. TCR stimulation and LFA-1 ligation can induce the activation of the Erk1/2 MAPK signal pathway in CD4+ T cells and Jurkat cells (27Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J.

Kapsenberg M.L. Wierenga E.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Using the phospho-Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2) flow cytometry assay and CD11a KO mice, we examined the role of LFA-1 and TCR stimulation in CD8+ T cell activation. As shown in Fig. 1A (upper panel), purified CD8+ T cells were stimulated with coated anti-CD3 antibody, the p-Erk1/2 activity was detected in 40.1% WT and 37.1% CD11a KO CD8+ T cells after 5 min of stimulation. The mean florescence intensity (MFI) was 71.3 and 50.7, respectively. The p-Erk1/2 activity in WT (left panel) and CD11a KO (right panel) cells peaked at 5 min, and the signal subsided to background levels within 60 min. The percentage of p-Erk1/2+ cells was similar in WT and CD11a KO CD8+ T cells with CD3 antibody stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A (lower panel), ICAM-1 alone did not induce p-Erk1/2, and there was no apparent difference in p-Erk1/2 activity in the presence or absence of ICAM-1. It has been demonstrated previously that continuous TCR stimulation is required for signal amplification during T cell activation (2Huppa J.B. Davis M.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 4Lin J. Miller M.J. Shaw A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Dustin M.L. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S119-S125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Dustin M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether LFA-1 plays a role in sustained Erk1/2 signaling in CD8+ T cells, we measured p-Erk1/2 activity after prolonged TCR cross-linking with CD3 antibody for 6–18 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, there were two distinct subsets of cells with intracellular p-Erk1/2 activity in the presence of ICAM-1: one with relatively high amounts of p-Erk1/2(p-Erk1/2High) and one with relatively low amounts of p-Erk1/2(p-Erk1/2Low). The p-Erk1/2 activity measured by the MFI in the p-Erk1/2High subset was 17 times that of the p-Erk1/2Low subset (815 versus 50). However, the CD3 antibody stimulation alone only induced the p-Erk1/2Low subset. The p-Erk1/2 activity of cells stimulated with ICAM-1 in the absence of TCR cross-linking was similar to that of the unstimulated control without any detectable p-Erk1/2 activity, which indicated that signal from LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 alone could not activate the Erk1/2 signal pathway. In addition, only the p-Erk1/2High but not the p-Erk1/2Low could be inhibited with an LFA-1-blocking antibody M17/4, which abolished LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 (data not shown). Thus, LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 provided a unique LFA-1-dependent Erk1/2 signal upon TCR stimulation. Furthermore, there was only a minimal amount of detectable p-Erk1/2 activity in CD11a KO cells upon continuous TCR stimulation for 12 h (Fig. 1B), although a significant amount of p-Erk1/2 was detected 5 min after CD3 antibody stimulation (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the p-Erk1/2Low subset is generated with continuous TCR stimulation in the presence of LFA-1. In summary, we found that LFA-1 contributes to CD8+ T cell activation in two ways: first, the presence of LFA-1 is required for the p-Erk1/2 activity induced by TCR stimulation, which is represented by the p-Erk1/2Low subset (TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signaling); second, the ligation of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 significantly enhances intracellular Erk1/2 signaling, which is represented by the p-Erk1/2High subset (LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signaling). Although TCR stimulation and LFA-1 ligation can activate Erk1/2 signaling in CD8+ T cells, these signal pathways depend on the presence of LFA-1 on the cell surface. To further investigate the mechanism of LFA-1 in regulating TCR-induced Erk1/2 activity, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine the subcellular location and dynamics of p-Erk1/2 activity. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), p-Erk1/2 was enriched proximal to the membrane and associated with the prominent CD3 macro-cluster in the WT CD8+ T cells after 30 min of TCR stimulation. The relative location and quantity of p-Erk1/2 (blue line) and CD3 (red line) were plotted on the right side of the overlay image, with two peaks of p-Erk1/2 and CD3 co-localized to the cell membrane. In the CD11a KO cells, the predominant pattern was different with multiple CD3/p-Erk1/2 micro-clusters distributed on the cell membrane. However, the p-Erk1/2 activity was evident and co-localized with CD3 proximal to the cell membrane. This is consistent with the data in Fig. 1A showing that p-Erk1/2 activity in WT and CD11a KO cells was comparable. After 8–12 h of stimulation with CD3 antibody, p-Erk1/2 remained co-localized with CD3 macro-clusters in the WT CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2A, middle panel). Furthermore, p-Erk1/2 was translocated inside of the cell, and a significant amount of p-Erk1/2 activity was detected in the cytosol, which indicated the continuous recruitment and amplification of p-Erk1/2 upon TCR stimulation. However, the p-Erk1/2 activity was barely detectable proximal to the membrane in CD11a KO cells, although CD3 micro-clusters remained evenly distributed across the cell surface. In addition, the p-Erk1/2 signal inside of the cells was minimal and at background levels. Although the p-Erk1/2 activity can be transiently initiated upon TCR stimulation in CD11a KO cells, the sustained Erk1/2 signaling requires the presence of LFA-1. The cytoskeleton remodeling and lipid rafts have been demonstrated to be involved in TCR clustering and immunological synapse formation (1Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 30Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Marwali M.R. MacLeod M.A. Muzia D.N. Takei F. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To examine the role of LFA-1 in regulating CD3 macro-cluster formation, CD8+ T cells were preincubated with CTB before CD3 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2A (bottom panel), a CD3 macro-cluster was associated with the lipid microdomain enriched with GM1 gangliosides in WT cells upon TCR stimulation for 30 min. The CD3 macro-clusters were detected in about 50% of the WT cells after 30 min of TCR stimulation (left panel in Fig. 2B). In the CD11a KO cells, there was a significant reduction of cells containing CD3 macro-clusters (18.75%), which was similar to WT control (13.77%), WT cells pretreated with actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D (11.64%), or latrunculin A (18.61%). After 12 h of TCR stimulation (right panel in Fig. 2B), CD3 macro-clusters presented on 80.72% of the wild-type cells compared with 10.69% CD11a KO cells. Thus, LFA-1 plays an essential role in CD3 macro-cluster formation, which maintains the sustained Erk1/2 signaling. The presence of LFA-1 on the cell surface is required for TCR-mediated Erk1/2 activity and TCR/CD3 clustering. Upon TCR stimulation, MTOC is reoriented to the immunological synapse through cytoskeleton reorganization, and it has been proposed that microtubules anchor in the pSMAC (32Kuhn J.R. Poenie M. Immunity. 2002; 16: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 33Sancho D. Vicente-Manzanares M. Mittelbrunn M. Montoya M.C. Gordón-Alonso M. Serrador J.M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 189: 84-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Stinchcombe J.C. Majorovits E. Bossi G. Fuller S. Griffiths G.M. Nature. 2006; 443: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In addition, Erk1/2 signaling is required for the polarization of MTOC in NK cells (35Chen X. Trivedi P.P. Ge B. Krzewski K. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6329-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the presence of LFA-1 is required for the Erk1/2 signaling in CD8+ T cells, we examined MTOC localization in WT and CD11a KO cells. Upon TCR stimulation for 30 min, there were slightly increased MTOCs reoriented to the proximal cell membrane in WT cells compared with CD11a KO (data not shown). After TCR stimulation for 12 h, the MTOC was reoriented to the CD3 macro-cluster in WT cells, whereas the MTOC remained inside of the CD11a KO cells (upper panel in Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, there were 77.7% WT cells with polarized MTOC in comparison to only 17.24% CD11a KO cells. After 48 h of stimulation, the WT CD8+ T cells were mostly premitotic blasts with a single polarized MTOC (74.78%) and about 10.81% mitotic cells with two polarized MTOCs (lower panel in Fig. 3, A and C). We observed the dissolution of cytoskeleton structure including MTOC and significant apoptosis in CD11a KO cells after 48 h of stimulation (data not shown). Thus, in the absence of LFA-1, the MTOC polarization induced by TCR stimulation is defective. We further investigated whether the absence of LFA-1 and Erk1/2 signaling plays a role in cell cycle entry and mitosis. The percentage of viable cells in the G0, G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined by double staining of Ki-67 and PI (36Endl E. Steinbach P. Knüchel R. Hofstädter F. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, there were 5.02, 3.03, and 2.63% wild-type cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases respectively in WT cells after 48 h of stimulation. Although CD11a KO cells could progress through the cell cycle, there were reduced cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases (3.33, 1.05, and 1.08%). In addition, there were increased dying cells in CD11a KO cells in comparison to WT (16.7% versus 42.1%). Collectively, CD11a KO CD8+ T cells can enter the cell cycle upon TCR stimulation but at a much slower rate than WT. We further investigated the functional consequences of LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 in CD8+ T cell activation. Intracellular IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were measured simultaneously 12 h after stimulation with CD3 antibody or CD3 plus ICAM-1. As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), there were two subsets of activated CD8+ T cells with relatively high and low levels of intracellular IL-2 in the presence of ICAM-1. The total amount of intracellular IL-2 was significantly increased in the presence of ICAM-1 compared with CD3 antibody stimulation alone (MFI: 133 versus 18), as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4A. Thus, the activation of the Erk1/2 signal pathway by LFA-1 ligation enhances IL-2 production in CD8+ T cells. In addition, the cells positive for intracellular IL-2 also coexpressed TNF-α and IFN-γ. Whereas the amount of TNF-α remained the same in the presence of ICAM-1, the production of IFN-γ was significantly increased as shown in Fig. 4A (lower panel). Subsequently, we examined the effect of LFA-1 ligation on CD8+ T cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 4B (upper panel), there were similar amounts of cells entering G1 phase after 72 h of stimulation with CD3 antibody in the absence or presence of ICAM-1 (13.6 versus 13.9). However, LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 produced a higher percentage of cells in the S phase than did CD3 antibody stimulation alone (7.4 versus 6.43), and a similar effect was seen in cells entering G2-M phase (3.6 versus 2.22). Overall, there were significantly increased cells in cycle (S+G2-M) in the presence of ICAM-1 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Thus, LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 promotes cell cycle entry of CD8+ T cells. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of LFA-1 in CD8+ T cell activation. We found that LFA-1 regulates CD8+ T cell activation through two distinct signal pathways. Upon CD3 stimulation, the presence of LFA-1 on the cell surface is required for TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signaling. In addition, LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 produces a unique LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal, which integrates with the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal for optimal T cell activation. Our data demonstrated the differential contribution of TCR stimulation and LFA-1 ligation in the activation of the Erk1/2 pathway. We have shown that LFA-1 plays an essential role in the sustained Erk1/2 signaling induced by TCR stimulation. LFA-1 is not required to initiate the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway because Erk1/2 signaling occurs in the absence of LFA-1. However, the presence of LFA-1 is required for TCR/CD3 macro-cluster formation and sustained Erk1/2 signaling. Subsequently, the CD8+ T cells commit to the activation program such as cytokine production and cell cycle progression. We demonstrated that the TCR/CD3 macro-cluster is co-localized with p-Erk1/2 activity. Newly formed TCR/CD3 micro-clusters are actively transported and reorganized into the macro-cluster upon TCR stimulation (1Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Lin J. Miller M.J. Shaw A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Davis M.M.

The absence of LFA-1 results in defective TCR/CD3 macro-cluster formation, which has a structural and functional similarity to the cSMAC. The mature immunological synapse is a long-lived structure, and the cSMAC is required for the maintenance of sustained signaling (1Dustin M.L. Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Nat.

Shaw A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the absence of LFA-1 and the TCR/CD3 macro-cluster as an anchor, the local concentration of p-Erk1/2 is not maintained and amplified over time, and the MTOC does not polarize toward the immunological synapse. This results in incomplete CD8+ T cell activation. The presence of LFA-1 is essential for sustained TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signaling (p-Erk1/2Low), and LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signaling (p-Erk1/2High) promotes the optimal activation of CD8+ T cells. Both signal pathways depend on TCR and LFA-1. To investigate whether the LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway is directly regulated by the proximal signals from TCR stimulation, we used the pharmacological inhibitors Lck (PP1), PI3K (LY294002), and ZAP70 (piceatannol). As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, preincubation of CD8+ T cells with PP1, piceatannol, or LY294002 blocked TCR-mediated Erk1/2 activity (p-Erk1/2Low), regardless of the absence (upper panel) or presence (lower panel) of ICAM-1. However, the p-Erk1/2High subset resulting from LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 was not affected by LY294002 and piceatannol, but partially impaired by PP1 with 66% reduction of cells with p-Erk1/2High activity (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data indicated the existence of two signal pathways: the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway (p-Erk1/2Low) depends on Lck, ZAP-70, and PI3K, whereas the LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway (p-Erk1/2High) is dependent on Lck but independent of ZAP-70 and PI3K. Thus, TCR-mediated and LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathways are differentially regulated by proximal signals from TCR activation. Lck, ZAP-70, and PI3K function sequentially to initiate TCR signal transduction and activate the downstream Erk1/2 MAPK pathway (15Huppa J.B. Gleimer M. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Gratton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the TCR-dependent Lck/Zap70/PI3K pathway can trigger actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and recruit LFA-1 to the peripheral zone of the pSMAC (17Kinashi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 21Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway depends on Lck, ZAP-70, and PI3K. Furthermore, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, inhibitors that disrupt the cytoskeleton, prevent sustained Erk1/2 activity and TCR/CD3 clustering on the cell surface. We propose that the function of LFA-1 in the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway is as follows: TCR signaling recruits and activates LFA-1 via cytoskeleton rearrangement; subsequently, LFA-1 functions via pSMAC to stabilize the cSMAC and sustain Erk1/2 signaling in T cell activation. Thus, LFA-1 regulates the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway in the context of the immunological synapse. The LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway, which is Zap70- and PI3K-independent but partially Lck-dependent, requires TCR stimulation and LFA-1 ligation for optimal CD8+ T cell activation. The p-Erk1/2High population indicates that LFA-1 ligation with ICAM-1 can significantly enhance intracellular Erk1/2 MAPK signaling in the presence of TCR stimulation. This is consistent with the previous observation that LFA-1 signaling cooperates with TCR stimulation to augment phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and lower the activation threshold in CD4+ T cells (27Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that LFA-1 influences CD8+ T cell activation by providing a distinct signal through ligation with ICAM-1, which integrates with the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal to enhance T cell activation. LFA-1 is constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes in an inactive state (39Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 40Hogg N. Smith A. McDowall A. Giles K. Stanley P. Laschinger M. Henderson R. Immunol.

It is controversial whether the affinity or avidity state of LFA-1 is involved in the inside-out and outside-in signals. A recent publication demonstrated that cytoskeletal regulation couples LFA-1 conformational changes to receptor lateral mobility and clustering; thus, both affinity and avidity states of LFA-1 provide regulation of receptor function on lymphocytes (42Cairo C.W. Mirchev R. Golan D.E. Immunity. 2006; 25: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies reported that LFA-1 ligation can co-stimulate T cells for IL-2 production, cell proliferation, and Th1 polarization (27Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 43Bossi G. Bottone M.G. Pellicciari C. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1999; 7: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular pathways that regulate these processes are not defined. In particular, evidence in support of a distinctive role for LFA-1 activation in T cell signaling pathway is lacking. Based on our data, a plausible model is derived as follows: the TCR signaling to LFA-1 (inside-out) activates both the avidity and affinity of LFA-1; the avidity regulation of LFA-1 in the absence of ICAM-1 ligand is mediated through pSMAC formation, which leads to the maintenance of the stable immunological synapse for the TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway. This is consistent with a previous report that TCR stimulation activates Rap1, which leads LFA-1 to rapidly accumulate at immunological synapses through spatial redistribution (45Katagiri K. Maeda A. Shimonaka M. Kinashi T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin-activating agonists have been shown to cause LFA-1 to move into lipid rafts (30Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the polarization and clustering of LFA-1 can be observed when T cells are stimulated with CD3 antibody (2. 4). The TCR signaling to LFA-1 also changes the affinity state of LFA-1 simultaneously. Subsequently, the ligation of high affinity LFA-1 with ICAM-1 transduces the outside-in signal. The ligation between activated LFA-1 and ICAM-1 provides extra strength to stabilize the immunological synapse and accessory signals to accelerate T cell activation. Thus, our results suggest that TCR controls the avidity and affinity of LFA-1, which are coupled to provide regulation of CD8+ T cell activation. In summary, we found that LFA-1 contributes to CD8+ T cell activation through two distinct Erk1/2 signal pathways. The first Erk1/2 signal is delivered through the TCR by recruiting LFA-1 to the immunological synapse. This TCR-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway is required for CD8+ T cell activation. The second Erk1/2 signal is delivered through LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding. This LFA-1-mediated Erk1/2 signal pathway induces optimal activation of CD8+ T cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993644786,"Background Movement data are frequently collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, but recorded GPS locations are subject to errors. While past studies have suggested methods to improve location accuracy, mechanistic movement models utilize distributions of turning angles and directional biases and these data present a new challenge in recognizing and reducing the effect of measurement error. Methods I collected locations from a stationary GPS collar, analyzed a probabilistic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to understand how measurement error affects measured turning angles and directional biases. Results Results from each of the three methods were in complete agreement: measurement error gives rise to a systematic bias where a stationary animal is most likely to be measured as turning 180° or moving towards a fixed point in space. These spurious effects occur in GPS data when the measured distance between locations is <20 meters. Conclusions Measurement error must be considered as a possible cause of 180° turning angles in GPS data. Consequences of failing to account for measurement error are predicting overly tortuous movement, numerous returns to previously visited locations, inaccurately predicting species range, core areas, and the frequency of crossing linear features. By understanding the effect of GPS measurement error, ecologists are able to disregard false signals to more accurately design conservation plans for endangered wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W2030816895,"Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the intestine. The etiology is unknown, but an excessive immune response to bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals is probably involved. The response is characterized by a strong Th1/Th17 response, but the relative importance of the various bacteria is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings In an attempt to address this issue, we made T-cell lines from intestinal biopsies of patients with CD (n = 11), ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 13) and controls (n = 10). The T-cell lines were tested for responses to various bacteria. A majority of the CD patients with active disease had a dominant response to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). The T cells from CD patients also showed higher proliferation in response to MAP compared to UC patients (p<0.025). MAP reactive CD4 T-cell clones (n = 28) were isolated from four CD patients. The T-cell clones produced IL-17 and/or IFN-γ, while minimal amounts of IL-4 were detected. To further characterize the specificity, the responses to antigen preparations from different mycobacterial species were tested. One T-cell clone responded only to MAP and the very closely related M. avium subspecies avium (MAA) while another responded to MAP, MAA and Mycobacterium intracellulare. A more broadly reactive T-cell clone reacted to MAP1508 which belongs to the esx protein family. Conclusions/Significance The presence of MAP reactive T cells with a Th1 or Th1/Th17 phenotype may suggest a possible role of mycobacteria in the inflammation seen in CD. The isolation of intestinal T cells followed by characterization of their specificity is a valuable tool to study the relative importance of different bacteria in CD."
https://openalex.org/W2090595394,"Activation of RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway and the associated changes in actin cytoskeleton induced by thrombin are crucial for activation of NF-kappaB and expression of its target gene ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. However, the events acting downstream of RhoA/ROCK to mediate these responses remain unclear. Here, we show a central role of cofilin-1, an actin-binding protein that promotes actin depolymerization, in linking RhoA/ROCK pathway to dynamic alterations in actin cytoskeleton that are necessary for activation of NF-kappaB and thereby expression of ICAM-1 in these cells. Stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin resulted in Ser(3) phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin and formation of actin stress fibers in a ROCK-dependent manner. RNA interference knockdown of cofilin-1 stabilized the actin filaments and inhibited thrombin- and RhoA-induced NF-kappaB activity. Similarly, constitutively inactive mutant of cofilin-1 (Cof1-S3D), known to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton, inhibited NF-kappaB activity by thrombin. Overexpression of wild type cofilin-1 or constitutively active cofilin-1 mutant (Cof1-S3A), known to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton, also impaired thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activity. Additionally, depletion of cofilin-1 was associated with a marked reduction in ICAM-1 expression induced by thrombin. The effect of cofilin-1 depletion on NF-kappaB activity and ICAM-1 expression occurred downstream of IkappaBalpha degradation and was a result of impaired RelA/p65 nuclear translocation and consequently, RelA/p65 binding to DNA. Together, these data show that cofilin-1 occupies a central position in RhoA-actin pathway mediating nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 and expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003657086,"We introduce a method for large scale reconstruction of complex bundles of neural processes from fluorescent image stacks. We imaged yellow fluorescent protein labeled axons that innervated a whole muscle, as well as dendrites in cerebral cortex, in transgenic mice, at the diffraction limit with a confocal microscope. Each image stack was digitally re-sampled along an orientation such that the majority of axons appeared in cross-section. A region growing algorithm was implemented in the open-source Reconstruct software and applied to the semi-automatic tracing of individual axons in three dimensions. The progression of region growing is constrained by user-specified criteria based on pixel values and object sizes, and the user has full control over the segmentation process. A full montage of reconstructed axons was assembled from the approximately 200 individually reconstructed stacks. Average reconstruction speed is approximately 0.5 mm per hour. We found an error rate in the automatic tracing mode of approximately 1 error per 250 um of axonal length. We demonstrated the capacity of the program by reconstructing the connectome of motor axons in a small mouse muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2032576848,"Social dominance and physical size are closely linked. Nonverbal dominance displays in many non-human species are known to increase the displayer's apparent size. Humans also employ a variety of nonverbal cues that increase apparent status, but it is not yet known whether these cues function via a similar mechanism: by increasing the displayer's apparent size.We generated stimuli in which actors displayed high status, neutral, or low status cues that were drawn from the findings of a recent meta-analysis. We then conducted four studies that indicated that nonverbal cues that increase apparent status do so by increasing the perceived size of the displayer. Experiment 1 demonstrated that nonverbal status cues affect perceivers' judgments of physical size. The results of Experiment 2 showed that altering simple perceptual cues can affect judgments of both size and perceived status. Experiment 3 used objective measurements to demonstrate that status cues change targets' apparent size in the two-dimensional plane visible to a perceiver, and Experiment 4 showed that changes in perceived size mediate changes in perceived status, and that the cue most associated with this phenomenon is postural openness.We conclude that nonverbal cues associated with social dominance also affect the perceived size of the displayer. This suggests that certain nonverbal dominance cues in humans may function as they do in other species: by creating the appearance of changes in physical size."

Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a widespread dissemination of tumors throughout the peritoneal cavity. As peritoneal carcinomatosis is fatal in most cases, novel therapies are needed. F3 is a tumor homing peptide which is internalized into the nucleus of tumor cells upon binding to nucleolin on the cell surface. Therefore, F3 may be an appropriate carrier for alpha-particle emitting isotopes facilitating selective tumor therapies.A dimer of the vascular tumor homing peptide F3 was chemically coupled to the alpha-emitter (213)Bi ((213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2)). We found (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) to accumulate in the nucleus of tumor cells in vitro and in intraperitoneally growing tumors in vivo. To study the anti-tumor activity of (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) we treated mice bearing intraperitoneally growing xenograft tumors with (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2). In a tumor prevention study between the days 4-14 after inoculation of tumor cells 6x1.85 MBq (50 microCi) of (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) were injected. In a tumor reduction study between the days 16-26 after inoculation of tumor cells 6x1.85 MBq of (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) were injected. The survival time of the animals was increased from 51 to 93.5 days in the prevention study and from 57 days to 78 days in the tumor reduction study. No toxicity of the treatment was observed. In bio-distribution studies we found (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) to accumulate in tumors but only low activities were found in control organs except for the kidneys, where (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) is found due to renal excretion.In conclusion we report that (213)Bi-DTPA-[F3](2) is a novel tool for the targeted delivery of alpha-emitters into the nucleus of tumor cells that effectively controls peritoneal carcinomatosis in preclinical models and may also be useful in oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2072029429,"Background The unique responsiveness of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells, the major γδ subset of human peripheral blood, to non-peptidic prenyl pyrophosphate antigens constitutes the basis of current γδ T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for phosphoantigen-mediated activation of human γδ T-cells remain unclear. In particular, previous reports have described a very slow kinetics of activation of T-cell receptor (TCR)-associated signal transduction pathways by isopentenyl pyrophosphate and bromohydrin pyrophosphate, seemingly incompatible with direct binding of these antigens to the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR. Here we have studied the most potent natural phosphoantigen yet identified, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP), produced by Eubacteria and Protozoa, and examined its γδ T-cell activation and anti-tumor properties. Methodology/Principal Findings We have performed a comparative study between HMB-PP and the anti-CD3ε monoclonal antibody OKT3, used as a reference inducer of bona fide TCR signaling, and followed multiple cellular and molecular γδ T-cell activation events. We show that HMB-PP activates MEK/Erk and PI-3K/Akt pathways as rapidly as OKT3, and induces an almost identical transcriptional profile in Vγ9+ T-cells. Moreover, MEK/Erk and PI-3K/Akt activities are indispensable for the cellular effects of HMB-PP, including γδ T-cell activation, proliferation and anti-tumor cytotoxicity, which are also abolished upon antibody blockade of the Vγ9+ TCR Surprisingly, HMB-PP treatment does not induce down-modulation of surface TCR levels, and thereby sustains γδ T-cell activation upon re-stimulation. This ultimately translates in potent human γδ T-cell anti-tumor function both in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation of human leukemia cells into lymphopenic mice, Conclusions/Significance The development of efficient cancer immunotherapy strategies critically depends on our capacity to maximize anti-tumor effector T-cell responses. By characterizing the intracellular mechanisms of HMB-PP-mediated activation of the highly cytotoxic Vγ9+ T-cell subset, our data strongly support the usage of this microbial antigen in novel cancer clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2092799297,"Background Despite age-related adipose involution, T cell generation in the thymus (thymopoiesis) is maintained beyond puberty in adults. In rodents, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and GH secretagogues reverse age-related changes in thymus cytoarchitecture and increase thymopoiesis. GH administration also enhances thymic mass and function in HIV-infected patients. Until now, thymic function has not been investigated in adult GH deficiency (AGHD). The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate thymic function in AGHD, as well as the repercussion upon thymopoiesis of GH treatment for restoration of GH/IGF-1 physiological levels. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-two patients with documented AGHD were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were measured: plasma IGF-1 concentrations, signal-joint T-cell receptor excision circle (sjTREC) frequency, and sj/β TREC ratio. Analyses were performed at three time points: firstly on GH treatment at maintenance dose, secondly one month after GH withdrawal, and thirdly one month after GH resumption. After 1-month interruption of GH treatment, both plasma IGF-1 concentrations and sjTREC frequency were decreased (p<0.001). Decreases in IGF-1 and sjTREC levels were correlated (r = 0.61, p<0.01). There was also a decrease in intrathymic T cell proliferation as indicated by the reduced sj/β TREC ratio (p<0.01). One month after reintroduction of GH treatment, IGF-1 concentration and sjTREC frequency regained a level equivalent to the one before GH withdrawal. The sj/β TREC ratio also increased with GH resumption, but did not return to the level measured before GH withdrawal. Conclusions In patients with AGHD under GH treatment, GH withdrawal decreases thymic T cell output, as well as intrathymic T cell proliferation. These parameters of thymus function are completely or partially restored one month after GH resumption. These data indicate that the functional integrity of the somatotrope GH/IGF-1 axis is important for the maintenance of a normal thymus function in human adults.

https://openalex.org/W2072327661,"Background Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in successful treatment of cancers. Human ABCG2, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, plays a key role in MDR and an important role in protecting cancer stem cells. Knockout of ABCG2 had no apparent adverse effect on the mice. Thus, ABCG2 is an ideal target for development of chemo-sensitizing agents for better treatment of drug resistant cancers and helping eradicate cancer stem cells. Methods/Preliminary Findings Using rational screening of representatives from a chemical compound library, we found a novel inhibitor of ABCG2, PZ-39 (N-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[(6-{[4,6-di(4-morpholinyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino}-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetamide), that has two modes of actions by inhibiting ABCG2 activity and by accelerating its lysosome-dependent degradation. PZ-39 has no effect on ABCB1 and ABCC1-mediated drug efflux, resistance, and their expression, indicating that it may be specific to ABCG2. Analyses of its analogue compounds showed that the pharmacophore of PZ-39 is benzothiazole linked to a triazine ring backbone. Conclusion/Significance Unlike any previously known ABCG2 transporter inhibitors, PZ-39 has a novel two-mode action by inhibiting ABCG2 activity, an acute effect, and by accelerating lysosome-dependent degradation, a chronic effect. PZ-39 is potentially a valuable probe for structure-function studies of ABCG2 and a lead compound for developing therapeutics targeting ABCG2-mediated MDR in combinational cancer chemotherapy."

Here we report that mutations in the hydrophobic pocket of Munc18-1 (F115E and E132A), predicted to disrupt the N-terminal Sx1a interaction have a modest effect on binding to Sx1a in its free state, but abolish binding to the SNARE complex.

Although the function of Munc18-1 and its interaction with SNAREs have been studied for over 10 years, the molecular mechanism of Munc18-1 regulation of membrane fusion is still not clear. Munc18-1 was originally characterized as a negative regulator of exocytosis as it binds to the target membrane SNARE, Syntaxin 1a (Sx1a) (5Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) in a conformation that sequesters the Sx1a SNARE helix and inhibits SNARE complex formation (7Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Other SM proteins have been shown to bind to their cognate syntaxins via an N-terminal motif (16Bracher A. Weissenhorn W.

Cell. 2002; 2: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), allowing interactions that are associated with a positive role for SM proteins in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (20Peng R. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Despite biochemical evidence supporting a negative regulatory role for Munc18-1, there is strong genetic evidence for a critical positive role for Munc18-1 in exocytosis, as demonstrated by a Munc18-1 knock-out mouse that exhibits a complete blockage of neurotransmission (21Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Recently, a short N-terminal peptide from Sx1a was also shown to bind to Munc18-1 via a novel interaction that promotes SNARE-mediated fusion of liposomes in vitro (6Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal truncation of Sx1a only affects the binding of the open conformation of Sx1a to Munc18-1 occurring near the plasma membrane (10Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Oddly, the Munc18-1-Sx1a interaction in solution predominantly involves the closed conformation (10Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which raises the question of the relative contribution of the Sx1a N terminus to the overall Munc18-1-Sx1a interaction. To address the functional significance of the N-terminal interaction, we took a reverse strategy and investigated the molecular nature of the binding of Munc18-1 to the Sx1a N terminus and to the SNARE complex. We mutated Munc18-1:Phe115 and Glu132, which are located in an evolutionarily conserved surface pocket of Munc18-1 (17Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We found that whereas these mutations have only a mild effect on the binding of Munc18-1 to Sx1a in its free state, they completely abrogate Munc18-1 binding to the SNARE complex. Expression of these mutants in PC12 cells lacking Munc18-1 rescues exocytosis to a similar extent to that obtained with Munc18-1-WT. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of vesicle docking at the cell surface reveals that these mutations support exocytosis. However, the rate of vesicle fusion is markedly reduced at the onset of stimulation, arguing for a role of Munc18-1 in regulating the dynamics of SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion during exocytosis. Coordinates for the Munc18c-Sx4-(1–29) complex (Protein Data Bank code 2PJX) and the Munc18-1:Sx1a complexes (PDB code 1DN1) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Analysis was performed using MacPymol (PyMol, W. L. DeLano). A model for Sx1a peptide binding to domain 1 of Munc18-1 was constructed in the following way: the crystal structure of Munc18-1 was superimposed onto the crystal structure of Munc18c (from the Munc18c-Sx4-(1–29) complex). The peptide binding site of the Munc18c-Sx4-(1–29) complex was compared with the corresponding region in the overlaid Munc18-1 crystal structure. Residues in the Sx4 peptide of the crystal structure of the Munc18c-Sx4-(1–29) complex were mutated in silico to the corresponding Sx1a residues. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Figures showing model or crystal structures were generated using MacPymol. Expression of recombinant full-length rat GST-Munc18-1 (GST-Munc18-1-WT) in the pGEX-KG vector has been described previously (24Latham C.F. Osborne S.L. Cryle M.J. Meunier F.A. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1543-1554PubMed Google Scholar). Various point mutants (GST-Munc18-1-F115E, GST-Munc18-1-E132A, and GST-Munc18-1-F115E/E132A) were constructed from the GST-Munc18-1 pGEX-KG vector using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and mutation primers as follows: GST-Munc18-1-F115E, forward 5′-CATGTCCAGATGCCCTGGAAAACGAGCTGGTAAAATC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GATTTTACCAGCTCGTTTTCCAGGGCATCTGGACATG-3′; GST-Munc18-1-E132A, forward 5′-CATCAAGACGCTGACGGCAATCAACATTGCGTTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTAGTTCTGCGACTGCCGTTAGTTGTAACGCAAAG-3′. A C-terminal truncated GST-Munc18-1 mutant (GST-Munc18-1-dom1, residues 1–132) was constructed by introducing a STOP codon at bp 394 (Gly to Thr) using the QuikChange kit. An N-terminal truncated Munc18-1 mutant (GST-Munc18-1-dom2/3, residues 132–594) was constructed by introducing an EcoRI site at residue 132 by mutagenesis (primers: forward, 5′-CATCAAGACGCTGACGGAATTCAACATTGCGTTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAAACGCAATGTTGAATTCCGTCAGCGTCTTGATG-3′). After digestion with EcoRI, the fragment corresponding to residues 132–594 was ligated into pGEX-KG also digested with EcoRI. pCMV5-Munc18-1-F115E/E132A plasmids containing the silent mutations were constructed using the same strategy using pCMV5-Munc18-1-WT as template. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Venus and pXGHF-human growth hormone (hGH) were also used to transfect PC12-KD43 cells as previously described (25Arunachalam L. Han L. Tassew N.G. He Y. Wang L. Xie L. Fujita Y. Kwan E. Davletov B. Monnier P.P. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GST-VAMP2 (residues 1–94) and GST-SNAP25 (residues 1–206) were both expressed in pGEX-KG. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by autoinduction in pGEX-KG. His6-tagged Sx1a (Sx1a-His) (residues 1–265) was also expressed in pHO4c using the autoinduction method. All GST fusion proteins were purified using similar methods to those previously described (18Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The GST tag was cleaved from purified GST-Munc18-1 proteins using bovine thrombin overnight at room temperature in standard buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Β-mercaptoethanol) containing 3 mm CaCl2. GST-SNAP25 was eluted from glutathione beads with standard buffer containing 20 mm glutathione. His6-tagged Sx1a was purified using Co2+-affinity beads (Scientifix) in standard buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, then eluted with standard buffer containing 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The SNARE complex was produced by combining Sx1a-His, GST-SNAP25, and VAMP2 in a 1:1.5:2 ratio and incubating overnight at 4 °C in standard buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The complex was isolated on Co2+-affinity beads via the His tag on Sx1a. Detagged Munc18-1-WT (1.3 mg/ml), Munc18-1-F115E (1.3 mg/ml), Munc18-1-E132A (2.3 mg/ml), and Munc18-1-F115E/E132A (2.3 mg/ml) were analyzed by circular dichroism to whether the mutation caused changes in the protein secondary structure compared with Munc18-1-WT. Five replicates of each spectrum were measured on a J-810 polarimeter (Jasco) in a quartz demountable cuvette with a path length of 0.01 cm (Hellma) using a dwell time of 1 s, a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, and data pitch of 1 nm. Pulldown assays were performed by first isolating tagged proteins on affinity beads, then incubating with a molar excess of purified protein in solution. For all pulldown assays, the concentration of protein bound to the beads was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ and a bovine serum albumin standard curve. For the pulldown assay with Munc18-1-WT point and truncated mutants, a 3-fold molar excess of detagged Munc18 was incubated with Sx1a-His beads in standard buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Munc18-1-WT or mutant binding to Sx1a was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ and compared for three independent experiments. For SNARE complex pulldown assays, SNARE complex-bound beads were incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of Munc18-1-WT, Munc18-1-F115E, or Munc18-1-F115E/E132A at 4 °C in standard buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. After extensive washing, proteins bound to beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using standard procedures. Western blot was performed for detection of Munc18-1 using anti-Munc18-1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Synaptic Systems). Syntaxin1a-(2–243) was prepared as previously described (26Deák F. Xu Y. Chang W.P. Dulubova I. Khvotchev M. Liu X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Munc18-1-WT and Munc18-1-F115E/E132A used for the ITC experiment were prepared as previously described (18Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (ITC buffer). ITC was carried out at 298 K using a MicroCal iTC200, with 13 × 3.1-μl injections of 25 μm Sx1a-(2–243) (30 μg in 40 μl) into 2.5 μm Munc18-1-WT or Munc18-1-F115E/E132A (32 μg in 200 μl). Integration of the titration curves was performed using ORIGIN to extract thermodynamic parameters, stoichiometry N, equilibrium association constant Ka (=Kd−1) and the binding enthalpy ΔH. The Gibbs free energy of binding ΔG was calculated from the relation ΔG = −RT ln(Ka) and the binding entropy ΔS was deduced from the equation (ΔG = ΔH − TΔS). Experiments were performed with protein concentrations well within the recommended range for the c-value (concentration of protein in cell/Kd ∼ 100). Binding paramaters were calculated as the average of three independent experiments mean ± S.E. For rescue of Sx1a localization, Munc18-1 knockdown PC12-KD43 cells were transfected with empty pCMV5, pCMV5-Munc18-1-WT, or pCMV5-Munc18-1-F115E/E132A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were briefly washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and double-immunolabeled with anti-Munc18-1 (Synaptic Systems) and anti-Syntaxin1a (HPC-1, Sigma) antibodies followed by Alexa 488 and Alexa 546 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively. For NPY-Venus and hGH colocalization experiments, PC12-KD43 cells were co-transfected with plasmids pCMV-NPY-Venus and pXGH5-hGH, expressing Venus-tagged NPY and hGH, respectively. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed, fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), and immunolabeled with anti-hGH antibody, followed by Alexa 546 secondary antibody. Cells were visualized and images acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope as previously described (27Wen P.J. Osborne S.L. Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Domin J. Meunier F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Munc18-1 knockdown PC12 cells (KD43) at 70–80% confluence in 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-NPY-hPLAP (to express NPY fused with soluble human placental alkaline phosphatase) and 15 μg of empty pCMV5 (for control) or pCMV-Munc18-1 (silent mutations) (for rescue of the wild type or the indicated mutant) using electroporation (25Arunachalam L. Han L. Tassew N.G. He Y. Wang L. Xie L. Fujita Y. Kwan E. Davletov B. Monnier P.P. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were harvested and re-plated in 24-well plates. 6 or 7 days after electroporation, the plated cells were washed once with physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and NPY-hPLAP secretion was stimulated with 200 μl of PSS or high K+-PSS (containing 81 mm NaCl and 70 mm KCl). Secretion was terminated after a 20-min incubation at 37 °C by chilling to 0 °C, and samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of PSS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The amounts of NPY-hPLAP secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured by the Phospha-Light Reporter Gene Assay System (Applied Biosystems). Samples treated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate non-placental alkaline phosphatases and an aliquot (10 μl) was assayed for placental alkaline phosphatase activity with the kit. The total volume of the assay was 120 μl. After 5 to 10 min, chemiluminescence was quantified by a FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). PC12-KD43 cells were plated on a 6-well tissue culture plate (Techno Plastic Plate). pXGH5 vector encoding hGH (1.6 μg/well) either alone or together with mammalian expression vectors encoding proteins as indicated in the figure (0.8 μg/well) were co-transfected in PC12-KD43 cells with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 72 h after transfection, PC12-KD43 cells were briefly washed with PSS and either stimulated with PSS or high K+ PSS buffer (containing 81 mm NaCl and 70 mm KCl) for 20 min at 37 °C. Secretion was terminated by chilling to 0 °C and supernatants were used for the hGH assay as previously described (28Osborne S.L. Wen P.J. Boucheron C. Nguyen H.N. Hayakawa M. Kaizawa H. Parker P.J. Vitale N. Meunier F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2804-2813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For totals, cells were solubilized on ice in 1% Triton X-100 in PSS buffer containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). The amount of secretion from co-transfected cells was determined as the percentage of unstimulated hGH released using an hGH ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics) as previously described (29Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4841-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Plotted data are representative of three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate. TIRF imaging was done using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a ×60 TIRF objective and 1.45 N.A. objective illuminated with a 10-milliwatt argon laser (Melles Griot). Images were captured using the Hamamatsu ORCA1-ER camera controlled by Metamorph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging). Time-lapse images were acquired every 5 s for 5 min at room temperature. PC12-KD43 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged human growth hormone (hGH-GFP) and either pCMV5-Munc18-1-WT or pCMV5-Munc18-1-F115E/E132A using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were then plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom microwell dish (35 mm) (MatTek) and allowed to express for 48 h. Cells were then washed in Buffer A (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) and imaged in Buffer A supplemented with Ca2+ (2 mm). Cells were stimulated using 100 μm nicotine 30 s following the onset of acquisition. Following TIRF image acquisition, hGH-GFP-labeled granules entering the evanescence field were analyzed by particle tracking using Slidebook software (Version 4.2.0.13, Intelligent Innovation Imaging). The path lifetime of single vesicle tracks was followed immediately after application of nicotine until the disappearance of hGH-GFP-labeled vesicles. The mean square displacement (MSD) of tracked vesicle motion was calculated from the Slidebook software and plotted against increment time interval. MSD plots can be fitted to different equations describing vesicle motions in three different categories (30Steyer J.A. Almers W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2262-2271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The simple diffusion motion is described by the following linear equation, MSD(Δt)=6DΔt+CEq. 1 where C is an offset constant related to the accuracy of the tracking algorithm. From the second-order polynomial fit information about the velocity v and diffusion coefficient D was obtained by fitting MSD to, MSD(Δt)=v2Δt2+6DΔt+CEq. 2 The third case, restricted diffusion, is described by the following equation in terms of the radius of the cage R, diffusion coefficient, and two constants (a1 = 0.9, a2 = 0.85). MSD(Δt)=R2[1-a1exp(-6a2DΔt/R2)]+6DΔt+CEq. 3 When analyzing the MSD of hGH-GFP positive granules for both Munc18-1-WT and Munc18-1-F115E/E132A, the best fit was obtained with Equation 2. The velocity was therefore extracted from Equation 2. Background correction and contrast adjustment of raw images were done either using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (version 9) or SlideBook (version 4.2.0.13; Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Vesicle tracking and analysis were performed using Slidebook and the results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Data analysis was carried out using unpaired Student’s t tests. Experiments were performed at least 3 times. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E., and data are considered significant at: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. Phe115 and Glu132 are key Munc18-1 residues predicted to mediate the interaction between the N-terminal peptide of Sx1a and a predominantly hydrophobic pocket on the surface of Munc18-1 (Fig. 1). Initially, we used a model of the Munc18-1-Sx1a N-terminal interaction and compared interactions with the crystal structure of the closely related SM protein, Munc18c (Fig. 1B, top panel). Our Munc18-1-Sx1a model (Fig. 1B, middle panel) was supported by the newly refined model for the crystal structure of the Munc18-1-Sx1a complex recently reported by Burkhardt and colleagues (22Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The key interaction is formed between Munc18c/Phe119 and Sx4/Leu8 (17Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is conserved in the Munc18-1-Sx1a interaction (Fig. 1, B and C) as well as other SM:Syntaxin cognate partners exhibiting the N-terminal binding mode (17Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8773-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a conserved DRT motif of Sx1a (D3, R4, T5) has been shown to contribute to interactions with Munc18-1 via the hydrophobic pocket (17Hu S.H. Latham C.F. Gee C.L. James D.E. Martin J.L.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12147-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on the structural analysis, Glu132 can form an electrostatic interaction with Arg4 in this motif. We aimed to investigate the impact of two key Munc18-1 residues, Glu132 and Phe115, on binding to Sx1a. We constructed two point mutants of Munc18-1 at residue Phe115 (Munc18-1-F115E) and at residue Glu132 (Munc18-1-E132A), as well as a double mutant (Munc18-1-F115E/E132A), to disrupt the binding pocket and examine their contribution to the interactions with Sx1a alone and with the SNARE complex. We first compared the interaction of Sx1a with our four Munc18-1 constructs: Munc18-1-WT, Munc18-1-F115E, Munc18-1-E132A, and Munc18-1-F115E/E132A. In addition, two other truncated Munc18-1 constructs were tested for Sx1a binding, Munc18-1-dom1, which contains only domain 1 of Munc18-1 (residues 1–132), and Munc18-1-dom2/3, consisting of domains 2 and 3 only (residues 132–594) (Fig. S1). His-tagged Sx1a was tethered to Co2+-affinity beads and incubated with de-tagged Munc18-1-WT and the three mutants, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B). In this strategy, the GST tag was removed from the N terminus of the Munc18-1 proteins and the Sx1a was tethered to the beads via its C-terminal His tag. As expected, Munc18-1-WT bound to Sx1a-His. However, when compared with Munc18-1-WT, the Munc18-1 mutants showed a significant reduction in Sx1a binding (Fig. 2B) or in the case of the truncated mutants, no detectable binding to Sx1a at all (Fig. S1). It should be noted that the point mutants still displayed a relatively high affinity as discerned by the strong intensity bands detected in Coomassie-stained gels. This is not surprising considering the independent peptide binding surface represents only ∼25% of the total buried surface area when full-length Sx1a is bound to Munc18-1 (790 Å2 of a total of 4940 Å2) (22Burkhardt P. Hattendorf D.A. Weis W.I. Fasshauer D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Neither of the truncated Munc18-1 proteins, dom1 and dom2/3, bound to Sx1a-His indicating that the intact full-length Munc18-1 protein is required (Fig. S1). The reduced Sx1a binding observed for Munc18-1-F115E, Munc18-1-E132A, and double mutant Munc18-1-F115E/E132A was quantified and compared with WT Sx1a binding (n = 3). The Phe115 mutation resulted in ∼40% reduction in binding to Sx1a compared with Munc18-1-WT (Fig. 2C), whereas the Glu132 mutation resulted in ∼30% decrease"
https://openalex.org/W2022363230,"Real networks, including biological networks, are known to have the small-world property, characterized by a small “diameter”, which is defined as the average minimal path length between all pairs of nodes in a network. Because random networks also have short diameters, one may predict that the diameter of a real network should be even shorter than its random expectation, because having shorter diameters potentially increases the network efficiency such as minimizing transition times between metabolic states in the context of metabolic networks. Contrary to this expectation, we here report that the observed diameter is greater than the random expectation in every real network examined, including biological, social, technological, and linguistic networks. Simulations show that a modest enlargement of the diameter beyond its expectation allows a substantial increase of the network modularity, which is present in all real networks examined. Hence, short diameters appear to be sacrificed for high modularities, suggesting a tradeoff between network efficiency and advantages offered by modularity (e.g., multi-functionality, robustness, and/or evolvability)."
https://openalex.org/W2042632827,"Background Lipoatrophy is known to be associated with stavudine as part of the treatment for HIV infection, but it is less clear if this serious side effect is also related to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like zidovudine. We aimed to determine whether zidovudine-sparing first-line antiretroviral therapy would lead to less lipoatrophy and other metabolic changes than zidovudine-containing therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings Fifty antiretroviral therapy-naïve HIV-1 infected men with an indication to start antiretroviral therapy were included in a randomized single blinded clinical trial. Randomisation was between zidovudine-containing therapy (zidovudine/lamivudine+lopinavir/ritonavir) and zidovudine-sparing therapy (nevirapine+lopinavir/ritonavir). Main outcome measures were body composition assessed by computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and lipid profile before and after 3, 12, 24 months of antiretroviral therapy. In the zidovudine/lamivudine+lopinavir/ritonavir group, from 3 months onward limb fat decreased progressively by 684±293 grams (estimated mean±standard error of the mean)(p = 0.02) up to 24 months whereas abdominal fat increased, but exclusively in the visceral compartment (+21.9±8.1 cm2, p = 0.008)). In contrast, in the nevirapine+lopinavir/ritonavir group, a generalized increase in fat mass was observed. After 24 months no significant differences in high density lipoprotein and total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were found between both treatment groups, but total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher in the nevirapine+lopinavir/ritonavir group (6.1±0.2 versus 5.3±0.2 and 3.6±0.1 versus 2.8±0.1 mmol/l respectively, p<0.05). Virologic response and safety were comparable in both groups. Conclusions/Significance Zidovudine/lamivudine+lopinavir/ritonavir, but not nevirapine+lopinavir/ritonavir in antiretroviral therapy-naïve patients, is associated with lipoatrophy and greater relative intraabdominal lipohypertrophy, suggesting that zidovudine/lamivudine contributes to both these features of lipodystrophy. These findings support to no longer consider zidovudine/lamivudine as one of the preferred possible components of first-line antiretroviral therapy where alternative treatments are available.

https://openalex.org/W1988583684,"Background Effective prevention of excessive alcohol use has the potential to reduce the public burden of disease considerably. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) for excessive alcohol use in primary care in the Netherlands, which is targeted at early detection and treatment of ‘at-risk’ drinkers. Methodology and Results We compared a SBI scenario (opportunistic screening and brief intervention for ‘at-risk’ drinkers) in general practices with the current practice scenario (no SBI) in the Netherlands. We used the RIVM Chronic Disease Model (CDM) to extrapolate from decreased alcohol consumption to effects on health care costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. In total, 56,000 QALYs were gained at an additional cost of €298,000,000 due to providing alcohol SBI in the target population, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of €5,400 per QALY gained. Conclusion Prevention of excessive alcohol use by implementing SBI for excessive alcohol use in primary care settings appears to be cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W2033860017,"Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed pharmacologically active substances. Its acute effect on myocardial blood flow is widely unknown. Our aim was to assess the acute effect of caffeine in a dose corresponding to two cups of coffee on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in coronary artery disease (CAD).MBF was measured with (15)O-labelled H2O and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at rest and after supine bicycle exercise in controls (n = 15, mean age 58+/-13 years) and in CAD patients (n = 15, mean age 61+/-9 years). In the latter, regional MBF was assessed in segments subtended by stenotic and remote coronary arteries. All measurements were repeated fifty minutes after oral caffeine ingestion (200 mg). Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was calculated as ratio of MBF during bicycle stress divided by MBF at rest. Resting MBF was not affected by caffeine in both groups. Exercise-induced MBF response decreased significantly after caffeine in controls (2.26+/-0.56 vs. 2.02+/-0.56, P<0.005), remote (2.40+/-0.70 vs. 1.78+/-0.46, P<0.001) and in stenotic segments (1.90+/-0.41 vs. 1.38+/-0.30, P<0.001). Caffeine decreased MPR significantly by 14% in controls (P<0.05 vs. baseline). In CAD patients MPR decreased by 18% (P<0.05 vs. baseline) in remote and by 25% in stenotic segments (P<0.01 vs. baseline).We conclude that caffeine impairs exercise-induced hyperaemic MBF response in patients with CAD to a greater degree than age-matched controls."
https://openalex.org/W2048286796,"A genome-wide silencing screen in Drosophila has identified a novel player in apoptosis. In their screen Chew et al. combined a library of double-stranded RNAs together with a chemical antagonist of Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Thus they identified a set of validated targets necessary for death by several stimuli. Among these, Tango7 is identified as a novel effector for apoptosis in flies. Caspases, and the proximal regulators of caspases, are central to the core machinery of apoptosis. The results of a genome-wide silencing screen in Drosophila—using a strategy combining a library of double-stranded RNAs together with a chemical antagonist of Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)—now reveals a set of validated targets necessary for cell death provoked by several stimuli, as well as a new effector for apoptosis, Tango7. Apoptosis is a conserved form of programmed cell death firmly established in the aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment of many human diseases. Central to the core machinery of apoptosis are the caspases and their proximal regulators. Current models for caspase control involve a balance of opposing elements, with variable contributions from positive and negative regulators among different cell types and species1. To advance a comprehensive view of components that support caspase-dependent cell death, we conducted a genome-wide silencing screen in the Drosophila model. Our strategy used a library of double-stranded RNAs together with a chemical antagonist of Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) that simulates the action of native regulators in the Reaper and Smac (also known as Diablo) families2. Here we present a highly validated set of targets that is necessary for death provoked by several stimuli. Among these, Tango7 is identified as a new effector. Cells depleted for this gene resisted apoptosis at a step before the induction of effector caspase activity, and the directed silencing of Tango7 in Drosophila prevented caspase-dependent programmed cell death. Unlike known apoptosis regulators in this model system3, Tango7 activity did not influence stimulus-dependent loss of Drosophila DIAP1 (also known as th and IAP1), but instead regulated levels of the apical caspase Dronc (Nc). Similarly, the human Tango7 counterpart, PCID1 (also known as EIF3M), impinged on caspase 9, revealing a new regulatory axis affecting the apoptosome."
https://openalex.org/W2049934148,"Background Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs is illegal in Canada as a health protection measure, but is permitted in the United States. However, in 2000, Canadian policy was changed to allow ‘reminder’ advertising of prescription drugs. This is a form of advertising that states the brand name without health claims. ‘Reminder’ advertising is prohibited in the US for drugs that have ‘black box’ warnings of serious risks. This study examines spending on DTCA in Canada from 1995 to 2006, 12 years spanning this policy shift. We ask how annual per capita spending compares to that in the US, and whether drugs with Canadian or US regulatory safety warnings are advertised to the Canadian public in reminder advertising. Methodology/Principal Findings Prescription drug advertising spending data were extracted from a data set on health sector spending in Canada obtained from a market research company, TNS Media Inc. Spending was adjusted for inflation and compared with US spending. Inflation-adjusted spending on branded DTCA in Canada grew from under CAD$2 million per year before 1999 to over $22 million in 2006. The major growth was in broadcast advertising, accounting for 83% of spending in 2006. US annual per capita spending was on average 24 times Canadian levels. Celebrex (celecoxib), which has a US black box and was subject to three safety advisories in Canada, was the most heavily advertised drug on Canadian television in 2005 and 2006. Of 8 brands with >$500,000 spending, which together accounted for 59% of branded DTCA in all media, 6 were subject to Canadian safety advisories, and 4 had US black box warnings. Conclusions/Significance Branded ‘reminder’ advertising has grown rapidly in Canada since 2000, mainly due to a growth in television advertising. Although DTCA spending per capita is much lower in Canada than in the US, there is no evidence of safer content or product choice; many heavily-advertised drugs in Canada have been subject to safety advisories. For governments searching for compromise solutions to industry pressure for expanded advertising, Canada's experience stands as a stark warning."
https://openalex.org/W1976124825,"There is evidence that slow wave sleep (SWS) promotes the consolidation of memories that are subserved by mediotemporal- and hippocampo-cortical neural networks. In contrast to implicit memories, explicit memories are accompanied by conscious (attentive and controlled) processing. Awareness at pre-sleep encoding has been recognized as critical for the off-line memory consolidation. The present study elucidated the role of task-dependent cortical activation guided by attentional control at pre-sleep encoding for the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories during sleep.A task with a hidden regularity was used (Number Reduction Task, NRT), in which the responses that can be implicitly predicted by the hidden regularity activate hippocampo-cortical networks more strongly than responses that cannot be predicted. Task performance was evaluated before and after early-night sleep, rich in SWS, and late-night sleep, rich in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In implicit conditions, slow cortical potentials (SPs) were analyzed to reflect the amount of controlled processing and the localization of activated neural task representations.During implicit learning before sleep, the amount of controlled processing did not differ between unpredictable and predictable responses, nor between early- and late-night sleep groups. A topographic re-distribution of SPs indicating a spatial reorganization occurred only after early, not after late sleep, and only for predictable responses. These SP changes correlated with the amount of SWS and were covert because off-line RT decrease did not differentiate response types or sleep groups.It is concluded that SWS promotes the neural reorganization of task representations that rely on the hippocampal system despite absence of conscious access to these representations.Original neurophysiologic evidence is provided for the role of SWS in the consolidation of memories encoded with hippocampo-cortical interaction before sleep. It is demonstrated that this SWS-mediated mechanism does not depend critically on explicitness at learning nor on the amount of controlled executive processing during pre-sleep encoding."

The fourth enzymatic step in the pseudaminic acid pathway, the hydrolysis of UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-β-l-altropyranose to generate 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-l-altropyranose, is performed by the nucleotide sugar hydrolase PseG. To better understand the molecular basis of the PseG catalytic reaction, we have determined the crystal structures of C. jejuni PseG in apo-form and as a complex with its UDP product at 1.8 and 1.85 Å resolution, respectively. In addition, molecular modeling was utilized to provide insight into the structure of the PseG-substrate complex.

Furthermore, based on these structures a series of amino acid substitution derivatives were constructed, altering residues within the active site, and each was kinetically characterized to examine its contribution to PseG catalysis. In conjunction with structural comparisons, the almost complete inactivation of the PseG H17F and H17L derivatives suggests that His17 functions as an active site base, thereby activating the nucleophilic water molecule for attack of the anomeric C–O bond of the UDP-sugar.

The CMP-Pse biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) is similar to that of CMP-sialic acid, involving condensation of an N-acetylhexosamine intermediate with the three-carbon pyruvate molecule forming a nine-carbon sialic acid-like nonulosonate, although in contrast the CMP-Pse pathway consists of several more steps between the initial building block UDP-GlcNAc and the condensation reaction. PseG, a UDP-sugar hydrolase, produces the final 6-deoxy-N-acetylhexosamine intermediate in the CMP-Pse pathway by removing the nucleotide moiety from UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-β-l-altropyranose or UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (Fig. 1). This sort of single enzymatic function is rare in nature, with the only other similar example being a GDP-mannose/GDP-glucose hydrolase (16Legler P.M. Massiah M.A. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8603-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which belongs to the metal-dependent Nudix family of enzymes. In an elegant study, Liu and Tanner (11Liu F. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20902-20909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PseG catalyzes nucleotide removal by a metal-independent C–O bond cleavage mechanism resulting in inversion of stereochemistry at C-1 of the product 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-l-altropyranose or 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, similar to the catalytic properties of some GT-B glycosyltransferases. Together, glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases compose the majority of enzymes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes that manipulate glycosidic bonds. Glycosyltransferases of the Leloir classification use sugar-nucleotide derivatives as glycosyl donors resulting in transfer to acceptors such as a monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide. It is therefore plausible that a “glycosyltransferase fold” in PseG has evolved to efficiently utilize water as an acceptor, instead of another carbohydrate, consequently behaving as a hydrolase (11Liu F. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20902-20909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on structure, most glycosyltransferases fall into two groups, GT-A and GT-B, that exhibit different folds, respectively (17Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). For both families, depending on the particular enzyme, the outcome may result in either inversion or retention of stereochemistry for the donor anomeric carbon (see Fig. 2). In addition, GT-B family enzymes are metal-independent, lacking an important DXD motif present in most GT-A members. Based on the novelty of PseG and its role in H. pylori pathogenicity, we sought a greater structural and mechanistic understanding of this important enzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of PseG alone at 1.8 Å resolution and in complex with UDP, a product of the reaction, at 1.85 Å resolution. Although very few homologs have been identified based on sequence similarity alone, PseG bears the closest structural similarity to MurG, a GT-B family member (18Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, computational docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to gain insight into the binding mode of the PseG substrate UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. Based on the crystallographic and modeled structures, several potential active site residues were selected for mutagenesis and kinetic analyses to further characterize the PseG active site. The relevance of these findings to the structurally related MurG family of enzymes is discussed. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with pNRC17.1 (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 8C-14CCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as template and the mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S1. The newly constructed plasmids were sequenced as described previously (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 8C-14CCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein production was performed using the expression strain BL21[DE3] (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing pseG-His6 from C. jejuni 11168 cloned in-frame in pET30a (Novagen) yielding the plasmid pNRC17.1 (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 8C-14CCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or mutant derivatives. The original pNRC17.1 plasmid encodes for a PseG E155K substitution (PseGHis6), in addition to those described here. This PseG E155K derivative or PseGHis6 was found to have activity similar to that of wild-type enzyme. For CD spectroscopic and kinetic analyses, PseGHis6 and substitution derivatives were purified as described previously (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 8C-14CCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm MgCl2 was absent from lysis and dialysis buffers (see supplemental Figs.

Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using A2800.1% values (PseGHis6, PseGHis6-H17F, PseGHis6-H17L, PseGHis6-H17N, and PseGHis6-N255A 0.826; PseGHis6-Y78F 0.780). For crystallization, PseGHis6 was expressed in 1 liter of TB medium containing 30 μg ml−1 kanamycin. The culture was first grown for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by induction with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an overnight period at room temperature. The same induction protocol was followed to express the selenomethionine (SeMet)-containing protein in the Escherichia coli metA− auxotroph DL41(DE3) in LeMaster medium (19Hendrickson W.A.

Cells were disrupted by sonication for a total of 2 min with alternating cycles of 15 s on and 15 s off. The lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 45 min), and the protein supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 1 h with gentle shaking. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were washed first with buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) followed by a similar buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and 40 mm imidazole to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Elution was performed in the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Purity of the eluted protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. A total of 9 mg of pure native protein and 5 mg of SeMet-labeled protein was obtained using this procedure. The protein buffer was changed to 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2 prior to concentration by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 9 mg ml−1 as determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Large scale enzymatic synthesis of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc was accomplished using a 45-ml reaction containing 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 1 mm pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, 10 mml-glutamate, 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA, and ∼10 mg each of H. pylori PseBHis6, His6PseC, and His6PseH, similar to methods described previously (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 8C-14CCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After passage through an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (10,000 molecular weight cutoff), the sugar preparation was lyophilized and desalted/purified using a Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9. For kinetic analysis, the sample was subjected to a final polishing step using a Mono Q 4.6/100 PE column (Amersham Biosciences) with a 25–500 mm ammonium bicarbonate gradient, pH 7.9, over 20 column volumes. Purified fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Finally, quantification was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of UDP (ϵ260 = 10,000). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter (Utrecht, Netherlands) with a 0.05-cm quartz cuvette at ambient temperature (20–22 °C). The instrument was calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate. Wavelengths from 190 to 260 nm were measured with a 0.2-nm step resolution, a 2.0-nm bandwidth, and 20-nm/min scan speed. All CD experiments were performed with protein samples in a buffer consisting of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 25 mm NaCl. The final concentrations of the proteins were 0.098–0.104 mg/ml, calculated from the absorption at 280 nm. Four scans were collected and averaged, and the data were smoothed using the Jasco software. Data are expressed per peptide bond as mean residue ellipticity [θ]×10−3 (degrees cm2 dmol−1). For routine analysis of enzyme activity, PseGHis6 or respective substitution derivatives were incubated at 37 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 25 mm NaCl, with UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, and reactions were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis as described earlier (14Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, substrate conversion was measured using a continuous coupled assay for UDP formation by monitoring NADH oxidation (21Gosselin S. Alhussaini M. Streiff M.B. Takabayashi K. Palcic M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Specifically, enzyme reactions (150 μl each) were performed in a 96-well microplate at 37 °C with 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 12 units each of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and variable UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc concentrations (0.03–2 mm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of PseGHis6 derivatives (1.5–90 nm final concentration) as required. Substrate conversion was extrapolated from A340 versus [NADH] standard curves using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT), where initial [NADH] was determined using the molar extinction coefficient for NADH (ϵ340 = 6220) and a quartz cuvette. Kinetic constants were calculated using initial velocities and Eadie-Hofstee plots with the program GraphPad Prism 3. Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro plate reader (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) using purified PseG at a concentration of 14 mg ml−1 in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2. The mass of native and SeMet-substituted PseGHis6 was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1100 Series LC-MSD mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and analyzed using Agilent Chemstation version A.09.01 software. Initial crystallization screening was performed in 96-well sitting drop plates using crystallization screens from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA) with a Hydra II crystallization robot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hudson, NH). Well diffracting crystals were obtained from two reservoir conditions (a and b), following optimization from initial screens, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C as follows: condition a, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 23% (v/v) PEG 3350; condition b, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5, 50 mm CaCl2, 25% (v/v) PEG monomethyl ether 550. Crystals of SeMet-substituted protein were obtained under the same conditions but by increasing the precipitant concentration by 2–3% (v/v). PseGHis6 crystals obtained by co-crystallization in the presence of 1 mm UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, 5 mm UDP-glucosamine, or 5 mm UDP-N-acetylglucosamine were obtained under the same conditions. Crystals obtained with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine showed electron density only for UDP and were used to determine the co-crystal structure. For cryoprotection prior to x-ray diffraction data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 15% glycerol (v/v) for crystals from condition a and with reservoir solution alone for crystals from condition b, picked up with a nylon loop and flash-cooled directly in the N2 cold stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Apo- and UDP-bound PseGHis6 crystals belong to space group P41 with the apo-form having unit cell dimensions of a = b = 93.6, c = 42.7 and Z = 4, and a Matthews coefficient of 2.9 Da Å−1 (22Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), whereas UDP-bound PseGHis6 crystals have a unit cell of a = b = 94.4, c = 43.6 and Z = 4. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamlines X12B and X29, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using a Quantum-4 CCD detector (X12B) or Quantum-315 detector (X29) (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). For phase determination, data collected at the selenium anomalous peak were used in the selenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method (19Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO. J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). All three selenium sites present in the asymmetric unit were identified using SHELXD (23Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81072) Google Scholar) with cross-correlation values of 42.3 and 25.1 for all and weak reflections, respectively. Initial phases were calculated using SHELXE (23Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81072) Google Scholar), and the resulting maps were used directly for automated model building with ARP/wARP (24Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The resulting model was 70% complete with remaining residues fit manually using the program COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The final model of PseGHis6 was refined using Refmac5 (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) to a final Rwork and Rfree of 0.193 and 0.237, respectively, for all reflections to 1.8 Å. No σ-cutoff was used in the refinement. The apo-PseGHis6 structure was used as the starting model for molecular replacement, phase calculation, and refinement with data sets obtained for PseGHis6 co-crystallized with ligands. In all cases, the resulting electron density maps clearly indicated the presence of bound UDP, which was modeled using the program COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The PseGHis6-UDP complex was refined to 1.85 Å resolution with a final Rwork and Rfree of 0.177 and 0.211, respectively. Final refinement statistics for both models are given in Table 1. Coordinates for apo- and UDP-bound PseGHis6 have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (27Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

Open table in a new tab To facilitate molecular modeling of PseG-bound substrate, several energetically favorable free-substrate conformations (OGly-methylated) were calculated. All “free” structures were first optimized using the AM1 Hamiltonian as implemented in Hyperchem 6.0, starting from idealized ring structures, including several boat structures. Three different ring structures 4C1, 1C4, and 5S1 were found. Each structure then had the hydroxyl rotamers optimized by using the conformational search routine available in Hyperchem. These three structures were then optimized using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF-2006) DFT QM program. Optimized structures were checked by frequency calculations (analytical second derivatives) for true convergence. Structures that exhibited negative frequencies were re-optimized using the coefficients of the negative modes to adjust the Cartesian coordinates and the optimization, with the frequency calculations repeated until all modes were positive. All structures were optimized as internal coordinates using the triple ζ plus basis set with no frozen core. Keywords used for the DFT calculations were LDA, SCF, VWN, METAGGA, and HFEXCHANGE (see ADF manual). Full solvation was considered parameterized to water. For further free conformer (4C1, 1C4, and 5S1) details, see supplemental Fig. S3. Substrate docking was performed on the UDP-bound PseGHis6 crystal structure, after removal of UDP, C-terminal fusion tag extension Leu-Glu-His6, and water molecules. The protonation state of PseG was assigned with H++ (28Gordon J.C. Myers J.B. Folta T. Shoja V. Heath L.S. Onufriev A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W368-W371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc substrate was built in Sybyl 6.9 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO), starting from the PseG-bound conformation of UDP to which the 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc sugar moiety was appropriately connected. Three substrate conformations were separately built, corresponding to the 1C4 chair, 4C1 chair, and 5S1 twist-boat sugar conformations calculated for the free OGly-methylated sugar as described earlier. Flexible docking of the sugar part of the substrate was carried out by Monte Carlo minimization (MCM) conformational sampling (29Li Z. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) applied to protein-ligand binding (30Rangarajan E.S. Ruane K.M. Sulea T. Watson D.C. Proteau A. Leclerc S. Cygler M. Matte A. Young N.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The crystallographic binding mode of the UDP product was adopted for the UDP part of the substrate. Three independent docking runs of 10,000 MCM cycles were carried out, initiated from the expected 1C4, 4C1, and 5S1 conformations for the 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc sugar moiety. Conformational sampling included all acyclic and cyclic rotatable bonds starting from the P-α atom and covered the pyrophosphate and 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc moieties. In each MCM cycle, at least two dihedral angles were simultaneously and randomly perturbed. The O-5–C-1 endocyclic sugar bond was used for pyranose ring opening and reforming during sampling. The minimized energy of the complex formed the basis of accepting or rejecting the resulting conformation according to the Metropolis probability criterion at 300 K. Energy minimization was carried out with the AMBER force field (31Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem.

Ligand partial charges were calculated with Molcharge (OpenEye, Inc., Santa Fe, NM) based on the AM1-BCC method (33Jakalian A. Bush B.L. Jack D.B. Bayly C.I."
https://openalex.org/W2057186273,"Pirh2 is a newly identified E3 ubiquitin ligase known to inhibit tumor suppressor p53 function via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We have identified two novel Pirh2 splice variants that encode different Pirh2 isoforms and named these Pirh2B and Pirh2C. Accordingly, the full-length protein is now classified as isoform Pirh2A. The central region of Pirh2 harbors a RING finger domain that is critical for its ubiquitin ligase function. The Pirh2B isoform lacks amino acids 171-179, whereas Pirh2C is missing C-terminal amino acids 180-261, which for each isoform results in a RING domain deletion and the abrogation of ubiquitin ligase activity. Our findings further indicate that the Pirh2B isoform but not the Pirh2C isoform is capable of binding to Pirh2A, suggesting that the C-terminal region absent in Pirh2C is critical for Pirh2-Pirh2 interactions. Similar to Pirh2A, both Pirh2B and Pirh2C interact with p53; however, interactions between p53 and Pirh2B appear stronger than those between p53 and Pirh2C. Interestingly, although both Pirh2B and Pirh2C are not able to promote in vitro p53 ubiquitination, both are capable of negatively regulating p53 protein stability and promoting the intracellular ubiquitination of p53. Furthermore, like Pirh2A, both isoforms are able to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. We have also for the first time demonstrated that Pirh2A as well as the novel isoforms also interact directly with MDM2 within a region encompassing MDM2 acidic and zinc finger domains. It is therefore possible that Pirh2A and the novel Pirh2 isoforms identified in this study may also modulate p53 function by engaging MDM2."
https://openalex.org/W2076211636,"In skeletal and cardiac muscles, troponin (Tn), which resides on the thin filament, senses a change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Tn is composed of TnC, TnI, and TnT. Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of TnC removes the inhibitory effect by TnI on the contraction. The inhibitory region of cardiac TnI spans from residue 138 to 149. Upon Ca2+ activation, the inhibitory region is believed to be released from actin, thus triggering actin-activation of myosin ATPase. In this study, we created a series of Ala-substitution mutants of cTnI to delineate the functional contribution of each amino acid in the inhibitory region to myofilament regulation. We found that most of the point mutations in the inhibitory region reduced the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+, which suggests the same region also acts as an activator of the ATPase. The thin filaments can also be activated by strong myosin head (S1)-actin interactions. The binding of N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin subfragment 1 (NEM-S1) to actin filaments mimics such strong interactions. Interestingly, in the absence of Ca2+ NEM-S1-induced activation of S1 ATPase was significantly less with the thin filaments containing TnI(T144A) than that with the wild-type TnI. However, in the presence of Ca2+, there was little difference in the activation of ATPase activity between these preparations.

Ca2+ binds to the regulatory domain of TnC, which regulates the interaction of troponin I (TnI) with actin-tropomyosin (Tm) and TnC (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol.

In the thin filaments, the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 104–115 of rabbit fast skeletal TnI (fsTnI) or 138–149 of mouse cardiac TnI (cTnI)) undergoes a structural transition depending on the Ca2+ state of TnC (4Kobayashi T.

In the absence of Ca2+ at the regulatory site(s) of TnC, the inhibitory region interacts with actin to prevent activation of myosin ATPase activity. When Ca2+ binds to the regulatory site(s) of TnC, the switch region of TnI, which is located at the C terminus of the inhibitory region, interacts with the newly exposed hydrophobic patch of the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnC (6Li M.X.

This interaction causes the removal of the inhibitory region and the second actin-Tm binding region of TnI from the actin surface and allows actin to interact with myosin. In the presence of Ca2+ at the regulatory sites of TnC, the inhibitory region and the central helical region of TnC are mutually stabilized, according to the recent x-ray crystal structure of the core domain of the fsTn complex (9Vinogradova M.V.

The sequence variations in the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of TnT, another component of the Tn complex, are known to alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilament activity (10Pan B.S.

There is evidence supporting the idea that each amino acid residue in the inhibitory region of TnI contributes differently and to a different degree to myofilament activities. One example is genetic mutations and phosphorylation of amino acid residues in the inhibitory region of cardiac TnI that cause the modification of myofilament activities. In hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy-linked mutations found in the inhibitory region, such as R142Q, L145Q, and R146G/Q/W mutations (mouse cTnI sequence number), induce Ca2+ sensitization of myofilament activities and an increase in ATPase/tension at low [Ca2+] (13Chang A.N. Parvatiyar M.S. Potter J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Harada K. Morimoto S. Jpn. J. Physiol. 2004; 54: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that thin filaments reconstituted with R146G or R146W mutant cTnI bind Ca2+ tighter than those with cTnI(wt) (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ sensitization may occur as a result of the destabilization of the off-state of the thin filaments due to the mutation introduced into the actin-Tm-interacting residue, i.e. Arg-146, of cTnI. On the other hand, Thr-144 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) specifically, although the consequence of the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-144 has not yet been clearly defined. Pseudophosphorylation of Thr-144 was shown to cause Ca2+ desensitization in in vitro motility assays (16Burkart E.M. Sumandea M.P. Kobayashi T. Nili M. Martin A.F. Homsher E. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11265-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas there is a report that indicates phosphorylation of Thr-144 sensitizes skinned cardiomyocytes to Ca2+ (17Wang H.

Furthermore, Tachampa et al. reported that Thr-144 of cTnI is important for length-dependent activation of skinned cardiac muscle (18Tachampa K. Wang H. Farman G.P. de Tombe P.P. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus in each case presented above, a specific change in a single amino acid in the inhibitory region of TnI induced different and divergent effects on myofilament activities. Our aim of this study is to assess the functional contributions of the individual amino acid residues in the inhibitory region to the regulatory function. To assess the functional roles of the individual amino acid residues systematically, we used Ala scanning (19Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Ala substitution deletes all the interactions made by atoms beyond β-C yet does not alter the peptide backbone conformation, unless it is applied to Gly or Pro. Ala is one of the most abundant amino acids and is found in both buried and exposed positions. We found that almost the entire minimum inhibitory region of cTnI we investigated (Fig. 1) is important for both the inhibition and activation. Our data also indicate that the C-terminal part of the inhibitory region destabilizes the active state of the thin filaments. We also found that Thr-144 is involved in NEM-S1-dependent activation of ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+. Recombinant human wild-type and mutant cTnCs, cTnC(C35S/T53C/C84S) and cTnC(C35S), in pET3d vector were expressed using BL21(DE3) cells. cTnC was extracted with 5% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and the protease inhibitors (AEBSF, E-64, and pepstatin A). After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was collected, and CaCl2 and MgCl2 were added to final concentrations of 1 mm and 5 mm, respectively, followed by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation. After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After washing with the same solution, the column was washed further with the same solution except that 0.2 mm CaCl2 was used instead of 1 mm. Finally cTnC was eluted with 5 mm EDTA and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cTnC-containing fraction was dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT. Solid urea was added to the protein solution to 6 m, and cTnC was separated on a QAE fast flow-Sepharose column equilibrated with 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. cTnC was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Recombinant mouse cTnIs were expressed and purified as described previously (21Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse cTnT with a Myc tag at the N terminus was expressed and purified with a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography as described (22Sumandea M.P.

Previously we showed that the Myc tag at the N terminus of cTnT has no affect on myofilament activity (19Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin was extracted from bovine left ventricular ether powder with 1 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 followed by isoelectric point precipitation. The precipitation fractions were resuspended with 1 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and ammonium sulfate fractionation was carried out. The 45–60% saturation fraction was collected, and Tm was further purified on a QAE fast flow-Sepharose column. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder as described by Spudich and Watt (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification, F-actin solution was stored in the presence of phalloidin (1:1 molar ratio). Myosin subfragment-1 (S1) was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of rabbit psoas muscle myosin and purified on a SP-Sephadex column as described previously (24Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20497-20506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single Cys residues of mutant cTnC(C35S/T53C/C84S) and cTnC(C35S) were labeled with 2-fold amounts of IAANS over Cys in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The reaction was quenched by the addition of DTT, and the excess fluorescence dye was removed by dialysis and a desalting column. The labeling yield was determined using ϵ326 nm = 27,000 m−1 for IAANS (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of Tn components were combined in a solution containing 6 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein mixture was dialyzed against the same solution without urea. The NaCl concentration was next reduced to 0.3 m and finally to 0.1 m. After dialysis, the protein mixture was clarified by centrifugation, and then the resulting supernatant fractions were applied to a Resource-Q (1 ml, GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The Tn complex was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same solution. To reconstitute thin filaments, we first mixed actin and Tm, followed by Tn. For the Ca2+ binding measurements, we first mixed actin and Tm in a 8.5:1 molar ratio followed by the addition of IAANS-labeled Tn to 8.5:1:1 (actin:Tm:Tn) molar ratio with cTnC(C35S/T53C/C84S). A slightly high molar ratio of actin to Tn-Tm was necessary to minimize free Tn in the thin filament preparations. Because free Tn shows an opposite direction of fluorescence change upon binding Ca2+ (25Davis J.P. Norman C. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Swartz D.R. Tikunova S.B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3195-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the presence of excess free Tn may interfere with the measurements of Ca2+ binding to thin filaments. To confirm that a slightly lower molar ratio of Tn and excess amounts of Tn produce the same results, we also carried out Ca2+ binding measurements using an excess amount of Tn with IAANS-labeled cTnC(C35S) over actin and Tm. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Model 2000-4 spectrofluorometer equipped with two 814 PMT photon-counting detectors (Photon Technology International) with a cell holder containing a thermostat and a magnetic stirrer. The Ca2+ binding was monitored by fluorescence emission of IAANS attached at Cys-53 of cTnC(C35S/T53C/C84S) or Cys-84 of cTnC(C35S). As mentioned above, the latter was used to make sure that the data obtained with a subsaturating amount of Tn in the thin filaments gave the same affinity as that of thin filaments with saturated amounts of Tn. The fluorescence emission intensity change observed was assumed to be due to direct Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site of cTnC in the protein complexes. The solution conditions were 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The titration was carried out at 25 °C, and the free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the WEBMAXC Standard Program (26Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The titration curves were analyzed as described previously (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Davis J.P. Norman C. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Swartz D.R. Tikunova S.B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3195-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a measure of Ca2+ sensitivity, pCa50 values were then calculated as −logKd from the apparent dissociation constant, Kd. The apparent dissociation constant, Kd and pCa50 are expressed as a mean ± S.E. from 4–6 experiments. The apparent coupling energy of Tn with Ca2+ binding and actin-Tm interaction was calculated as in Equation 1, where KdCaTn and KdCaThin are the Ca2+ dissociation constants for the Tn complex and the thin filaments, respectively. Error propagation was calculated by Equation 2,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where Φ is a function of measurable quantities χ1 and χ2, and ω̄, ω1, and ω2 are errors associated with Φ, χ1, and χ2, respectively. The reaction conditions were 5.0 μm actin, 0.2 μm myosin S1, 1.0 μm Tm, and 2.0 μm Tn in 35 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA at 25 °C. A reaction was initiated by the addition of a final concentration of 1 mm ATP. ATPase activity was determined from the time course of inorganic phosphate liberation using a malachite green assay (27Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Steady-state ATPase activity was determined from 5 to 6 time points. In the case of NEM-S1-activated acto-S1 ATPase activity, free actin concentrations were held at 5.0 μm as described (28Greene L.E. Williams Jr., D.L. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 3102-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Mathur M.C. Kobayashi T. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 542-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and ATPase rates were expressed per unmodified S1 concentration. In all figures and tables, the rate for S1 alone has been subtracted from the measured rates, and the rate is expressed as a mean ± S.E. from 4 (without NEM-S1) or 8–12 (with NEM-S1) measurements. Statistical evaluation was carried out by one-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffe test as a post-hoc multiple comparison test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Note that the Scheffe test is one of the most conservative evaluations and least likely produces “Type-1” (false-positive) error (30Maxwell S.E. Dalaney H.D. Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A Model Comparison Perspective. 2nd Ed. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., 2003Crossref Google Scholar). A segment cTnI, residues from 143 to 149 (Fig. 1), was subjected to Ala scanning to assess the impact of Ala substitution at each position. It should be mentioned that the Ala substitution of each of these residues seems to perturb neither the flexible structure of the inhibitory region nor the α-helical structure of the switch region, which follows the inhibitory region, based upon the secondary structural prediction by the AGADIR computer program (31Muñoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We measured Ca2+ binding to the Tn complex with Ala mutation of cTnI in the inhibitory region residues 143–149 either alone or in reconstituted thin filaments. The Ca2+ binding was reported by fluorescence emission intensity change of IAANS attached to Cys-53 of the cTnC mutant. As we reported recently, IAANS attached to Cys-53 of the mutant cTnC(C35S/T53C/C84S) shows Ca2+ binding affinity as well as Ca2+ dissociation kinetics from the regulatory site of cTnC and of the cTn complex similar to those measured directly with Quin-2 using unlabeled wild-type cTnC and cTn (25Davis J.P. Norman C. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Swartz D.R. Tikunova S.B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3195-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IAANS at Cys-53 of cTnC reports Ca2+ binding to the reconstituted thin filaments with almost the same affinity as expected from previous reports (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Pan B.S. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7839-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this labeling can be used not only for the Ca2+ binding measurements for the cTn complex but also for the thin filaments as well. This allowed us to compare results obtained from different regulatory complexes. Ca2+ binding to the Tn complex induces a decrease of the IAANS emission intensity, whereas Ca2+ binding to the thin filaments enhances the fluorescence intensities. This indicates that the microenvironments of IAANS attached to Cys-53 are different in the Tn complex and the thin filaments in the presence of Ca2+. In the thin filaments, IAANS may face toward the actin-Tm surface so that it experiences a less exposed environment upon Ca2+ binding. For the reconstituted thin filaments, we also conducted the Ca2+ binding measurements using cTnC with IAANS attached to Cys-84 as mentioned under “Materials and Methods.” The Ca2+ binding properties of the Tn complexes and the reconstituted thin filaments are summarized in Table 1. The changes in the apparent pCa50 of the regulatory complexes with mutant cTnI from that with wild type (ΔpCa50) were calculated from the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) and are shown in Fig. 2. These Ca2+ binding properties were used to evaluate the perturbation of the interaction of the inhibitory region with other thin filament components by Ala substitution at each position in the segment residues from 143 to 149 (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Summary for the effect of Ala-substituted mutations of cTnI on the Ca2+ binding properties for the different regulatory complexesComplexTnIKdpCa50nHmTnwt3.03 ± 0.04 × 10−76.52 ± 0.011.11 ± 0.02P143A3.45 ± 0.02 × 10−76.46 ± 0.001.17 ± 0.04T144A2.90 ± 0.06 × 10−76.54 ± 0.011.08 ± 0.02L145A3.08 ± 0.05 × 10−76.52 ± 0.011.12 ± 0.02R146A3.54 ± 0.06 × 10−7aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.6.45 ± 0.01aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.1.14 ± 0.02R147A4.57 ± 0.04 × 10−7aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.6.34 ± 0.01aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.1.16 ± 0.01V148A3.56 ± 0.03 × 10−7aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.6.45 ± 0.00aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.1.14 ± 0.01R149A3.89 ± 0.04 × 10−7aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.6.41 ± 0.01aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.1.14 ± 0.01Thin filamentwt2.97 ± 0.16 × 10−65.53 ± 0.021.80 ± 0.05P143A2.83 ± 0.24 × 10−65.55 ± 0.042.31 ± 0.46T144A2.01 ± 0.12 × 10−65.70 ± 0.022.08 ± 0.18L145ANDbND, not determined.R146A1.91 ± 0.28 × 10−65.73 ± 0.062.29 ± 0.17R147A2.49 ± 0.40 × 10−65.61 ± 0.051.85 ± 0.16V148A1.37 ± 0.06 × 10−6aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.5.87 ± 0.02aIndicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.1.74 ± 0.06R149A2.07 ± 0.27 × 10−65.69 ± 0.051.63 ± 0.13a Indicates p < 0.05 from cTnI(wt) by one-way ANOVA followed by a Scheffe test.b ND, not determined.

Compared with the residues from segment 143–145 of cTnI, Ala substitution of the amino acid residues in the segment 146–149 showed decreases in Ca2+ affinity of the Tn complex. The R147A mutation demonstrated the largest decrease (ΔpCa50 = 0.18 ± 0.01; p < 0.05 versus each of the rest of the mutations investigated). Nonetheless, there were relatively small perturbations of Ca2+ binding properties of the Tn complex caused by Ala substitution of individual amino acid residues in the minimum inhibitory region. In general, Ala substitution had more impact on Ca2+ binding properties of the thin filaments (Table 1 and Fig. 2B) than those of the cTn complexes. Mutations that affected Ca2+ binding to the thin filaments resulted in sensitization of the system to Ca2+, as shown by positive values of ΔpCa50 in Fig. 2B. The V148A mutation significantly increased the apparent Ca2+ binding affinity of the thin filaments by ΔpCa50 = 0.34 ± 0.03. R146A and R149A, as well as T144A, also demonstrated sensitization of the thin filaments to Ca2+, but these were not significantly different from cTnI(wt) with ANOVA analysis (they were significant versus cTnI(wt) with the Student's t test). The P143A mutation did not alter the Ca2+ binding property of the thin filaments. The thin filaments with the L145A mutation did not demonstrate a fluorescence intensity change when titrated with Ca2+. Therefore, we could not measure Ca2+ binding to the thin filaments with L145A mutation. Ca2+ binding to the Tn complex and actin-Tm binding are negatively coupled. That is, Ca2+ binding to the Tn complex reduces its affinity for actin-Tm. The apparent Ca2+ binding constants for the Tn complexes and the thin filaments were used to calculate coupling energies between Ca2+ and actin-Tm (ΔΔGcoupl) for each Tn complex (Fig. 3). The apparent coupling energy, ΔΔGcoupl, is a measure of apparent Ca2+-dependence of the interaction of the Tn complex with actin-Tm (Reaction Scheme 1) and was calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” It should be mentioned that the thin filaments exist in equilibrium between at least two states, which possess different affinities for Ca2+; Ca2+ binding itself is capable of shifting the thin filaments state. Thus the scheme could be more complicated. Ca2+-dependent interactions of the Tn complex with actin-Tm can also be assessed using a co-sedimentation assay. However, it may require much higher salt concentrations as demonstrated previously (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As evident from Fig. 3, the Ca2+-dependent interaction of the Tn complex with actin-Tm was affected by Ala mutations in the C-terminal-half of the inhibitory region (p < 0.05; R146A, R147A, V148A, and R149 versus wt). The V148A mutation showed a 0.55 ± 0.04 kcal/mol (ΔΔGcoupl(wt) − ΔΔGcoupl(V148A)) decrease in the Ca2+-dependent interaction. Because we could not determine the apparent Ca2+ binding affinity of the thin filaments with the L145A mutation, we could not determine the ΔΔGcoupl for the L145A mutation. A summary of actin-activated myosin S1-ATPase activities is shown in Fig. 4. The addition of the wild-type Tn to the complex of myosin S1, actin, and Tm increased the ATPase activity to 0.9 s−1 from 0.28 s−1 in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4A), whereas it decreased the activity to 0.05 s−1 in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4B). Thus, the ATPase activity was increased ∼18-fold by Ca2+ in the presence of the Tn complex. In the presence of Ca2+, all but the T144A mutation examined in this study resulted in a decrease of ATPase activity compared with cTnI(wt) (Fig. 4A). These data clearly demonstrated the involvement of the inhibitory region in Ca2+ activation. L145A, R147A, and V148A mutations greatly impaired Ca2+ activation. ATPase activities with one of these mutations were 0.36–0.40 s−1. It is noteworthy that the P143A mutation impaired Ca2+ activation without affecting the Ca2+ binding property. In general, the shift of the equilibrium of the thin filament states seems to be accompanied by the alteration of the Ca2+ binding property. Therefore, this observation for the P143A mutation deserves further investigation. In the absence of Ca2+, most of the Ala mutations impaired the inhibitory action (Fig. 4B). The L145A mutation showed the largest effect (p < 0.05 versus every cTnI examined in this study, including cTnI(wt)): it decreased the ATPase activity only to 0.17 s−1, resulting in only ∼2-fold Ca2+ sensitivity. P143A, T144A, and V148A mutations showed no significant effect on the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+. The thin filaments can be activated through a strong cross-bridge interaction. We used NEM-S1 to mimic such an interaction. NEM-treated S1 has little ATPase activity by itself, binds to actin strongly even in the presence of ATP, and stabilizes the active st"
https://openalex.org/W1974504466,"Background Molecular genetic studies are revealing an increasing number of cryptic lineages or species, which are highly genetically divergent but apparently cannot be distinguished morphologically. This observation gives rise to three important questions: 1) have these cryptic lineages diverged in phenotypic traits that may not be obvious to humans; 2) when cryptic lineages come into secondary contact, what are the evolutionary consequences: stable co-existence, replacement, admixture or differentiation and 3) what processes influence the evolutionary dynamics of these secondary contact zones? Methodology/Principal Findings To address these questions, we first tested whether males of the Iberian lizard Lacerta schreiberi from two highly genetically divergent, yet morphologically cryptic lineages on either side of an east-west secondary contact could be differentiated based on detailed analysis of morphology, coloration and parasite load. Next, we tested whether these differences could be driven by pre-copulatory intra-sexual selection (male-male competition). Compared to eastern males, western males had fewer parasites, were in better body condition and were more intensely coloured. Although subtle environmental variation across the hybrid zone could explain the differences in parasite load and body condition, these were uncorrelated with colour expression, suggesting that the differences in coloration reflect heritable divergence. The lineages did not differ in their aggressive behaviour or competitive ability. However, body size, which predicted male aggressiveness, was positively correlated with the colour traits that differed between genetic backgrounds. Conclusions/Significance Our study confirms that these cryptic lineages differ in several aspects that are likely to influence fitness. Although there were no clear differences in male competitive ability, our results suggest a potential indirect role for intra-sexual selection. Specifically, if lizards use the colour traits that differ between genetic backgrounds to assess the size of potential rivals or mates, the resulting fitness differential favouring western males could result in net male-mediated gene flow from west to east across the current hybrid zone."
https://openalex.org/W2089878103,"A fundamental function of the respiratory system is the supply of oxygen to meet metabolic demand. Morphological constraints on the supply of oxygen, such as the structure of the lung, have previously been studied in birds. Recent research has shown that uncinate processes (UP) are important respiratory structures in birds, facilitating inspiratory and expiratory movements of the ribs and sternum. Uncinate process length (UPL) is important for determining the mechanical advantage for these respiratory movements. Here we report on the relationship between UPL, body size, metabolic demand and locomotor specialisation in birds. UPL was found to scale isometrically with body mass. Process length is greatest in specialist diving birds, shortest in walking birds and intermediate length in all others relative to body size. Examination of the interaction between the length of the UP and metabolic demand indicated that, relative to body size, species with high metabolic rates have corresponding elongated UP. We propose that elongated UP confer an advantage on the supply of oxygen, perhaps by improving the mechanical advantage and reducing the energetic cost of movements of the ribs and sternum."
