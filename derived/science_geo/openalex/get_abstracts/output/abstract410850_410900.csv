https://openalex.org/W2120424887,"One of the most surprising predictions of modern quantum theory is that the vacuum of space is not empty. In fact, quantum theory predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in and out of existence. While initially a curiosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had measurable consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic spectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This type of renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding of nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed if it might instead be possible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the quantum vacuum. 40 years ago, Moore suggested that a mirror undergoing relativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real photons. This effect was later named the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE). Using a superconducting circuit, we have observed the DCE for the first time. The circuit consists of a coplanar transmission line with an electrical length that can be changed at a few percent of the speed of light. The length is changed by modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at high frequencies (~11 GHz). In addition to observing the creation of real photons, we observe two-mode squeezing of the emitted radiation, which is a signature of the quantum character of the generation process."

https://openalex.org/W2088978228,"Deforestation in mid- to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes. In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback. This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead. Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner. Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 ± 0.44 K (mean ± one standard deviation) northwards of 45° N and 0.21 ± 0.53 K southwards. Below 35° N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models."

https://openalex.org/W2045842319,"Triacylglycerols from plants, familiar to most people as vegetable oils, supply 25% of dietary calories to the developed world and are increasingly a source for renewable biomaterials and fuels. Demand for vegetable oils will double by 2030, which can be met only by increased oil production. Triacylglycerol synthesis is accomplished through the coordinate action of multiple pathways in multiple subcellular compartments. Recent information has revealed an underappreciated complexity in pathways for synthesis and accumulation of this important energy-rich class of molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2034745024,"Most malaria drug development focuses on parasite stages detected in red blood cells, even though, to achieve eradication, next-generation drugs active against both erythrocytic and exo-erythrocytic forms would be preferable. We applied a multifactorial approach to a set of >4000 commercially available compounds with previously demonstrated blood-stage activity (median inhibitory concentration < 1 micromolar) and identified chemical scaffolds with potent activity against both forms. From this screen, we identified an imidazolopiperazine scaffold series that was highly enriched among compounds active against Plasmodium liver stages. The orally bioavailable lead imidazolopiperazine confers complete causal prophylactic protection (15 milligrams/kilogram) in rodent models of malaria and shows potent in vivo blood-stage therapeutic activity. The open-source chemical tools resulting from our effort provide starting points for future drug discovery programs, as well as opportunities for researchers to investigate the biology of exo-erythrocytic forms."
https://openalex.org/W2005960433,"The bite of the Texas coral snake, although not fatal, causes excruciating and long-lasting pain. The toxin involved has now been characterized. The purified active component (MitTx) results from an unusual combination of two housekeeping enzymes, the dimerization of which produces a potent and selective activator of the acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1. Activation of ASIC1 recruits primary afferent nociceptors that detect thermal and inflammatory pain. The identification of MitTx, and the unexpected involvement of ASIC1 channels in nociception, open new routes for the study of these ion channels in particular, and pain research in general. Natural products that elicit discomfort or pain represent invaluable tools for probing molecular mechanisms underlying pain sensation1. Plant-derived irritants have predominated in this regard, but animal venoms have also evolved to avert predators by targeting neurons and receptors whose activation produces noxious sensations2,3,4,5,6. As such, venoms provide a rich and varied source of small molecule and protein pharmacophores7,8 that can be exploited to characterize and manipulate key components of the pain-signalling pathway. With this in mind, here we perform an unbiased in vitro screen to identify snake venoms capable of activating somatosensory neurons. Venom from the Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener tener), whose bite produces intense and unremitting pain9, excites a large cohort of sensory neurons. The purified active species (MitTx) consists of a heteromeric complex between Kunitz- and phospholipase-A2-like proteins that together function as a potent, persistent and selective agonist for acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), showing equal or greater efficacy compared with acidic pH. MitTx is highly selective for the ASIC1 subtype at neutral pH; under more acidic conditions (pH < 6.5), MitTx massively potentiates (>100-fold) proton-evoked activation of ASIC2a channels. These observations raise the possibility that ASIC channels function as coincidence detectors for extracellular protons and other, as yet unidentified, endogenous factors. Purified MitTx elicits robust pain-related behaviour in mice by activation of ASIC1 channels on capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibres. These findings reveal a mechanism whereby snake venoms produce pain, and highlight an unexpected contribution of ASIC1 channels to nociception."

https://openalex.org/W1980047541,"About 20% of all massive stars in the Milky Way have unusually high velocities, the origin of which has puzzled astronomers for half a century. We argue that these velocities originate from strong gravitational interactions between single stars and binaries in the centers of star clusters. The ejecting binary forms naturally during the collapse of a young ($\aplt 1$\,Myr) star cluster. This model replicates the key characteristics of OB runaways in our galaxy and it explains the $\apgt 100$\,\Msun\, runaway stars around young star clusters, e.g. R136 and Westerlund~2. The high proportion and the distributions in mass and velocity of runaways in the Milky Way is reproduced if the majority of massive stars are born in dense and relatively low-mass (5000-10000 \Msun) clusters."

Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar); for example, on the cell surface, it participates in the activation of the fusion of HIV virus (11Fenouillet E. Barbouche R.

PDI is composed of four thioredoxin-like domains (a, b, b′, and a′) plus an x linker and a C-terminal acidic tail (Fig. 1A) (17Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A.

Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The b′ domain possesses the main peptide binding site, whereas binding of large substrates or partner proteins requires all four domains (21Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Sun X.X. Dai Y. Liu H.P. Chen S.M. Wang C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of yeast PDI (yPDI) at 4 and 22 °C revealed that four domains are arranged in a “twisted U shape” and a “boat shape,” respectively, with domains a and a′ representing two mobile arms connected to the rigid bb′ base, and the a arm was demonstrated to be more flexible than the a′ arm (23Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Tian G. Kober F.X. Lewandrowski U. Sickmann A. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33630-33640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The full-length structure of hPDI has not been reported so far; however, the major flexible sites are located in the b′xa′ region (25Wang C. Chen S. Wang X. Wang L. Wallis A.K. Freedman R.B. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26788-26797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PDI can shuttle between the oxidized and reduced states with abilities to bind to various targets and catalyze different reactions (i.e. the oxidized PDI preferentially binds to reduced/unfolded polypeptide to introduce disulfide bonds, whereas the reduced PDI mainly interacts with misoxidized substrates functioning as a reductase or isomerase (26Hatahet F. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2807-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar)). In mammalian cells, only the reduced and not the oxidized PDI interacts with its oxidase Ero1 (27Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or peroxiredoxin 4 (28Zito E. Melo E.P. Yang Y. Wahlander Å. Neubert T.A. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hence, it is elusive how reduced/oxidized PDI distinguishes its substrates/partner proteins or selectively binds to the same substrate at different stages in the protein-folding pathway (26Hatahet F. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2807-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). About 10 years ago, PDI was reported to be a redox-dependent chaperone based on the finding that PDI binds and unfolds the cholera toxin A1 subunit in the reduced form (29Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and releases it after being oxidized by Ero1, thus facilitating the retrograde transport of A1 subunit from the ER into the cytosol (30Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, this redox-dependent chaperone activity of PDI was subsequently challenged by arguing that the release of the A1 subunit is mediated by substrate competition rather than by a change in the redox state of PDI (31Lumb R.A. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6763-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether the chaperone activity of PDI is redox-regulated is controversial (32Winter J. Jakob U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the putative redox-dependent conformational changes of PDI are much less characterized, and only very recently, studies of PDI from a thermophilic fungus showed a redox-dependent intramolecular rearrangement of the b′ and a′ domains by using NMR spectroscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering (33Nakasako M. Maeno A. Kurimoto E. Harada T. Yamaguchi Y. Oka T. Takayama Y. Iwata A. Kato K. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Serve O. Kamiya Y. Maeno A. Nakano M.

Biol. 2010; 396: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism for redox-regulated conformational changes and chaperone activity of PDI remains largely unknown. In this study, we extensively explored different conformations and the chaperone activity of hPDI in different redox states. We demonstrate that hPDI is a redox-regulated chaperone undergoing large redox-dependent conformational changes. We further map out b′xa′ to be the minimal region of hPDI enduring the conformational rearrangement and identify the active site in the a′ domain to be the key trigger. The crystal structure of the reduced bb′xa′ was determined and reveals that the a′ domain packs tightly with both the b′ domain and the x linker to form one compact structural module. Oxidation of the a′ domain releases this compact conformation and subsequently exposes the shielded substrate binding areas for higher chaperone activity of hPDI. We finally demonstrate that the redox-dependent conformational changes are essential for regulation of the chaperone activity of hPDI. The genes encoding hPDI, abb′x and bb′xa′, were cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen), and the resulting proteins contained N-terminal (MRGSH6GS) tags. The bb′xa′ gene was also cloned into a modified pET32a for structural studies, and the resulting protein contained an N-terminal (H6SSGLEVLFQGSEF) tag. hPDI mutants were created by the overlap extension PCR method, and the sequences of all of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (35Li S.J. Hong X.G. Shi Y.Y. Li H. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6581-6588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Complete denaturation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was carried out by incubation of 0.14 mm GAPDH in 3 m guanidine hydrochloride with 1 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C. Refolding was initiated by 50-fold dilution of the denatured GAPDH into 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm EDTA in the absence or presence of hPDI proteins and different concentrations of DTT at 25 °C. Aggregation produced during the refolding was monitored by recording the light scattering at 488 nm, and the suppression of aggregation was used to measure the chaperone activity of hPDI proteins (3Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hPDI proteins at 1 mg/ml were incubated with or without 1 mm GSH, GSSG, or DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for 30 min, and then different proteases were added for digestion. The reactions were terminated at different times by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. hPDI proteins of 5 μm were incubated with or without 1 mm GSH, GSSG, or DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl at 25 °C for 30 min. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded at 310–400 nm at 25 °C with excitation at 290 nm. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) was added in protein samples to 50 μm and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in the dark before the ANS fluorescence emission spectra (400–600 nm) were determined with excitation at 370 nm. The concentration of ANS was determined using an extinction coefficient at 350 nm of 5000 m−1 cm−1. The purified bb′xa′ at 10.0 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, was crystallized at 16 °C using the hanging drop method by mixing 1 μl of protein sample containing 50 mm DTT with an equal volume of 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.5. The crystals were flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beam line BL17U at a wavelength of 0.979 Å at 100 K. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The bb′xa′ structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program Phaser (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

At the final refinement stage, TLS refinement was used with groups defined by the TLSMD server (41Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The overall quality of the final structural model was assessed by PROCHECK (42Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of bb′xa′ have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 3UEM). Protein samples were purified by size exclusion chromatography with 0.1% formic acid/water for digests by proteinase K and by reverse-phase HPLC on a C8 chip (G4240-63001) with a water-ACN system containing 0.1% formic acid for digests by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The samples were introduced into the spectrometer by JetStream electrospray ionization using a spray voltage of 3.7 kV for digests by proteinase K and by HPLC-chip using 1.88 kV for digests by trypsin or chymotrypsin. Spectra were acquired on a calibrated Q-TOF (Agilent 6530) instrument operated in positive ion mode over the m/z range 400–1600 for digests by proteinase K and 400–3200 for digests by trypsin or chymotrypsin. Data were processed via Mass Hunter qualitative analysis software. To reconcile the controversy on redox-regulated chaperone activity of hPDI, we first tested whether the chaperone activity of hPDI is regulated by its redox states. A well established system was used to characterize the chaperone activity of hPDI (3Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (i.e. the presence of hPDI in the refolding buffer strongly suppressed the aggregation of guanidine hydrochloride-denatured GAPDH during dilution-induced refolding) (Fig. 1B). The purified hPDI contains about 2.5 free thiols as determined by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), indicating the active sites in domains a and a′ are mostly oxidized because the two cysteines in the b′ domain do not form a disulfide bond (43Nguyen V.D. Wallis K. Howard M.J. Haapalainen A.M. Salo K.E. Saaranen M.J. Sidhu A. Wierenga R.K. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. Williamson R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Adding DTT in the refolding buffer significantly decreased the chaperone activity of hPDI in a concentration-dependent manner (i.e. the more reduced hPDI was, the lower chaperone activity it showed) (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the redox states of hPDI indeed control its chaperone activity. Because both active sites of domains a and a′ are redox state sensors, we next made double Cys/Ser point mutations on both sites (PDIaSSa′SS) to impair its redox responses. Notably, PDIaSSa′SS showed chaperone activity similar to that of the oxidized hPDI, and the DTT-induced chaperone activity decrease was completely abolished (Fig. 1B), indicating that redox-regulated hPDI chaperone activity is dependent on its active sites. We next looked for the potential redox-dependent conformational changes of hPDI by direct digestion with proteinase K, trypsin, and chymotrypsin under various redox conditions (Fig. 1C). After 5 min of digestion by proteinase K, the GSSG-incubated hPDI almost disappeared, whereas about half of the GSH-incubated hPDI was intact. Similar digestion profiles were produced by trypsin and chymotrypsin. To avoid S-glutathionylation-induced conformational change, hPDI was next digested in the presence or absence of DTT. After a 10-min digestion by proteinase K, most of hPDI but little of the DTT-incubated hPDI was digested (Fig. 1C). Hence, the oxidized hPDI adopts a loose conformation, and the reduced one is very compact. We next carried out fluorescence studies of hPDI under different redox conditions to further probe redox-regulated conformational changes. Consistent with a compact conformation of the reduced hPDI, the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the GSH-incubated hPDI showed a blue shift (∼4 nm) of the maximum excited wavelength compared with that of the GSSG-incubated hPDI (Fig. 1D). The GSSG-incubated hPDI showed higher ANS fluorescence intensity than that of the GSH-incubated hPDI, again indicating the oxidized hPDI being much looser and exposing more hydrophobic areas (Fig. 1E). Additionally, the intrinsic and ANS fluorescence spectra of DTT-treated and -untreated hPDI showed similar results (supplemental Fig. S1). Finally, size exclusion chromatography analysis also demonstrated that the reduced hPDI was eluted with a larger volume, confirming its compact conformation (Fig. 1F). Taken together, hPDI shows significant conformational changes induced by different redox conditions. To identify the critical cysteine responsible for the redox-regulated conformational changes of hPDI, we made cysteine mutations in a, b′, or a′ domain, respectively. The digestion profiles of the mutants (Fig. 2A) showed that the redox-regulated susceptibility to hydrolysis disappeared only for the a′ domain mutant (PDIaCCa′SS), indicating that the active site of the a′ domain is the key position. Moreover, mutation of either cysteine in the a′ domain resulted in loss of the redox-regulated conformation changes (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, the proteinase digestion profiles (Fig. 2B) and the intrinsic (Fig. 2C) and ANS (Fig. 2D) fluorescence spectra of abb′x and bb′xa′ in different redox conditions were determined, showing little redox-dependent difference for abb′x but significant difference for bb′xa′. All of the above data demonstrated that the active site of the a′ domain plays a predominant role in the regulation of hPDI conformation under different redox conditions. Next, to map out the corresponding minimal structural element undergoing the redox-induced conformational changes, we made truncations on the bb′xa′. Further deletion of domain b still showed different susceptibilities to proteinase digestion under different redox conditions, whereas domain a′ alone did not show any difference (Fig. 2E), indicating that the minimum region is b′xa′. We further made domain-swapped mutants by exchanging the position of domain a and a′ in the abb′x and bb′xa′, respectively. Interestingly, limited proteolysis studies showed that a′bb′x did not undergo the redox-regulated conformational changes, whereas bb′xa did (Fig. 2E). Hence, the presence of an active thioredoxin-like domain (either a or a′) following the b′x is a most critical element for the redox-regulated interdomain conformational changes of hPDI. After mapping out b′xa′ to be the minimal structural element undergoing the redox-induced interdomain conformational changes, we next tried to solve the structure of this fragment to explore the molecular mechanism. Due to the fact that b and b′ extensively contact with each other to form one structural unit (44Denisov A.Y. Määttänen P. Dabrowski C. Kozlov G. Thomas D.Y. Gehring K. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we included b to b′xa′ for further structural studies. After extensive crystallization trails, high quality crystals of the reduced bb′xa′ were successfully achieved and finally diffracted to 2.29 Å for the structure determination (Table 1). From the overall topology, the structure of the reduced bb′xa′ demonstrated that, consistent with the above biochemical characterizations, the bb′ tandem tightly packs with the a′ domain to form one compact structural entity integrated by the x linker.

FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) revealed obvious interdomain motion (Fig. 3B), although single domains b and b′ in the two structures are similar. The a′ domain in the bb′xa′ structure is similar to the isolated a′ solution structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1X5C) (Fig. 3C) and exists in the reduced form with a distance of 3.62 Å between two sulfur atoms in the active site. Although the b′ domains in bb′xa′ and in I289A b′x (43Nguyen V.D. Wallis K. Howard M.J. Haapalainen A.M. Salo K.E. Saaranen M.J. Sidhu A. Wierenga R.K. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. Williamson R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) are also highly similar (Fig. 3D), differences were observed around the x linker. In I289A b′x, the first α-helix shifts toward the bound x linker with a tilt of ∼20°; the N-terminal half of the x linker forms an anti-parallel β-strand with the fifth β-strand of b′, and the C-terminal half of the x linker twists and folds back to directly interact with the b′ domain (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the x linker in bb′xa′ orients perpendicularly to the β-sheet of b′ and extends to a′, packing against both the fourth β-strand of b′ and the first α-helix of a′, thus to mediate the compact interactions between them (Fig. 3A). We next compared the reduced bb′xa′ structure with two different crystal structures of yeast PDI (yPDI22 °C (24Tian G. Kober F.X. Lewandrowski U. Sickmann A. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33630-33640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and yPDI4 °C (23Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)) and found significant interdomain motions of the a′ domain relative to the bb′ base in the reduced bb′xa′ (Fig. 4A). Based on the structural superposition analysis, the a′ domain in the reduced bb′xa′ exhibits a ∼8–9-Å dislocation of the center of the a′ domain due to a ∼35–45° rotation around the x linker toward the hydrophobic surface of the b′ domain. Furthermore, compared with the recently solved structure of human ERp57 (45Dong G. Wearsch P.A. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Reinisch K.M. Immunity. 2009; 30: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which is a PDI family member with similar domain architecture to PDI, the a′ domain endures more significant changes with an ∼11 Å dislocation through a ∼50° rotation (Fig. 4A). The x linker in the reduced bb′xa′ connects the b′ and a′ domains with intensive interactions, mediating their interdomain conformation (Fig. 4B, left). The interaction of the N-terminal x linker was contributed by the side chain of Ile-351, which inserts into the hydrophobic pocket formed by side chains of Tyr-327, Phe-342, and Phe-346 of the b′ domain. The central and C-terminal x linker interact with the b′ and a′ domains via forming intensive hydrogen bonds (i.e. His-354–Lys-326, Met-356–Glu-431, Ser-357–Gly-374 and –Lys-375, Gln-358–Asn-430, Trp-364–Val-371, and Asp-365–Lys-370) (Fig. 4B, left). Although the relative positions of domains b′ and a′ are different among yPDI, ERp57, and the reduced bb′xa′, the interaction pattern between the x linker and the b′ or a′ domain is similar (i.e. hydrophobic interactions in the N-terminal x linker and intensive hydrogen bonds in the central and C-terminal x linker). Surprisingly, direct interactions between domains b′ and a′ were observed in the reduced bb′xa′ (Fig. 4B, right), whereas little was found in yPDI22 °C, yPDI4 °C, and ERp57. The side chain of Trp-396 in the a′ domain exists in two alternative conformations; in one, it forms a cation-π interaction with the side chain of Arg-300 in the b′ domain, and in the other, it contacts with Pro-395 and Thr-428. Interestingly, the side chain of His-438 in the a′ domain also adopts two alternative conformations with the major conformation, in which it is buried in the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe-304, Ile-318, Leu-320, and Met-324 in the b′ domain. In addition, Lys-326 in domain b′ forms a salt bridge with Glu-431 in domain a′, and Phe-304 in domain b′ interacts with Thr-428, Phe-440, and His-438 in domain a′ (Fig. 4B, right). It is noteworthy that most of residues in the interface of domains b′ and a′ (Arg-300, Phe-304, Ile-318, Leu-320, Met-324, Trp-396, Thr-428, His-438, and Phe-440) coincidentally have been previously characterized for ligand binding (34Serve O.

https://openalex.org/W2040705798,"NMR spectroscopy is used to elucidate the intermediates in the bacterial transformation of alkylphosphonates to phosphate, showing that the essential bond cleavage occurs in a radical-based reaction in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-methionine. As a component of nucleic acids, carbohydrates and phospholipids, phosphorus is essential for all forms of life. It is known that many bacteria can utilize phosphonates as a phosphorus source in the absence of phosphates, but knowledge of the pathways involved remains sketchy. Here the authors explore the mechanism by which Escherichia coli converts alkylphosphonates to phosphate, directed by the phn gene cluster. Of the 14 genes within the phn operon, seven were shown previously to be essential to phosphonate usage, but no catalytic function had been identified for any of the individual proteins. The reaction sequence has now been determined. In the final step of the process, the key carbon–phosphorus bond is cleaved in a radical-based reaction that relies on the presence of the S-adenosyl- L-methionine cofactor. Phosphorus is an essential element for all known forms of life. In living systems, phosphorus is an integral component of nucleic acids, carbohydrates and phospholipids, where it is incorporated as a derivative of phosphate. However, most Gram-negative bacteria have the capability to use phosphonates as a nutritional source of phosphorus under conditions of phosphate starvation1. In these organisms, methylphosphonate is converted to phosphate and methane. In a formal sense, this transformation is a hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon–phosphorus (C–P) bond, but a general enzymatic mechanism for the activation and conversion of alkylphosphonates to phosphate and an alkane has not been elucidated despite much effort for more than two decades. The actual mechanism for C–P bond cleavage is likely to be a radical-based transformation2. In Escherichia coli, the catalytic machinery for the C–P lyase reaction has been localized to the phn gene cluster1. This operon consists of the 14 genes phnC, phnD, …, phnP. Genetic and biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the genes phnG, phnH, …, phnM encode proteins that are essential for the conversion of phosphonates to phosphate and that the proteins encoded by the other genes in the operon have auxiliary functions1,3,4,5,6. There are no functional annotations for any of the seven proteins considered essential for C–P bond cleavage. Here we show that methylphosphonate reacts with MgATP to form α-d-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-triphosphate (RPnTP) and adenine. The triphosphate moiety of RPnTP is hydrolysed to pyrophosphate and α-d-ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate (PRPn). The C–P bond of PRPn is subsequently cleaved in a radical-based reaction producing α-d-ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate and methane in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Substantial quantities of phosphonates are produced worldwide for industrial processes, detergents, herbicides and pharmaceuticals7,8,9. Our elucidation of the chemical steps for the biodegradation of alkylphosphonates shows how these compounds can be metabolized and recycled to phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1987434147,"The YjgF/YER057c/UK114 family of proteins is conserved in all domains of life, suggesting that the role of these proteins arose early and was maintained throughout evolution. Metabolic consequences of lacking this protein in Salmonella enterica and other organisms have been described, but the biochemical function of YjgF remained unknown. This work provides the first description of a conserved biochemical activity for the YjgF protein family. Our data support the conclusion that YjgF proteins have enamine/imine deaminase activity and accelerate the release of ammonia from reactive enamine/imine intermediates of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent threonine dehydratase (IlvA). Results from structure-guided mutagenesis experiments suggest that YjgF lacks a catalytic residue and that it facilitates ammonia release by positioning a critical water molecule in the active site. YjgF is renamed RidA (reactive intermediate/imine deaminase A) to reflect the conserved activity of the protein family described here. This study, combined with previous physiological studies on yjgF mutants, suggests that intermediates of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-mediated reactions may have metabolic consequences in vivo that were previously unappreciated. The conservation of the RidA/YjgF family suggests that reactive enamine/imine metabolites are of concern to all organisms."

Here, we review how select pathogens interact with LDs. Several RNA viruses use host LDs at different steps of their life cycle. Some intracellular bacteria and parasites usurp host LDs or encode their own lipid biosynthesis machinery, thus allowing production of LDs independently of their host. Although many mechanistic details of host/pathogen LD interactions are unknown, a picture emerges in which the unique cellular architecture and energy stored in LDs are important in the replication of diverse pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2143368175,"Protein kinases are activated by phosphorylation and by the binding of activator proteins. The interplay of these two factors is incompletely understood. We applied energetic analysis to this question and characterized the activation process of the serine/threonine kinase Aurora-A by phosphorylation and by its protein partner, targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2). We discovered that these two activators act synergistically and without a predefined order: each can individually increase the activity of Aurora-A, and the effect of both bound together is the exact sum of their individual contributions to catalysis. Unexpectedly, the unphosphorylated enzyme has catalytic activity that is increased 15-fold by the binding of TPX2 alone. The energetic contribution of phosphorylation to catalysis is 2-fold greater than that of TPX2 binding, which is independent of the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. Based on this analysis, we propose a revised, fluid model of Aurora-A activation in which the first step is a reduction in the mobility of the activation loop by either TPX2 binding or phosphorylation. Furthermore, our results suggest that unphosphorylated Aurora-A bound to the mitotic spindle by TPX2 is catalytically active and that the phosphorylation state of Aurora-A is an inaccurate surrogate for its activity. Extending this form of analysis will allow us to compare quantitatively the effects of the whole network of kinase-activating partners. Comparison with other kinases showed that kinetic characterization detects those kinases whose activation loops undergo a rearrangement upon phosphorylation and thus whose unphosphorylated state offers a distinct target for the development of Type II inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2052301534,"Bifidobacteria inhabit the lower intestine of mammals including humans where the mucin gel layer forms a space for commensal bacteria. We previously identified that infant-associated bifidobacteria possess an extracellular membrane-bound endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EngBF) that may be involved in degradation and assimilation of mucin-type oligosaccharides. However, EngBF is highly specific for core-1-type O-glycan (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), also called T antigen, which is mainly attached onto gastroduodenal mucins. By contrast, core-3-type O-glycans (GlcNAcβ1-3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr) are predominantly found on the mucins in the intestines. Here, we identified a novel α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NagBb) from Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM 1254 that hydrolyzes the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr). Sialyl and galactosyl core-3 (Galβ1-3/4GlcNAcβ1-3(Neu5Acα2-6)GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), a major tetrasaccharide structure on MUC2 mucin primarily secreted from goblet cells in human sigmoid colon, can be serially hydrolyzed into Tn antigen by previously identified bifidobacterial extracellular glycosidases such as α-sialidase (SiaBb2), lacto-N-biosidase (LnbB), β-galactosidase (BbgIII), and β-N-acetylhexosaminidases (BbhI and BbhII). Because NagBb is an intracellular enzyme without an N-terminal secretion signal sequence, it is likely involved in intracellular degradation and assimilation of Tn antigen-containing polypeptides, which might be incorporated through unknown transporters. Thus, bifidobacteria possess two distinct pathways for assimilation of O-glycans on gastroduodenal and intestinal mucins. NagBb homologs are conserved in infant-associated bifidobacteria, suggesting a significant role for their adaptation within the infant gut, and they were found to form a new glycoside hydrolase family 129."
https://openalex.org/W2036214482,"Crigler-Najjar type I (CNI) syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) deficiency. The disease is lethal due to bilirubin-induced neurological damage unless phototherapy is applied from birth. However, treatment becomes less effective during growth, and liver transplantation is required. To investigate the pathophysiology of the disease and therapeutic approaches in mice, we generated a mouse model by introducing a premature stop codon in the UGT1a1 gene, which results in an inactive enzyme. Homozygous mutant mice developed severe jaundice soon after birth and died within 11d, showing significant cerebellar alterations. To rescue neonatal lethality, newborns were injected with a single dose of adeno-associated viral vector 9 (AAV9) expressing the human UGT1A1. Gene therapy treatment completely rescued all AAV-treated mutant mice, accompanied by lower plasma bilirubin levels and normal brain histology and motor coordination. Our mouse model of CNI reproduces genetic and phenotypic features of the human disease. We have shown, for the first time, the full recovery of the lethal effects of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. We believe that, besides gene-addition-based therapies, our mice could represent a very useful model to develop and test novel technologies based on gene correction by homologous recombination.—Bortolussi, G., Zentilin, L., Baj, G., Giraudi, P., Bellarosa, C., Giacca, M., Tiribelli, C., Muro, A.

We show that the α-crystallin domain is the elementary Cu(II)-binding unit specifically coordinating one Cu(II) ion with picomolar binding affinity.

Electron microscopy of negatively stained αB revealed the envelope of a 24-mer with tetrahedral symmetry (16Peschek J. Braun N. Franzmann T.M. Georgalis Y. Haslbeck M. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13272-13277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently, solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR enabled structural studies of full-length αB and provided insights into the oligomeric architecture of αB (15Jehle S. van Rossum B. Stout J.R.

In all atomic-level structures, the ACD folds into a β-sandwich structure comprising the two sheets β8-β9-β3-(β2) and β4-β5-β6 + 7 (Fig. 1B). The structurally variable β2 strand was refined only for two of five molecules in the asymmetric unit (13Bagnéris C. Bateman O.A. Naylor C.E. Cronin N. Boelens W.C. Keep N.H. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 1242-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two monomers align in an anti-parallel fashion along the β6 + 7 strands and form an extended β-sheet (bottom sheet). The dimer interface has been termed the “AP” (anti-parallel) interface (14Laganowsky A. Benesch J.L. Landau M. Ding L. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Huang Q. Robinson C.V. Horwitz J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A shared groove is located above the AP interface, which appears to be polymorphic, because three different alignment registers were observed (13Bagnéris C. Bateman O.A. Naylor C.E. Cronin N. Boelens W.C. Keep N.H. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 1242-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Laganowsky A. Benesch J.L. Landau M. Ding L. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Huang Q. Robinson C.V. Horwitz J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An extensive network of ionic interactions spans the interface. This network involves charged residues of the strands β3 and β4, as well as β5 and β6 + 7 and the intervening loops. Notably, the conserved Arg120 of one monomer is involved in a bidentate ion pair with Asp109 of the neighboring molecule. The missense mutation R120G causes an increase of the oligomeric size and a decrease in chaperone efficiency in vitro (19Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Co-precipitates of desmin and αB-R120G are found in cardiac muscle tissue of patients suffering from desmin-related cardiomyopathy (11Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prévost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tomé F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The dimeric substructure represents the building block of higher order oligomers (17Jehle S. Rajagopal P. Bardiaux B. Markovic S. Kühne R. Stout J.R. Higman V.A. Klevit R.E. van Rossum B.J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Jehle S. Vollmar B.S. Bardiaux B. Dove K.K. Rajagopal P. Gonen T. Oschkinat H. Klevit R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Due to dynamic subunit exchange, the resulting αB ensemble is consequently heterogeneous. The intrinsic subunit exchange and domain dynamics have been shown to be essential for αB chaperone activity (20Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21Liu L. Ghosh J.G. Clark J.I. Jiang S. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 350: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Srinivas V. Raman B. Rao K.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao Ch. M. Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, divalent metal ions like Cu(II) and Zn(II) can act as modulators of this chaperone property (23Ganadu M.L. Aru M. Mura G.M. Coi A. Mlynarz P. Kozlowski H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Biswas A. Das K.P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Reif B. Narayanan S. Peters T. Topics in Current Chemistry. Springer, Berlin2007: 117-167Google Scholar). It was shown recently that αB can coordinate Cu(II) with a picomolar affinity, whereas the interaction with other divalent metal ions is significantly weaker (26Ahmad M.F. Singh D. Taiyab A. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cu(II) affects the secondary structure and oligomeric size of αB (26Ahmad M.F. Singh D. Taiyab A. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Prabhu S. Srinivas V. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, αB is able to reduce Cu(II)-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species, thereby conferring cytoprotection to cells under conditions of oxidative stress (26Ahmad M.F. Singh D. Taiyab A. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By using solution- and MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate here how Cu(II) interacts with αB. Cu(II)-induced broadening of the oligomeric ensemble of αB is accompanied by enhanced chaperone activity. Similar to full-length αB, the excised ACD (residues 64–152) shows picomolar binding affinity with respect to Cu(II). Each ACD binds one Cu(II) ion at the outer edge of the AP interface. Cu(II) is coordinated in the loop regions connecting the strands β3 and β4 as well as β5 and β6 + 7, involving residues His83, His104, His111, and Asp109 as potential ligands. Coordination of Cu(II) consequently competes with the intermolecular ion pair between Asp109 and Arg120 affecting the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Furthermore, Cu(II) binding triggers structural reorganization of β2-β3, which is of importance for dimer-dimer contacts in full-length αB (17Jehle S. Rajagopal P. Bardiaux B. Markovic S. Kühne R. Stout J.R. Higman V.A. Klevit R.E. van Rossum B.J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Jehle S. Vollmar B.S. Bardiaux B. Dove K.K.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, the metal ion Cu(II) potentially alters quaternary dynamics of both the dimeric subunit and the higher order assemblies of αB. Expression and purification of human, full-length αB (UniProt accession code: P02511) was performed as described elsewhere (29Mainz A. Jehle S. van Rossum B.J. Oschkinat H. Reif B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 15968-15969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cloning of the truncated construct αB10m (αB residues 64–152) was accomplished similarly to the procedure already described for full-length αB (29Mainz A. Jehle S. van Rossum B.J. Oschkinat H. Reif B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 15968-15969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used: CGTGGCCAGCATATGGGACTCTCAGAGATGCGCCTGG (forward-primer), CGCCTTCCATGGCTAGACCTGTTTCCTTGGTCCATTCACAGTG (reverse-primer). The obtained vector mod.pET30-αB10 was subject to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) to generate the point mutant αB10-N146D (αB10m). The vector mod.pET30-αB10m in turn was used to introduce further point mutations. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. αB10m and its variants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells for 4 h at 37 °C in LB medium (unlabeled protein) or 16 h at 22 °C in M9 minimal medium (uniformly 13C,15N-labeled protein). Due to the high susceptibility toward proteolysis, all purification steps were performed in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The following buffers were used: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA (buffer A); buffer A, 1 m sodium chloride (buffer B); 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA (GF buffer); and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium chloride (PBS buffer). After cell lysis and subsequent centrifugation, the filtered lysate in buffer A was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column. αB10m was eluted with a stepwise gradient of buffer B. The αB10m fraction was pooled and subject to Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography. Finally, the αB10m fraction was pooled and loaded onto a Superdex-75 gel-filtration column with αB10m eluting in GF buffer as a well separated and symmetrical peak. SDS-PAGE confirmed >98% purity of the αB10m pool, which was dialyzed against PBS buffer and concentrated to 1.1 mm. Aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. HSQC spectra of fresh and flash-frozen protein were found to be identical. Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed on a ZEN3500 Zetasizer NanoZS instrument (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a 50-milliwatt laser operating at 532 nm. The instrument detects back-scattering at an angle of 173°. Samples of αB (50 μm) in PBS buffer were incubated with CuCl2, ZnCl2, and CaCl2 at a 10-fold molar excess of the respective metal ion. After filtration (0.1 μm), 20-μl aliquots were measured at 25 °C in quartz cuvettes built for small volumes. After temperature equilibration, three measurements were performed for each sample. Each measurement consisted of 60 runs with a duration of 5 s each, thereby accumulating scattering data for 300 s. All samples revealed monomodal size distributions for αB multimers. The hydrodynamic diameter Dh and the polydispersity index Pd% were extracted from volume-weighted size distributions. Data analysis and estimation of molecular weights Mw,est (supplemental Fig. S1C), assuming a globular particle, was done using the software DTS 5.03 (Malvern Instruments). The Zetasizer NanoZS instrument (Malvern Instruments) was used to follow light scattering during heat-induced aggregation of bovine βL-crystallin (βL). Final concentrations for the different components were as follows: 2 μm βL (Sigma-Aldrich); 0.5, 1, and 2 μm full-length αB; 1 μm CuCl2. Higher concentrations of CuCl2 induced augmented aggregation of βL. Lyophilized proteins and CuCl2 were dissolved in PBS buffer and de-ionized water, respectively. Each sample of 40 μl was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before measurement. Three runs (5-s duration each) were performed to measure the mean count rate of scattered light. After measuring the initial intensity at room temperature, the sample was heated to 60 °C. The mean count rate was detected in 2 min intervals for a period of 30 min. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Notably, αB is stable at 60 °C in the absence and presence of Cu(II) giving rise to a constant baseline. The scattering intensities were normalized to the maximum intensity of the 2 μm βL sample in the absence of αB. For inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments, samples of αB and αB10m (80 μm monomer concentration) in PBS buffer were incubated with CuCl2 (160 μm) for 2 h with constant shaking at room temperature. The samples were subsequently dialyzed overnight against a 2000-fold volume of PBS buffer. After dialysis, protein concentrations were quantitated. A 200-μl sample solution was mixed with 1 ml of HNO3 (65% v/v) and decomposed in a microwave labstation (Ethos Plus, Milestone Inc.) at 170–210 °C and 6 bars for 30 min. ICP-MS was performed by using an Element 2 ShieldTorch system instrument (Thermo-Fischer Scientific) in peak-hopping mode with spacing at 0.01 atomic mass units, three points per peak, three scans per replicate, and an integration time of 300 ms per point. The rate of plasma flow was 15 liters/min with an auxiliary flow of 0.9 liter/min and a blend gas flow rate of 0.1 liter/min. The radiofrequency (rf) power was 1.3 kW. The sample was introduced using a cross-flow nebulizer at a flow rate of 1.02 liters/min. The apparatus was calibrated with a 6.5% HNO3 solution containing copper and zinc at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 parts per billion with Rh-103 as internal standard for all isotopes. Samples were measured in triplicate. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed at 25 °C employing a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal Inc.). Protein samples were dialyzed against a 500-fold volume of PBS buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in triplicate. The protein solutions were degassed for 10 min before use. To stabilize Cu(II) in buffered solution and to minimize nonspecific binding of Cu(II) in the titration experiment, we used Cu(Gly)2 as a weak chelator (26Ahmad M.F. Singh D. Taiyab A. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The glycine solution was prepared by dissolving glycine in the corresponding buffer after dialysis. CuCl2 was then dissolved in a 4-fold molar excess of glycine to ensure complete chelation of Cu(II). All solutions were prepared freshly. In the titration experiments 5-μl aliquots of 2 mm Cu(II) were injected into the cell containing αB10m (110 μm). A spacing time of 300 s was used. In control experiments (i) Cu(Gly)2 was injected into buffer only and (ii) glycine was injected into the protein solution. Both experiments revealed very weak and constant heat changes that were subtracted from the binding isotherm of the αB10m-Cu(II) titration. The curve was then fitted to a one-site binding model using Origin (MicroCal Inc.). The first three data points were excluded from the analysis, because the binding isotherm revealed an initial endothermic contribution. This observation might arise from Cu(II)-induced dissociation of either dimers or higher oligomers. To account for the competition between protein and glycine for Cu(II) binding, the apparent dissociation constant Kd,app had to be corrected as described previously (26Ahmad M.F. Singh D. Taiyab A. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Thompsett A.R. Abdelraheim S.R. Daniels M. Brown D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42750-42758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the real dissociation constant Kd for the respective Cu(II)-protein interaction was obtained as the product of Kd,app and the first dissociation constant of Cu(Gly)2 (2.5 × 10−6 m). Instead of precipitating αB with polyethylene glycol as published (15Jehle S. van Rossum B. Stout J.R. Noguchi S.M. Falber K. Rehbein K. Oschkinat H. Klevit R.E. Rajagopal P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 385: 1481-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we exploited the large molecular weight, and thus the intrinsic very slow molecular tumbling, of the αB oligomer to retard its rotational diffusion during MAS. The main advantage of this FROSTY MAS NMR approach is that the target molecule can be studied in solution (29Mainz A. Jehle S. van Rossum B.J. Oschkinat H. Reif B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 15968-15969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Bertini I. Luchinat C. Parigi G. Ravera E. Reif B. Turano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10396-10399Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sample conditions were as follows: 217 mg/ml uniformly 13C,15N-labeled αB (∼10 mm monomer) in PBS buffer and 20% (v/v) glycerol. For the metal-αB samples, CuCl2 and ZnCl2 were added to the αB solutions at a 3-fold molar excess. 40 μl of the viscous protein solutions were filled into 4-mm MAS rotors. Samples were measured at a magnetic field strength of 16.4 teslas (T) (Bruker Biospin) and at an effective temperature of −5 °C. MAS was performed at 12 kHz. Cross-polarization from 1H to 13C was accomplished with contact pulses of 0.8-ms duration. The rf field strengths were matched according to the n = 1 Hartmann-Hahn condition considering the ramp (75–100%) that was used for the 13C contact pulse (76 kHz (1H), 56 kHz (13C)). 1H decoupling during indirect and direct evolution periods was performed with an rf field strength of 76 kHz. The PDSD mixing time was set to 50 ms. A recycle delay of 3 s was used. The acquisition times amounted to 10 ms for the indirect 13C dimension and 12 ms for the direct 13C dimension. Solution-state NMR experiments were performed at 22 °C on 13C,15N-labeled αB10m and variants at monomer concentrations of 1 mm in PBS buffer containing 10% D2O. NMR spectrometers (Bruker Biospin) with magnetic field strengths of 14.1 T and 17.6 T were equipped with cryogenically cooled probe heads. Data acquisition and processing were done using TopSpin 2.0 (Bruker Biospin); further data analysis and resonance assignments were performed using the software Sparky. 3T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco, CA. Backbone resonance assignment of apo-αB10m and Cu(II)-αB10m was accomplished by recording standard triple-resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO) (32Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar, 33Clubb R.T. Thanabal V. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 213-217Google Scholar, 34Bax A. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). All amide resonances were assigned for apo-αB10m except that of Ser139. In titration experiments, CuCl2 in de-ionized water was added stepwise to αB10m and its mutants, respectively. Signal intensities and chemical shifts were extracted from HSQC spectra in the absence and presence of Cu(II). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) for 1H-15N correlations were calculated as follows: CSP = ((0.2 × Δδ15N)2 + (Δδ1H)2)−1/2 with Δδ15N and Δδ1H being the absolute values of the chemical shift differences in parts per million (ppm) for 15N and 1H, respectively (35Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 15N T1 and T2 relaxation rates were determined using standard pulse sequences with the following delays: 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 900, 2000, and 5000 ms (T1 measurements) and 6, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 82, 122, 162, 202, and 242 ms (T2 measurements) (36Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Signal intensities were fitted with mono-exponential decays, and relaxation rates were extracted. Rotational correlation times, τc, for the protein core were obtained as described elsewhere (37Fushman D. Ohlenschläger O. Rüterjans H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1994; 11: 1377-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Theoretical τc values were estimated with the program Hydro-NMR (38García de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 147: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) based on the x-ray structure of the ACD of human αB (13Bagnéris C. Bateman O.A. Naylor C.E. Cronin N. Boelens W.C. Keep N.H. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 1242-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The calculations were run for a temperature of 22 °C and a viscosity of 0.011 Poise. All the direct 13C-detected experiments were recorded at 22 °C on a 16.4-T Bruker AVANCE spectrometer, which was equipped with a cryogenically cooled probe head optimized for 13C direct detection. For mapping 13C chemical shifts, two-dimensional CACO and CBCACO spectra (39Bermel W. Bertini I. Duma L. Felli I.C. Emsley L. Pierattelli R. Vasos P.R. Angew. Chem. Int.

For the apo- and the 1:1 Cu(II) samples three-dimensional CBCACO and two-dimensional CCCO (41Bermel W. Bertini I. Felli I.C. Kümmerle R. Pierattelli R. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) experiments were also performed. The experiments enabled transfer of assignments for all 89 residues. The carrier frequencies were placed at 175.0 and 54.0 ppm for C′ and Cα, respectively, at 120.0 ppm for 15N and at 4.0 ppm for 1H. Composite pulse decoupling was applied during acquisition and during some of the elements of the pulse sequences with an rf field strength of 1.7 kHz for 1H (waltz-16) (42Shaka A.J. Keeler J. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 313-340Google Scholar) and 1.0 kHz for 15N (garp-4) (43Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). The common parameters were: recycle delay of 1.2 s, spectral widths of 50 ppm for C′, 40 ppm for Cα, 80 ppm for Cα/Caliphatic.

https://openalex.org/W2028922188,"Here, we examined the role of the extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the control of colonic epithelial cell proliferation in vivo and changes in β-catenin triggered by CaSR stimulation in human colonic epithelial cells in vitro. The in vivo studies, using a novel Casr intestinal-specific knock-out mouse, indicate that the genetic ablation of the Casr leads to hyperproliferation of colonic epithelial cells, expansion of the proliferative zone, changes in crypt structure, and enhanced β-catenin nuclear localization. The in vitro results indicate that stimulation of the CaSR, by Ca(2+) or by the calcimimetic R-568, produced a striking and time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser-552 and Ser-675, two amino acid residues that promote β-catenin transcriptional activity. The reduced phosphorylation of β-catenin coincided with a decline in its nuclear localization and a marked redistribution to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, CaSR stimulation promoted a down-regulation of β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. These studies demonstrate that signaling pathways emanating from the CaSR control colonic epithelial cell proliferation in vivo and suggest that the mechanism involves regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2038657817,"Formin proteins are actin assembly factors that accelerate filament nucleation then remain on the elongating barbed end and modulate filament elongation. The formin homology 2 (FH2) domain is central to these activities, but recent work has suggested that additional sequences enhance FH2 domain function. Here we show that the C-terminal 76 amino acids of the formin FMNL3 have a dramatic effect on the ability of the FH2 domain to accelerate actin assembly. This C-terminal region contains a WASp homology 2 (WH2)-like sequence that binds actin monomers in a manner that is competitive with other WH2 domains and with profilin. In addition, the C terminus binds filament barbed ends. As a monomer, the FMNL3 C terminus inhibits actin polymerization and slows barbed end elongation with moderate affinity. As a dimer, the C terminus accelerates actin polymerization from monomers and displays high affinity inhibition of barbed end elongation. These properties are not common to all formin C termini, as those of mDia1 and INF2 do not behave similarly. Interestingly, mutation of two aliphatic residues, which blocks high affinity actin binding by the WH2-like sequence, has no effect on the ability of the C terminus to enhance FH2-mediated polymerization. However, mutation of three successive basic residues at the C terminus of the WH2-like sequence compromises polymerization enhancement.

This study aimed to determine whether MRP proteins regulate cardiac cAMP homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that MRP4 is the predominant isoform present at the plasma membrane of cardiacmyocytes and that it mediates the efflux of cAMP in these cells. MRP4-deficient mice displayed enhanced cardiac myocyte cAMP formation, contractility, and cardiac hypertrophy at 9 mo of age, an effect that was compensated transiently by increased phosphodiesterase expression at young age. These findings suggest that cAMP extrusion via MRP4 acts together with phosphodiesterases to control cAMP levels in cardiac myocytes.—Sassi, Y., Abi-Gerges, A., Fauconnier, J., Mougenot, N., Reiken, S., Haghighi, K., Kranias, E.

https://openalex.org/W1970959407,"Subclass III SnRK2s (SnRK2.6/2.3/2.2) are the key positive regulators of abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. The kinases, activated by ABA or osmotic stress, phosphorylate stress-related transcription factors and ion channels, which ultimately leads to the protection of plants from dehydration or high salinity. In the absence of stressors, SnRK2s are subject to negative regulation by group A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2C), whereas the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the kinase domain of SnRK2.6 at 2.6-Å resolution. Structure-guided biochemical analyses identified two distinct interfaces between SnRK2.6 and ABI1, a member of group A PP2Cs. Structural modeling suggested that the two interfaces lock SnRK2.6 and ABI1 in an orientation such that the activation loop of SnRK2.6 is posited to the catalytic site of ABI1 for dephosphorylation. These studies revealed the molecular basis for PP2Cs-mediated inhibition of SnRK2s and provided important insights into the downstream signal transduction of ABA."
https://openalex.org/W1991892475,"To gain insight in the lifetimes of photosystem II (PSII) chlorophyll and proteins, a combined stable isotope labeling (15N)/mass spectrometry method was used to follow both old and new pigments and proteins. Photosystem I-less Synechocystis cells were grown to exponential or post-exponential phase and then diluted in BG-11 medium with [15N]ammonium and [15N]nitrate. PSII was isolated, and the masses of PSII protein fragments and chlorophyll were determined. Lifetimes of PSII components ranged from 1.5 to 40 h, implying that at least some of the proteins and chlorophyll turned over independently from each other. Also, a significant amount of nascent PSII components accumulated in thylakoids when cells were in post-exponential growth phase. In a mutant lacking small Cab-like proteins (SCPs), most PSII protein lifetimes were unaffected, but the lifetime of chlorophyll and the amount of nascent PSII components that accumulated were decreased. In the absence of SCPs, one of the PSII biosynthesis intermediates, the monomeric PSII complex without CP43, was missing. Therefore, SCPs may stabilize nascent PSII protein complexes. Moreover, upon SCP deletion, the rate of chlorophyll synthesis and the accumulation of early tetrapyrrole precursors were drastically reduced. When [14N]aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was supplemented to 15N-BG-11 cultures, the mutant lacking SCPs incorporated much more exogenous ALA into chlorophyll than the control demonstrating that ALA biosynthesis was impaired in the absence of SCPs. This illustrates the major effects that nonstoichiometric PSII components such as SCPs have on intermediates and assembly but not on the lifetime of PSII proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2037483133,"Diabetes mellitus is characterized by an impairment of glucose uptake even though blood glucose levels are increased. Methylglyoxal is derived from glycolysis and has been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus, because methylglyoxal levels in blood and tissues are higher in diabetic patients than in healthy individuals. However, it remains to be elucidated whether such factors are a cause, or consequence, of diabetes. Here, we show that methylglyoxal inhibits the activity of mammalian glucose transporters using recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells genetically lacking all hexose transporters but carrying cDNA for human GLUT1 or rat GLUT4. We found that methylglyoxal inhibits yeast hexose transporters also. Glucose uptake was reduced in a stepwise manner following treatment with methylglyoxal, i.e. a rapid reduction within 5 min, followed by a slow and gradual reduction. The rapid reduction was due to the inhibitory effect of methylglyoxal on hexose transporters, whereas the slow and gradual reduction seemed due to endocytosis, which leads to a decrease in the amount of hexose transporters on the plasma membrane. We found that Rsp5, a HECT-type ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for the ubiquitination of hexose transporters. Intriguingly, Plc1 (phospholipase C) negatively regulated the endocytosis of hexose transporters in an Rsp5-dependent manner, although the methylglyoxal-induced endocytosis of hexose transporters occurred irrespective of Plc1. Meanwhile, the internalization of hexose transporters following treatment with methylglyoxal was delayed in a mutant defective in protein kinase C.

Glucose is an easy-to-use energy source for all kinds of cells. However, because cellular membranes are not very permeable to glucose, cells are equipped with glucose transporters on the plasma membrane to take up glucose from outside of the cell. Many glucose transporters from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes belong to the major facilitator superfamily, which is characterized by a single polypeptide carrier with 12 transmembrane domains capable of transporting substrates across the membrane in response to a chemiosmotic gradient (1Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 229-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Walmsley A.R. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. Gould G.W. Trends Biochem.

Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, if the glucose concentration outside of cells is higher, glucose transporters take up glucose from the outside, but when the intracellular glucose concentration is higher than outside, they pump out glucose. Although glucose is necessary as an energy source, glucose homeostasis in blood is crucial for mammals. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a disruption of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose levels increase upon food intake, insulin is secreted from pancreatic β cells. The insulin signaling pathway in cells possessing insulin receptors is activated upon receipt of insulin, which leads to the translocation of a glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane thereby facilitating the influx of glucose (4Huang S. Czech M.P. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). In type 1 diabetes, insulin secretion is defective, whereas in type 2 diabetes, cells are insensitive to insulin (insulin resistance), which seems to be caused by lifestyle. In both cases, cells are impaired in taking up glucose from blood, and consequently, hyperglycemic situations develop, which leads to the induction of several diabetic complications. One of the causes of diabetic complications is the accumulation of advanced glycation end products, the synthesis of which is initiated by a nonenzymatic reaction between the aldehyde groups of glucose and amino groups of proteins, sometimes referred to as the Maillard reaction (5Dyer D.G. Blackledge J.A. Katz B.M. Hull C.J. Adkisson H.D. Thorpe S.R. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Z. Ernahrungswiss. 1991; 30: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).

Because MG contains two carbonyl groups, it has a 20,000-fold higher potential than glucose to produce advanced glycation end products (9Turk Z. Physiol. Res. 2010; 59: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MG levels and diabetic complications are closely related (10McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Benn J. Sonksen P.H. Clin.

One feature of diabetes mellitus is that the hyperglycemia is sustained even in a fasted state. The control of blood glucose levels mainly depends upon whether glucose transporters can transport glucose adequately (14Yki-Järvinen H. Helve E. Koivisto V.A. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Thurmond D.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To date, 13 glucose transporters, GLUT1-GLUT12 and Hmit1, have been identified in mammals (2Walmsley A.R. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. Gould G.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 476-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters are responsible for the supply of glucose to various tissues, storage of glucose (glycogen) in liver, uptake of glucose in response to insulin, and sensing of blood glucose levels in pancreatic β cells (16Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 17Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G541-G553PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian glucose transporters are classified into three groups on the basis of primary structure (19Uldry M. Thorens B. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). GLUT1–GLUT4 belong to a major facilitator superfamily (3Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT1, the first glucose transporter to be identified (20Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), is distributed in almost all tissues, and therefore, it is thought to play a crucial role in glucose homeostasis under normal conditions (19Uldry M. Thorens B. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because only GLUT4 is sensitive to insulin, it is involved in controlling blood glucose levels upon food intake (15Thurmond D.C. Pessin J.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because yeast has served as a model of higher eukaryotes to reveal the mechanisms of many pivotal biological events, it is feasible that we will gain a clue as to the effect of MG on the function of mammalian GLUTs by analyzing the effect of MG on yeast glucose transporters. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose transporters are referred to as hexose transporters (Hxts). S. cerevisiae has 17 hexose transporters (Hxt1–Hxt17) and Gal2 as a galactose permease, all of which belong to a major facilitator superfamily (21Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that MG inhibits the activities of not only yeast Hxts but also mammalian GLUTs. Furthermore, MG induced endocytosis of yeast Hxts in an Rsp5 (HECT-type ubiquitin ligase)-dependent manner, thereby lowering glucose uptake. We found that protein kinase C (Pkc1) is involved in the MG-induced endocytosis of Hxts. Intriguingly, a deficiency in phospholipase C (Plc1) accelerated the internalization of Hxts under normal conditions in an Rsp5-dependent manner. However, the MG-induced endocytosis of Hxts occurred independently of Plc1. The media used were YPD (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone), YPMal (2% maltose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone), SD (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids), SGal (2% galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids), and SMal (2% maltose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids). Appropriate amino acids and bases were added to the SD, SGal, and SMal media as necessary. To select the HXT null mutant carrying a plasmid (URA3 marker) harboring human GLUT1 cDNA or rat GLUT4 cDNA, cells were first spread on to YPMal agar (2%) plates after transformation, and cells grown on YPMal agar plates were replica plated on SMal agar plates without uracil. After verification of growth in SMal agar plates without uracil, cells were streaked on SD agar plates without uracil to verify the functional expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4. Yeast strains used are summarized in Table 1. To construct an rsp5wimp (RSP5 low level expression) mutant with the YPH250 background, the natMX-inserted RSP5 promoter region of EN44 (22Nikko E.

Next, 5 ml of culture was taken at the prescribed time and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube, and 10 μl of [14C]glucose (10.6 GBq/mmol, GE Healthcare) was added. Cells were then collected, washed with a chilled 0.85% NaCl solution, and suspended in 200 μl of distilled water. The cell suspension (150 μl) was mixed with 2 ml of a liquid scintillation mixture (Ultima-Flo AP, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the amount of [14C]glucose taken up by cells was measured using a scintillation counter (LS6500, Beckman Coulter). When cells were treated with latrunculin B (Lat-B, BIOMOL International), cells were pretreated with 100 μm Lat-B for 20 min prior to the addition of MG. Cells carrying Hxt1-GFP, Hxt2-GFP, or Hxt3-GFP were cultured in 200-ml flasks containing 50 ml of SD medium until a log phase of growth (A610 = ∼0.5); 10 mm MG was added, and the cells were incubated for the prescribed time. After being collected by centrifugation, cells were disrupted with glass beads in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque)) using BeadSmash 12 (Waken). Cell homogenates were kept on ice for 2 min and transferred to another tube. The resulting glass beads were mixed with 100 μl of buffer A and kept on ice for 2 min. The supernatant was mixed with the first cell homogenate, which was then centrifuged at low speed (3000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C) to remove unbroken cells and cell debris, and the resultant supernatant, referred to as whole cell extract (WCE), was transferred to another tube. WCE was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (soluble fraction) and pellet (insoluble fraction) were separated. The pellet was suspended in 75 μl of IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (Dojin) and protease inhibitor mixture, and the suspension was kept on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as a membrane fraction. The soluble fraction (4 μg of protein) and membrane fraction (40 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and then detected using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreacted bands were visualized with a kit (Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate, Millipore) using a LAS-4000 mini imaging system (FUJIFILM). To prepare the membrane fraction containing protein A-tagged Hxt2 (Hxt2-PA), MBY242 cells carrying the HXT2-PA gene (27Bagnat M. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14183-14188Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were cultured in SD medium until a log phase of growth and then transferred to fresh medium containing 0.1% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases. After 1 h, cells were collected and disrupted as described above. WCE was ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C (himac CS120, Hitachi). The pellet was suspended in buffer A and ultracentrifuged again. The resultant pellet was suspended in IPP150 buffer containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 50 μl of IgG beads (IgG-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with IPP150 buffer. To adsorb the protein A-tagged Hxt2 to IgG beads, the mixture was gently rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, IgG beads were washed with 1 ml of IPP150 buffer three times, and then 0.9 ml of 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.5) was added to elute Hxt2-PA. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 100% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%), and the mixture was kept on ice for 10 min to precipitate proteins. After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), the pellet was washed with acetone, and dried materials were dissolved in 25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After that, 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the mixture was boiled for 3 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a RC DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). After SDS-PAGE followed by the transfer of separated proteins onto a PVDF membrane, Hxt2-PA and its ubiquitinated form were detected using anti-protein A (Lockland) and anti-ubiquitin (BIOMOL International LP) antibodies, respectively.

Biochem. 2003; 13: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) carrying GLUT4 cDNA was cultured in SD medium until a log phase of growth, and the membrane fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation as described above. Anti-Hxt1, anti-Hxt2, anti-GLUT1, and anti-GLUT4 antibodies, which were donated by Dr. T. Kasahara, were used to detect proteins. To detect Pma1, an anti-Pma1 antibody (Encor Biotechnology) was used. Cells carrying GFP-tagged proteins were cultured in SD medium until a log phase of growth, and 10 mm MG was added. The localization of each protein of interest was determined periodically using a fluorescence microscope. To stain vacuoles, 10 ml of culture was centrifuged to collect cells, which were then suspended in 196 μl of YPD medium. Four microliters of 2 mm FM4-64 (Biotium) was added to the cell suspension and incubated at 28 °C in the dark. After 20 min of incubation, 1 ml of a 0.85% NaCl solution was added to the cell suspension and centrifuged to collect the cell. Cells were then suspended in fresh SD medium and incubated for the prescribed time in the presence or absence of MG at 28 °C. To explore the effect of MG on the function of hexose transporter (Hxt), we determined the rate of glucose uptake by yeast cells in the presence of MG. [14C]Glucose was added to the culture in which yeast cells were growing logarithmically, and the amount of [14C]glucose taken up by cells was determined. Fig. 1A shows the levels of [14C]glucose uptake after 15 min of the addition of various concentrations of MG. Glucose uptake was inhibited in the presence of MG in a dose-dependent manner, and ∼50% inhibition was attained by 10 mm MG. Next, we determined the time course of the effect of MG on inhibition of glucose uptake. The rate of uptake dropped by 35% within the first 5 min after the addition of 10 mm MG, after which it declined gradually. It had decreased by ∼60% after 60 min compared with that in the absence of MG. Several explanations are feasible regarding the reduction of glucose uptake following treatment with MG. For example, MG inhibited the activity of Hxts, or the number of Hxt molecules on the plasma membrane was decreased by endocytosis followed by degradation in vacuoles. To study these possibilities, we first determined whether endocytosis of Hxts occurred upon MG stress. S. cerevisiae has 17 HXT genes encoding glucose transporters. Because a mutant lacking one of these HXT genes is able to grow in a medium containing glucose as a source of carbon, these Hxts share redundant functions in terms of glucose uptake (21Ozcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because a mutant lacking HXT1 to HXT7 simultaneously loses the ability to grow in glucose medium (26Kruckeberg A.L. Ye L. Berden J.A. van Dam K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the rest of Hxts does not seem to play crucial roles in glucose uptake. The mRNAs of HXT1, HXT2, and HXT3 were abundant compared with those of other HXTs in cells cultured under ordinary laboratory conditions (i.e. containing 2% glucose) (29Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar), so we determined the localization of GFP-tagged Hxt1, Hxt2, and Hxt3 as representatives of Hxts using a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig. 2A, Hxt1-GFP, Hxt2-GFP, and Hxt3-GFP were located on the plasma membrane at a log phase of growth; however, small punctate vesicles appeared after 15 min of MG treatment, which grew in size (30–60 min), and fluorescence derived from GFP-tagged proteins was observed in vacuoles (60–120 min). We investigated whether membrane pro"

The worm Caenorhabditis elegans expresses >1000 of these receptors along with their cognate heterotrimeric G proteins. Here, we report properties of 9-cis-retinal regenerated bovine opsin [(b)isoRho] and human melanopsin [(h)Mo], two light-activated, heterologously expressed GPCRs in the nervous system of C. elegans with various genetically engineered alterations. Profound transient photoactivation of Gi/o signaling by (b)isoRho led to a sudden and transient loss of worm motility dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas transient photoactivation of Gq signaling by (h)Mo enhanced worm locomotion dependent on phospholipase Cβ. These transgenic C. elegans models provide a unique way to study the consequences of Gi/o and Gq signaling in vivo with temporal and spatial precision and, by analogy, their relationship to human neuromotor function.—Cao, P., Sun, W., Kramp, K., Zheng, M., Salom, D., Jastrzebska, B., Jin, H., Palczewski, K., Feng, Z.

A bioinformatics study identified a coevolving signal-accepting network of 10 amino acids in membrane-delimited HAMP proteins. To probe the functionality of this network we used a HAMP containing mycobacterial adenylyl cyclase, Rv3645, as a reporter enzyme in which the membrane anchor was substituted by the Escherichia coli chemotaxis receptor for serine (Tsr receptor) and the HAMP domain alternately with that from the protein Af1503 of the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus or the Tsr receptor. In a construct with the Tsr-HAMP, cyclase activity was inhibited by serine, whereas in a construct with the HAMP domain from A. fulgidus, enzyme activity was not responsive to serine. Amino acids of the signal-accepting network were mutually swapped between both HAMP domains, and serine signaling was examined. The data biochemically tentatively established the functionality of the signal-accepting network. Based on a two-state gearbox model of rotation in HAMP domain-mediated signal propagation, we characterized the interaction between permanent and transient core residues in a coiled coil HAMP structure. The data are compatible with HAMP rotation in signal propagation but do not exclude alternative models for HAMP signaling. Finally, we present data indicating that the connector, which links the α-helices of HAMP domains, plays an important structural role in HAMP function."
https://openalex.org/W2098643940,"LYVE-1+ corneal lymphatics contribute to drainage and immunity. LYVE-1 is widely accepted as the most reliable lymphatic marker because of its continuous expression in lymphatic endothelium. LYVE-1 expression in corneal lymphatics has not been examined. In this study, we report intact CD31+ corneal lymphatic capillary endothelial cells that do not express LYVE-1. The number of LYVE-1- gaps initially increased until 8 wk of age but was significantly reduced in aged mice. C57BL/6 mice showed a notably higher number of the LYVE-1-/CD31+ lymphatic regions than BALB/c mice, which suggests a genetic predisposition for this histological feature. The LYVE-1- lymphatic gaps expressed podoplanin and VE-cadherin but not αSMA or FOXC2. Interestingly, the number of LYVE-1- gaps in FGF-2, but not VEGF-A, implanted corneas was significantly lower than in untreated corneas. Over 70% of the CD45+ leukocytes were found in the proximity of the LYVE-1- gaps. Using a novel in vivo imaging technique for visualization of leukocyte migration into and out of corneal stroma, we showed reentry of extravasated leukocytes from angiogenic vessels into newly grown corneal lymphatics. This process was inhibited by VE-cadherin blockade. To date, existence of lymphatic valves in cornea is unknown. Electron microscopy showed overlapping lymphatic endothelial ends, reminiscent of microvalves in corneal lymphatics. This work introduces a novel corneal endothelial lymphatic phenotype that lacks LYVE-1. LYVE-1- lymphatic endothelium could serve as microvalves, supporting unidirectional flow, as well as immunological hot spots that facilitate reentry of stromal macropahges.—Nakao, S., Zandi, S., Faez, S., Kohno, R., Hafezi-Moghadam, A.

In addition, we recently reported on the expression of JAM-C in Schwann cells (SCs) and its importance for the integrity and function of peripheral nerves. To investigate the role of JAM-C in neuronal functions further, mice with a specific deletion of JAM-C in SCs (JAM-C SC KO) were generated. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls, JAM-C SC KO mice showed electrophysiological defects, muscular weakness, and hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli. In addressing the underlying cause of these defects, nerves from JAM-C SC KO mice were found to have morphological defects in the paranodal region, exhibiting increased nodal length as compared to WTs. The study also reports on previously undetected expressions of JAM-C, namely on perineural cells, and in line with nociception defects of the JAM-C SC KO animals, on finely myelinated sensory nerve fibers.

With a newly devised protocol, 0.6-1 mg of purified homogenous 9-cis-retinal-bound bovine isorhodopsin [(b)isoRho] and ligand-bound (h)A(2A)R were obtained from C. elegans from one 10-L fermentation at low cost. Purified recombinant (b)isoRho exhibited its signature absorbance spectrum and activated its cognate G-protein transducin in vitro at a rate similar to native rhodopsin (Rho) obtained from bovine retina.

We also demonstrate the reversal of replication forks carrying hemi-replicated DNA, indicating that MtRuvAB complex-catalyzed fork reversal is independent of symmetry at the fork junction. The fork reversal reaction catalyzed by MtRuvAB is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, is processive, and culminates in the formation of an extended reverse DNA arm.

One of the pathways posit a role for RecA in fork reversal and the generation of HJ intermediates that are subsequently processed to allow PriA-mediated replication restart (16Seigneur M. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In general, the RuvAB complex is known to drive the branch migration of HJs, whereas RuvC facilitates the resolution of junctions (18Cox M.M. Mutat.

E. coli RuvB protein is a hexameric DNA helicase that is recruited to the RuvA-Holliday junction complex, which in turn drives branch migration of the HJs (20Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A.

Genetic evidence implicates the role of RuvAB complex not only in the processing of HJs generated by RFR but also as one of the initiator molecules for RFR. In dnaEts, holDQ10am, and to some extent in rep helicase mutants, the RFR is catalyzed by RuvAB (15Baharoglu Z. Petranovic M. Flores M.J. Michel B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In particular, isolation of ruvA and ruvB mutants impaired specifically for RFR underscores the fact that the RuvAB complex indeed plays a key role in the conversion of stalled forks into HJ intermediates (37Baharoglu Z. Bradley A.S. Le Masson M. Tsaneva I. Michel B. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Le Masson M. Baharoglu Z. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although genetic studies reveal that RuvAB complex can convert replication forks into an HJ, the biochemical and mechanistic aspects of this process remain to be elucidated. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests a role for RecG helicase in regression of stalled replication forks (39McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 40McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although a role for RecG in the processing of replication forks arrested by UV-induced damage was proposed, it has since been shown that in UV-irradiated recG or ruvA ruvB mutant cells, the arrested replication forks were maintained intact, and DNA synthesis resumed with kinetics that were similar to those in wild-type cells (42Donaldson J.R. Courcelle C.T. Courcelle J. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coli mutants with defects in both ruvABC and recG display extremely poor growth phenotypes, even in the absence of DNA damage, indicating their requirement during exponential cell growth (43Rudolph C.J. Upton A.L. Briggs G.S. Lloyd R.G. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 210-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite the recent advances in our understanding of the expanding roles of RecG in processing of stalled replication forks, delineating its precise role is compounded by the lack of direct in vivo evidence supporting its role in fork reversal and by the fact that none of the pathways of RFR appear to require RecG (15Baharoglu Z. Petranovic M. Flores M.J. Michel B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Rudolph C.J. Upton A.L. Briggs G.S. Lloyd R.G. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 210-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although our understanding of the genetic basis of RFR catalyzed by E. coli ruvA ruvB is beginning to emerge, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying RFR in mycobacteria and other organisms. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical lung tissues have shown up-regulation of ruvA ruvB expression (44Rachman H. Strong M. Ulrichs T. Grode L. Schuchhardt J. Mollenkopf H. Kosmiadi G.A. Eisenberg D. Kaufmann S.H. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that their gene products might be necessary for DNA replication/repair and to sustain a long term, persistent infection. We further note that two independent studies have clearly demonstrated the essentiality of ruvA ruvB genes for infection by Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease (45Dresser A.R. Hardy P.O. Chaconas G. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Lin T. Gao L. Edmondson D.G. Jacobs M.B. Philipp M.T. Norris S.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000679Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To explore whether the E. coli paradigm can be generalized to other organisms, and to investigate the RFR activity of M. tuberculosis RuvAB complex, we used a series of synthetic substrates that mimic stalled replication fork intermediates. This approach is especially important because genetic analysis of M. tuberculosis ruvA ruvB and their role in the processing of stalled replication forks have not been elucidated. Our results reveal that M. tuberculosis RuvAB, unlike E. coli RuvAB (47McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41938-41944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), catalyzes the RFR reaction via the formation of Holliday junction. Furthermore, fork reversals catalyzed by MtRuvAB are independent of DNA supercoiling and are unimpeded by the presence of a short stretch of heterologous sequence.

E. coli HRS3401 is a ΔruvB::KmR derivative of E. coli AB1157. E. coli Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS (ΔruvB::KmR) strain was generated by moving the kanamycin resistance cassette from E. coli HRS3401 (ΔruvB::KmR), by P1 transduction, to E. coli Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS strain (48Thomason L.C. Costantino N. Court D.L. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2007; 79: 1.17.1-1.17.8Crossref Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis RuvA was purified as described previously (26Khanduja J.S. Tripathi P. Muniyappa K. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ODNs sequences are shown under supplemental Table 1. The ODNs were labeled at the 5′-end by using [γ-32P]ATP, and fork substrates were generated in a two-step process by annealing the appropriate combinations of ODNs, as indicated under supplemental Table 2. For each substrate, we added stoichiometric amounts of purified ODNs to 100 μl of 0.3 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 7) containing 3 m NaCl. Reaction mixtures were heated for 5 min at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 4 °C over a period of 2 h. Annealed substrates were gel-purified by electrophoresis on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 44.5 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The bands corresponding to the individual substrates were excised from the gel and eluted into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA). The model replication fork substrates were prepared as described under supplemental “Materials and Methods”. M. tuberculosis ruvB (Rv2592c) ORF sequence was obtained on line. The coding sequence corresponding to ruvB was PCR-amplified from the cosmid, MTCY 227, using ODNs and was directionally inserted into pET 21a(+) expression vector, as described under supplemental “Results and Discussion”. The resultant plasmid was designated pMTRB. M. tuberculosis RuvB was overexpressed in E. coli strain Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS harboring the plasmid pMTRB. The recombinant RuvB was purified through a series of conventional chromatographic procedures. Details of RuvB protein overexpression and purification are described under supplemental “Results and Discussion”. The purity of M. tuberculosis RuvB was >95%, as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue (supplemental Fig. 1). The sensitivity of E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3)pLysS(ΔruvB::KmR) cells carrying the vector pET21a(+) or pMTRB to UV or MMS was examined as described under supplemental “Materials and Methods”.

Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V, for variable times, depending on the fork substrate, at 4 °C. The electrophoresis time was 9, 8.5, 7.5, 7, or 6.5 h for HomFork 44/44, HomFork 44/36, HomFork 44/28, HomFork 44/20, or HomFork 44/16, and HomFork 16/44, respectively.

After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm EDTA. Reaction products were deproteinized by incubation with SDS (1%) and proteinase K (0.5 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 2.5 μl of gel loading dye, samples were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gel in 44.5 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Gel electrophoresis was performed at 150 V, for variable time depending on the fork substrate, at 4 °C. Electrophoresis run time was 9, 8.5, 7.5, 7, and 6.5 h for HomFork 44/44, HomFork 44/36, HomFork 44/28, HomFork 44/20 or HomFork 44/16, and HomFork 16/44, respectively. Gels were dried and exposed to the PhosphorImaging screen; the images were captured and the bands were quantified in UVI-Tech gel documentation station as described above.

After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by addition of 10 mm ATPγS and subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. One unit of the indicated restriction enzyme was added to the reactions, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for an additional 60-min period. Reaction products were deproteinized by incubation with SDS (1%) and proteinase K (0.5 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the addition of 3 μl of gel loading dye solution, samples were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) in 44.5 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 mm EDTA at 150 V for 5 h 30 min at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to the PhosphorImaging screen, and images were captured using Fuji FLA-9000 PhosphorImager. Reactions where restriction digestion was carried out with EcoRI, PvuII, or AlwNI alone, the samples were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) at 150 V for 6, 9, or 11 h, respectively. In time course reactions with RF substrate, reactions contained 1 μm MtRuvA and 200 nm MtRuvB in the reaction buffer. Reactions were terminated at the indicated time intervals by the addition of 5 mm ATPγS and subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. One unit of the indicated restriction enzyme was added to the reactions, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for additional 60 min. Reaction products were deproteinized and subjected to electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to the PhosphorImaging screen, and the images were acquired using Fuji FLA-9000 PhosphorImager. The bands were quantified in UVI-Tech gel documentation station using UVI-BandMap software (version 97.04) and plotted using Graphpad Prism (version 5.0). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of MtRuvB with other mycobacterial and eubacterial species revealed that it is evolutionarily related to the family of RuvB proteins (see supplemental Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 3). To ascertain the functional identity of M. tuberculosis ruvB in vivo, E. coli ΔruvB strain was complemented using the recombinant plasmid, pMTRB (see supplemental “Materials and Methods”). Complementation was examined by its ability to confer resistance to genotoxic stress. The results point toward M. tuberculosis ruvB being active in E. coli and its ability to make functionally similar contacts with E. coli RuvA and RuvC proteins (see supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). Purification of RuvB was carried out by expression from recombinant plasmid pMTRB in E. coli strain, Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS, as described under supplemental “Results and Discussion”. As a part of our broader goal to investigate the RFR activity of MtRuvAB complex, we first examined its binding to different substrates that are likely to occur during the processes of DNA replication and/or rescue of stalled replication forks. Activity was assayed in a binding buffer containing a fixed amount of the specified 32P-labeled DNA substra"

https://openalex.org/W2018714786,"Cell differentiation is compromised in acute leukemias. We report that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase (S6K) are highly expressed in the undifferentiated promyelomonocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line, whereas PLD2 expression is minimal. The expression ratio of PLD2 to mTOR (or to S6K) is gradually inverted upon in vitro induction of differentiation toward the neutrophilic phenotype. We present three ways that profoundly affect the kinetics of differentiation as follows: (i) simultaneous overexpression of mTOR (or S6K), (ii) silencing of mTOR via dsRNA-mediated interference or inhibition with rapamycin, and (iii) PLD2 overexpression. The last two methods shortened the time required for differentiation. By determining how PLD2 participates in cell differentiation, we found that PLD2 interacts with and activates the oncogene Fes/Fps, a protein-tyrosine kinase known to be involved in myeloid cell development. Fes activity is elevated with PLD2 overexpression, phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. Co-immunoprecipitation indicates a close PLD2-Fes physical interaction that is negated by a Fes-R483K mutant that incapacitates its Src homology 2 domain. All these suggest for the first time the following mechanism: mTOR/S6K down-regulation→PLD2 overexpression→PLD2/Fes association→phosphatidic acid-led activation of Fes kinase→granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation shortening could have a clinical impact on reducing the time of return to normalcy of the white cell counts after chemotherapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia."
