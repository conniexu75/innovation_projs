These adjuvants cannot be used in man because the mineral oil base is not degraded and persists at the injection site. Particularly with the complete adjuvant, unacceptable granulomas can be formed. There is real need for a safe and effective adjuvant for use in human immunisation programmes."

https://openalex.org/W2057557618,Serum factors that inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin to the acetylcholine receptor extracted in detergent from denervated rat muscle were detected by a sensitive assay. The serum of at least 5 and possibly 11 out of 15 patients with myasthenia gravis showed inhibitory activity that was localized to the globulin fraction. No controls showed inhibitory activity. The demonstration of inhibitory globulins may help explain the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of the neuromuscular junction in patients with myasthenia gravis.

In the majority of cases this means that particles that are less than 1 μm in size are of primary importance. Special significance is attached to the organic constitutents of aerosols. Many of these are known or potential carcinogens and most predominate in extremely small particles which become deposited almost exclusively in the lung."

https://openalex.org/W1654759002,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase from the rat renal medulla has been solubilized with the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX. The enzyme activity in a 100,000 x g Lubrol PX supernatant is resolved into three peaks by gel filtration on Sepharose 4B: Peak A in the void volume; Peak B, the major form, with a Stokes radius of 64 A; and Peak C with a Stokes radius of 34 A. When Triton X-100 is used to solubilize the enzyme activity is only found at the positions of Peaks B and C and the Stokes radii are 62 A and 28 A, respectively. The sedimentation coefficients for the two smaller forms have been determined by centrifugation in 5 to 20 % sucrose gradients. By comparing sedimentation of activity in sucrose gradients made up in H2O and D2O, the partial specific volume (v) of the predominant form (Peak B) was estimated. The molecular properties of the predominant form of adenylate cyclase in Triton X-100 are: s20,w, 5.9 S; v, 0.74 ml per g; mass, 159,000 daltons; f:f0, 1.6. For the minor form, the values are: s20,w, 3.0 S; mass, 38,000 daltons, f:f0, 1.2. The partial specific volume of the smaller species was assumed to be the same as the larger. The corresponding values determined in Lubrol PX are similar. The low value for v obtained in these studies suggests that adenylate cyclase binds very little detergent, less than 0.2 mg of detergent per mg of protein. Since interactions with detergents probably substitute for interactions with lipids and hydrophobic amino acid side chains, these findings suggest that no more than 5 % of the surface of adenylate cyclase is involved in hydrophobic interactions with other membrane components."

https://openalex.org/W1973841814,"The reproductive condition of a variety of benthic invertebrates from the bathyal San Diego Trough was monitored periodically. In this physically seasonless, deep-sea environment most species reproduce throughout the year, and only a few display highly synchronous, annual reproductive cycles. These few are not typical deep-sea species; they are known from shallow water and belong to groups which are relatively unimportant in abyssal depths. Of the 11 species examined, 3 bivalves, 2 ophiuroids, 2 isopods, 1 amphipod, and 1 polychaete breed year-round, and 1 brachiopod and 1 scaphopod spawn seasonally."

https://openalex.org/W2042966910,"A specific deficiency of methionine adenosyltransferase has been demonstrated in the liver of an infant with hypermethioninemia. Since the enzymatic activity was below that in fetal liver and the metabolic abnormality has persisted (the infant now being 1 year of age), there is probably a genetic mutation. Mass screening for hypermethioninemia may uncover more such cases."
https://openalex.org/W1625157788,"Protein fractions washed from the free small ribosome subunits present in a reticulocyte lysate, with 40 S and 60 S ribosome subunits and 9 S RNA from reticulocyte polysomes, promote the initiation of synthesis in vitro of both the α and β chains of rabbit hemoglobin. Changing relative concentrations of 9 S RNA, polysome-derived ribosome subunits, and different initiation factor fractions cause changes in the ratio of α- to β-globin product synthesized. Increasing 9 S RNA concentration with constant ribosome subunit and initiation factor concentration causes a decreasing ratio of α to β product, whereas increasing ribosome subunit concentration with constant 9 S RNA and initiation factor concentration promotes an increasing ratio of α to β product. Increasing levels of derived 40 S subunits relative to derived 60 S subunits with constant 9 S RNA and initiation factor concentration causes an increase in ratio of α to β product. Increasing levels of derived 60 S subunits relative to 40 S subunits causes a small decrease in ratio of α- to β-globin synthesized. In addition, the ratio of α- to β-globin synthesized is affected by the relative amounts of two separate fractions of the salt wash from the free small subunits. Increasing levels of a fraction containing a factor which inhibits the spontaneous association of polysome-derived 40 S subunits with 60 S subunits into single ribosomes causes an increase in the ratio of α- to β-globin product synthesized. The Mg2+ and K+ concentrations have marked effects on the ratio of α- to β-globin synthesized. The results are discussed in terms of (a) different affinities of the initiation sites of α- and β-mRNA for ribosome subunits active in initiation; (b) different availabilities of initiation sites of α- and β-mRNA to the initiating ribosome subunits; and (c) the concentration of ribosome subunits available to interact with the initiation sites of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2025666482,"The heart of Boltenia ovifera (the sea potato) is a tubular structure formed by a single layer of myocardial cells. Electron microscopic studies show that each cell contains a single myofibril located adjacent to the luminal surface of the cell. Electrical and mechanical measurement of a cannulated perfused heart demonstrate that only the luminal membrane is excitable and elicits contraction on depolarization. Calcium and magnesium exert antagonistic effects on tension, and potassium depolarizes the myocardium and produces contractures when the luminal membrane is exposed to various concentrations of these ions. The extraluminal membrane does not respond electrically or mechanically to calcium, magnesium, or potassium, and its potential seems to be effectively ""clamped"" by the luminal membrane. Functionally, therefore, this heart consists of a single active membrane with the adjacent contractile apparatus."
