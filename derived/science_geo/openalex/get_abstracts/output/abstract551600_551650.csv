Alterations in the mother's immune system during pregnancy, especially during key early periods of fetal neurodevelopment, may play a role. Choi et al. provided infectious or inflammatory stimuli to pregnant mice, which resulted in of spring exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of ASD (see the Perspective by Estes and McAllister). A subset of T helper cells that make the cytokine interleukin-17a in the mothers caused cortical defects and associated ASD behaviors in offspring. Therapeutic targeting of interleukin-17a during gestation reduced ASD symptoms in offspring. Science , this issue p. 933 ; see also p. 919"

Although orally introducing nominal protein antigens is known to induce such pTreg cells, whether a typical diet induces a population of pTreg cells under normal conditions thus far has been unknown. By using germ-free mice raised and bred on an elemental diet devoid of dietary antigens, we demonstrated that under normal conditions, the vast majority of the small intestinal pTreg cells are induced by dietary antigens from solid foods. Moreover, these pTreg cells have a limited life span, are distinguishable from microbiota-induced pTreg cells, and repress underlying strong immunity to ingested protein antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2268569236,"The ""cancerized field"" concept posits that cancer-prone cells in a given tissue share an oncogenic mutation, but only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. Most benign nevi carry oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutations but rarely become melanoma. The zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (NCPs) and specifically reexpressed in melanoma. Live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters shows that within a cancerized field (BRAF(V600E)-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the NCP state, revealing a fate change at melanoma initiation in this model. NCP transcription factors, including sox10, regulate crestin expression. Forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, which is consistent with activation of NCP genes and super-enhancers leading to melanoma. Our work highlights NCP state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation."

They also turn on the translation of proteins that will help them cope with the misfolded proteins generated during stress. How do they turn down translation in general, but maintain or increase translation of specific proteins? Starck et al. developed an approach that allowed them to look at the translation of specific messenger RNAs that were not down-regulated by stress.

The mechanistic link between this symptom and the genetic cause of the disease (mutations that compromise the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR) is not fully understood. Studying animal models, Shah et al. find that in the absence of functional CFTR, the surface liquid in the airways becomes acidic, which impairs host defenses against infection. This acidification occurs through the action of a proton pump called ATP12A. Molecules inhibiting ATP12A could potentially be developed into useful drugs. Science , this issue p. 503"

https://openalex.org/W2265237365,"Background Vietnam is a lower middle-income country with no national surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). We assessed the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial use in adult intensive care units (ICUs) across Vietnam. Methods Monthly repeated point prevalence surveys were systematically conducted to assess HAI prevalence and antimicrobial use in 15 adult ICUs across Vietnam. Adults admitted to participating ICUs before 08:00 a.m. on the survey day were included. Results Among 3287 patients enrolled, the HAI prevalence was 29.5% (965/3266 patients, 21 missing). Pneumonia accounted for 79.4% (804/1012) of HAIs Most HAIs (84.5% [855/1012]) were acquired in the survey hospital with 42.5% (363/855) acquired prior to ICU admission and 57.5% (492/855) developed during ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, the strongest risk factors for HAI acquired in ICU were: intubation (OR 2.76), urinary catheter (OR 2.12), no involvement of a family member in patient care (OR 1.94), and surgery after admission (OR 1.66). 726 bacterial isolates were cultured from 622/1012 HAIs, most frequently Acinetobacter baumannii (177/726 [24.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100/726 [13.8%]), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (84/726 [11.6%]), with carbapenem resistance rates of 89.2%, 55.7%, and 14.9% respectively. Antimicrobials were prescribed for 84.8% (2787/3287) patients, with 73.7% of patients receiving two or more. The most common antimicrobial groups were third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems (20.1%, 19.4%, and 14.1% of total antimicrobials, respectively). Conclusion A high prevalence of HAIs was observed, mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria with high carbapenem resistance rates. This in combination with a high rate of antimicrobial use illustrates the urgent need to improve rational antimicrobial use and infection control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2290737450,"The lymphatic endothelial receptor LYVE-1 has been implicated in both uptake of hyaluronan (HA) from tissue matrix and in facilitating transit of leukocytes and tumor cells through lymphatic vessels based largely onin vitrostudies with recombinant receptor in transfected fibroblasts. Curiously, however, LYVE-1 in lymphatic endothelium displays little if any binding to HAin vitro, and this has led to the conclusion that the native receptor is functionally silenced, a feature that is difficult to reconcile with its proposedin vivofunctions. Nonetheless, as we reported recently, LYVE-1 can function as a receptor for HA-encapsulated Group A streptococci and mediate lymphatic dissemination in mice. Here we resolve these paradoxical findings and show that the capacity of LYVE-1 to bind HA is strictly dependent on avidity, demanding appropriate receptor self-association and/or HA multimerization. In particular, we demonstrate the prerequisite of a critical LYVE-1 threshold density and show that HA binding may be elicited in lymphatic endothelium by surface clustering with divalent LYVE-1 mAbs. In addition, we show that cross-linking of biotinylated HA in streptavidin multimers or supramolecular complexes with the inflammation-induced protein TSG-6 enables binding even in the absence of LYVE-1 cross-linking. Finally, we show that endogenous HA on the surface of macrophages can engage LYVE-1, facilitating their adhesion and transit across lymphatic endothelium. These results reveal LYVE-1 as a low affinity receptor tuned to discriminate between different HA configurations through avidity and establish a new mechanistic basis for the functions ascribed to LYVE-1 in matrix HA binding and leukocyte traffickingin vivo."

The early stages of invasion are mediated via merozoite surface proteins that interact with human erythrocytes. The nature of these interactions are currently not well understood, but it is known that merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) is critical for successful erythrocyte invasion. Here we show that the peripheral merozoite surface proteins MSP3, MSP6, MSPDBL1, MSPDBL2, and MSP7 bind directly to MSP1, but independently of each other, to form multiple forms of the MSP1 complex on the parasite surface. These complexes have overlapping functions that interact directly with human erythrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2279116587,"The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is a major agricultural pest in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, has commonly been used for control of L. decemlineata since its registration in 1995. In the last 10 years, many field populations of L. decemlineata have begun to show increasing imidacloprid resistance. We studied resistance phenotype as a phenomenon that reduces neonicotinoid efficacy and has practical consequences for potato pest management. Although we have not observed complete field failure following the use of these products, multiple studies have demonstrated that the lethal concentration to kill 50% of the test organisms (LC50) in different field populations of L. decemlineata varies greatly which may suggest that resistance of L. decemlineata is heritable and involves genetic changes. An important challenge in understanding resistance is assessing the genetic mechanisms associated with resistance and classifying up-regulated genes that may be involved in combating an insecticide insult. In this study we uncovered trends in imidacloprid phenotypic response that have developed in the region by estimating the LC50 values among different field populations against a range of imidacloprid doses. The LC50 values collected in 2008-2011, and more recently in 2013 and 2014, show that some field locations remain susceptible to imidacloprid, while nearby fields (<100km) have developed high levels of resistance. We also sought to uncover potential mechanisms of resistance at each field location. We compiled a transcriptome for populations, characterized as phenotypically 'susceptible' and 'resistant', by isolating mRNA from adult beetles and analyzing gene expression level differences. Strong differences were observed in constituently up and down-regulated genes among different field populations. Most significantly, the up-regulation of 3 cytochrome p450s and a glutathione synthetase related protein in multiple resistant populations provide a mechanistic explanation of resistance evolution in L. decemlineata."

When T cells respond to a pathogen, they proliferate, and a fraction of their progeny goes on to form long-lived memory cells. It is not clear whether all of the T cell clones that respond to the initial infection have the potential to form memory T cells. Tubo et al. used a single-cell adoptive transfer model in mice to answer this question. Nearly all T cell clones produced memory cells, which suggests that breadth is probably an important component of immunological memory. Science , this issue p. 511"

Obstetric characteristics and clinical course were compared between CP cases in the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy database and controls in the perinatal database of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology born as live singleton infants between 2009 and 2011 with a birth weight ≥ 2,000 g and gestation ≥ 33 weeks.One hundred and seventy-five CP cases and 17,475 controls were assessed. Major relevant single factors for CP were placental abnormalities (31%), umbilical cord abnormalities (15%), maternal complications (10%), and neonatal complications (1%). A multivariate regression model demonstrated that obstetric variables associated with CP were acute delivery due to non-reassuring fetal status (relative risk [RR]: 37.182, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.028-69.032), uterine rupture (RR: 24.770, 95% CI: 6.006-102.160), placental abruption (RR: 20.891, 95% CI: 11.817-36.934), and preterm labor (RR: 3.153, 95% CI: 2.024-4.911), whereas protective factors were head presentation (RR: 0.199, 95% CI: 0.088-0.450) and elective cesarean section (RR: 0.236, 95% CI: 0.067-0.828).CP after 33 weeks' gestation in the recently reported cases in Japan was strongly associated with acute delivery due to non-reassuring fetal status, uterine rupture, and placental abruption."

Here, we replaced Sry by transgenic activation of its downstream target Sox9, and Eif2s3y, by transgenic overexpression of its X chromosome-encoded homolog Eif2s3x. The resulting males with no Y chromosome genes produced haploid male gametes and sired offspring after assisted reproduction.

However, and remarkably, oligomerization of the yeast enzymes regulates their functionality. Thus, the analysis of the structure of a complex of SoFfase with the polymeric inulin showed the direct involvement of the β-sandwich domain of an adjacent subunit in substrate binding (24.Álvaro-Benito M.

In this study, we report the three-dimensional structure of the yeast XdINV that discloses novel features and an unusual dimer. Complexes with relevant substrates and products have been obtained, which allowed mapping the catalytic pocket. The role of identified leading residues has been investigated by mutagenesis. Our results give the experimental evidence of the direct involvement of glycosylation in dimerization and activity of a GH32 enzyme and suggest the role of a flexible loop surrounding the catalytic pocket in discriminating substrate specificity. X. dendrorhous ATCC MYA-131 was grown in MMM medium as referred previously (1.Linde D. Macias I. Fernández-Arrojo L. Plou F.J. Jiménez A. Fernández-Lobato M. Molecular and biochemical characterization of a β-fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Pichia pastoris GS115 (his4−, Invitrogen) was used as expression host for the different enzyme variants. It was grown in YEPD medium (yeast extract 1%, peptone 2%, and glucose 2%) at 30 °C. MD media (YNB 1.34%, biotin 4 × 10−5 %, and glucose 2%) was used to select transformants. Expression and induction of proteins in P. pastoris were analyzed using BMG and BMM media (both are the same as MD but in potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and glycerol 1% or methanol 0.5% as carbon sources, respectively). Yeast growth was followed spectrophotometrically at a 600-nm wavelength. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for DNA manipulation and amplification using the standard techniques. The β-fructofuranosidase Xd-INV gene from X. dendrorhous (GenBankTM accession number FJ539193.2) comprises an open reading frame of 1995 bp corresponding to a 665-amino acid protein. The QDNS-pIB4 construction contained the 1902-bp fragment of Xd-INV responsible for the synthesis of the last 634 amino acids of this protein fused to the 267-bp fragment of the S. cerevisiae MFα secretion signal sequence (25.Gimeno-Pérez M.

DNA sequencing was used to verify that only the desired mutations were present in all the obtained constructs. X. dendrorhous β-fructofuranosidase was purified using tangential concentration and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, as described previously (26.Polo A. Linde D. Estévez M. Fernández-Lobato M. Sanz-Aparicio J. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Active fractions were concentrated using Microcon YM-10 (Amicon) filters and stored at −70 °C. β-Fructofuranosidase variants from X. dendrorhous (wild type and mutants) expressed in P. pastoris were purified as described elsewhere (25.Gimeno-Pérez M. Linde D. Fernández-Arrojo L. Plou F.J. Fernández-Lobato M. Heterologous overproduction of β-fructofuranosidase from yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, an enzyme producing prebiotic sugars.Appl.

ProtoBlue Safe Colloidal Coomassie-stained (National Scientific) denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 8% polyacrylamide) of the samples confirmed the purity of the protein fractions. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad microprotein determination assay and bovine serum albumin as standard. After purification of XdINV, protein deglycosylation was performed using endoglycosidase H (Endo H; New England Biolabs) as described previously (26.Polo A. Linde D. Estévez M. Fernández-Lobato M. Sanz-Aparicio J. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated protein was subjected to a 1-min ultrafiltration using an Amicon Ultra-4 50K device (Millipore) to remove the Endo H present in the sample and was subsequently concentrated to about 8 mg ml−1 using a 10-kDa cutoff membrane. β-Fructofuranosidase hydrolytic activity was determined by the dinitrosalicylic acid method adapted to a 96-well microplate scale as described previously (25.Gimeno-Pérez M. Linde D. Fernández-Arrojo L. Plou F.J. Fernández-Lobato M. Heterologous overproduction of β-fructofuranosidase from yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, an enzyme producing prebiotic sugars.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 99: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Standard enzymatic assays were performed using 2% sucrose in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, at 60 °C. Inulin (Orafti GR, BENEO Ibérica, S.L. Barcelona, Spain) and fructans from Agave tequilana (kindly supplied by Dr. Georgina Sandoval, CIATEJ, Guadalajara, Mexico) at 1% were also used in this assay. One unit of activity was defined as that catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of reducing sugar/min. Hydrolase activity analysis at 55-80 °C was carried out under the aforementioned conditions. The thermostability refers to the temperature required for 50% enzyme inactivation (enzyme half-life) after heating about 0.5 units of the pure enzyme at different temperatures (60-85 °C) during 10-120 min and was determined by removing samples at regular intervals and estimating the residual β-fructofuranosidase activity. For kinetic analysis, the initial velocity was measured in triplicate with 45–30 μg ml−1 of enzyme and using 0–80 mm sucrose, 0–60 mm raffinose, or 0–60 mm nystose. The reaction time was 20 min. The plotting and analysis of the curves were carried out using the kinetic module of SigmaPlot software (version 12). Kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the initial rate values to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The activity of several XdINV mutants was analyzed by zymogram analysis using non-denaturing gels (6% polyacrylamide) stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium-chloride, as described previously (1.Linde D. Macias I. Fernández-Arrojo L. Plou F.J. Jiménez A. Fernández-Lobato M. Molecular and biochemical characterization of a β-fructofuranosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous.Appl. Environ.

For data collection, native crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions consisting of mother liquor plus 10% (v/v) glycerol before being cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble) on ID23-1 beamline.

The inactive D80A mutant was deglycosylated as reported for native enzyme and tested for crystallization. The best diamond-shaped crystals were grown by mixing equal amounts of 8 mg ml−1 protein (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7) and a solution consisting of 1.3 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m Hepes or 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 7.5.

Finally, the ternary complexes of D80A-Fru with the corresponding buffer, Hepes or Bistris propane, were obtained in crystals pre-incubated with 30 mm fructose for 5–10 min and then adding different acceptors as maltotriose, isomaltose, or isomaltulose (all from Sigma) that were not found in the crystal. For data collection, all D80A crystals (except the D80A-sucrose complex) were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions consisting of mother liquor plus 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol.

Uncovering the molecular function of these effectors is essential for a mechanistic understanding of R. solanacearum pathogenicity.

Heterologous expression of RipAY, but not other ChaC family proteins conserved in various organisms, caused growth inhibition of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the intracellular glutathione level was decreased to ∼30% of the normal level following expression of RipAY in yeast. Although active site mutants of GGCT activity were non-toxic, the addition of glutathione did not reverse the toxicity, suggesting that the toxicity might be a consequence of activity against other γ-glutamyl compounds. Intriguingly, RipAY protein purified from a bacterial expression system did not exhibit any GGCT activity, whereas it exhibited robust GGCT activity upon its interaction with eukaryotic thioredoxins, which are important for intracellular redox homeostasis during bacterial infection in plants.

https://openalex.org/W2259071507,"The goal of this study is to generate high-resolution sea floor maps using a Side-Scan Sonar(SSS). This is achieved by explicitly taking into account the SSS operation as follows. First, the raw sensor data is corrected by means of a physics-based SSS model. Second, the data is projected to the sea-floor. The errors involved in this projection are thoroughfully analysed. Third, a probabilistic SSS model is defined and used to estimate the probability of each sea-floor region to be observed. This probabilistic information is then used to weight the contribution of each SSS measurement to the map. Because of these models, arbitrary map resolutions can be achieved, even beyond the sensor resolution. Finally, a geometric map building method is presented and combined with the probabilistic approach. The resulting map is composed of two layers. The echo intensity layer holds the most likely echo intensities at each point in the sea-floor. The probabilistic layer contains information about how confident can the user or the higher control layers be about the echo intensity layer data. Experimental results have been conducted in a large subsea region."
https://openalex.org/W2260198926,"High endogenous production of, or treatment with muricholic bile acids, strongly reduces the absorption of cholesterol. Mice abundant in muricholic bile acids may therefore display an increased resistance against dietary induced weight gain, steatosis, and glucose intolerance due to an anticipated general reduction in lipid absorption. To test this hypothesis, mice deficient in steroid 12-alpha hydroxylase (Cyp8b1-/-) and therefore abundant in muricholic acids were monitored for 11 weeks while fed a high fat diet. Food intake and body and liver weights were determined, and lipids in liver, serum and feces were measured. Further, responses during oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were evaluated. On the high fat diet, Cyp8b1-/- mice displayed less weight gain compared to wildtype littermates (Cyp8b1+/+). In addition, liver enlargement with steatosis and increases in serum LDL-cholesterol were strongly attenuated in Cyp8b1-/- mice on high fat diet. Fecal excretion of cholesterol was increased and there was a strong trend for doubled fecal excretion of free fatty acids, while excretion of triglycerides was unaltered, indicating dampened lipid absorption. On high fat diet, Cyp8b1-/- mice also presented lower serum glucose levels in response to oral glucose gavage or to intraperitoneal insulin injection compared to Cyp8b1+/+. In conclusion, following exposure to a high fat diet, Cyp8b1-/- mice are more resistant against weight gain, steatosis, and to glucose intolerance than Cyp8b1+/+ mice. Reduced lipid absorption may in part explain these findings. Overall, the results suggest that muricholic bile acids may be beneficial against the metabolic syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2309475325,"DnaK is the major bacterial Hsp70, participating in DNA replication, protein folding, and the stress response. DnaK cooperates with the Hsp40 co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. Under non-stress conditions, DnaK binds to the heat shock transcription factor σ32 and facilitates its degradation. Oxidative stress results in temporary inactivation of DnaK due to depletion of cellular ATP and thiol modifications such as glutathionylation until normal cellular ATP levels and a reducing environment are restored. However, the biological significance of DnaK glutathionylation remains unknown, and the mechanisms by which glutathionylation may regulate the activity of DnaK are also unclear. We investigated the conditions under which Escherichia coli DnaK undergoes S-glutathionylation. We observed glutathionylation of DnaK in lysates of E. coli cells that had been subjected to oxidative stress. We also obtained homogeneously glutathionylated DnaK using purified DnaK in the apo state. We found that glutathionylation of DnaK reversibly changes the secondary structure and tertiary conformation, leading to reduced nucleotide and peptide binding ability. The chaperone activity of DnaK was reversibly down-regulated by glutathionylation, accompanying the structural changes. We found that interaction of DnaK with DnaJ, GrpE, or σ32 becomes weaker when DnaK is glutathionylated, and the interaction is restored upon deglutathionylation. This study confirms that glutathionylation down-regulates the functions of DnaK under oxidizing conditions, and this down-regulation may facilitate release of σ32 from its interaction with DnaK, thus triggering the heat shock response.

NMR and EPR studies have revealed that in the ATP-bound state the NBD and SBD of DnaK are in a docked position, and the lid is in an open position; whereas in the ADP-bound or apo state, the NBD and SBD of DnaK are undocked, and the lid is predominantly in a closed position.

DnaJ is the Hsp40 partner of DnaK and interacts with the NBD and the SBD, promoting both ATPase activity and substrate binding of DnaK (16.Han W. Christen P.

The DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE complex works as a chaperone machine to mitigate the effects of heat shock stress, prevent protein aggregation, and facilitate protein folding (20.Arsène F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. The heat shock response of Escherichia coli.Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This machinery also controls the level of the heat shock response by interaction with the σ32 subunit of RNA polymerase, which is involved in expression of a number of heat shock-related genes (21.Grossman A.D.

Gross C.A. σ32 synthesis can regulate the synthesis of heat shock proteins in Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22.Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W.

Under non-stress conditions, formation of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE-σ32 complex inactivates σ32 and facilitates its degradation by the protease FtsH (20.Arsène F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B.

Stress causes σ32 to be released from the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE-σ32 complex, which triggers expression of heat shock genes. Thus σ32 plays a similar role to the transcription factor Hsf1 in eukaryotes (25.Sorger P.K. Heat shock factor and the heat shock response.Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 26.Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Identification of cis and trans components of a novel heat shock stress regulatory pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which σ32 (or Hsf1) is rapidly released from the Hsp70 complex remains unclear. Bacteria often encounter oxidative stress when they are attacked by reactive oxygen and reactive chlorine species released from the immune system of the host. It is therefore interesting to note that DnaK becomes inactive under conditions where oxidative stress is accompanied by heat shock (27.Winter J. Linke K. Jatzek A. Jakob U. Severe oxidative stress causes inactivation of DnaK and activation of the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The following factors are likely to contribute to the mechanism of inactivation of DnaK. (i) The dramatic decrease in cellular ATP levels due to oxidative stress will limit the function of ATP-dependent chaperones. (ii) Depletion of ATP and elevated temperature will lead to unfolding of the NBD of DnaK. (iii) Unfolding of the NBD of DnaK leaves its cysteine residue vulnerable to thiol modification (27.Winter J. Linke K. Jatzek A. Jakob U. Severe oxidative stress causes inactivation of DnaK and activation of the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reversible thiol modifications such as glutathionylation will cause DnaK to remain inactivated until both cellular ATP levels and reducing conditions are restored (27.Winter J. Linke K. Jatzek A. Jakob U. Severe oxidative stress causes inactivation of DnaK and activation of the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A number of cysteine modifications of DnaK have been observed in vivo under oxidative stress conditions, including S-nitrosylation (28.Wiktorowicz J.E. Stafford S. Rea H. Urvil P. Soman K. Kurosky A. Perez-Polo J.R. Savidge T.C. Quantification of cysteinyl S-nitrosylation by fluorescence in unbiased proteomic studies.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5601-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as well as sulfinic, sulfenic, and sulfonic forms (27.Winter J. Linke K. Jatzek A. Jakob U. Severe oxidative stress causes inactivation of DnaK and activation of the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that the cysteine residue of DnaK is indeed susceptible to modification under these conditions. Oxidative stress can induce heat shock gene expression and the heat shock response, similar to heat stress in bacteria and eukaryotes (29.Leichert L.I. Scharf C. Hecker M. Global characterization of disulfide stress in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30.Ahn S.G. Thiele D.J. Redox regulation of mammalian heat shock factor 1 is essential for Hsp gene activation and protection from stress.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It is reported that under oxidative stress conditions the half-life of σ32 becomes longer due to its release from the chaperone complex (31.Müller A. Hoffmann J.H. Meyer H.E. Narberhaus F. Jakob U. Leichert L.I. Nonnative disulfide bond formation activates the σ32-dependent heat shock response in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2807-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There is still no convincing explanation for the link between oxidative stress and release of σ32 from DnaK. However, the observation of cysteine modifications such as glutathionylation under oxidative stress conditions could provide a clue to this mystery. To address the significance of DnaK glutathionylation and the mechanism by which glutathionylation regulates the function of DnaK, we investigated the conditions under which the cysteine residue of DnaK becomes glutathionylated and then studied the effect of glutathionylation on the structure and function of DnaK. We found that glutathionylation affects the interaction of DnaK with its key partners DnaJ, GrpE, and σ32. This study indicates a mechanism by which DnaK is able to transfer redox information and thus could provide a bridge between oxidative stress and the heat shock response. The genes for dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, rpoH (for production of σ32), and grxC (for production of Grx3) were cloned from the genomic DNA of E. coli C41 cells. The dnaK truncations were derived from the wild-type dnaK gene. dnaK, its truncations, rpoH, and grxC genes were ligated into the pET28a-SMT3 expression plasmid for production of protein with a cleavable His6-Smt3 tag. dnaJ and grpE genes were ligated into the mini pRSETa expression plasmid for production of protein with an uncleavable His6 tag. Primer sequences are shown in Table 1. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primers used for cloning and mutation of proteins used in this studyProtein namePrimersWT DnaKForward, 5′-CATCACGGATCCATGGGTAAAATAATTGGTATCGACCTGGGTA-3′Reverse, 5′-CGCTCGAAGCTTTTATTTTTTGTCTTTGACTTCTTCAAATTCAGCG-3′Δ508–638DnaKForward, 5′-CATCACGGATCCATGGGTAAAATAATTGGTATCGACCTGGGTA-3′Reverse, ′-CGCTCGAAGCTTACAGACCAGAAGAAGCCTTGATGGTGAT-3′Δ553–638DnaKForward, 5′-CATCACGGATCCATGGGTAAAATAATTGGTATCGACCTGGGTA-3′Reverse, 5′-CGCTCG AAGCTTATTCTTCAACCTGCTTACGGGTGCTGTGC-3′Δ606–638DnaKForward, 5′-CATCACGGATCCATGGGTAAAATAATTGGTATCGACCTGGGTA-3′Reverse, 5′-CGCTCGAAGCTTATTGCTGCTGGGCGATTTCCATCAGTTT-3′DnaK T199AForward, 5′-GTGGTGCTTTCGATATTTCTATTATCGAAATCGACG-3′Reverse, 5′-CGAAAGCACCACCACCCAGGTCATAAACCGC-3′Grx3Forward, 5′-CATCACGGATCCATGGCCAATGTTGAAATCTATACC-3′Reverse, 5′-CGCTCGAAGCTTATTTCAGCAGGGGGTCCAGTCCACCAC-3′DnaJForward, 5′-GGGCACGGATCCAAGATGGCTAAGCAAGATTATTACG-3′Reverse, 5′-ACACTTCCATGGTTAGCGGGTCAGGTCGTCAAAAA-3′GrpEForward, 5′-AACTGGCTCGAGATGAGTAGTAAAGAACAGAAAACGC-3′Reverse, 5′-ACACCTCCATGGTTAAGCTTTTGCTTTCGCTACAGTA-3′σ32Forward, 5′-GAGAGGGGATCCATGACTGACAAAATGCAAAGTTTAGC-3′Reverse, 5′-ATAGCGAAGCTTACGCTTCAATGGCAGCACGCAAT-3′ Open table in a new tab All the proteins were produced in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown at 16 °C for 16–20 h. The harvested cells were lysed using a JNBIO JN-3000 PLUS high-pressure cell press in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the debris was removed by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatant was then loaded onto a nickel affinity column (chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin, GE Healthcare) and washed with Buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted using Buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. His6-Smt3-DnaK, His6-Smt3-fused DnaK truncations, and His6-Smt3-Grx3 were cleaved by the protease Ulp1 at 4 °C for 1 h to remove the His6-Smt3 fusion tag. Then the cleaved proteins were loaded onto the nickel affinity column again after changing to Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the run-through was collected for further SEC purification. The concentrated proteins were loaded onto a 120-ml SuperdexTM 200 HiLoad column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2). The dimer and monomer peaks were collected for glutathionylation experiments. His6-DnaJ, His6-GrpE, and His6-Smt3-σ32 were further purified using a 120-ml SuperdexTM 200 HiLoad column equilibrated with Buffer B. All protein concentrations are given in terms of monomer and were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce). Cysteine reactivity of DnaK was measured by Ellman assay as described (32.Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Ellman's reagent: 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)—a reexamination.Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) to predict the possibility of glutathionylation. A standard curve was obtained using 0–100 μm free cysteine. We mixed 5 μl of 10 mm DTNB in 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5, with 145 μl of 10–20 μm DnaK, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured in a SpectraMax M3e multimode plate reader (Molecular Devices) at room temperature. If ADP, ATP, or peptide was added, 1 mm ADP/ATP/NRLLLTG peptide was mixed with DnaK to give a total volume of 145 μl, and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h before DTNB was added. The number of active cysteine residues can be calculated by dividing the concentration of free thiols in the protein by the concentration of protein. To measure the pKa of the cysteine residue in DnaK, we recorded the specific absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm according to the pH-dependent ionization of the nucleophilic cysteine (33.Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Reactivity and ionization of the active site cysteine residues of DsbA, a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Measurements using 15 μm DnaK were carried out at 25 °C in Buffer B in a 1-cm-path length, 0.4-ml-volume cuvette on a Shimadzu UVmini-1240 instrument. The pH of the protein solution was increased from 7.5 to 12.5 by the stepwise addition of calculated volumes of 6 n KOH in Buffer B. Absorption of buffer at different pH values was subtracted. Molar absorbance was corrected according to the actual volume and concentration of DnaK. The pKa value was estimated from the curve of the pH-dependent absorption at 240 nm according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The predicted pKa value was calculated using online Propka software using the NMR structure of DnaK (Protein Data Bank code 2kho). For the DnaK homologue of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the structure was modeled using the software Modeller (34.Webb B. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling using MODELLER.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2014; 47: 5.6.1-5.6.32Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) using the S. enterica Typhimurium DnaK sequence and the E. coli DnaK structure (Protein Data Bank code 2kho). The predicted pKa value was then calculated as above. A solution of 15 μm DnaK or its mutant was incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 mm GSH and 1 mm diamide to allow the glutathionylation reaction to proceed. To deglutathionylate the protein, 10 mm DTT was added to the reaction mixture. GSH, diamide, and/or DTT was removed by dialysis. (To prevent oxidation of the untreated DnaK control during dialysis, 10 mm DTT was added before dialysis.) To test the effect of nucleotide on glutathionylation of DnaK, 0.5 mm ATP or ADP was premixed with DnaK T199A for 30 min at room temperature before GSH and diamide were added. To test deglutathionylation of DnaK by Grx3, 10 μm glutathionylated DnaK was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under each of the following conditions: 20 μm GSH, 40 μm GSH, 1.5 μm Grx3, a combination of 1.5 μm Grx3 and 20 μm GSH, or 9 μm Grx3. To test whether glutathionylation of DnaK can occur under conditions mimicking oxidative stress in cells, BL21(DE3) E. coli cells bearing the pET28a-Smt3-DnaK plasmid were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 16 °C for 16–20 h. To induce oxidative stress conditions, the cells were treated with 4 mm H2O2 at 42 °C for 15 min before harvesting and then lysing the cells in PBS buffer containing 2 mm GSSG using a JNBIO JN-3000 PLUS high-pressure cell press. The cell lysate was treated with 2 mm GSSG at 37 °C for 30 min. DnaK was then separated from the cell lysate using a nickel affinity column followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE as described above, and cysteine modification was then detected by mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF and nano-LC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS/MS were performed to detect cysteine modifications of DnaK. Glutathionylated peptide peaks can be distinguished in MALDI-TOF spectra by the corresponding 305-Da increase in molecular mass when the samples are prepared without reducing agents such as DTT. For nano-LC-LTQ-Orbitrap XL MS/MS, trypsin-digested peptides were separated by a C18 reverse phase column (filled with 3-μm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ from Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) and loaded by a C18 reverse phase column (filled with 5-μm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ from Dr. Maisch GmbH) onto the LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS system. Data were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Fischer Scientific). The second MS spectra were searched in the E. coli database using the SEQUEST search engine. Glutathionylation or oxidation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. The matching of searched peptide and MS spectra was filtered by Percolator calculation. Glutathionylation or deglutathionylation of DnaK was also confirmed by the absence or presence of free thiols by staining with Alexa Fluor® 350 dye (Invitrogen) (blue fluorescence). DnaK was boiled for 10 min to destroy its secondary structure. Cooled protein was mixed with the dye and incubated in the dark at room temperature for at least 30 min. SDS-PAGE was performed to separate protein and surplus dye. Fluorescence of Alexa Fluor 350 dye was observed using excitation at 254 nm with a UV lamp. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Hitachi F-4500 or a Shimadzu RF-5301PC instrument. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of glutathionylated and deglutathionylated DnaK were measured from 300 to 400 nm using excitation wavelengths of 280 and 295 nm (to eliminate absorbance of ATP at 280 nm) at 25 °C. The proteins were prepared in Buffer B. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired between 190 and 260 nm on a Chirascan Plus CD instrument (Applied Photophysics, UK) at 25 °C in a 0.1-mm-path length thermostated quartz cuvette after preincubation for 10 min at 25 °C. Spectra of 14 μm control, glutathionylated, and deglutathionylated DnaK were measured in Buffer B. Temperature-induced denaturation measurements were performed under the following conditions: 2.5 μm control, glutathionylated, or deglutathionylated DnaK was prepared in Buffer B in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. Denaturation was followed by monitoring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm. A temperature ramp of 0.5 °C/min was applied between 25 and 95 °C. All equilibrium measurements were performed using a Chirascan Plus CD instrument in a 1-mm-path length thermostated quartz cuvette. Data were collected with a band pass of 1 nm, and the sensitivity was set to 100 millidegrees. The unfolding curves were fitted to a two-state or three-state therm"

Numerous studies demonstrate gender differences in attitudes to risk and loss in financial decision-making, often finding that women are more loss and risk averse than men. It is unclear what drives these effects and whether cyclically varying hormonal differences between men and women contribute to differences in economic preferences. We focus here on how economic rationality and preferences change as a function of menstrual cycle phase in women. We tested adherence to the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), the standard test of economic rationality. If choices satisfy GARP then there exists a well-behaved utility function that the subject's decisions maximize. We also examined whether risk attitudes and loss aversion change as a function of cycle phase. We found that, despite large fluctuations in hormone levels, women are as technically rational in their choice behavior as their male counterparts at all phases of the menstrual cycle. However, women are more likely to choose risky options that can lead to potential losses while ovulating; during ovulation women are less loss averse than men and therefore more economically rational than men in this regard. These findings may have market-level implications: ovulating women more effectively maximize expected value than do other groups."

Recent attempts to identify molecular targets for specific therapies have shown that Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) is significantly mutated in a small number of patients. However, few inhibitors for the potential treatment for NRAS mutant neuroblastoma have been investigated so far. In this in-vitro study, we show that MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901 block cell growth in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma cell lines but not in NRAS wild-type cell lines. Several studies show that mutant NRAS leads to PI3K pathway activation and combined inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR effectively block cell growth. However, we observed the combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K or AKT inhibitors did not show synergestic effects on cell growth. Thus, we tested single mTOR inhibitors Everolimus and AZD8055. Interestingly, Everolimus and AZD8055 alone were sufficient to block cell growth in NRAS mutant cell lines but not in wild-type cell lines. We found that Everolimus alone induced apoptosis in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma. Furthermore, the combination of mTOR and MEK inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth inhibition. Taken together, our results show that NRAS mutant neuroblastoma can be targeted by clinically available Everolimus alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors which could impact future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2252899779,"Plant roots exude numerous metabolites into the soil that influence nutrient availability. Although root exudate composition is hypothesized to be under selection in low fertility soils, few studies have tested this hypothesis in a phylogenetic framework. In this study, we examined root exudates of three pairs of Helianthus species chosen as phylogenetically-independent contrasts with respect to native soil nutrient availability. Under controlled environmental conditions, seedlings were grown to the three-leaf-pair stage, then transferred to either high or low nutrient treatments. After five days of nutrient treatments, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for analysis of root exudates, and detected 37 metabolites across species. When compared in the high nutrient treatment, species native to low nutrient soils exhibited overall higher exudation than their sister species native to high nutrient soils in all three species pairs, providing support for repeated evolutionary shifts in response to native soil fertility. Species native to low nutrient soils and those native to high nutrient soils responded similarly to low nutrient treatments with increased exudation of organic acids (fumaric, citric, malic acids) and glucose, potentially as a mechanism to enhance nutrition acquisition. However, species native to low nutrient soils also responded to low nutrient treatments with a larger decrease in exudation of amino acids than species native to high nutrient soils in all three species pairs. This indicates that species native to low nutrient soils have evolved a unique sensitivity to changes in nutrient availability for some, but not all, root exudates. Overall, these repeated evolutionary divergences between species native to low nutrient soils and those native to high nutrient soils provide evidence for the adaptive value of root exudation, and its plasticity, in contrasting soil environments."

https://openalex.org/W2264784198,"Anthropogenic infrastructure such as roads and non-native species are major causes of species endangerment. Understanding animal behavioral responses to roads and traffic provides insight into causes and mechanisms of effects of linear development on wildlife and aids effective mitigation and conservation. We investigated effects of roads and traffic on space use and movements of two forest-dwelling species: endemic, forest-dependent Mount Graham red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) and introduced, edge-tolerant Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti). To assess the effects of roads on space use and movement patterns, we compared the probability that a squirrel home range included roads and random lines in forests, and assessed effects of traffic intensity on rate of road crossing and movement patterns. Red squirrels avoided areas adjacent to roads and rarely crossed roads. In contrast, Abert's squirrels were more likely to include roads in their home ranges compared to random lines in forests. Both red squirrels and Abert's squirrels increased speed when crossing roads, compared to before and after road crossings. Increased hourly traffic volume reduced the rate of road crossings by both species. Behavioral responses of red squirrels to roads and traffic resemble responses to elevated predation risk, including reduced speed near roads and increased tortuosity of movement paths with increased traffic volume. In contrast, Abert's squirrels appeared little affected by roads and traffic with tortuosity of movement paths reduced as distance to roads decreased. We found that species with similar body size category (<1 kg) but different habitat preference and foraging strategy responded to roads differently and demonstrated that behavior and ecology are important when considering effects of roads on wildlife. Our results indicate that roads restricted movements and space use of a native forest-dependent species while creating habitat preferred by an introduced, edge-tolerant species."
https://openalex.org/W2257403823,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a maternally imprinted disorder and leading cause of obesity, is characterised by insatiable appetite, poor muscle development, cognitive impairment, endocrine disturbance, short stature and osteoporosis. A number of causative loci have been located within the imprinted Prader-Willi Critical Region (PWCR), including a set of small non-translated nucleolar RNA’s (snoRNA). Recently, micro-deletions in humans identified the snoRNA Snord116 as a critical contributor to the development of PWS exhibiting many of the classical symptoms of PWS. Here we show that loss of the PWCR which includes Snord116 in mice leads to a reduced bone mass phenotype, similar to that observed in humans. Consistent with reduced stature in PWS, PWCR KO mice showed delayed skeletal development, with shorter femurs and vertebrae, reduced bone size and mass in both sexes. The reduction in bone mass in PWCR KO mice was associated with deficiencies in cortical bone volume and cortical mineral apposition rate, with no change in cancellous bone. Importantly, while the length difference was corrected in aged mice, consistent with continued growth in rodents, reduced cortical bone formation was still evident, indicating continued osteoblastic suppression by loss of PWCR expression in skeletally mature mice. Interestingly, deletion of this region included deletion of the exclusively brain expressed Snord116 cluster and resulted in an upregulation in expression of both NPY and POMC mRNA in the arcuate nucleus. Importantly, the selective deletion of the PWCR only in NPY expressing neurons replicated the bone phenotype of PWCR KO mice. Taken together, PWCR deletion in mice, and specifically in NPY neurons, recapitulates the short stature and low BMD and aspects of the hormonal imbalance of PWS individuals. Moreover, it demonstrates for the first time, that a region encoding non-translated RNAs, expressed solely within the brain, can regulate bone mass in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2309574602,"Human airway epithelial cells express pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels to release ATP, which regulates mucociliary clearance. Airway inflammation causes mucociliary dysfunction. Exposure of primary human airway epithelial cell cultures to IFN-γ for 48 h did not alter Panx1 protein expression but significantly decreased ATP release in response to hypotonic stress. The IFN-γ-induced functional down-regulation of Panx1 was due to the up-regulation of dual oxidase 2 (Duox2). Duox2 suppression by siRNA led to an increase in ATP release in control cells and restoration of ATP release in cells treated with IFN-γ. Both effects were reduced by the pannexin inhibitor probenecid. Duox2 up-regulation stoichiometrically increases H2O2 and proton production. H2O2 inhibited Panx1 function temporarily by formation of disulfide bonds at the thiol group of its terminal cysteine. Long-term exposure to H2O2, however, had no inhibitory effect. To assess the role of cellular acidification upon IFN-γ treatment, fully differentiated airway epithelial cells were exposed to ammonium chloride to alkalinize the cytosol. This led to a 2-fold increase in ATP release in cells treated with IFN-γ that was also inhibited by probenecid. Duox2 knockdown also partially corrected IFN-γ-mediated acidification. The direct correlation between intracellular pH and Panx1 open probability was shown in oocytes. Therefore, airway epithelial cells release less ATP in response to hypotonic stress in an inflammatory environment (IFN-γ exposure). Decreased Panx1 function is a response to cell acidification mediated by IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of Duox2, representing a novel mechanism for mucociliary dysfunction in inflammatory airway diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2261531824,"The pulmonary vasculature constitutively expresses the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 ligands intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and -2. In this study, effector T cells were temporarily entrapped by the lung vasculature on their way to inflamed lymph nodes, and this entrapment was strongly reduced in ICAM-1 and -2 double-deficient mice (79 and 86% reduction for CD8+ and CD4+ effectors, respectively, compared with wild-type mice). Although the pulmonary vasculature has been suggested to be masked by the heparan sulfate-containing glycocalyx, which is susceptible to heparanase-mediated shedding, lung and lymphocyte heparanase have been found to be unnecessary for this entrapment. Systemic LPS induced rapid neutrophil entrapment in the lung vasculature, but in contrast to T-cell entrapment, this sequestration was ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and heparanase independent. Furthermore, neutrophil migration into the bronchoalveolar space induced by LPS inhalation and LPS-induced leakage of red blood cells into this space were not dependent on lung ICAMs or heparanase activity. Nevertheless, heparanase was critical for neutrophil accumulation in smoke-exposed lungs. Our results indicate that, whereas T cells use ICAM-1 and -2 for temporary pulmonary entrapment, neutrophils get sequestered and extravasate into inflamed lungs independent of ICAMs. This is the first demonstration that the pulmonary vasculature is differentially recognized by T cells and neutrophils.—Petrovich, E., Feigelson, S.

Here, we describe a first insight into the structure-function relationship of ADGRs using the family member ADGR subfamily G member 4 (ADGRG4)/GPR112 as a model receptor. In a bio-informatics approach, we compared conserved, functional elements of the well-characterized class A and class B1 secretin-like GPCRs with the ADGRs. We identified several potential equivalent motifs and subjected those to mutational analysis. The importance of the mutated residues was evaluated by examining their effect on the high constitutive activity of the N-terminally truncated ADGRG4/GPR112 in a 1-receptor-1-G protein Saccharomyces cerevisiae screening system and was further confirmed in a transfected mammalian human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. We evaluated the results in light of the crystal structures of the class A adenosine A2A receptor and the class B1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1. ADGRG4 proved to have functionally important motifs resembling class A, class B, and combined elements, but also a unique highly conserved ADGR motif (H3.33). Given the high conservation of these motifs and residues across the adhesion GPCR family, it can be assumed that these are general elements of ADGR function.—Peeters, M. C., Mos, I., Lenselink, E.

Genotypic analysis of a total of 523 subjects (260 patients and 263 controls) revealed an overwhelming presence of Gln399Gln in the case subjects against the controls (P < 0.0068), indicating significant level of association of this nsSNP with schizophrenia; the Gln399 allele frequency was also perceptibly more in cases than in controls (p < 0.003; OR = 1.448). The results of the genotypic studies were further validated using pathogenicity and stability prediction analysis employing computational tools [I-Mutant Suite, iStable, PolyPhen2, SNAP, and PROVEAN], with a view toassess the magnitude of deleteriousness of the mutation. The pathogenicity analysis reveals that the nsSNP could be deleterious inasmuch as it could affect the functionality of the gene, and interfere with protein function. Molecular dynamics simulation of 60ns was performed using GROMACS to analyse structural change due to a mutation (Arg399Gln) that was never examined before. RMSD, RMSF, hydrogen bonds, radius of gyration and SASA analysis showedthe existence of asignificant difference between the native and the mutant protein. The present study gives astrong indication that the XRCC1 locus deserves serious attention, as it could be a potential candidatecontributing to the etio-pathogenesis of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2265686893,"Background Although 5-HT2A serotonergic antagonists have been used to treat vascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus or obesity, their effects on leukocyte-endothelial interactions have not been fully investigated. In this study, we assessed the effects of sarpogrelate hydrochloride (SRPO), a 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist, on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in obesity both in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Findings In the in vivo experiment, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD), comprising 20% fat and 30% fructose, with or without intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg/day SRPO for 4 weeks. The body weight, visceral fat weight, and serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in the mice increased significantly with the HFFD, but these effects were prevented by chronic injections of SRPO. Intravital microscopy of the femoral artery detected significant leukocyte-endothelial interactions after treatment with HFFD, but these leukocyte-endothelial interactions were reduced in the mice injected with SRPO. In the in vitro experiment, pre-incubation of activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) induced THP-1 cell adhesion under physiological flow conditions, but the adhesion was reduced by pretreatment of PRP with SRPO. A fluorescent immunobinding assay showed that PRP induced significant upregulation of E-selectin in HUVECs, but this upregulation was reduced by pretreatment of PRP with SRPO. In other in vitro conditions, pre-incubation of THP-1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to activated HUVECs under rotational conditions, but this adhesion was reduced by pretreatment with SRPO. Western blotting analysis showed that protein kinase C α activation in THP-1 cells was inhibited by SRPO. Conclusion Our findings indicated that SRPO inhibits vascular inflammation in obesity via inactivation of platelets and leukocytes, and improvement of obese."

Design An explorative intervention study including an intra-individual comparison of 20 patients with severely reduced dentitions in terms of nutrition- and quality of life-related parameters recorded at baseline and at six and twelve months after implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. Participants Twenty patients from the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry of Justus-Liebig University of Giessen, with an mean age of 63 years, who had fewer than ten pairs of antagonists. Measurements The baseline data collection included dental status, a chewing ability test, laboratory parameters, anthropometric data (body mass index), energy supply, a 3-day dietary record, an analysis of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) with the OHIP-G14, the Mini-Mental Status (MMS) and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Six months after implantation and prosthetic rehabilitation, individual nutritional counseling was performed by a dietician. Data were again collected and analyzed. A final follow-up was conducted 12 months after prosthetic rehabilitation. Results Despite the highly significant improvement in masticatory ability and OHRQoL after implant-prosthetic rehabilitation, no significant changes were observed regarding MNA, anthropometric data or energy supply. Except for cholinesterase (p = 0.012), ferritin (p = 0.003), folic acid (p = 0.019) and vitamin A (p = 0.004), no laboratory parameter changed significantly during the investigation period. In addition, no general significant differences were observed for nutrient intake or food choice. Conclusion The present study does not confirm the assumption that the implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with severely reduced residual dentitions with or without an individual nutritional counseling influences nutritional status."

This clam possesses three hemoglobins: hemoglobin I (HbI), a sulfide-reactive protein, and hemoglobin II (HbII) and III (HbIII), which are oxygen-reactive. We characterized the complete gene sequence and promoter regions for the oxygen reactive hemoglobins and the partial structure and promoters of the HbI gene from Lucina pectinata. We show that HbI has two mRNA variants, where the 5’end had either a sequence of 96 bp (long variant) or 37 bp (short variant). The gene structure of the oxygen reactive Hbs is defined by having 4-exons/3-introns with conservation of intron location at B12.2 and G7.0 and the presence of pre-coding introns, while the partial gene structure of HbI has the same intron conservation but appears to have a 5-exon/ 4-intron structure. A search for putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) was done with the promoters for HbII, HbIII, HbI short and HbI long. The HbII, HbIII and HbI long promoters showed similar predicted TFBSs. We also characterized MITE-like elements in the HbI and HbII gene promoters and intronic regions that are similar to sequences found in other mollusk genomes. The gene expression levels of the clam Hbs, from sulfide-rich and sulfide-poor environments showed a significant decrease of expression in the symbiont-containing tissue for those clams in a sulfide-poor environment, suggesting that the sulfide concentration may be involved in the regulation of these proteins. Gene expression evaluation of the two HbI mRNA variants indicated that the longer variant is expressed at higher levels than the shorter variant in both environments."

https://openalex.org/W2416799520,"Individual acts of cooperation give rise to dynamic social networks. Traditionally, models for cooperation in structured populations are based on a separation of individual strategies and of population structure. Individuals adopt a strategy-typically cooperation or defection, which determines their behaviour toward their neighbours as defined by an interaction network. Here, we report a behavioural experiment that amalgamates strategies and structure to empirically investigate the dynamics of social networks. The action of paying a cost c to provide a benefit b is represented as a directed link point from the donor to the recipient. Participants can add and/or remove links to up to two recipients in each round. First, we show that dense networks emerge, where individuals are characterized by fairness: they receive to the same extent they provide. More specifically, we investigate how participants use information about the generosity and payoff of others to update their links. It turns out that aversion to payoff inequity was the most consistent update rule: adding links to individuals that are worse off and removing links to individuals that are better off. We then investigate the effect of direct reciprocation, showing that the possibility of direct reciprocation does not increase cooperation as compared to the treatment where participants are totally unaware of who is providing benefits to them."

The results indicated that TCAA precursors (no MW limits), DCAA and CHCl3 precursors in low MW fractions (MW<30 kDa) had a relatively good relations with SUVA values. These DBP precursors were coagulated more easily by in situ Al13 of AlCl3 at pH 5.0.

Yet my flight from Sweden, where I was an assistant professor at Umea University, was one of the few not grounded. Then, when I arrived at ERC headquarters and entered the hot, airless meeting room to present my proposed work, the chairperson told me, “You have 10 minutes—sharp.” I finished in 9 minutes and 59 seconds. “This must be a good sign,” I told myself.

> “The hydra returned at unpleasantly regular intervals.” 

I turned out to be right. In the middle of the summer holidays, I learned that I received the grant! But the contract negotiations had to start immediately. With 19 different documents amounting to more than 150 pages to read or fill out, the contract process seemed like a many-headed bureaucratic hydra. I had to convert the text and budget of my application into a legal document, but my knowledge of legalese was limited, so I enlisted help from administrators and lawyers at my university. Eight weeks later, my team at Umea and ERC officers in Brussels had exchanged many emails and documents, 15 people had been mobilized, and I had sacrificed a large part of my vacation, but the contract was signed.

A couple of months later, I realized that I needed to temporarily hire an outside person to bring in some specific expertise. The ERC officer said I would have to amend the painstakingly negotiated contract and asked me, “Do you really need to do this?” Any sensible person would have realized that such a statement meant problems, but I somehow missed the not-so-subtle message. After once again going through the lengthy contract process, I had an amended contract.

A year later the hydra returned, hidden in a discreet email entitled “Advanced Notice Letter,” alerting me to the fast-approaching deadline for my first financial report. A failure to have the report approved would prevent me from receiving further funding, but meeting all the requirements laid out in the 36-page user guide seemed almost impossibly complicated. Again, a fierce communication between Umea and Brussels began. Through a strategy that amounted to trial and error, and with the help of supportive ERC officials, the report was approved, and I could turn my attention back to research.

The hydra returned at unpleasantly regular intervals, demanding its share of sacrifice. I have now finished the ERC project and completed four financial reports and two scientific reports. In addition, three different external auditing firms have scrutinized the project because auditing is required once a certain budget threshold is reached.

My ERC adventure helped me build up my research group and produce good science, and it has meant an enormous amount to me. But fighting the hydra has taken its toll. Certainly large grants require some control measures, but I don't think that cutting the number of reports and audits by half would have been irresponsible—and it would have allowed me to spend more of my time on the research the grant was meant to fund. But on the positive side, the experience helped me become more patient and stress resistant, and I now know that I have many helpful colleagues who can support me.

So what advice can I offer for others facing the hydra? First, before even applying for a grant, carefully plan how you'd like to spend the money to avoid time-consuming amendments. Second, the administrators helping you with the process are probably much more experienced in dealing with these situations than you are, so listen to their advice. Third, don't despair. Even if the requirements are complicated and lengthy, you will get through them—with the assistance of those more expert than you. Then you can return to the real reason you became a scientist and get back to the research.
