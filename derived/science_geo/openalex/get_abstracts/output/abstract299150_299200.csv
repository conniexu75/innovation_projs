https://openalex.org/W2070437415,"Carminic acid, the well-known red dyestuff from cochineal insects (Dactylopius spp.), is a potent feeding deterrent to ants. This deterrency may be indicative of the natural function of the compound, which may have evolved in cochineals as a chemical weapon against predation. The behavior of an unusual predator is described-the carnivorous caterpillar of a pyralid moth (Laetilia coccidivora)-which is undeterred by carminic acid and feeds on cochineals. The animal has the remarkable habit of utilizing the ingested carminic acid for defensive purposes of its own."
https://openalex.org/W1978641294,"The acidity of rainfall in Florida has increased markedly in the past 25 years, and the average sulfate and nitrate concentrations have increased by factors of 1.6 and 4.5, respectively, over the period. Annual average pH values below 4.7 now occur over the northern three quarters of the state. Summer rainfall has average pH values 0.2 to 0.3 unit lower than winter rainfall, and sulfate concentrations at most sites are higher in summer. The annual deposition of H(+) (about 300 to 500 equivalents per hectare) in northern Florida is a third to a half of the deposition in the heavily impacted northeastern United States; comparable figures for excess sulfate (derived from sulfur dioxide) are 7 to 11 kilograms of sulfur per hectare or 50 to 90 percent of the sulfate deposition rates at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire."
https://openalex.org/W2042629219,"The effect of the angle of incidence on the radiative heat load was determined for light and dark plumage. As the angle of incidence to the solar radiation source increases the difference in heat transfer between light and dark plumage disappears. Thus, by postural adjustment, a dark bird may become thermally white with regard to the radiative heat load."

https://openalex.org/W1986244433,"Nickel carbonyl [Ni(CO)(4)] is a toxic gas used in the manufacture of metallic nickel which has been shown to be carcinogenic and teratogenic in laboratory studies. Its decomposition in air proceeds at a rate that is strongly dependent on the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO). In the absence of CO, the lifetime in air at 296 degrees K and at atmospheric pressure is 60 +/- 5 seconds. A mechanism consisting of equilibrium unimolecular decomposition to Ni(CO)(3) and CO, followed by reaction of the Ni(CO)(3) with molecular oxygen, is consistent with the observations."
