https://openalex.org/W2020559241,"By analyzing the hearts of quail-chick chimeras, it was found that neural crest cells at the level of occipital somites 1 to 3 migrate to the region of the aorticopulmonary septum. Bilateral removal of this neural crest population prior to migration causes malformation of the aorticopulmonary septum resulting in common arterial outflow channels or transposition of the great vessels."

The greatest rate of loss of 5-methylcytosine residues was observed in mouse cells, which survived the least number of divisions. Immortal mouse cell lines had more stable rates of methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1595570412,"A series of synthetic oligosaccharides, resembling natural N-acetyllactosamine type glycans, were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of labeled ligand to the mammalian hepatic lectin on rabbit hepatocytes at 2 degrees C. A dramatic hierarchy of inhibitory potency (tetraantennary greater than triantennary much greater than biantennary much greater than monoantennary) could be demonstrated. The range of concentration required for 50% inhibition of labeled ligand binding extended from approximately 1 mM, for the monoantennary oligosaccharides, to approximately 1 nM for triantennary oligosaccharides, even though the absolute Gal concentration increased only 3-fold. It was found that the number of Gal residues/cluster and their branching mode are major determinants of binding affinity of ligands to the hepatic lectin on the surface of hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1968602579,Deoxyglucose labeled with carbon-14 was used in studying the utilization of glucose in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of fetal rats. The results showed that an entrainable circadian clock is present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei during fetal development and that the maternal circadian system coordinates the phase of the fetal clock to environmental lighting conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1996133944,"Developing axons of the corpus callosum of mice are guided across the cerebral midline by a slinglike glial structure that forms transiently between the hemispheres. If the ""sling"" is cut at precallosal stages, the would-be callosal fibers whirl into paired neuromas adjacent to the longitudinal cerebral fissure. In experiments on such surgically acallosal animals, the aberrant commissural axons maintained a potential to regrow across the hemispheres at prenatal and early postnatal stages if they were presented with a properly aligned, glia-covered scaffold spanning the hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W1607032234,"In liver, kidney, and lung of the mouse, two of the major H1 subtypes present at 1 week after birth, H1a and H1b, decline to nearly undetectable levels by 8-16 weeks, and a third subtype, H1d, also diminishes. The amounts of two other H1 subtypes, H1e and H1 degrees, increase markedly and that of another, H1c, also increases. The disappearance of H1a is almost complete by the age of 4 weeks, whereas the decline in H1b occurs largely between 4 and 16 weeks, when most cells are nondividing. A decline in H1a was observed also in cultured mouse embryo fibroblasts after they became quiescent. Furthermore, in the quiescent fibroblasts, the synthesis of H1a and H1b was preferentially reduced. In the thymus, newly formed nondividing cells have as much H1a and H1b as the dividing cells from which they are derived, but circulating lymphocytes have less H1a and H1b and more H1e, indicating that molecules of H1a and H1b are removed from chromatin, and H1e deposited, after cell division ceases. H1 degrees, however, is not present in thymocytes or peripheral blood lymphocytes. Our results indicate that 1) there are no tissue-specific H1 subtypes among the somatic tissues examined; 2) H1a and H1b are synthesized in large amounts only in dividing cells, whereas H1c, H1d, and H1e are synthesized in both dividing and nondividing cells; 3) different H1 subtypes are degraded at different rates in nondividing cells; and 4) H1e always, and H1 degrees sometimes, accumulates in nondividing somatic cells. We conclude that alterations of the H1 composition of chromatin are a general feature of nondividing cell formation; that such alterations are made, in large part, after the nondividing cells are formed and are accomplished both by changes in the pattern of synthesis of the various H1 subtypes and by differential loss of subtypes; and that each H1 subtype differs from the others in some or all of the properties that we have examined, supporting the idea that the individual H1 subtypes differ from each other in some of their functions."
https://openalex.org/W1498308337,"It is well established that either exogenous or endogenous cholesterol is required for both cell growth and proliferation. This laboratory has recently discovered that, in baby hamster kidney-21 cells, independent of its role as a cholesterol precursor, mevalonic acid plays an essential role in S phase DNA replication. It was later shown that isopentenyl adenine, a known product of mevalonate in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, is 100 to 200 times more effective than mevalonate in restoring DNA replication in cells in which mevalonic acid synthesis is blocked with the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, compactin. The present study was designed to determine the relationship in the cell cycle between the known requirement for cholesterol and the newly discovered effect of mevalonic acid and isopentenyl adenine on S phase DNA synthesis. Employing cells arrested by serum depletion, it was shown that the cholesterol requirement is limited to the early and mid-G1 phases, whereas the isopentenyl effect is required at the late G1-S interphase of the cell cycle. The evidence supporting these conclusions involves: first, in serum-arrested cells blocked early in G1 by compactin, only the combination of cholesterol added in early G1 and either mevalonate or isopentenyl adenine in late G1 permitted progression through the G1 and S phase DNA synthesis. Neither isopentenyl adenine added early in G1 nor cholesterol in late G1 was capable of restoring DNA synthesis in this system. Second, in accord with the above formulation, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with the oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor, dl-4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, affected only the early G1 phase of the cell cycle, but had no late G1 effect on DNA replication."

Despite the apparent presence of limited proteolytic degradation of the protein derived from this method, the sequence analysis reveals two primary peptide sequences and suggests that active PDGF is composed of two, possibly homologous, peptides linked by a disulfide bond or bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1568015334,"The glucocorticoid receptor in GH1 cells cultured without glucocorticoids and harvested in hypotonic buffer is primarily a cytosolic protein with a sedimentation coefficient of 10 S in low salt gradients. In gradients containing 0.4 M KCl, the receptor sediments at 3.5 S. Following incubation of cells for various times in culture medium containing dense amino acids, discrete peaks of newly synthesized dense receptor and normal density 3.5 S receptor are resolved in salt-containing gradients. The half-life of the 3.5 S receptor is 9.5 h. In contrast, the 10 S receptor gradually becomes more dense as the time of incubation of cells with dense medium increases and discrete normal and dense receptor peaks are not resolved in sucrose gradients. These results suggest that the 10 S receptor is an oligomer and is in a rapidly exchanging equilibrium in intact cells at 37 degrees C with its 3.5 S hormone-binding subunit. When GH1 cells are incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C with various concentrations of [3H]9 alpha-fluoro-11 beta, 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 16,17-acetonide ([3H]triamcinolone acetonide), receptor is found both in the cytosol and the nucleus. Sedimentation of the cytosol in low salt gradients reveals that a 4 S receptor form is present along with 10 S receptor. As the concentration of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide is increased, the amounts of both 4 S cytosolic receptor and nuclear receptor increase and the amount of 10 S cytosolic receptor decreases. Following removal of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide from cells, the amounts of both 4 S cytosolic receptor and nuclear receptor decrease and the amount of 10 S cytosolic receptor increases. Density labeling indicates that this increase in 10 S receptor is not due to new receptor synthesis. The 4 S receptor form, but not the 10 S form, binds to purified DNA. Resedimentation studies suggest that the 4 S receptor found in low salt gradients is identical with or derived from the 3.5 S form found in salt-containing gradients. A model for hormone-mediated receptor translocation to the nucleus is proposed in which binding of hormone shifts the equilibrium between the oligomeric 10 S receptor and its 4 S subunit toward the 4 S form. The 4 S form is in equilibrium with 4 S receptor bound to chromatin. The model provides a molecular explanation for many experimental findings concerning glucocorticoid and other steroid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2160550943,"The nucleotide sequence of the T24 human bladder carcinoma oncogene was determined, and the coding and noncoding sequences of the genome were identified. The amino acid sequence of p21, the translational product of the T24 oncogene, was predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the oncogene. Comparison of this sequence with that of the normal cellular homolog showed that a single point mutation in the coding sequences of the T24 oncogene resulted in the acquisition of transforming properties. Other differences between the T24 oncogene and its normal cellular homolog were found in the 5′ noncoding and 3′ noncoding sequences, but these differences appear to be due to polymorphism and do not play a significant role in the transformation process."
https://openalex.org/W1532410496,"Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has been employed to analyze the changes in membrane order parameter in Sarcoma 180 cells under conditions in which an alteration in cellular susceptibility to the chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin is demonstrable. Changes in relative membrane fluidity using the paramagnetic probe 5-doxyl stearic acid were found to be associated with two phenomena which result in an altered cellular response to adriamycin: (a) the presence of an oxygen-deficient environment and (b) the expression of drug resistance. Under hypoxic conditions, in which the susceptibility to the cytotoxic action of adriamycin is increased, a decrease in bulk membrane order parameter was observed. Upon reoxygenation, the membrane fluidity and enhanced susceptibility to adriamycin reverted to control conditions with the same time course. In the case of drug-resistant cells, a progressive decrease in membrane fluidity was also observed which correlated with the degree of resistance to adriamycin. These data suggest that the physical alterations in the membrane reported by the spin label may be functionally linked to biological alterations in sensitivity to adriamycin."
https://openalex.org/W1589050186,"Exposure of human fibroblasts to 5 J/m2 of UV light resulted in a rapid increase of up to 1500% in the intracellular content of poly(ADP-ribose) and a rapid depletion of its metabolic precursor, NAD. When added just prior to UV treatment, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, totally blocked both the increase of poly(ADP-ribose) and decrease in NAD for up to 2.5 h. Addition of 3-aminobenzamide at the time of maximal accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) resulted in a decrease to basal levels with a half-life of approximately 6 min. The rates of accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) and depletion of NAD were increased in the presence of either 1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine or hydroxyurea. Since these agents are known to cause an additional accumulation of DNA strand breaks following UV irradiation, these data provide evidence for a mechanism in which the rate of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis following DNA damage is regulated in intact cells by the number of DNA strand breaks. Under conditions in which the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) was blocked, DNA repair replication induced by UV light was neither stimulated nor inhibited."

Anemia developed 4 to 5 days after the initiation of oil ingestion and was accompanied by Heinz-body formation and a strong regenerative response. The data evince a toxic effect on circulating red blood cells involving an oxidative biochemical mechanism and the first clear evidence of a primary mechanism of toxicity from the ingestion of crude oil by birds.

For one such species, testosterone or dihydrotestosterone induces females and immature males to produce the mature male electric organ discharge which is two times the duration of the female or immature discharge. Estradiol has only a weak effect. For a second species where males and females have similar electric organ discharges, testosterone produces no effect. The data suggest that androgens affect the electric organ itself."
https://openalex.org/W1487346902,"The ability of HeLa DNA polymerases to carry out DNA synthesis from incisions made by various endodeoxyribonucleases which recognize or form baseless sites in DNA was examined. DNA polymerase beta carried out limited strand displacement synthesis from 3'-hydroxyl nucleotide termini made by HeLa apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease II at the 5'-side of apurinic sites. Escherichia coli endonuclease III incises at the 3'-side of apurinic sites to produce nicks with 3'-deoxyribose termini which did not efficiently support DNA synthesis with beta-polymerase. However, these nicks could be activated to support limited DNA synthesis by HeLa AP endonuclease II, an enzyme which removes the baseless sugar phosphate from the 3'-termini, thus creating a one-nucleotide gap. With dGTP as the only nucleoside triphosphate present, the beta-polymerase catalyzed one-nucleotide DNA repair synthesis from those gaps which lacked dGMP. In contrast, HeLa DNA polymerase alpha was unreactive with all of the above incised DNA substrates. Larger patches of DNA synthesis were produced by nick translation from one-nucleotide gaps with HeLa DNA polymerase beta and HeLa DNase V. Moreover, incisions made by E. coli endonuclease III were activated to support DNA synthesis by the DNase V which removed the 3'-deoxyribose termini. HeLa DNase V also stimulated both the rate and extent of DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase beta from AP endonuclease II incisions. In this case the baseless sugar phosphate was removed from the 5'-termini, and nick translational synthesis occurred. Complete DNA excision repair of pyrimidine dimers was achieved with the beta-polymerase, DNase V, and DNA ligase from incisions made in UV-irradiated DNA by T4 UV endonuclease and HeLa AP endonuclease II. Such incisions produce a one-nucleotide gap containing 3'-hydroxyl nucleotide and 5'-thymine: thymidylate cyclobutane dimer termini. DNase V removes pyrimidine dimers primarily as a dinucleotide and then promotes nick translational DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1524316280,"Extracts of bovine anterior pituitary glands contain significant amounts of material with immunological properties similar to those of the common, alpha, subunit isolated from the pituitary glycoprotein hormones. Purification of this material and analysis show it to contain an additional site of glycosylation not present in the alpha subunit isolated from intact glycoprotein hormones. This additional oligosaccharide is O-linked to a threonine residue corresponding to threonine-43 of bovine lutropin-alpha. Carbohydrate analysis shows 1.7 mol of sialic acid, 0.8 mol of galactose and 0.9 mol of galactosamine/mol of oligosaccharide. A similar structure for the free alpha-like material as compared to bovine lutropin-alpha is evident from equal potency in an anti-lutropin-alpha radioimmunoassay, a similar amino acid composition and similar but not identical peptide maps. The free alpha-like material is distinct from lutropin-alpha in that the free alpha-material contains sialic acid and galactose, has a slightly higher apparent molecular weight, an increased negative charge, and will not reassociate with native lutropin-beta. Peptide maps of the tryptic peptides of the free alpha-like material show additional differences (other than the O-linked oligosaccharide) when compared to peptide maps of lutropin-alpha; thus additional modifications are probably present."
https://openalex.org/W1543020414,"We describe here an activable neutral cholesteryl esterase (EC 3.1.1.13) in arteries similar to the hormone-sensitive lipase of adipose tissue and adrenal cortex. Maximum enzyme activity in rabbit aorta was given by cholesteryl ester substrates dispersed as a mixed micelle with phosphatidylcholine and Na taurocholate (molar ratio 1:4:2). A quantitative assay of enzymic activity was obtained with the following component concentrations: 6.0 microM cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate, 23.7 microM phosphatidylcholine, 12.5 microM Na taurocholate, 0.04% serum albumin, and 85 mM K phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The enzymic activity in aortic homogenates was stimulated 2-fold by addition of 5 microM glucagon or 100 microM dibutyryl cAMP. This activation was Mg-ATP dependent. Addition of 50 micrograms/ml of exogenous protein kinase could reverse the action of protein kinase inhibitor on dibutyryl cAMP activation of the neutral cholesteryl esterase. In addition to activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the enzyme could be distinguished from the more active arterial lysosomal cholesteryl esterase by its pH 7.0 optimum, relative stability to preincubation at elevated temperatures, and exclusive localization in the cell cytosol. Subcellular fractionation of lipid-laden arterial foam cells revealed a significant portion of the neutral cholesteryl esterase bound to cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester-rich lipid droplets. Our results suggest that the breakdown of cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester droplets in arterial cells may be under hormonal regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2013476012,"Increases in penile circumference during sleep-related erections in human subjects closely reflected increases in penile blood flow, and bursts of activity in the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles were temporally related to these increases. The penile arterial system and the perineal muscles appear to have important coordinated roles in human penile erection. Monitoring sleep-related erections and penile blood flow holds promise for the study of erectile mechanisms and dysfunction and for screening of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1563898993,"Detailed studies of the effects of the ionophore monensin upon the glycosylation of secreted fibronectin have been carried out. Human fibroblasts in culture were incubated in 1 microM monensin for several hours, following which radiolabeled glucosamine or mannose was added to the cultures. Parallel incubation and labeling of control cultures were done. Labeled fibronectin was isolated from the culture media by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography, from cell surfaces by urea extraction, and from intracellular locations by cell lysis followed by immunoprecipitation. Detailed comparison of the glycopeptides released from fibronectin by pronase and of the oligosaccharides liberated by hydrazinolysis was carried out, particularly focusing on the secreted fibronectin, using gel filtration, high performance liquid chromatography, and concanavalin A chromatography, in conjunction with the use of endoglycosidase H and specific exoglycosidases. We demonstrate that fibronectin in the medium of monensin-treated cultures differs in its glycosylation pattern from the control fibronectin. High mannose oligosaccharides are abundant in the monensin-derived fibronectin, whereas the control protein contains primarily complex oligosaccharides. Monensin apparently does not alter the initial glycosylation of fibronectin since the high mannose oligosaccharides are present on both control and monensin-treated intracellular fibronectin. We suggest, therefore, that monensin, by impairing intracellular translocation through the Golgi region, allows incompletely processed forms of fibronectin to reach the cell surface and to be released into the culture medium."

https://openalex.org/W1481051677,"The hematoside of rat intestine is analyzed from 1 day to 60 days of age. During the first 3 weeks of life, GM3 (N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide) contains only nonhydroxylated fatty acids and accounts for 80-90% of the ganglioside sialic acid. Its concentration is maximum at 6 days (315 micrograms of NeuAc/g of intestine) and falls abruptly over the next 2 weeks. It reaches 45 micrograms of NeuAc/g of intestine at 60 days. Between 28 and 60 days, GM3 accounts for 72% of the total intestinal gangliosides. From 21 days on, structural modifications of GM3 are observed. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is replaced progressively by N-glycolylneuraminic acid and nonhydroxylated fatty acids are replaced by alpha-hydroxylated fatty acids. Both changes are interpreted as the result of hydroxylations of GM3 components which are triggered at the time of weaning. These hydroxylations take place chiefly in epithelial cells and to a much lesser extent in nonepithelial residue, as shown by the separate analysis of both compartments of rat intestine at 38 and 60 days. In epithelial cells, the highest percentage of alpha-hydroxylated fatty acids and of N-glycolylneuraminic acid is found at 60 days. In addition, 4 D-hydroxysphinganine is the major base of the GM3 of intestinal cells from birth to adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W1527542977,"The complete amino acid sequence of the 7Fe ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av Fd) was determined by repetitive Edman degradation of the whole protein and of peptides derived from CNBr cleavage or chymotrypsin digestion. The sequence was confirmed by the 2A electron density maps for the residues calculated with difference Fourier coefficients. The density maps for all residues are included in the paper. Av Fd has several important differences with the clostridial-type ferredoxins: (i) Av Fd is 106 residues (versus 55-60 for other bacterial ferredoxins); (ii) Av Fd has 9 cysteines, one of which (residue 24) is not homologous with the bacterial ferredoxins; (iii) Av Fd has 2 extra residues between 2 cysteines (residues 11 and 16) homologous to cysteines in the bacterial ferredoxins; and (iv) Av Fd has the unique sequence -Cys-Val-Glu-Val-Cys- (residues 16-20) which are two of the ligands of the 3Fe:3S center. These sequence features are compared to the sequences of various ferredoxin groups. Structure predictions for other suspected 7Fe ferredoxins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1591864047,"The coagulation protein Factor Va forms the receptor for the serine protease Factor Xa at the platelet surface. This membrane-bound complex of Factor Va and Factor Xa plus calcium constitutes the enzymatic complex prothrombinase, which effects the conversion of prothrombin to the clotting enzyme, thrombin. Studies were undertaken to investigate the proteolytic events accompanying the inactivation of platelet-bound Factor Va by activated protein C as well as the ability of Factor Xa to protect Factor Va from activated protein C inactivation. During the course of these studies, observations were made which indicated that Factor Va was also cleaved by both a platelet-associated protease, as well as Factor Xa. When Factor Va was incubated with washed platelets, electrophoresis and autoradiography of solubilized platelet pellets indicated that three Factor Va peptides were associated with the platelet: component D (Mr = 94,000), component E (Mr = 74,000), and a 90,000-dalton peptide (component D') which appeared with time as the result of a platelet-associated protease cleavage of component D. The Factor Va peptides bound to platelets were proteolytically inactivated by activated protein C, resulting in five peptide products, all of which remained associated with the platelet-membrane surface. Factor Va was protected from activated protein C proteolysis by complex formation with Factor Xa or active site-blocked Factor Xa. However, active Factor Xa cleaved platelet-bound Factor Va to peptide products which also remained associated with the platelet. Whereas activated protein C rapidly cleaved components D and D' with secondary cleavages occurring in component E, Factor Xa rapidly cleaved component E with secondary cleavages occurring in components D and D'. The Factor Xa-cleaved Factor Va is catalytically functional. To determine whether cleavage was necessary for function, prothrombin conversion reaction mixtures were monitored for thrombin formation and Factor Va cleavage with time in a defined phospholipid vesicle model system. The results indicated that Factor Xa cleavage of Factor Va is not essential for Factor Va activity but may promote its ability to function in the prothrombinase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1502744155,"Villin, a Ca2+-modulated F-actin-binding protein (95,000 daltons) present in microvillus core filament bundles, has been shown to contain multiple Ca2+-binding sites. 45Ca Hummel-Dreyer chromatography reveals the presence of two rapidly exchanging Ca2+-binding sites with an apparent dissociation constant, Kd, equal to 4.6 X 10(-6) M. Use of the two proteolytically separable domains of the molecule revealed that one site is located on the 90,000-dalton core (apparent Kd = 3.5 X 10(-6) M) while the second site is provided by the 8,800-dalton headpiece fragment (apparent Kd = 7.4 X 10(-6) M). In addition villin displays a further very slowly exchanging or nonexchangeable high affinity Ca2+-binding site, which is situated in the core domain. Secondary structural predictions and a comparison of the amino acid sequence of headpiece with other known Ca2+-binding proteins indicates one region suggestive of a Ca2+-binding site, although headpiece seems not to exhibit a classical EF-hand Ca2+-binding structure."

The final specific activity was approximately 24,400 nmol/min/mg of protein. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme determined by gel filtration analyses on Sephacryl S-200 was 55,000 in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl and 145,000 in its absence. The minimum molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 54,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

https://openalex.org/W1525311362,"Effects of intermolecular DNA interactions on the motional dynamics of defined length (147-, 234-, and 437-nucleotide pair (np)) double-stranded DNA were examined by 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At a critical high concentration varying inversely with length, DNA undergoes a spontaneous transition to an ordered, liquid crystalline-like state. Ordering is accompanied by the appearance of distinct opalescence, and an increase in solution viscosity. An apparent standard heat of fusion of -38 kcal/mol of helix (-0.13 kcal/mol of DNA phosphate) and an entropy change of -0.13 entropy units (per mol of helix) were determined from the temperature dependence of the phase transition of 147-np DNA. The average phosphodiester configuration, monitored by Raman spectroscopy, was typical of B-form DNA above and below the phase transition. NMR spectra and relaxation data show that intermolecular interactions are strong at concentrations well below the phase transition and cause stepwise uncoupling of internal motions at specific sites. Motions of the exocyclic C5' carbon, but not other sugar carbons, are frozen in approximately 50% of 147-np DNA molecules at concentrations as low as 6.5 mg/ml. Motions of backbone ring carbons (C3', C4') are frozen in a progressively larger fraction of molecules at concentrations above 46 mg/ml. Rapid C2' motions are unaffected below the critical concentration (193 mg/ml at 32 degrees C), and still occur in the ordered phase. We conclude that rapid internal motions of DNA monitored by NMR consist mostly of coupled, periodic bending deformations and partially uncoupled local motions within the sugar ring. Rapid, extensive C2' motions can occur without strong coupling to other sugar carbon motions. From a comparison of 13C and 31P NMR data, we conclude that 31P NMR at best yields an incomplete representation of DNA dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1520070573,"Thymidylate synthase-negative mutants of mouse FM3A cells were transformed to thymidine prototrophs by human DNA. The stable transformants had only human thymidylate synthase and segments of human DNA. They grew normally but had unusually high levels of the human enzyme. In two transformants examined, however, neither was the dTTP pool elevated nor the dCTP pool decreased. DNA synthesis in permeabilized cells of a transformant was more efficient than that in the wild type with dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dUMP as substrates, but this was not so when dUMP was replaced by dTTP. Unlike the mouse enzyme, the human enzyme in the transformants did not co-sediment with DNA polymerase alpha and thymidine kinase in a sucrose gradient, suggesting that the human enzyme is not incorporated into a multienzyme complex for DNA replication. The high levels of the human enzyme in the transformants were suppressed to various degrees by fusion with a wild type mouse line. No active hybrid dimer enzyme was found between the human and mouse enzymes, which each consist of two identical subunits. Thus, the human enzyme in the transformants seems to behave differently from the mouse enzyme and its overproduction seems to be necessary for supporting the normal growth of the transformants."

https://openalex.org/W1630183483,"D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate apodehydrogenase is a lipid-requiring enzyme with a specific requirement of lecithin for enzymatic function. The purified enzyme which is devoid of lipid can be reactivated with lecithin or mixtures of natural phospholipid-containing lecithin. However, it is mitochondrial phospholipid which activates the enzyme optimally and with kinetic parameters similar to that of the native membrane-bound enzyme. Mitochondrial phospholipid consists of three classes of phospholipid (lecithin:phosphatidylethanolamine:diphosphatidylglycerol in a ratio of approximately 2:2:1 by phosphorus); each class consists of a multiplicity of different molecular species due to diversity in the fatty acyl substituents. In this study, we have synthesized defined molecular species of mixed fatty acyl phospholipids to evaluate whether multiplicity of phospholipid molecular species are essential for optimal reactivation. We find that: 1) ternary mixtures of single molecular species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylpropan-1,3-diol in the liquid crystalline state mimic the optimal reactivation of the enzyme obtained with mitochondrial phospholipids; 2) although some negatively charged phospholipid appears necessary for optimizing the efficiency of activation, diphosphatidylglycerol can be replaced by phosphatidylpropan-1,3-diol, another negatively charged phospholipid; and 3) biphasic Arrhenius plots can be correlated with the liquid crystalline and gel states of the phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1681264417,"The structure of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase has been partially refined by crystallographic least squares methods. Using phases based on the refined coordinates, analysis of the resultant electron density maps has led to a new model of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase and a tentative x-ray sequence. The two crystallographically independent subunits comprising the dimeric enzyme are nearly identical in structure and are related to each other by roughly 2-fold rotational symmetry. The best fit of the molecular structure of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase to that of lactate dehydrogenase has been obtained by least squares methods. The active sites of these two enzymes contain similarly oriented His-Asp pairs linked by a hydrogen bond which may function as a proton relay system during catalysis. This pair could also provide an explanation for the relatively stronger binding by cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase of NADH versus NAD. Similar His-Asp pairs have been observed in the serine proteases, thermolysin, and phospholipase A2, and the His-Asp pair may play a similar functional role in all of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1571259910,"Five major metabolites (peaks I-V) of 25-hydroxy-24-oxovitamin D3 (25(OH)24-oxo-D3) have been isolated in pure form from in vitro incubates containing kidney homogenates of vitamin D-deficient chicks and chicks given 65 nmol of vitamin D3; peaks II, III, and V are from vitamin D-deficient chicks and peaks I, II, and IV are from vitamin D-supplemented birds. The structures of the metabolites were unequivocally identified as 23,25-dihydroxy-24-oxo-vitamin D3 (peak I), 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) (peak II), 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxy-24-oxovitamin D3 (peak III), 23,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 (peak IV), and 1 alpha,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 (peak V) by means of ultraviolet absorption spectrometry, mass spectrometry, and specific chemical reactions. It is concluded that 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 is further hydroxylated at the 1 alpha-position in the kidney of vitamin D-deficient chicks and at the 23-position in that of vitamin D-supplemented animals. Formation of 24,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 in both vitamin D-deficient and -supplemented animals provides evidence for the presence of an enzyme to reduce the 24-oxo group irrespective of the vitamin D status."
https://openalex.org/W1522677563,"The antitumor protein macromomycin is a single chain polypeptide of 112 amino acid residues cross-linked by two intramolecular disulfide bonds. The protein was reduced and S-alkylated with 2-mercaptoethanol in 8 M urea followed by treatment with iodoacetic acid. Tryptic digestion of tetra-S-carboxymethyl macromomycin gave four tryptic peptides which were fractionated by gel permeation on Sephadex G-50. The amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptides and the overlap sequences were determined by a combination of automated Edman degradation analysis, gas chromatographic mass spectrometry, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. A comparison of the structures of macromomycin, actinoxanthin, and neocarzinostatin suggests that they belong to a family of related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2155181132,"The physical structure of villin, a Ca2+-modulated regulator protein of actin filament organization, has been studied in the absence and presence of Ca2+ using analytical ultracentrifugation, gel chromatography, ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. Villin exhibits an intrinsic sedimentation coefficient, S020, w, of 5.0 s and an apparent Stokes radius, Rs, of 44 A in EGTA-containing buffer. In the presence of greater than 20 microM Ca2+, villin shows a S020, w of 4.1 s and Rs of 49 A, indicative of a conformational change in the protein. No significant changes in the partial specific volume (0.73) of villin are observed in the presence of Ca2+, and sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrates that the effects of Ca2+ are not due to a change in the molecular mass (95,000 daltons). The combined hydrodynamic data suggest that villin is an asymmetric molecule with an axial ratio of 4.5:1, based on a prolate ellipsoid model at 0.5 g/g of hydration, corresponding to a maximum length of 84 A. The presence of Ca2+ changes the shape to a more asymmetric molecule with an axial ratio of 8:1 and a maximum length of 123 A. Since the large proteolytic fragment, villin core, does not exhibit the strong structural change of villin, an important function of the small villin headpiece domain in the observed conformational change of intact villin is suggested. The results indicate new aspects of the function of villin as cross-linker in microvillus core filament bundles and the disintegration of these structures in the presence of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1519417715,"It has been shown earlier that 3-deazaadenosine but not 3-deazaaristeromycin inhibits chemotaxis of RAW264 cells (Aksamit, R.R., Falk, W., and Cantoni, G.L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 621-625). We show here in RAW264 cells that (a) the incorporation of the methyl group of methionine into phosphatidylcholine is inhibited approximately 90% by both 3-deazaadenosine and 3-deazaaristeromycin, (b) 3-deazaadenosine but not 3-deazaaristeromycin inhibits the synthesis of specific proteins, and (c) 3'-deoxyadenosine and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine in the presence of adenosine and homocysteine inhibit chemotaxis and the synthesis of specific proteins. Inhibition of the synthesis of specific proteins can be observed only after the solubilized cellular proteins are separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, since the adenosine analogs do not significantly affect total protein synthesis. When total protein synthesis is inhibited by incubation of the cells with cycloheximide, puromycin, or actinomycin D, chemotaxis is correspondingly inhibited. The results suggest that the continuous synthesis of one or more cellular proteins is required for chemotaxis by RAW264 cells."

The magnitude of stimulation could be altered by environmental lighting conditions and by prior exposure to the agonist.

https://openalex.org/W1479787273,"The absolute orientation of the prosthetic heme group in the active site of a hemoprotein may influence its substrate selectivity and catalytic properties. The only method available until now to determine the chiral orientation of the heme in a hemoprotein has been high resolution x-ray crystallography. The orientation of the heme in cytochrome P-450, therefore, is unknown because a crystallographic structure is not available for any form of this enzyme. We report here that the absolute configurations of the N-ethylprotoporphyrin IX adducts formed from the prosthetic hemes of cytochrome P-450 and hemoglobin during catalytic turnover of appropriate substrates are identical. The prosthetic heme in the inactivated cytochrome P-450 enzyme, therefore, has exactly the same orientation, relative to the fifth iron ligand, as the heme in hemoglobin. The approach described here can be used to determine the prosthetic heme orientation in other hemoproteins, including other cytochrome P-450 isozymes, for which x-ray structures are not available."
https://openalex.org/W1519773322,"We have examined the fluorescent properties of histones H1, and of some peptides derived from them, from calf thymus and from the fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. The fluorescent emission spectrum of folded histone H1 from C. capitata at neutral pH is characterized by a maximum at 303 nm and a shoulder at 340 nm. The overall quantum yields of fluorescence do not increase upon folding, although the fluorescence of the single tyrosyl residue of calf H1 is enhanced when the protein folds. As expected, the excitation maximum of calf H1 is shifted to longer wavelengths when the protein folds and its position does not depend upon the wavelength at which the fluorescence is observed. However, Ceratitis H1 exhibits two excitation maxima. The first corresponds to emission at 303 nm and it is slightly redshifted upon protein folding, whereas the second, which corresponds to emission at 340 nm, is displaced from 280 nm in the denatured protein to approximately 285 nm in the folded histone. This suggests that the two tyrosyl residues of the insect histone behave as independent fluorophores. The shoulder at 340 nm does not appear at pH 2, even when the protein is folded. Titration to neutral pH values results in the appearance of the shoulder, the process being characterized by a pK'a approximately equal to 3.7. The fluorescence spectrum of insect histone has been resolved into the contributions of the individual tyrosyl residues and the results suggest that the emission at 340 nm originates in a tyrosinate that may be formed in the excited state by proton transfer to the carboxylate anion of a glutamyl residue. The results obtained from these experiments have also aided in resolving the near-UV circular dichroism spectrum of insect histone (Barbero, J.L., Franco, L., Montero, F., and Moran, F. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 4080-4087) into the individual contributions of the tyrosyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1481256749,"Steady state velocities for the rate of exchange of extracellular dithionite for intracellular sulfate through the red cell inorganic anion transport protein, known as band 3, were measured at increasing trans-sulfate concentrations at constant cis-sulfate concentration in order to directly discriminate between single and double displacement classes of mechanism. A 7-fold increase in trans-sulfate concentration resulted in intersecting Lineweaver-Burk plots under iso-osmotic conditions. This result argues against a double displacement or ping-pong mechanism. The specificity of the trans-anion effect for band 3 was illustrated by studying reversible 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate inhibition of anion exchange. The increase in trans-sulfate increased 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate affinity at the outer surface by about 4-fold under conditions where outside anion concentration was constant. A possible two-site ordered sequential mechanism for erythrocyte inorganic anion exchange is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2104183661,"We have previously presented evidence for the formation of 1-O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone-P from acyl dihydroxyacetone-P via the initial formation of an intermediate 1-O-acyl endiol of acyl dihydroxyacetone-P. This reaction involves a stereospecific exchange of the pro-R hydrogen of the acyl dihydroxyacetone-P moiety without change in configuration. The fatty acid is replaced by a long chain fatty alcohol which retains the oxygen of the primary carbinol. In the absence of fatty alcohol, water substitutes and the product is dihydroxyacetone-P which has also exchanged the pro-R hydrogen with a hydrogen from the medium. An absolute requirement of the proposed mechanism is that the loss of the fatty acid must proceed via an unusual cleavage of the dihydroxyacetone-P C-1 to oxygen bond instead of the usual cleavage at the fatty acid acyl to oxygen bond. In the present investigation, we have synthesized hexadecanoyl dihydroxyacetone-P containing oxygen-18 exclusively at the dihydroxyacetone-P C-1 oxygen. Using this substrate, we have shown that cleavage of hexadecanoyl dihydroxyacetone-P at the C-1 to oxygen bond is linked to O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone-P synthesis. Inhibition of O-alkyl lipid synthesis by means of magnesium or NADPH inhibited the unusual cleavage. At the same time, we have shown that there was hydrolysis of acyl dihydroxyacetone-P which proceeded by the usual mechanism and which was not related to synthesis of O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone-P."
https://openalex.org/W1580112569,"Cell-free protein-synthesizing extracts prepared from rabbit reticulocytes, wheat germ, or cultured baby hamster kidney cells efficiently translated frog virus 3 early mRNAs; in contrast, late mRNAs were translated poorly under similar conditions. However, the translational efficiency of the late viral mRNAs was markedly enhanced in cell-free extracts prepared from frog virus 3 (FV 3)-infected baby hamster kidney cells and in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte extracts by the addition of a 0.5 M KCl wash from FV 3-infected cell ribosomes; the 0.5 M KCl wash (initiation factors) from uninfected cells had no such effect. Total cytoplasmic RNA from infected cells was fractionated according to size on sucrose gradients and fractions containing different concentrations, and relative proportions of early and late mRNAs were translated in either native or initiation factor-supplemented extracts. Under these conditions, the translation efficiency of early mRNAs was unchanged, while the translation of late mRNAs increased 2-7-fold. Thus, the in vitro discriminatory activity of the 0.5 M wash was not dependent on the complexity of the mRNAs present in the translation mixture. We show also that in native extracts, under conditions of blocked polypeptide chain elongation, early mRNAs are initiated preferentially. However, late as well as early mRNAs are initiated equally well in reticulocyte extracts under similar experimental conditions when supplemented with crude initiation factors from infected cells. These data support the conclusion that the translational enhancement of FV 3 mRNAs in vitro is mediated by a virus-specified or virus-modified initiation factor(s) and likely represents a regulatory mechanism of protein synthesis operative in vivo (Willis, D. B., Goorha, R., Miles, M., and Granoff, A. (1977) J. Virol. 24, 326-342)."

After normal eye movements were monitored under controlled conditions, subjects spent 5 days wearing goggles that contained minification lenses and that curtailed vision to a 5 degree field. The amplitude and frequency of eye movements decreased when subjects were awake and increased during REM sleep; sleep stage durations and distributions were unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W1494649753,"Abstract 125I-choleragen bound to human fibroblasts was degraded slowly with a t1/2 of 2-3 days; the radiolabel in bound 125I-choleragen was present in both the A and B subunits. During degradation, radiolabel was lost more rapidly from the 125I-A1 (t1/2 approximately 2 days) than from the 125I-B peptides (t1/2 greater than 5 days). 125I-Choleragen bound to neuroblastoma cells showed a considerably shorter t1/2 for both the 125I-A1 and 125I-B peptides; as with the fibroblasts, radiolabel was lost more rapidly from the 125I-A1 than from the 125I-B peptides. The continued presence of choleragen in the fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells was associated with a prolonged activation of adenylate cyclase. In addition, fibroblasts, previously exposed to toxin and then washed free of unbound choleragen, only slowly recovered their ability to bind 125I-choleragen with a t1/2 of 7 days. Fibroblasts exposed to choleragen also showed evidence of persistent toxin on the surface based on the ability of the cells to bind antitoxin, antisubunit A or antisubunit B antibodies followed by 3H-protein A. It appears that choleragen remains persistently bound to fibroblasts, is degraded at a slow rate, and may prevent the binding of new toxin molecules to the fibroblast. The relatively slow degradation of toxin by fibroblasts may explain the prolonged activation of adenylate cyclase by toxin. The loss of 125I-toxin binding capacity following incubation with toxin may result from continued presence of toxin subunits on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1533414465,"The environment of the phosphate group of pyridoxal-P bound at the active site of cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase has been investigated by 31P NMR spectroscopy. In the holoenzyme, the pyridoxal-P chemical shift is pH-dependent with a pKa of 6.45. The chemical shift of the bound pyridoxal-P is shifted upfield about 0.3 ppm from the signal for free pyridoxal-P. Saturation of the active site with the substrates L-serine, glycine, and tetrahydrofolate does not alter the chemical shift or the pKa of the phosphate group. The addition of these substrates does, however, alter the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the bound coenzyme, reflecting environmental changes of the pyridine ring-Schiff's base system. We conclude from these studies that the phosphate group of the bound coenzyme is exposed to the solvent. The reorientation and conformational changes of the pyridoxal-P ring which take place during the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes do not appear to change the environment of the phosphate moiety of the coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483082345,"Tryptophan side chain oxidase from Pseudomonas catalyzes the pH-dependent dichotomous conversion of tryptophan residues to a,p-didehydro- and p-hydroxytryptophan. When tryptophan side chain oxidase I1 and N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide, a model substrate, were incubated at 25 “C in 10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, a 5-min lag was shown for the formation of N-acetyl-a,p-didehydrotryptophanamide, the main product under these conditions. The analysis of the reaction by high performance liquid chromatography showed that an entity distinct from the products accumulated extensively at the initial stage of the reaction and it decayed nonenzymatically with a half-life of 8 min to give the a,pdidehydro derivative. The formation of the #I-hydroxy derivative was favored when the pH was decreased in the latter stage. Nucleophiles such as methylmercaptan, methyl alcohol, pyrrole, cysteine, and glutathione trapped this intermediate to give the corresponding psubstituted derivatives such as N-acetyl-p-methylthioL-tryptophanamide. The unstable intermediate was extractable by methylene chloride, in which the intermediate survived for several days at -20 “C, but in an aqueous solution, it was readily converted to give a,pdidehydro and 8-hydroxy derivatives at ratios prescribed by a pK value of 5.8, or &substituted adducts in the presence of nucleophiles. The dichotomy of the reaction was thus attributed to the nonenzymatic reaction of the common intermediate which was identified by NMR spectrometry and gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry as 5-(3-indolyl)-2-methyl-2-oxazoline-4-carboxamide, a new biochemical entity."
https://openalex.org/W1533220800,"Thrombin-stimulated platelet secretion is accompanied by a 30% reduction in the steady state level of cytosolic ATP, a breakdown that proceeds through ADP, AMP, IMP, and inosine to hypoxanthine. The ATP to hypoxanthine conversion could be blocked at the stage of AMP deamination by incubation of platelet-rich plasma for 6 h with 200 microM coformycin, a transition-state analog inhibitor of AMP deaminase. Abolition of AMP deaminase activity had no effect on thrombin-induced secretion from the dense granules, alpha-granules, or acid hydrolases measured in gel-filtered platelets. Coformycin treatment had no effect on thrombin-stimulated lactate production, even when oxidative phosphorylation was blocked by antimycin A, nor on the rate of thrombin-stimulated glycogenolysis. In addition, although it was clear that the adenylate energy charge was maintained by activation of AMP deaminase following thrombin treatment, the adenylate energy charge was also maintained in coformycin-treated platelets, albeit after a short lag, by stimulated ATP production and equilibration through the adenylate kinase reaction. Hydrogen peroxide brings about similar adenylate degradation which could also be inhibited by coformycin. The results indicate that AMP deamination and secretion, although temporally related, are not coupled. The role of AMP deaminase appears to be to maintain the adenylate energy charge in the absence of stimulation of ATP production or to buffer the adenylate charge before ATP production is stimulated."
