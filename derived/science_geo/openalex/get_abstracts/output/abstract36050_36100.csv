https://openalex.org/W1989775015,"We have devised a sensitive means to assess the anti-tumor effect of cytokines that act via the mobilization of host-mediated defenses. This assay involves transfecting malignant cells to produce a specific cytokine (in this case, IL-4) and measuring the ability of transfectants to form tumors alone and when mixed with a variety of nontransfected tumor cells. In this way, we have identified a potent, non-cell autonomous, anti-tumor effect of IL-4 which is effective against a wide range of tumor cell types in vivo. The effect is reversed by anti-IL-4 antibody, correlates closely with levels of IL-4 production, and is evident in nu/nu mice. The anti-tumor effect seems to be mediated by an inflammatory infiltrate composed of eosinophils and macrophages."

Healthy volunteers were studied before, during, and after anticipation of a painful electric shock. During anticipatory anxiety, there were significant blood flow increases in bilateral temporal poles, the same regions recently implicated in a lactate-induced anxiety attack in patients with panic disorder. Thus, the temporal poles seem to be involved in normal and pathological forms of human anxiety."

https://openalex.org/W1511475277,"The effect of 40 h of wakefulness on a variety of immunological parameters in the peripheral blood from 10 normal male subjects was studied. Sleep deprivation led to enhanced nocturnal plasma interleukin 1-like and interleukin 2-like activities. The rise in nocturnal response of lymphocytes to pokeweed mitogen stimulation during a normal 24 h sleep-wake cycle was delayed by sleep deprivation, but the response to the phytohemagglutinin mitogen was unaffected. With resumed nocturnal sleep, there was a prolonged decline in natural killer cell activity (measured as spontaneous cytolytic activity for human tumor cells) and return of an increased response to pokeweed mitogen. The altered patterns in immune functions occurred independently of the cortisol circadian rhythm, which remained unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1566327690,"Chronic inflammatory diseases are often associated with decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass. The cytokines cachectin/tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL 1) are produced by monocytes/macrophages in response to many inflammatory stimuli and have been implicated in the anemia of chronic disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate the mechanisms by which cachectin/TNF, IL 1, or endotoxin induce anemia. Hematologic parameters and RBC kinetics were quantitated in rats given chronic sublethal quantities of either recombinant human cachectin/TNF, recombinant human IL 1α, or Salmonella endotoxin for 7 days. Cachectin/TNF or endotoxin treatment resulted in a 25 or 31% decrease, respectively, in total RBC mass, whereas RBC mass was unchanged by IL 1 administration. Anemia associated with either chronic cachectin or endotoxin administration was characterized by normal mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin content, and reticulocyte numbers. [59Fe]RBC survival was significantly shortened in animals given cachectin, IL 1 or endotoxin, but the magnitude of the response was greatest in cachcctin/TNF-or endotoxin-treated rats. Although cachectin/TNF-, IL 1-, or endotoxin treatment resulted in similar hypoferremia and shortened plasma iron half-life, endotoxin or cachectin/TNF treatment (but not IL 1) significantly reduced the incorporation of plasma 59Fe into newly synthesized RBCs. We conclude that chronic cachectin/TNF administration produces anemia by decreasing RBC synthesis and reducing the life span of circulating RBCs. An endogenous cachectin/TNF response during inflammatory disease may contribute to an associated anemic state, whereas the modestly reduced red cell life span induced by IL 1 does not lead to a net reduction in RBC mass, presumably owing to a preserved RBC synthetic rate.—Moldawer, L.

https://openalex.org/W2080794145,"Activity-dependent variations in extracellular potassium concentration in the central nervous system may be regulated, in part, by potassium spatial buffering currents in glial cells. The role of spatial buffering in the retina was assessed by measuring light-evoked potassium changes in amphibian eyecups. The amplitude of potassium increases in the vitreous humor was reduced to approximately 10 percent by 50 micromolar barium, while potassium increases in the inner plexiform layer were largely unchanged. The decrease in the vitreal potassium response was accurately simulated with a numerical model of potassium current flow through Müller cells, the principal glial cells of the retina. Barium also substantially increased the input resistance of Müller cells and blocked the Müller cell-generated M-wave, indicating that barium blocks the potassium channels of Müller cells. Thus, after a light-evoked potassium increase within the retina, there is a substantial transfer of potassium from the retina to the vitreous humor by potassium current flow through Müller cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512490426,"Abstract We have used a permeabilized cell assay and a synthetic peptide substrate (KRTLRR) to specifically monitor the activity of protein kinase C in PC12 cells preincubated with nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or phorbol esters. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or 1 microM phorbol dibutyrate stimulated the rate of KRTLRR peptide phosphorylation 4.8- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with NGF or EGF transiently increased the KRTLRR peptide kinase activity. Peak stimulations of KRTLRR peptide kinase (1.3-2-fold) were observed after 1-5 min of growth factor treatment and returned to control levels within 15-20 min. The KRTLRR peptide kinase activity fulfilled two criteria of protein kinase C. A synthetic peptide inhibitor of protein kinase C inhibited both growth factor- and phorbol ester-stimulated KRTLRR peptide kinase activity. In addition, growth factors and phorbol esters failed to stimulate KRTLRR peptide kinase activity in cells rendered protein kinase C-deficient by long-term treatment with 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. In contrast to the transient activation of protein kinase C, ribosomal S6 kinase, assayed with the synthetic peptide RRLSSLRA, was persistently activated by NGF and EGF. The findings indicate that protein kinase C serves an early and transient role in the molecular actions of NGF and EGF in PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561146956,"Abstract The MgATP dependency of secretion was investigated in digitonin-permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells. Shortly after permeabilization there is a component of Ca2+-dependent secretion that occurs in the absence of MgATP in the medium. This secretion occurs from cells which are permeable to Ca2+/[ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid buffers, to nucleotides, and to proteins. It is prevented by treatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors to reduce cellular ATP prior to permeabilization. The rate of MgATP-independent secretion is rapid and terminates by approximately 2 min after introduction of Ca2+. MgATP-independent secretion is labile and is lost unless Ca2+ is introduced within 8 min of permeabilization. MgATP-dependent secretion occurs at a slower rate than MgATP-independent secretion and continues at a constant rate for 12 min. Preincubation of permeabilized cells with MgATP enhances Ca2+-dependent secretion during a subsequent incubation in the absence of MgATP. Similar MgATP sensitivities are observed when MgATP is present only prior to or only during stimulation with Ca2+ with half-maximal stimulation occurring at 0.4-0.5 and 0.6 mM MgATP, respectively. The data indicate that intact cells are primed by intracellular ATP so that immediately upon permeabilization, there is a component of secretion which is independent of medium MgATP. MgATP partially maintains the primed state after permeabilization by acting before Ca2+ in the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1518143481,"Interleukin-1 beta is a 17.4-kilodalton hormone derived from a 33-kilodalton inactive precursor produced by monocytes. We used the precursor as a substrate to detect proteolytic activities in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cell-conditioned medium that might be involved in interleukin-1 beta processing. We found that the conditioned medium, following passage through DEAE-Sephacel, generates a biologically active fragment from the precursor that runs slightly higher than the mature hormone in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The responsible activity behaved as a single protein in ion exchange chromatography. It was completely inhibited by metal ion chelators and not by inhibitors of serine, cysteine, or aspartate proteases, and it was dependent on both calcium (or magnesium) and zinc. The enzyme was not inhibited by three substrate-based metalloprotease inhibitors, phosphoramidon, benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-NH2, and N-(2-carboxy-3-phenylpropionyl)-Leu. NH2-terminal sequence analysis showed that cleavage of the precursor occurred between a histidine and an aspartate residue, and digestion of synthetic peptides indicated that the protease is specific for pre-aspartate cleavages."
https://openalex.org/W1530737864,"The composition of the intramembranous domains of many receptors are remarkably uniform, yet there is evidence that many transmembrane proteins associate together to form specific noncovalent homo- or heterocomplexes within the membrane. We have synthesized peptides corresponding to transmembrane domains of glycophorin A, glycophorin C, and the interleukin 2-receptor Tac antigen to study the interactions between transmembrane domains in vitro. Synthetic transmembrane glycophorin A peptide formed a complex with native glycophorin and glycoproteins of erythrocyte and K562 cell membranes that was reversible, specific, and could be demonstrated in a natural bilayer system in the absence of detergents. Synthetic glycophorin C and interleukin 2-receptor Tac antigen transmembrane peptides, although similar in amino acid composition, did not interact with glycophorin and did not inhibit the binding of the synthetic glycophorin A transmembrane peptide to native glycophorin. It is proposed that the transmembrane segments of receptor proteins contain not only the structural information necessary for insertion and anchoring but specific binding sites that mediate interactions between transmembrane glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1595608936,"We isolated the cDNA for human prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) from a human peripheral T-cell library using two synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. Hybridization studies with this cDNA showed that the ProT alpha mRNA is detectable in all the rat tissues studied but is most abundant in thymus and within this gland mainly synthesized by thymocytes. In the T-cell lineage, its expression is higher in proliferative immature thymocytes than in pre- and post-thymic T lymphocytes. A quite similar pattern was obtained with the proliferation-related protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen/cyclin. These data show that ProT alpha mRNA levels change with the maturation stage of T-cells. Moreover, the amount of ProT alpha transcript is increased in lymphocytes from human patients with leukemias. Our findings indicate a role for ProT alpha linked to lymphocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2082188142,"A monoclonal antibody was used to show directly positive thymic selection of the T cell repertoire in mouse strains expressing the 17a beta-chain variable domain (V beta 17a) of the T cell receptor. In the absence of the potent tolerizing class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, I-E, peripheral expression of V beta 17a+ T cell receptors varied with the MHC haplotype of the mouse strain. In the most extreme case, H-2q mice expressed high peripheral levels of CD4+ V beta 17a+ T cells (14 to 19 percent), whereas H-2b mice expressed low levels (3 to 4 percent). Analysis of (b x q)F1 mice and chimeric mice showed that these differences were determined by positive thymic selection and implicated the thymic epithelium as the controlling cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1638613249,"alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) is considered a typical plasma protein and a prototype of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family. It is synthesized in hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, in macrophages. In this study we show that the alpha 1-AT gene is also expressed in human intestine and in a human colonic epithelial tumor cell line, Caco2. A single 1.6-kilobase alpha 1-AT-specific mRNA is present in jejunum and in Caco2 cells. It is identical in apparent size to that present in human hepatoma HepG2 cells but slightly smaller than that present in human macrophages, cells in which an alternative upstream transcriptional start site is used. Synthesis and secretion of alpha 1-AT in Caco2 cells is similar to that in HepG2 cells. It is synthesized as an approximately 52-kDa precursor polypeptide, converted to its mature, fully glycosylated 55-kDa form intracellularly, and the native protein is secreted with a half-time of 37 min. Functionally active alpha 1-AT is secreted into the basolateral and apical (luminal) fluid in pulse-chase labeling experiments of Caco2 cells cultured in polarized orientation on collagen-coated nitrocellulose membranes. Expression of alpha 1-AT in Caco2 enterocytes is not affected by soluble factors that regulate expression of alpha 1-AT in macrophages and hepatocytes. However, expression of alpha 1-AT increases markedly in Caco2 cells as they differentiate into enteric villous-type cells."

https://openalex.org/W1503203225,"Abstract It is now well established that mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) modulates the hormonal responsiveness of MA-10 Leydig tumor cells but does not affect cell multiplication. The studies presented herein are the first in a series of experiments designed to characterize the intracellular signaling systems activated by mEGF and their possible roles in mediating the diverse biological actions of this growth factor in MA-10 cells. We show that (i) MA-10 cells express a hormone-sensitive inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol pathway that can be stimulated with arginine vasopressin (AVP), (ii) mEGF does not activate this pathway, and (iii) activation of this pathway with arginine vasopressin does not mimic the biological actions of mEGF. Other data presented show that lutropin/choriogonadotropin, the principal endocrine regulators of Leydig cell function, also do not stimulate the inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol pathway in MA-10 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1845409646,"Abstract A cDNA library constructed from chick aorta poly(A+) RNA in the expression vector pEX1 was screened with rabbit polyclonal antisera. Additional clones were obtained by DNA-DNA hybridization with subclones from the most 5'- and 3'-ends. The overlapping clones span 4.6 kilobases and code for the entire alpha 1 (VI) chain. The nucleotide sequence reveals a 3057-base pair open reading frame that codes for 1019 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence predicts that alpha 1 (VI) has one collagenous domain (COL) of 336 residues flanked by three repeated domains of about 200 residues each, one at the amino (A'3) and two at the carboxyl ends (A'2 and A'1), respectively, that are similar to the type A repeats of von Willebrand Factor. The COL domain presents two short interruptions near the carboxyl end of the triple helix and three of the six potential N-asparaginyl-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). Furthermore, it contains 1 cysteine at position 89 that could participate in the formation of dimers and 3 Arg-Gly-Asp sequences that might be potential sites for cell adhesion. The COL domain shows an extended region, starting from position 40, within the triple helix, made of 14 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets that lack proline in the Y position, suggesting that it might be more flexible than the rest of the domain. At the junction of the COL with the N- and C-terminal domains, there are several cysteines that could confer the well known resistance of type VI collagen to pepsin and collagenase digestion under nonreducing conditions. The present sequence data allow a structural model for type VI collagen assembly to be proposed that is consistent with the structure implied from previous electron microscopic observation by Furthmayr et al. (Furthmayr, H., Wiedemann, H., Timpl, R., Odermatt, R., and Engel, J. (1983) Biochem. J. 221, 303-311)."
https://openalex.org/W1533313673,"We have studied the binding of radioiodinated human factor VII and its activated form, factor VIIa, to monolayers of a human bladder carcinoma cell line (J82) that expresses functional cell surface tissue factor. The binding of factors VII and VIIa to these cells was found to be time-, temperature-, and calcium-dependent. In addition, the binding of each protein to J82 cells was specific, dose-dependent, and saturable. The binding isotherms for factors VII and VIIa were hyperbolic, and Scatchard plots of the binding data obtained at 37 degrees C indicated a single class of binding sites for each protein with Kd values of 3.20 +/- 0.51 and 3.25 +/- 0.31 nM, respectively. Factors VII and VIIa, respectively, interacted with 256,000 +/- 39,000 and 320,000 +/- 31,000 binding sites/cell. Competition experiments suggested a common receptor for factors VII and VIIa. Binding of factor VIIa to the cells was completely blocked by preincubation of the cells with polyclonal anti-tissue factor IgG, whereas binding of factor VII was inhibited approximately 90%, suggesting the presence of a small number of tissue factor-independent binding sites specific for factor VII on this cell. Functional studies revealed that factor X activation by increasing amounts of cell-bound factor VII or VIIa was hyperbolic in nature. Half-maximal rates of factor Xa formation occurred at factor VII and VIIa concentrations of 3.7 +/- 0.47 and 3.2 +/- 0.31 nM, respectively. No factor VII- or VIIa-mediated activation of factor X was observed when cells were preincubated with anti-tissue factor IgG. Two-chain 125I-factor VIIa recovered from the cells was identical to the offered ligand as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In contrast, the offered single-chain 125I-factor VII was progressively converted to two-chain 125I-factor VIIa upon binding to the cells. When the J82 cells were pretreated with anti-tissue factor IgG, both factor VII recovered from the cells and factor VII in the supernatant were in the single-chain form, indicating that cell-surface tissue factor was essential for the activation of factor VII on these cells. These data indicate that binding of factor VII to tissue factor appears to be a prerequisite for its conversion to factor VIIa and the initiation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation on these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1631964335,"Nitrogenase is composed of two component proteins, the iron protein (Fe protein) and the molybdenum-iron protein (MoFe protein). The Fe protein is a Mr 60,000 dimer of identical subunits with one bridging [4Fe-4S] center. It serves as a one-electron donor to the MoFe protein in a reaction that is coupled to MgATP hydrolysis. The MoFe protein is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer of Mr 220,000 which contains four [4Fe-4S] clusters and two iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo cofactor) centers. The exact structure of FeMo cofactor is not known, but it is believed to form the active site of the enzyme. Using specifically constructed deletion mutants of Azotobacter vinelandii, we have previously shown that the Fe protein, but not the MoFe protein, is required for FeMo cofactor biosynthesis (Robinson, A. C., Dean, D. R., and Burgess, B. K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14327-14332). During the partial purification of a FeMo cofactor-deficient form of the MoFe protein from one of these mutants (DJ54, delta nifH), we have discovered that, in addition to biosynthesis, the Fe protein-MgATP complex is involved in FeMo cofactor insertion into the MoFe protein. This insertion process is also sensitive to a number of other parameters (e.g. salt, pH, temperature, protein concentration). Based on our experimental data, we present a model for how this insertion reaction might take place, in which the Fe protein-MgATP complex binds the FeMo cofactor-deficient form of the MoFe protein and stabilizes a specific conformation of the MoFe protein that has the FeMo cofactor binding site exposed and available for coordination by preformed FeMo cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1527149038,"Abstract Carboxypeptidase H is a putative post-translational processing enzyme which removes basic amino acid residues from intermediates during protein hormone biosynthesis. A 2.2-kilobase pair cDNA was shown to contain the complete amino acid sequence of rat carboxypeptidase H. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the enzyme was synthesized as preprocarboxypeptidase H, a precursor form of 476 amino acid residues. Preprocarboxypeptidase H contained a putative hydrophobic signal peptide and a short propeptide which contained 5 adjacent Arg residues at its C terminus. Northern blot analysis identified a single carboxypeptidase H mRNA of approximately 2.3 kilobases in brain, pituitary, and heart, as well as in mouse AtT20 cells. No carboxypeptidase H mRNA was detected in rat liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and mammary gland. Sequence analysis of cDNAs obtained from different rat tissues suggested that a single mRNA encodes an identical carboxypeptidase in several tissues. Treatment of AtT20 cells with dexamethasone decreased the levels of both carboxypeptidase H and preproopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNAs by approximately 30%. Exposure of the dexamethasone-treated cells to corticotropin-releasing factor effected a 2- to 3-fold increase in the carboxypeptidase H and POMC mRNA levels relative to those of dexamethasone-treated cells exposed to control medium. This suggests that the mRNA levels of POMC and one of its putative post-translational processing enzymes, carboxypeptidase H, are co-regulated by corticotropin-releasing factor and steroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1557338784,"We have used a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) which expresses high levels of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gag proteins to analyze the processing pathway of the gag p55 precursor. HIV-1 gag proteins were isolated from [3H]leucine-labeled VV:gag-infected H9 T lymphocytes by immunoprecipitation with either anti-p24, anti-p17, or anti-p6 antibodies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that processing of the p55 precursor involves three major intermediates (p41a, p41b, and p39). The p41a and p39 proteins contain the p17 and p24 protein segments, and the p41b is comprised of p24 and p15 segments. On two-dimensional gels, each intermediate as well as the mature p24 and p17 proteins migrated as distinct species. [3H]Myristic acid labeling of the HIV-1 gag proteins revealed that in addition to p55 and p17, the p41a and p39 intermediates, but not p41b, are myristylated, confirming that myristylation occurs at the NH2 terminus before cleavage of the p55 precursor protein. We conclude that the myristylated HIV-1 gag p55 precursor is initially cleaved at random either at the p17/p24 junction or at two sites between p24 and p15 proteins, resulting in three intermediates (p41a, p41b, and p39) which are subsequently cleaved to yield mature gag proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602543304,"A DNA fragment that carried the genes coding for FokI endonuclease and methylase was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Flavobacterium okeanokoites, and the coding regions were assigned to the nucleotide sequence by deletion analysis. The methylase gene was 1,941 base pairs (bp) long, corresponding to a protein of 647 amino acid residues (Mr = 75,622), and the endonuclease gene was 1,749 bp long, corresponding to a protein of 583 amino acid residues (Mr = 66,216). The assignment of the methylase gene was further confirmed by analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The endonuclease gene was downstream from the methylase gene in the same orientation, separated by 69 bp. The promoter site, which could be recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, was upstream from the methylase gene, and the sequences adhering to the ribosome-binding sequence were identified in front of the respective genes. Analysis of the gene products expressed in E. coli cells by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the molecular weights of both enzymes coincided well with the values estimated from the nucleotide sequences, and that the monomeric forms were catalytically active. No significant similarity was found between the sequences of the two enzymes. Sequence comparison with other related enzymes indicated that FokI methylase contained two copies of a segment of tetra-amino acids which is characteristic of adenine-specific methylase."
https://openalex.org/W1515819949,"Abstract Isolated rabbit pancreatic acinar cells, permeabilized by saponin treatment and incubated in the presence of 0.1 microM free Ca2+, accumulated 0.9-1.5 nmol of Ca2+/mg acinar protein in an energy-dependent pool. Uptake into this pool was not altered by pretreatment of acinar cells with the Ca2+ mobilizing secretagogues carbamylcholine and cholecystokinin-octapeptide or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, indicating that the Ca2+ pump of the internal Ca2+ store was not affected by prolonged activation of the Ca2+ messenger system. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) caused a rapid decrease in Ca2+ content of the internal Ca2+ store. The response was maximal within 30 s following addition of 1,4,5-IP3 and no reuptake of Ca2+ was observed over the next 60 s. Up to 55% of the amount of Ca2+ stored in the energy-dependent pool was 1,4,5-IP3 releasable with an EC50 of 1.0 microM. Pretreatment of acinar cells with carbamylcholine or cholecystokinin-octapeptide significantly reduced the effectivity of 1,4,5-IP3 to release Ca2+ from the internal store. The dose-response curve for 1,4,5-IP3-induced release of actively stored Ca2+ from carbamylcholine-treated acinar cells showed both a rightward shift (EC50 value of 1.7 microM) and a decreased maximal response (maximal release value of 44%), which suggests that the affinity of 1,4,5-IP3 for its receptor as well as the number of 1,4,5-IP3 receptors or 1,4,5-IP3-operated Ca2+ channels was reduced upon prolonged activation of the Ca2+ messenger system. Moreover, analysis of the release values in a Hill plot suggested positive cooperativity for 1,4,5-IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the internal store (n values of 1.3 and 1.7 for saline- and carbamylcholine-treated permeabilized acinar cells, respectively). Pretreatment of acinar cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate partly mimicked the inhibitory effect of carbamylcholine on 1,4,5-IP3-induced release of actively stored Ca2+ in that the dose-response curve was shifted to the right but the maximal response was not affected, suggesting that the effects of carbamylcholine were at least in part mediated by protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1672669524,"Chelation of Fe from the Fe-protein component (Av2) of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase has been investigated. The chelation, which requires MgATP binding by Av2, is best described as a two-exponential process. The rates for the two phases differed by approximately 10-fold and increased as the concentration of MgATP was increased. The rates for both phases were 50% of maximum at approximately 1.5 mM MgATP. At MgATP concentrations greater than 100 microM, the more rapid phase represented approximately 25% of the total Fe chelated from Av2. However, below 100 microM MgATP, the proportion of the faster phase decreased until at 20 microM MgATP, only a single phase could be detected. The properties of Av2 were studied at various stages of Fe chelation. The partially chelated protein was isolated from the reaction by gel filtration and was subjected to a second MgATP-dependent Fe chelation. Material isolated after the completion of the first phase regained biphasic kinetics in subsequent chelation reactions. However, if MgATP was present during the isolation of Av2, then only a single phase was observed in the subsequent chelation studies. In addition, the enzymatic activity of Av2 decreased concomitantly with total Fe chelation. To account for these observations, a model is presented in which Av2 exists in two conformers. Fe chelation is proposed to occur from either conformer but only when two MgATP are bound. Both conformers bind MgATP with the same affinity but are distinguished by a 10-fold difference in chelation rate. The two conformers are in equilibrium and can interconvert only in the absence of MgATP. That is, MgATP binding prevents the conversion of the two conformational states."
https://openalex.org/W1634811665,"Abstract Transport of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, products of lysosomal glycoprotein and glycosaminoglycan degradation, was examined in Percoll gradient purified rat liver lysosomes. Uptake of these two sugars was competitive and quite specific remaining largely unaffected by the presence of L-fucose, D-glucosamine, D-glucose, D-glucuronic acid, D-mannose, or N-acetylneuraminic acid. Kinetic studies revealed a Km of 4.4 mM for both N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine uptake. Temperature dependence studies revealed a Q10 of 2.3. N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine uptake was not dependent upon NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, or ATP/MgCl2 and was unaffected by 5 mM dithiothreitol or variation of buffer pH between 6.0 and 8.0. Cytochalasin B at a concentration of 50 microM effectively inhibited uptake of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine by 90% and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine by 65%. Prior incubation of lysosomes in 20 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine stimulated uptake of both sugars 3-4-fold, although it had no effect on the uptake of D-glucose. Countertransport was unaffected by neutral and cationic amino acids demonstrating independence from these amino acid transport systems. We conclude that lysosomes possess a highly specific transport system for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1502894394,Treatment of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) causes an inhibition of the high affinity binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to cell surface receptors and an inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity. The hypothesis that PMA controls EGF receptor function by regulating the oligomeric state of the receptor was tested. Dimeric EGF receptors bound to 125I-EGF were identified by covalent cross-linking analysis using disuccinimidyl suberimidate. Treatment of cells with PMA in the presence of 20 nM 125I-EGF caused no significant change in the level of labeled cross-linked monomeric and dimeric receptor species. Investigation of the in vitro autophosphorylation of receptor monomers and dimers cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide demonstrated that the treatment of cells with PMA caused an inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of both monomeric and dimeric EGF receptors. We conclude that the inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity caused by PMA is not associated with the regulation of the oligomeric state of the EGF receptor.
https://openalex.org/W1511639574,"Abstract A collagen-binding glycoprotein was isolated from human platelets using affinity chromatography of immobilized collagen. Based upon characterizations of this protein we confirmed that it was identical to the propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF), which is also called von Willebrand antigen II. The characteristics we have investigated are molecular weight, existence of carbohydrate chains, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. pp-vWF has strong affinity to collagen and inhibits collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets at a concentration as low as 2 micrograms/ml even in the presence of plasma. This inhibitory effect is specific for collagen-induced aggregation since it does not inhibit aggregation of platelets induced by other agonists such as ADP, arachidonic acid, platelet-activating factor, ionophore A23187, and ristocetin. As pp-vWF is quickly released from platelets upon activation by various agonists, it is possible that pp-vWF functions as a repressor for excess platelet aggregation induced by collagen and constitutes a negative feed-back mechanism. Considering the fact that mature vWF supports platelet adhesion to subendothelium, present observations suggest that the propeptide portion and the mature protein could have opposing effects on hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1527577334,"T cell mitogens induce the expression of specific trans-acting DNA binding proteins that in turn regulate the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha (IL-2R alpha) gene. To investigate whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the activation of these transacting factors and the induced expression of this receptor gene, Jurkat T cells were incubated with various inhibitors of protein synthesis prior to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Despite the presence of cycloheximide or anisomycin at concentrations sufficient to block greater than 97% of cellular protein synthesis, phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate effectively induced the expression of the IL-2R alpha gene as measured at the mRNA level. Similarly, gel retardation, DNA footprinting, and DNA-protein cross-linking studies revealed that these mitogens induced the activation of two predominant DNA binding proteins (50-55 and 80-90 kDa) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide and anisomycin. Both of these proteins specifically interacted with a kappa B-like binding site present in the IL-2R alpha promoter (-267 to -256) that is requisite for mitogen-induced expression of this receptor gene. These findings support a post-translational mechanism of induction of pre-existing, but inactive, DNA binding proteins which in turn bind to and activate the IL-2R alpha gene."
https://openalex.org/W1542161436,"Abstract The effects of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), which has been hypothesized to be a chemical transmitter in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle, on aldolase bound to isolated triad junctions were investigated. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase was identified as the major specific binding protein for the Ins(1,4,5)P3 analogue glycolaldehyde (2)-1-phospho-D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate which can form covalent bonds with protein amino groups by reduction of the Schiff's base intermediate with [3H]NaCNBH3. This analogue, Ins(1,4,5) P3, and the inositol polyphosphates inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate were nearly equipotent in selectively releasing membrane bound aldolase with a K0.5 of about 3 microM. The rank order of the K0.5 values was identical to the KI values for inhibition of aldolase. Aldolase was also released by its substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced aldolase release did not disrupt the triad junction; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a known junctional constituent, was displaced only at much higher Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 was as effective as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in releasing aldolase from myofibrils. A finite number of binding sites for aldolase exist on triads (Bmax = 43-47 pmol of tetrameric aldolase exist on triads (Bmax = 43-47 pmol of tetrameric aldolase/mg of triad protein, KD = 23 nM). The junctional foot protein was implicated as an aldolase binding site by affinity chromatography with the junctional foot protein immobilized on Sepharose 4B. The potential consequences of aldolase being bound in the gap between the terminal cisternae and the transverse tubule to inositol polyphosphate and glycolytic metabolism in that local region are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1964166323,"Mice transgenic for a hybrid gene containing the liver promoter of the mouse amylase gene (Amy-1a) fused to the SV40 tumor antigen coding region unexpected developed malignant brown adipose tissue tumors (malignant hibernomas). Expression of the alpha-amylase gene had previously been thought to be confined to the liver parotid, and pancreas; however, analysis of white and brown adipose tissue from nontransgenic mice revealed expression of the endogenous Amy-1a gene in these tissues. Gene constructs driven by the Amy-1a liver promoter thus provide a means of targeting gene expression to the adipocyte cell lineage in transgenic mice. Moreover the high frequency of metastases in the liver, lungs, spleen, heart, and adrenals of these mice provides an experimental system in which to study the development of disseminated malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1506552507,"Abstract We have previously described the isolation and characterization of a set of cDNA clones encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced early genes in murine peritoneal macrophages. The treatment of macrophages with LPS also stimulates the expression of four early or competence genes (c-fos, c-myc, JE, and KC) described in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Balb/c 3T3 cells. These latter findings led to the hypothesis that long term, adaptive responses such as DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and functional activation of macrophages may share multiple mechanistic pathways. To test this possibility, we have examined the expression of four LPS-inducible macrophage genes in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. The results demonstrate that three of these four genes are expressed in 3T3 cells in a fashion reminiscent of other growth factor-stimulated competence genes. All three mRNAs are expressed even in the presence of cycloheximide and two of the three exhibit superinducibility. The accumulation of these specific mRNA species was dependent upon the stimulation of transcription as determined by nuclear run-off studies. The platelet-derived growth factor dose dependence is comparable both for stimulation of DNA synthesis and expression of the three early genes. Furthermore, expression of all three genes preceded the entry of the cells into S phase, suggesting an association with cell cycle entry. Stimulation of 3T3 cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in DNA synthesis but not early gene expression. This latter result indicates that these early gene products are not necessary for 3T3 cell mitogenesis. Nevertheless, the expression of these genes in two different cell types in association with two distinct functional responses suggests that they contribute common functions either in terms of the physiologic response in which these cells participate (e.g. inflammation) or in the regulatory mechanisms which govern such responses."
https://openalex.org/W1516900829,"Monoclonal antibody 114/A10, raised against the murine multipotential hemopoietic progenitor cell line B6SUtA, identifies an antigen highly expressed by primary myeloid progenitor cells, the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line WEHI-3, and various interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines. Western blotting studies indicate that the 114/A10 antigen has a mean relative molecular mass of 150,000 but varies greatly in size range between different cell types. cDNA clones encoding this protein were isolated from a plasmid-based expression vector library prepared from B6SUtA RNA. Three clones corresponding in size to the two major mRNA species detected in IL-3-dependent cell lines (3.0 and 2.2 kilobase pairs) and differing in their utilization of alternative polyadenylation signals were obtained. These clones contain a single long open reading frame of 573 amino acids possessing the typical characteristics of an integral membrane protein. A particularly striking feature of this sequence is the presence at the extracellular amino terminus of a series of eight highly conserved 27-amino acid, serine/threonine-rich (55%) tandem repeats that may serve as sites of extensive glycosylation. The extracellular domain also contains three epidermal growth factor-like cysteine-rich repeats. The distribution and structural characteristics of the 114/A10 antigen suggest a possible regulatory role in the cellular response to IL-3."

https://openalex.org/W1823551230,"Abstract The binding interaction of bone Gla protein (BGP), or osteocalcin, to phospholipid vesicles in the presence of calcium has been investigated. Two separate indirect methodologies involving displacement of pyrene-modified Factor Va bound to phospholipid vesicles, and competition with several coagulation proteins in a prothrombin activation assay were performed. Titration of BGP into a cuvette containing phospholipid vesicles (75:25, L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine/L-alpha-phosphatidylserine (PCPS] saturated with pyrene-modified Factor Va resulted in a systematic decrease in steady-state anisotropy, suggesting competition for membrane binding sites with pyrene-modified Factor Va. BGP was also found to inhibit thrombin generation in the prothrombin activation assay. Approximately 50% inhibition was observed at 3 microM BGP under phospholipid-limiting (0.5 microM PCPS) concentrations. No inhibition was observed under phospholipid excess (30 microM PCPS) concentrations. Direct measurement of phospholipid binding was measured using equilibrium gel filtration. Elution profiles using fixed lipid (3.4 mumol of PCPS) and varying BGP concentrations (1-17 microM) in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2 showed a BGP-phospholipid association. Quantitation of determined isotherm yielded a dissociation constant of 6 +/- 1 microM with a stoichiometry of 102 +/- 9 BGP molecules/vesicle at saturation (35 PCPS lipids/BGP) in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2. These results support the hypothesis that protein gamma-carboxylation events are coincident with membrane binding potential."

https://openalex.org/W1548143242,"Abstract The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase activity is required for both the earliest EGF-stimulated post-binding events (enhancement of inositol phosphate formation and Ca2+ influx, activation of Na+/H+ exchange), and the ultimate EGF-induced mitogenic response. To assess the role of EGF receptor kinase in EGF-induced metabolic effects (2-deoxyglucose and 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake), we used NIH3T3 cells (clone 2.2), which do not possess endogenous EGF receptors and which were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding either wild type or kinase-deficient human EGF receptor (HER). In addition, we tested the importance of three HER autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1068, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173) in transduction of EGF-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Taking our data together, we conclude the following: (i) HER tyrosine kinase activity is required to elicit EGF stimulation of both 2-deoxyglucose and 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake; (ii) mutations on individual HER autophosphorylation sites, Tyr-1068, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173 do not impair EGF-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1572883096,"Abstract It was earlier reported (Padh, H., and Aleo, J. J. (1987) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 185, 153-157) that the activation of serum complement by endotoxin or immunocomplexes inhibited ascorbate transport in 3T6 fibroblasts. We show here that the inhibitor of 3T6 fibroblasts. We show here that the inhibitor of ascorbate transport increased the Km for ascorbate without affecting the Vmax, indicating that the inhibitor reduces the affinity of the ascorbate transporter for ascorbate without affecting the process of translocation. Inhibition by serum and endotoxin was reversible, and the generated inhibitor was no longer heat-labile (at 56 degrees C for 30 min) suggesting that the inhibitor of ascorbate transport is likely to be a small protein molecule. Utilization of complement components suggested that C3 was consumed during formation of the inhibitor of ascorbate transport while C5 and factor B were not consumed. These data along with other results indicate that the inhibitor is generated at C3 step of complement activation. The inhibitor was purified from inulin activated human serum and it had an apparent molecular mass of around 9000 daltons. The inhibitory effect of the purified factor was abolished by antiserum to C3a suggesting that the 9000-dalton factor could be related to this fragment of complement protein. These data raise the possibility that tissue supply of ascorbate may be compromised during infection or autoimmune processes when serum complement is activated."
https://openalex.org/W2104068112,"Abstract Very late antigen (VLA) 1 is a member of the family of integral plasma-membrane glycoproteins known as integrins. It is a heterodimer composed of an alpha subunit of Mr 200,000, noncovalently associated with a beta subunit of Mr 110,000 which is shared by other VLA molecules (VLA-2-5). Unlike most of the other VLA proteins which have been shown to be receptors for various extracellular matrix proteins, the ligand for VLA-1 is unknown. Utilizing polyclonal antisera against the human fibronectin receptor as well as alpha subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies and cDNA probes, we have been able to demonstrate that in two human neuroblastoma cell lines, IMR-32 and SK-N-SH, the common beta subunit is associated with alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 subunits. By culturing these two cell lines in the presence of a synthetic peptide, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro, which contains the Arg-Gly-Asp cell attachment promotion tripeptide, we have isolated variant cell lines resistant to the detachment effects of this peptide. Peptide-resistant SK-N-SH and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells exhibit weaker attachment to type I collagen and laminin, but a similar level of attachment to fibronectin as compared to the parental cells. Although the peptide-resistant variant cell lines proliferate at a rate similar to that of the parental cell lines, they stably overproduce (up to 20-fold) the alpha 1 subunit (VLA-1) specifically; and in the IMR-32 variant cells, the common beta 1 subunit is also overproduced. The level of expression of alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, however, is considerably reduced and that of the alpha 5 subunit is unchanged relative to the parental cells. These data suggest that the expression of integrin alpha subunits can be regulated differentially and independently of the beta subunit and that the VLA-1 heterodimer has an important function in mediating Arg-Gly-Asp-dependent cell adhesion or other phenotypic properties in human neuroblastoma cells."
