https://openalex.org/W1596439003,"Photoactive radioactive analogues of vinblastine were used to photoaffinity label membranes of Chinese hamster lung drug-sensitive (DC-3F), multidrug-resistant sublines selected for resistance to vincristine (DC-3F/VCRd-5L) or actinomycin D (DC-3F/ADX), and revertant (DC-3F/ADX-U) cells. A radiolabeled doublet (150-180 kDa) consisting of a major and minor band which was barely detectable in parental drug-sensitive cells was increased up to 150-fold in the drug-resistant variants but only 15-fold in the revertant cells. Photoaffinity labeling in the presence of 200-fold excess vinblastine reduced radiolabeling of the 150-180-kDa species up to 96%, confirming its Vinca alkaloid binding specificity. The radiolabeled doublet comigrated with a Coomassie Blue stained polypeptide doublet in the drug-resistant cells and was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody which is specific for the 150-180-kDa surface membrane glycoprotein in multidrug-resistant cell lines. The identification of this Vinca alkaloid acceptor in multidrug-resistant plasma cell membranes suggests the possibility of a direct functional role for the 150-180-kDa surface membrane protein in the development of multidrug resistance."

Both the crude enzyme and the purified fractions oxidized the substrate to three organic soluble products, namely benzo(a)pyrene 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-quinones. These findings support the recent proposition that lignin-degrading enzymes are peroxidases, mediating oxidation of aromatic compounds via aryl cation radicals. The ligninase which was unstable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be stabilized by addition of 3,4-dimethoxy benzyl alcohol to the reaction mixture. The oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene was enhanced in the presence of this alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W1480395470,"Human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) transacylates the sn-2 fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol forming cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. Measurement of the phospholipase A2 and transacylase activities of the enzyme using proteoliposome substrates and following selective chemical modification of serine, histidine, and cysteine residues of pure homogeneous LCAT indicated the following catalytic mechanism: HS-Cys-E-Ser-OH + lecithin in equilibrium HS-Cys-E-Ser-O-FA + lysolecithin, HS-Cys-E-Ser-O-FA in equilibrium FA-S-Cys-E-Ser-OH, FA-S-Cys-E-Ser-OH + cholesterol-OH in equilibrium HS-Cys-E-Ser-OH + cholesterol-O-FA, where FA denotes fatty acid. Modification of 2 LCAT cysteine residues with 5,5‘-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or treatment with ferricyanide inactivated the transacylase but not the phospholipase A2 activity. Modification of 1 serine residue with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or 1 histidine residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate inhibited cholesteryl ester formation and phospholipase A2 activity. Proteoliposome substrates protected both activities against chemical inactivation. Lecithin alone protected the phospholipase A2 activity against phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride inactivation but not the transacylase against 5,5‘-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inactivation. Incubation of native LCAT with arachidonyl-CoA or the lecithin-apo-A-I proteoliposome resulted in acylation of three enzyme sites, only one of which was stable to neutral hydroxylamine after denaturation. Fatty acylenzyme oxy- and thioesters were demonstrable in both cases. No transfer of arachidonic acid from iodoacetamide-modified LCAT to cholesterol occurred, indicating that the fatty-acylated serine residue cannot directly esterify cholesterol. Cholesterol arachidonate was formed upon incubation of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-modified LCAT with arachidonyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1574991890,"The effect of Glc deprivation (starvation) on hexose transporter (GT) polypeptide(s) (pp) was studied in 3T3-C2 murine fibroblasts. Cells deprived of Glc exhibit 5-fold increases in hexose transport and Glc-displaceable cytochalasin B binding. Immunoblots of membranes reveal a Mr 55,000 GT pp in fed (4 g of Glc/liter) cells and Mr 55,000 and Mr 42,000 GT pp in starved cells. A 10-40-fold increase in total GT pp occurs upon Glc deprivation; part of this accumulation (2-5-fold) is in the Mr 55,000 GT pp, and the remaining increase is in the Mr 42,000 GT pp. During the first 12 h of Glc deprivation only the Mr 55,000 GT pp accumulates. At later times (24-72 h) the Mr 42,000 GT pp appears and constitutes a larger fraction of the total accumulation. Similarly, the Glc concentration dependence of these phenomena reveals that the Mr 55,000 GT pp accumulates at higher concentrations of Glc (less than or equal to g/liter) than the Mr 42,000 GT pp (less than or equal to 0.5 g/liter). Using alternative nutrients, sugar analogs, and inhibitors we observed that the accumulation of total GT pp is dependent upon both hexose phosphate metabolism and the interaction of substrate with the GT. The role(s) of oligosaccharide biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and the transport process itself in the Glc deprivation-induced accumulation of GT pp were examined. The appearance of the Mr 42,000 GT pp but not the Mr 55,000 GT pp was dependent upon protein synthesis. The Glc deprivation-induced accumulation of GT pp is reversible upon refeeding with Glc (4 g/liter, 12 h). This reversal was dependent upon protein synthesis. The electrophoretic mobility of the Mr 42,000 GT pp is similar to the GT pp observed after tunicamycin treatment. The Mr 55,000 but not the Mr 42,000 GT pp binds specifically to agarose-bound wheat germ agglutinin and is sensitive to endoglycosidase F digestion. Oligosaccharide-stripped GT pp and the Mr 42,000 GT pp have the same Mr. The results suggest that the accumulation of total GT pp induced by Glc deprivation is partially independent of the effect of Glc deprivation on glycoprotein biogenesis. The appearance of the Mr 42,000 GT pp with aglyco characteristics is the result of the latter. The accumulation of total GT pp, however, is the result of a specialized and sensitive adaptation of the cell to Glc deprivation. The GT pp synthesized during chronic Glc deprivation has an Mr of 42,000; fed cells synthesize the Mr 55,000 GT pp. Neither the level of in vitro translatable GT mRNA nor the rate of GT pp synthesis are increased by Glc deprivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1491882973,"This report details the effects of methotrexate on the intracellular folate pools of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. To achieve this goal, we designed a high-pressure liquid chromatography system capable of separating the physiologic folates. The folate pools were quantitated following growth and equilibration in 2.25 microM radiolabeled folic acid. Each of the intracellular folates was identified by coelution with standard folates and by chemical/biochemical tests unique to each of the various folates. The 10-formyl-H4PteGlu (where H4PteGlu represents dl-tetrahydrofolic acid) pool accounted for 20.5% of the total intracellular folate pool in untreated cells, whereas 5-formyl-H4PteGlu and H4PteGlu accounted for 6.5 and 10.6%, respectively. The levels of these three folates remained stable throughout cell growth. The 5-methyl-H4PteGlu pool accounted for less than 10% in early growth phase cells but assumed greater than 60% of the total pool by the mid- and late-log phases of cell growth. When the MCF-7 cells were exposed to 1 microM methotrexate, de novo purine synthesis and de novo thymidylate synthesis were rapidly inhibited to less than 20% of control within 3 h. During this time period, rapid alterations in the folate pools also occurred such that dihydrofolic acid levels rose from less than 1% in untreated cells to greater than 30% of the total pool. This rise was accompanied by a parallel fall in 5-methyl-H4PteGlu. H4PteGlu and 5-formyl-H4PteGlu were undetectable following 2 h of methotrexate exposure, but 10-formyl-H4PteGlu, the required cosubstrate for de novo purine synthesis, was preserved at greater than 80% of pretreatment values following a 1 microM methotrexate exposure of up to 21 h. The rapid inhibition of de novo purine synthesis in these cells following methotrexate exposure coupled with a relatively preserved 10-formyl-H4PteGlu pool suggests direct inhibition of this synthetic pathway by the temporally coincident accumulation of dihydrofolic acid and/or methotrexate polyglutamates. This inhibition cannot be ascribed to depletion of the folate cofactor 10-formyl-H4PteGlu."
https://openalex.org/W1486865794,"We have used specific in vitro transcription as a functional assay to study the effects of the major chromosomal proteins, histones and high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2, on transcription by RNA polymerases II and III. HMG proteins 1 and 2 can stimulate transcription by both RNA polymerases II and III; maximal stimulation (up to 20-fold) is seen when HMG proteins 1 and 2 are mixed with template DNA prior to the addition of whole cell transcription lysate. HMG proteins 1 and 2 are also able to overcome inhibition of transcription caused by histones; maximal enhancement of transcription (at least 60-fold) is seen when histones and then HMG proteins 1 and 2 are added to DNA before addition of transcription lysate. This suggests that stimulation of transcription by HMG proteins 1 and 2 in the presence of histones is not due to a simple competition between histones and HMG proteins for binding to DNA. It appears likely that HMG proteins 1 and 2 stimulate transcription in a nonspecific manner, perhaps altering the template in such a way as to allow increased accessibility of transcription factors or rate of elongation for both RNA polymerases II and III."

https://openalex.org/W1494294743,"We have identified a pentapeptide region of microinjected ribonuclease A that is required for enhanced degradation of this protein during serum withdrawal. We introduced reductively methylated [3H]ribonuclease A, [3H]ribonuclease S-protein (residues 21-124), and [3H]ribonuclease S-peptide (residues 1-20) into the cytosol of human fibroblasts by red cell-mediated microinjection and osmotic lysis of pinosomes. The degradative rates of ribonuclease A and ribonuclease S-peptide are increased 2-fold upon withdrawal of serum, while catabolism of ribonuclease S-protein is not regulated in this manner. Certain fragments of ribonuclease S-peptide are also degraded in a serum-dependent fashion (residues 1-14 and 4-13), while other fragments are not (residues 1-10 and 2-8). [3H]Ribonuclease S-peptide is cleaved into two smaller radioactive peptides during loading into red cell ghosts. We tentatively identified the larger fragment as residues 7-11 based on its molecular weight determined by Sephadex chromatography in the presence of 8 M urea combined with sequential Edman degradation to identify the position of radioactive lysines. The smaller peptide fragment appears to be the amino-terminal dipeptide, Lys-Glu, and/or residues 7-8, Lys-Phe. After microinjection into fibroblasts, the pentapeptide is degraded at an enhanced rate in the absence of serum, while degradation of the dipeptide is not affected. We confirmed that residues 7-11 constitute the larger hydrolysis product of S-peptide by synthesizing this pentapeptide and radiolabeling it by reductive methylation. It migrated at the expected position after Sephadex chromatography in 8 M urea and was further hydrolyzed only slightly during loading into red cells. Finally, degradation of this pentapeptide after injection into fibroblasts was enhanced 2-fold upon serum withdrawal. These results, combined with our other recent studies (McElligott, M. A., Miao, P., and Dice, J. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11986-11993), suggest that the pentapeptide, Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln, targets microinjected ribonuclease A to lysosomes for enhanced degradation during serum deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1577662565,"Abstract The internal pH of lung lamellar bodies was investigated with membrane permeable basic amines. Isolated granular pneumocytes and isolated lung lamellar bodies exhibited fluorescence when exposed to 8 microM quinacrine, suggesting accumulation of this dye due to an acidic internal pH. Uptake of [14C]methylamine by isolated lung lamellar bodies was measured to quantitate the intralamellar body pH. In KCl-ATP (10 mM) medium (pH 7.0), the accumulation ratio of methylamine (inside/outside) during 2-min incubation was 8.1 +/- 0.47 (mean +/- S.E., n = 8) indicating an internal pH of 6.1. Lamellar bodies accumulated methylamine almost 30-fold in K+-free mannitol medium indicating an internal pH of 5.6. The pH gradient across the lamellar body membrane decreased when external pH was decreased or when ATP was omitted. The pH gradient was also decreased by the addition of 10 mM NH4Cl, 2 micrograms/ml nigericin, 0.02 mM N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or 1 mM N'-ethylmaleimide. These observations indicate that lamellar bodies maintain an acidic interior (pH 6.1 or below) which is generated by an energy-dependent process."
https://openalex.org/W1517997064,"Abstract The majority of the DNA polymerase alpha activity in HeLa cells has been isolated and purified as a multiprotein Mr 640,000 form. The multiprotein form of DNA polymerase alpha corresponds to DNA polymerase alpha 2 that was previously reported by us (Lamothe, P., Baril, B., Chi, A., Lee, L., and Baril, E. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4723-4727). The highly purified DNA polymerase alpha 2 has in addition to DNA polymerase alpha-associated DNase, primase, and diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A)binding activities and accessory primer recognition proteins C1 and C2. The DNA polymerase alpha and associated activities increase coordinately during the G1/S-phase transition of the cell cycle. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the electrophoretically homogeneous DNA polymerase alpha shows that it is composed of at least eight polypeptides in the molecular weight range of 180,000-15,000. Hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-agarose resolves the DNase and Ap4A-binding protein from a complex of DNA polymerase alpha, primase, and the primer recognition proteins C1 and C2. Hydrophobic chromatography of the latter complex on phenyl-Sepharose resolves the C1 protein from a DNA polymerase alpha-C2 protein-primase complex. Phosphocellulose chromatography of the DNA polymerase-primase-C2 protein complex resolves the C2 protein from a complex of DNA polymerase alpha-primase."
https://openalex.org/W1594492542,"Binding of Ca2+ to the troponin C (TnC) subunit of troponin is necessary for tension development in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Tension was measured in skinned fibers from rabbit skeletal muscle at various [Ca2+] before and after partial substitution of skeletal TnC with cardiac TnC. Following substitution, the tension-pCa relationship was altered in a manner consistent with the differences in the number of low-affinity Ca2+-binding sites on the two types of TnC and their affinities for Ca2+. The alterations in the tension-pCa relationship were for the most part reversed by reextraction of cardiac TnC and readdition of skeletal TnC into the fiber segments. These findings indicate that the type of TnC present plays an important role in determining the Ca2+ dependence of tension development in striated muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1608588255,"The exquisite sensitivity of brain amino acid availability to changes in plasma amino acid composition arises from the uniquely high affinity (low Km) of blood-brain barrier transport sites as compared to cell membrane transport systems in nonbrain tissues. The extension of this paradigm from rats to man assumes that the Km of blood-brain barrier amino acid transport in the human is low as in the rat. This hypothesis is tested in the present studies wherein isolated human brain capillaries are used as a model system for the human blood-brain barrier. Capillaries were obtained from autopsy brain between 20 and 45 h after death and were isolated in high yield and free of adjoining brain tissue. [3H]Phenylalanine transport into the isolated human, rabbit, or rat brain capillary was characterized by two saturable transport systems and a nonsaturable component. The Km values of phenylalanine transport into brain capillaries via the two saturable systems averaged 0.26 +/- 0.08 and 22.3 +/- 7.1 microM for five human subjects. These studies provide the first evidence for a very high affinity (Km = 0.26 microM) neutral amino acid transport system at the blood-brain barrier, and it is hypothesized that this system is selectively localized to the brain side of the blood-brain barrier. The results also show that the transport Km values for phenylalanine transport are virtually identical at both the rat and human blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1561561446,"Acetaldehyde reacted with hemoglobin at neutral pH and 37 degrees C to form adducts that were stable to dialysis and that were not reduced by sodium borohydride. Hemoglobin tetramers having 2, 3, and probably 4 molar eq of bound aldehyde were isolated by cation exchange chromatography. The sites of attachment of the aldehyde were the free amino groups of the N-terminal valine residues of the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin. Derivatization of the beta chains caused a greater increase in the acidity of the hemoglobin than did derivatization of the alpha chains. Derivatization of the beta chains was also preferred over that of the alpha chains. Acetaldehyde derivatives of the N-terminal octapeptide of hemoglobin S (beta sT-1 peptide), Val-Gly-Gly, and tetraglycine were formed readily, contained 1 M eq of acetaldehyde/mol of peptide, and were not reduced by sodium borohydride. In contrast, Ala-Pro-Gly failed to form a 1:1 adduct with acetaldehyde. 13C NMR analysis of the peptide adducts formed with [1,2-13C]acetaldehyde indicated that tetrahedral diastereomeric derivatives were produced. The 13C chemical shifts of the adducts formed between hemoglobin and [1,2-13C]acetaldehyde were identical to those of the peptide adducts although resonances from the individual diastereomeric adducts at each hemoglobin site could not be resolved. The results cited above as well as other evidence indicate that acetaldehyde reacts with the amino termini of hemoglobin to form stable cyclic imidazolidinone derivatives. An exchange of acetaldehyde residues between peptides was also documented."
https://openalex.org/W1572816190,"Abstract recA protein, in the presence of adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate, formed stable complexes with single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotides between 9 and 20 residues in length but not with those 8-residues long. The binding of recA protein to a 15-mer and 20-mer completely protected the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid from digestion by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I and protected the 5'-terminal phosphate from cleavage by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Ethylation of the phosphate backbone at any position by ethylnitrosourea blocked the binding of recA protein to the 15-mer but not to the 20-mer. Ethylation of phosphates near the ends of the 15-mer interfered less, suggesting a minimum binding site requirement. In contrast to the protection of the nucleic acid backbone, recA protein did not protect the N-7 position of guanine or the N-3 position of adenine from methylation by dimethyl sulfate, but rather enhanced the methylation of guanine. These results indicate that recA protein binds primarily to the phosphate backbone of single-stranded DNA, leaving the bases free for homologous pairing. We present a model for the organization of the presynaptic filament."
https://openalex.org/W1530650925,"Cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells display an increase in production of type I and type III collagen as a function of the number of days in second passage (Beldekas, J. C., Gerstenfeld, L. C., Sonenshein, G. E., and Franzblau, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12552-12556). In this study, we report that the regulation of these events is highly complex and relates to the growth state of the cells. Cultures, seeded at 1.5 X 10(6) cells/75-cm2 flask, produced very little collagenous protein early when the cells were proliferating rapidly. As they approached confluence at day 6, collagen synthesis began to increase. Maximal collagen synthesis was observed at day 14. In contrast, the levels of the mRNAs for type I and type III collagen increased only up to the 10th day and thereafter decreased. Cell-free translation analyses indicated that the translational activity of the collagen mRNAs was increasing over the time course. These results suggest that both translational and pretranslational sites are involved in the control of collagen production by aortic smooth muscle cells, and that collagen synthesis is inversely related to the proliferative state of the cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1607602270,"The intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded bichromophoric tetrapyrrole pigments, bilirubin-IX alpha and mesobilirubin-XIII alpha, adopt either of two folded, intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded, enantiomeric conformations which are in dynamic equilibrium in solution. Added human serum albumin binds preferentially, although not necessarily exclusively, to one conformational enantiomer, and the solutions exhibit bisignate circular dichroism Cotton effects in the region of the pigment's long wavelength electronic transition. In contrast, the bichromophoric tetrapyrrole pigment mesobilirubin-IV alpha, which is incapable of adopting intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded folded conformations, and the monochromophoric pyrromethenone, xanthobilirubic acid, show only monosignate induced circular dichroism Cotton effects under the same conditions. Application of exciton coupling theory indicates a preference for complexation of the right-handed (or positive) chirality conformational enantiomer of bilirubin-IX alpha or mesobilirubin-XIII alpha to human serum albumin at physiologic pH."
https://openalex.org/W1575103504,"A method for immobilizing protein crystals has been devised for determining face growth rates, and used to investigate the growth kinetics of hen egg white lysozyme crystals. Growth rates were determined at 22 degrees C in 0.1 M sodium acetate, 5% NaCl, pH 4.0, on the visually identified (110) face of tetragonal lysozyme crystals. Protein concentrations ranged from 13 to 57 mg/ml (saturation concentration = 1.7 mg/ml). Growth rate data were fit to the equation R = kappa sigma ri, where R = rate in cm/s; kappa = constant; sigma i = solute growth interface supersaturation; and r = rate dependence upon super-saturation, with the result that kappa = 0.146 X 10(-8) cm/s and r = 2.0. A model of the growth process was developed and the experimental data were used to determine the relative roles of transport and interfacial kinetics in the growth of this crystal. Values for the width of the boundary layer delta, the interfacial concentration Ci, and growth rate R were determined. The model may be used to extrapolate to other growth conditions. The relative role of transport and interfacial kinetics can be expressed by the coefficient gamma = (CB - Ci)/(CB - Cs), when CB is the bulk concentration and Cs the saturation. Values for gamma were found to range from much less than 0.1 for submicron-size crystals to approximately 0.15 for cm sizes. The results indicate that attachment or surface effects are rate-limiting in lysozyme crystal growth in Earth's gravity because solutal convection always provides more transport of solute than can be accommodated by the interface. In order to grow such crystals under transport limiting conditions, it would be necessary to suppress this solutal convection."

Here, we show that the DNA that flanks the 5'-end of the cytochrome P1-450 gene contains at least two discrete TCDD-responsive domains. Each domain has properties analogous to those of transcriptional enhancers. Each domain requires TCDD-receptor complexes for its function. There is no significant nucleotide sequence homology between the two TCDD-responsive domains."
https://openalex.org/W1621863752,"The isozymic forms of maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (P-enolpyruvate carboxylase) involved in photosynthetic CO2 fixation were shown by protein gel blot analysis to consist of 100-kDa subunits. The nonautotrophic isoform found in roots is comprised of 96-kDa subunits and is about 50-100-fold less prevalent. Further analysis of P-enolpyruvate carboxylase isoforms made use of cloned cDNA probes. Two cDNA clones were isolated from a library constructed from maize leaf poly(A) RNA. The largest clone was complementary to about 25% of P-enolpyruvate carboxylase mRNA, which is 3.4 kilobases in length. The quantity of P-enolpyruvate carboxylase mRNA in green, mature leaf tissue was estimated to be 0.20% of poly(A) RNA, whereas P-enolpyruvate carboxylase mRNA in roots was about 100-fold less prevalent. We used thermal denaturation of a P-enolpyruvate carboxylase cDNA probe hybridized to RNA gel blots to estimate the degree of sequence difference between mRNAs encoding different P-enolpyruvate carboxylase isoforms. There appear to be at least two prevalent P-enolpyruvate carboxylase mRNAs in green leaves which are significantly different in sequence, as are P-enolpyruvate carboxylase mRNAs in roots and shoots. The hybridization pattern of maize genomic DNA Southern blots indicates that P-enolpyruvate carboxylase is encoded by a small gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1588996416,"The antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGP) of polar fish have the ability to depress the freezing temperature of water approximately 500 times the amount expected based on the number of AFGP molecules in solution; yet AFGP solutions have a purely colligative melting point depression. The difference of solution melting and freezing temperatures is the antifreeze activity of AFGP. One characteristic of AFGP activity that requires further examination is the effect of concentration on antifreeze activity, especially whether the activity saturates at high concentrations or the measured activity increases ad infinitum. This study first surveys the activity of the various antifreeze components from both Pagothenia borchgrevinki and the Arg-containing antifreeze glycoprotein from Eleginus gracilis (EgAF). It was found that all AFGP components examined have a plateau in activity at high concentration, but the actual value of the plateau activity differs between the different length AFGP components and between AFGP and EgAF. While the low molecular weight components of both AFGP and EgAF lose activity at deep supercooling, at high concentration activity is restored. The activity data is then shown to fit a reversible kinetic model of AFGP activity, and the coefficients obtained are used to compare the activity differences between AFGP components and between AFGP and EgAF. The model is also shown to describe the activity of the antifreeze protein of the fish Pseudopleuronectes americanus and the thermal hysteresis protein of the insect, Tenebrio molitor."
https://openalex.org/W1537636330,"The involvement of cytochrome b561, an integral membrane protein, in electron transfer across chromaffin-vesicle membranes is confirmed by changes in its redox state observed as changes in the absorption spectrum occurring during electron transfer. In ascorbate-loaded chromaffin-vesicle ghosts, cytochrome b561 is nearly completely reduced and exhibits an absorption maximum at 561 nm. When ferricyanide is added to a suspension of these ghosts, the cytochrome becomes oxidized as indicated by the disappearance of the 561 nm absorption. If a small amount of ferricyanide is added, it becomes completely reduced by electron transfer from intravesicular ascorbate. When this happens, cytochrome b561 returns to its reduced state. If an excess of ferricyanide is added, the intravesicular ascorbate becomes exhausted and the cytochrome b561 remains oxidized. The spectrum of these absorbance changes correlates with the difference spectrum (reduced-oxidized) of cytochrome b561. Cytochrome b561 becomes transiently oxidized when ascorbate oxidase is added to a suspension of ascorbate-loaded ghosts. Since dehydroascorbate does not oxidize cytochrome b561, it is likely that oxidation is caused by semidehydroascorbate generated by ascorbate oxidase acting on free ascorbate. This suggests that cytochrome b561 can reduce semidehydroascorbate and supports the hypothesis that the function of cytochrome b561 in vivo is to transfer electrons into chromaffin vesicles to reduce internal semidehydroascorbate to ascorbate."

https://openalex.org/W1527188466,"Cyclic and acyclic analogs of tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) are evaluated in a study of the active site of succinyl-CoA:tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase. In addition to the natural substrate, THDPA, one cyclic and several acyclic compounds are also succinylated. 2-Hydroxytetrahydropyran-2,6-dicarboxylic acid is a potent competitive inhibitor having a Kis of 58 nM. Based on the results of this study, a stereochemical model for the succinylation of THDPA is proposed. The major features of this model are as follows. 1) The succinylase binds THDPA (L-configuration). 2) Hydration of the imine group follows to give 2-hydroxypiperidine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid in which the two carboxyl groups are trans. 3) Succinylation then occurs and the ring opens to give the acyclic product. It is suggested that 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran-2,6-dicarboxylic acid is a transition state analog by virtue of the fact that it structurally resembles the hydrated intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1562686170,"Abstract A procedure was devised to determine whether in the stimulated chromaffin cell phosphate is incorporated into specific proteins (chromobindins) that bind to chromaffin granule membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Cells were preincubated with 32P-labeled orthophosphate, then challenged with secretory stimuli. A postmicrosomal supernatant fraction was prepared from the cells and incubated with unlabeled chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+. Proteins that bound to the membranes were isolated by centrifugation and examined for 32P content by electrophoresis and autoradiography. Stimulation by carbamylcholine, nicotine, 56 mM K+, or 2 mM Ba2+ led to the incorporation of 32P into a 37-kDa protein that had previously been characterized as a substrate for protein kinase C in vitro (chromobindin 9, or CB9; Summers, T. A., and Creutz, C. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2437-2443). Incorporation of 32P into this protein was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and followed a time course that paralleled secretion of catecholamines, returning to base-line levels after 30 min, when secretion terminated. 32P was also incorporated into a 58-kDa protein that may be tyrosine hydroxylase and into an unidentified 28-kDa protein in response to cell stimulation, but neither of these proteins bound to granule membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, an activator of protein kinase C, led to 32P incorporation into the 37-kDa protein that was only 30% of the level obtained with nicotinic stimulation, suggesting that additional kinases may be involved in phosphorylating this protein in the stimulated cell."

This enzyme is cytosolic and is found at high levels in tissues with high levels of calmodulin and at low levels in tissues with little calmodulin. In liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, which have low levels of calmodulin and very low calmodulin N-methyltransferase activity (a low ratio of calmodulin N-methyltransferase to calmodulin), calmodulin was found to be incompletely methylated, as judged by its ability to act as a substrate for purified calmodulin N-methyltransferase. Calmodulin N-methyltransferase was purified 470-fold with a 33% yield from rat testis cytosol, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, CM-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100. At pH 7.4, calmodulin N-methyltransferase did not bind to DEAE-cellulose, but bound strongly to CM-Sepharose. The enzyme eluted from Sephadex G-100 with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000. Purified calmodulin N-methyltransferase was incubated with extracts of rat tissues, and [methyl-3H]AdoMet and methylated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in an attempt to discover substances other than calmodulin, but this enzyme only catalyzed the methylation of calmodulin, indicating a high degree of substrate specificity. Conditions were established for the in vitro preparative methylation of des(methyl)-calmodulin from Dictyostelium discoideum. Three moles of methyl/mol of calmodulin were incorporated into lysine 115 of des(methyl)calmodulin, resulting in the formation of 1 mol of trimethyllysine at the site normally methylated in calmodulins from most species. Activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase by des(methyl)calmodulin was indistinguishable from activation by in vitro methylated or sham methylated Dictyostelium calmodulin, indicating that methylation does not affect the ability of calmodulin to activate this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1481568614,"The polypeptides of mouse B16 melanoma lines of defined metastatic potential have been analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Parent B16 melanoma and two independently isolated B16-F1 lines, which are low metastatic, exhibited a new polypeptide, Ax (pI 5.2; Mr = 43,000), comprising approximately 30% of the total actin, in addition to normal beta- and gamma-actin. The Ax is present in the Triton-insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix) as well as in the Triton-soluble fraction at a constant ratio of about 0.5 to beta- plus gamma-actin. The Ax polypeptide has been identified as a variant form of actin by immunostaining with anti-actin antibody and by a comparison of its tryptic patterns with those produced by beta- and gamma-actin polypeptides; the Ax is also identified as a component of microfilaments. On the other hand, the Ax polypeptide disappears or its expression is very low in high metastatic lines, two independently isolated B16-F10s and B16-BL6. By in vitro translation, we have identified the mRNA species that code for Ax in B16-F1, but not in B16-F10."
https://openalex.org/W1837796673,"Four different preparations of rabbit and goat anti-Z-DNA antibodies were examined to determine the effects of antibody binding on the B-DNA-Z-DNA equilibrium. One of the four antibodies, a goat IgG, caused a marked lowering in the ionic strength required for the B-DNA to Z-DNA transition in poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC), shifting the midpoint from 2.25 to 2.0 M NaCl. This IgG had a more prominent high affinity antibody population than did the other goat IgG, which caused little change in the midpoint of this transition. The presence of anti-Z-DNA antibodies also reduced the degree of negative supercoiling required for the formation of Z-DNA in (dG-dC)n sequences inserted into closed circular plasmid DNA. The goat IgG with the more marked effect on the salt-induced transition also had a greater effect in favoring Z-DNA formation in negatively supercoiled plasmids. A shift toward Z-DNA formation was observed in circular dichroism measurements upon antibody binding to poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) in very low ionic strength solution as well. We propose that the stabilization of Z-DNA by antibody binding in poly(dG-dC) X poly(dG-dC) occurs cooperatively, several antibody molecules binding to a single polymer molecule and stabilizing the entire molecule in Z-DNA through their combined binding energies. The stabilization of Z-DNA by antibody binding in a supercoiled plasmid can be significant, and failure to consider this effect and to choose appropriate conditions for measurement can lead to errors in estimating when Z-DNA will form in response to negative supercoiling."
https://openalex.org/W1499622424,"To date all hyaluronic acid synthetic systems have been of a particulate nature, and attempts at solubilization have been unsuccessful. This has hampered attempts to elucidate the mechanism by which hyaluronic acid is produced. In this paper we demonstrate that the hyaluronic acid synthetic activity from group C streptococcal membranes was solubilized using 2% digitonin and that the activity was optimized by reconstitution with cardiolipin at an optimum phospholipid/protein ratio (microgram/microgram) of 5:1. Furthermore, chromatography of the solubilized synthetase demonstrated that it eluted after the void volume of a Sepharose CL-6B column. CHAPSO, octyl glucopyranoside, sodium cholate, Triton X-100, and zwittergent 314 either inhibited or failed to solubilize the synthetic activity. Phospholipids other than cardiolipin also reconstituted the activity from the digitonin extract, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In our system, the specific activity of hyaluronic acid synthetase was increased up to 63 times that of the system of the intact membrane. Furthermore, the total activity of the reconstituted system was 4.9 times greater than that of intact membranes. The soluble enzyme system showed similarities to the membrane-bound synthetase in the kinetics of production of trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble hyaluronic acid, and the hyaluronic acid produced was of comparable molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W2402426790,"The site of in vitro ADP-ribosylation of seminal ribonuclease was determined. Seminal enzyme was found to be a good receptor of [14C]ADP-ribose residues under the reaction conditions used. The recovery of [14C]ADP-ribosylated RNase was about 65% after purification. After tryptic digestion of modified enzyme, a fraction containing [14C]ADP-ribosylated peptides was separated from the others by ion-exchange chromatography on M82 resin. Radioactive peptides were then purified by affinity chromatography on anti-poly(ADP-ribose)IgG-Sepharose. High performance liquid chromatography of a mixture obtained after pronase digestion of purified ADP-ribosylated peptides revealed only one radioactive peptide whose amino acid composition corresponded to a peptide that has equimolar quantities of aspartic acid, serine, and glycine. Carboxypeptidase Y digestion of this peptide showed that its amino acid sequence was Asp-Ser-Gly. Only position 14-16 of seminal RNase corresponded to this sequence. The chemical stability of the ADP-ribose/enzyme linkage indicated that aspartic acid 14 is the modification site in seminal RNase."
https://openalex.org/W1497670646,"Dissociation of the 10 S androgen receptor to 8, 6, and 4.5 S forms was dependent on temperature, the reducing and ionic environment, and the binding of androgen. The [3H]dihydrotestosterone-labeled 10 S receptor was observed at low ionic strength using rat Dunning prostate tumor cytosol freshly prepared in the absence of an exogenous sulfhydryl reducing agent. Addition of mercaptoethanol caused 10 S receptor dissociation to 8 S following incubation at 0 degrees C for 30 min, to 6 S after a 30-min incubation at 23 degrees C at low ionic strength, and to 4.5 S at high ionic strength. Mercaptoethanol-induced dissociation required binding of [3H]dihydrotestosterone. Treatment with cupric phenanthroline, a disulfide-forming reagent, stabilized the 10 S receptor in 0.4 M KCl, but the receptor remained sensitive to dissociation by mercaptoethanol. Zn2+ (25 microM) and sodium molybdate (10 mM) also stabilized the 10 S receptor. A Stokes radius of 96 +/- 5 A was determined for the 10 S receptor by Sepharose-6B chromatography, with a calculated Mr of 396,000. The 10 S receptor was not retained by DNA-Sepharose, while dissociated forms displayed binding affinity for DNA. It is proposed that the 10 S receptor represents the nontransformed androgen receptor, composed of the 4.5 S steroid binding units plus a nonsteroid binding protein, perhaps in a tetrameric configuration. Binding of dihydrotestosterone appears to sensitize the 10 S receptor to disulfide bond reduction, resulting in transformation by subunit dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1503442903,"Studies were conducted on four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-containing fractions: purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-protein X-kinase subcomplex (E2.X.K), a kinase fraction (K fraction) prepared from the E2.X.K subcomplex, and a kinase fraction generated by limited trypsin-digestion of E2.X.K. We characterized the gel electrophoresis properties of dissociated subunits (one-dimensional and two-dimensional), the catalytic and ATP binding properties of kinase-containing fractions, and the subunit requirements for kinase binding to and being activated by the transacetylase-protein X subcomplex (E2.X). A significant portion of protein X was retained with the transacetylase core following release of virtually all the kinase. The K fraction had four major bands separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis which corresponded to the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, protein X, the trypsin-resistant catalytic subunit of the kinase and a chymotrypsin-resistant subunit which had a high pI and comigrated in one-dimensional systems with the chymotrypsin-sensitive alpha-subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase component. While purified kidney complex contained only about three molecules of kinase (determined by [14C]ATP binding), one molecule of E2.X subcomplex activated a large number (greater than 15) molecules of kinase associated with the protein X-containing K fraction. Sephadex G-200 chromatography of the K fraction in the presence of dithiothreitol led to coelution of protein X and kinase subunits. Limited trypsin digestion converted the transacetylase into subdomains and cleaved protein X and the high pI subunit of the kinase. Under those conditions, the intact catalytic subunit of the kinase did not bind to the large inner domain of the transacetylase but could be activated by untreated E2.X subcomplex. Thus, binding of the catalytic subunit of the kinase and its activation by E2.X required either protein X or the lipoyl-bearing outer domain of the transacetylase. In combination, our results suggest that protein X serves to anchor the kinase to the core of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1573675707,"The rate of translocation of newly synthesized acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic cytosol of Torpedo electric organ nerve terminals into synaptic vesicles and the extent to which ACh release from these neurons is mediated by a vesicular mechanism were investigated. For this purpose the compound 2(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol (AH5183), which inhibits the active transport of ACh into isolated cholinergic synaptic vesicles, was employed. Preincubation of purified Torpedo nerve terminals (synaptosomes) with AH5183 does not affect the intraterminal synthesis of [3H]ACh but results in a marked inhibition (85%) of its Ca2+-dependent K+-evoked release. By contrast, the evoked release of the endogenous nonlabeled ACh is not affected by this compound. When AH5183 is added during radiolabeling, it causes a progressively smaller inhibition of [3H]ACh release which is completely abolished if the drug is added after the preparation has been labeled. These findings suggest that most of the newly synthesized synaptosomal [3H]ACh (85%) is released by a vesicular mechanism and that some [3H]ACh (15%) may be released by a different process. The translocation of cytosolic [3H]ACh into the synaptic vesicles was monitored by determining the time course of the loss of susceptibility of [3H]ACh release to AH5183. It was found not to be coupled kinetically to [3H]ACh synthesis and to lag behind it. The nature of the intraterminal processes underlying this lag is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493509174,"An Arg-containing antifreeze glycoprotein from the polar fish Eleginus gracilis was isolated, and the major components were purified to homogeneity. The general protocol for purification was chromatography of serum on DEAE-cellulose, followed by chromatography on a cation exchanger. DEAE-cellulose chromatography resulted in two fractions, A and B. Fraction A contained most of the antifreeze glycoprotein found in E. gracilis (approximately 80% by weight) and consisted of 13 distinct components. Unlike antifreeze glycoproteins from other previously studied polar fish, Fraction A contained both low and high molecular weight antifreeze glycoprotein components. The two major components of Fraction A were sequenced and compared with the sequence of antifreeze glycoproteins 7 and 8 from both Boreogadus saida and Pagothenia borchgrevinki. The antifreeze glycoproteins from E. gracilis were shown to have a similar composition to those previously studied, except for an additional Ala-Arg dipeptide at the carbon terminal in the major components of Fraction A and the position of Pro in the low molecular weight components. The activity of E. gracilis antifreeze glycoproteins is the subject of a companion article (Burcham, T. S., Osuga, D. T., Yeh, Y., and Feeney, R. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6390-6397)."
https://openalex.org/W1559285908,"Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of flow cytometry in the analysis of dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) gene amplification. However, this powerful and potentially sensitive method for analyzing gene expression in individual cells has not seen widespread use. This is due in part to the difficulty of producing fluorescent methotrexate (Fluo-MTX), which is needed to label dihydrofolate reductase in vivo, in yields higher than 1% and of sufficient purity to give low nonspecific backgrounds by the published procedures. We have significantly improved the synthesis of Fluo-MTX to obtain rapidly a chromatographically pure product in 20% yields. In addition, we have found that cell volume is a variable which makes direct comparisons of fluorescence intensity between cell lines difficult. In order to circumvent this problem, we have improved flow cytometric analysis to measure the fluorescence specific intensity of individual cells. A survey of various cells commonly used for gene transfer shows a significant variability in the efficiency with which they are labeled with Fluo-MTX, which appears to be due to variations in their ability to transport this reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1496130682,"We have used the technique of DNA-mediated gene transfer to introduce dihydrofolate reductase genes into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. The transferred sequences include: dihydrofolate reductase minigenes, dihydrofolate reductase cDNA clones, and genomic DNA from mouse cells with highly amplified dihydrofolate reductase genes. The hamster cells were capable of utilizing the murine transcription initiation sites, splice junctions, and polyadenylation sites in complete murine dihydrofolate reductase genes. Only a short region of 5'-flanking sequence (160 base pairs (bp] was sufficient for proper initiation of dihydrofolate reductase transcription. In contrast only those clones with all of the dihydrofolate reductase introns and extensive (greater than 6.5 kilobase pairs) 3'-flanking regions utilized the dihydrofolate reductase polyadenylylation sites. Four of nine clones tested regulate the transfected genes normally, synthesizing dihydrofolate reductase preferentially at the onset of S phase. Regulated genes include one which entirely lacks intervening sequences, two with fewer than 420 bp of 5'-flanking sequence, and two in which polyadenylylation occurs predominantly in the adjacent hamster sequences. Two of the five cell lines which do not exhibit normal regulation contain genes which appear to be transcribed primarily from promoters present in the flanking hamster DNA. The other genes which fail to regulate do not appear to differ significantly in the structure of their transcripts or protein products from genes which regulate normally. We conclude that only the coding sequences, a region of less than 340 bp of sequence 5' of the translation initiation codon, and a short region of 3'-flanking sequence are required for regulated production of dihydrofolate reductase. The regulation can be abolished, however, by unknown properties of the site of insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1553015926,"Abstract Phycocyanobilin (PCB) peptides alpha-1 PCB and beta-2T PCB were obtained by proteolytic degradation of Synechococcus 6301 C-phycocyanin. These peptides were found to have the following sequences. alpha-1 PCB Cys(PCB)-Ala-Arg beta-2T PCB Ile-Thr-Gln-Gly-Asp-Cys(PCB)-Ser-Ala. The peptides were examined by 1H NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The 1H NMR data confirmed that in each case the bilin was attached through a single linkage, a thioether bond between the cysteinyl residue and the tetrapyrrole moiety. Comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of these peptides with those of appropriate model compounds showed that the thioether linkage in alpha-1 PCB was to the C-3' position and that in beta-2T PCB to the C-18' position on the bilin. Refluxing in neutral methanol under nitrogen led to the release of PCB from alpha-1 PCB but did not release the D-ring-linked tetrapyrrole from beta-2T. The above results together with those of an earlier study (Lagarias, J. C., Glazer, A. N., and Rapoport, H. (1979) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 101, 5030-5037) complete the determination of the mode of linkage of each of the three bilins on C-phycocyanin; two are linked through ring A and one through ring D. This is the first documented report of a singly D-ring-linked bilin."
https://openalex.org/W1519145409,"Conditions have been found for the isolation of rat liver nuclei which maintain chromatin in its native state and suppresses endogenous nuclease activity. Chromatin prepared in this way can be dispersed into buffers containing various concentrations of monovalent or divalent cations so that the 30-nm fiber is either totally or partially decondensed. When probed with micrococcal nuclease, the digestion profiles show that although the 30-nm fiber can be cleaved periodically to generate superbead-like particles this only occurs under certain ionic conditions when the fiber is partially decondensed. It is likely that this cleavage pattern reflects the transient exposure of specific nuclease sensitive sites as the 30-nm fiber condenses, rather than the existence of a specific subunit of a beaded 30-nm fiber. The periodicity of these nuclease-sensitive sites appear to be related to the asymmetric distribution of histone H1 molecules along the length of the fiber."
https://openalex.org/W1499783330,"Substitution of a methylene group for the C-3 oxygen in androstenedione, testosterone, and the corresponding 19-hydroxy and 19-oxo derivatives results in a new category of inhibitors of estrogen biosynthesis by human placental microsomes. The inhibition is of the competitive type with the most effective inhibitors being the 17-ketonic compounds, 3-methyleneandrost-4-en-17-one, 19-hydroxy-3-methyleneandrost-4-en-17-one, and 3-methylene-19-oxoandrost-4-en-17-one with apparent Ki values of 4.7, 13, and 24 nM, respectively. The 3-methylene derivatives of androstenedione and 19-hydroxyandrostenedione were effective substrates for the placental microsomal 17 beta-hydroxy-steroid oxidoreductase but were only marginally hydroxylated at the C-19 position to the respective 19-hydroxy and 19-oxo derivatives. The 3-methylene analogs are thus competitive inhibitors of aromatization but are not substrates for this enzyme complex. Time-dependent inhibition of aromatization by 10 beta-difluoromethylestr-4-ene-3,17-dione and 10 beta-(2-propynyl)estr-4-ene,3,17-dione was abolished by substitution of a methylene function for the C-3 oxygen, suggesting that the presence of an oxygen at C-3 is required for an oxidative transformation at C-19, an initial step in aromatization. The essential role of the C-19 hydroxylation in aromatization is supported by the observation that the 3-methylene derivatives of 19-hydroxy- and 19-oxoandrostenedione showed time-dependent inhibition, but the corresponding 19-methyl compound did not. The 3-methylene androgens are potent inhibitors of placental aromatization but are themselves only marginal substrates for the enzyme. Their high affinity for and inertness to the placental aromatase complex makes them valuable probes of the aromatization process."
https://openalex.org/W1522933116,"Rat liver glycine methyltransferase is inactivated by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) in a pseudo-first order fashion at pH 7.5. The addition of dithiothreitol (20 mM) to the reaction mixture results in partial restoration of enzyme activity. A semilog plot of residual activity after dithiothreitol reactivation versus time is also linear, indicating that at least two essential residues are present on the enzyme and the modification of either of which causes total loss of activity. The inactivation is accompanied by incorporation of the radiolabel from adenine-labeled FSBA, but the amount of radioactivity fixed is not altered upon treatment with dithiothreitol. From this fact and the stoichiometry between the loss of dithiothreitol-sensitive activity and the number of sulfhydryl groups disappeared, it is suggested that the dithiothreitol-sensitive inactivation is the consequence of the FSBA-mediated formation of a disulfide between two sulfhydryl groups in close proximity. Although 4 mol of reagent are covalently bound per enzyme subunit, the kinetics of modification and inactivation show that the reaction at 1 residue, which is identified as tyrosine, is responsible for the dithiothreitol-insensitive inactivation. The substrate S-adenosylmethionine provides complete protection against both types of inactivation, but the dithiothreitol-insensitive inactivation is protected much more effectively with a Kd value comparable to the Km value. This suggests that the tyrosine is located at or near the active site of the methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1483439037,"A novel protein has been purified from fetal calf serum and from serum-free bovine aortic endothelial cell conditioned medium. This protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of reduced Mr 70,000 (70K protein) and was separated from bovine serum albumin and other proteins by ion-exchange chromatography and immunoabsorption on Sepharose-coupled anti-70K protein antiserum. The 70K protein was shown to be structurally and immunologically distinct from bovine serum albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, and vitronectin by one- and two-dimensional peptide mapping, amino acid analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or immunoblotting. The 70K protein was located in endothelial cell cytoplasmic granules of irregular size and distribution. Metabolic radiolabeling studies showed that the 70K protein was not a biosynthetic product of these cells; its cytoplasmic location was due to a selective uptake from the fetal calf serum in which the cells were initially grown. After subconfluent cultures of endothelial cells were shifted to serum-free medium, nearly 80% of the total 70K protein that was measurable in the medium was released between 0 and 20 min. Moreover, sparse, rapidly proliferating cells released approximately 18-fold more 70K protein within 2 min as compared to dense, nonproliferating cultures. The concentration of 70K protein in fetal calf serum was estimated to be 400-600 micrograms/ml. Proliferating bovine aortic endothelial cells, 24 h after plating at an intermediate density, released approximately 250 pg of 70K protein/cell within the first 20 min after exposure to serum-free conditions. The data provide evidence for a novel protein in serum which is selectively internalized by endothelial cells in vitro and which in turn is released rapidly under conditions such as osmotic imbalance due to serum removal, or during periods of cellular proliferation, conditions which we term culture shock."
https://openalex.org/W1530498600,"We have determined the primary structure of a delta 5-3-oxosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B. The enzyme is a dimeric protein of two identical subunits, each consisting of a polypeptide chain of 131 residues and a Mr = 14,536. The intact S-carboxymethyl protein was sequenced from the NH2 terminus using standard automated Edman degradation and automated Edman degradation using fluorescamine treatment at known prolines to suppress background. The isomerase was fragmented using CNBr, trypsin, iodosobenzoic acid, and acid cleavage at aspartyl-prolyl peptide bonds. The peptides resulting from each fragmentation were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The full sequence was deduced by the overlapping of the various peptides. A search for homologous proteins was performed. Only the oxosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas testosteroni, an expected homology, was found to be similar. Comparison of the two proteins shows that the region of strongest homology is the region containing the aspartic acid at which steroidal affinity and photoaffinity reagents have been shown to react in the P. testosteroni isomerase. The P. putida isomerase contains 3 cysteines and 2 tryptophans, whereas the P. testosteroni isomerase lacks these amino acids. The two proteins are not highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1526606271,"Abstract A DNA primase was partially purified from rat liver mitochondria and separated from the bulk of DNA polymerase gamma and mtRNA polymerase by heparin-agarose chromatography. The primase was distinguished from mtRNA polymerase by its response to pH, monoand divalent cations, and ATP concentrations. In the absence of an active DNA polymerase and using poly(dT) as template, primase synthesized mixed polynucleotide products consisting of units of oligo(A) 1-12 alternating with units of oligo(dA)25-40. Contributions to these products by contaminating DNA polymerase gamma were eliminated by the addition of dideoxy-ATP. Addition of 50 microM dATP to the primase reaction caused a 50% inhibition of AMP incorporation as compared to reactions containing low levels of dATP present only as a contaminant of the ATP added. The inhibition was due primarily to a reduction of new chain initiations. The dATP did not lock the primase reaction into the DNA mode of synthesis since the proportion of internal and 3'-terminal RNA segments was little affected. However, the addition of both 50 microM dATP and exogenous DNA polymerase to the primase reaction greatly reduced the amount of internal and 3'-terminal RNA segments, presumably due to the displacement of primase by DNA polymerase. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis (Hu, S.-Z., Wang, T.S.-F., and Korn, D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2602-2609) that the physiologically significant primer is a mixed 5'-oligoribonucleotide-3'-oligodeoxyribonucleotide and that the formation of the RNA to DNA junction is inherently a primase function."
https://openalex.org/W2102934398,"The role of hemin in the maintenance of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates was examined by comparing the effects of various porphyrins and metalloporphyrins on the protein kinase activity of the hemin-controlled repressor and on protein synthesis. The porphyrin requirements for maintenance of protein synthesis were relatively specific. Iron and cobalt metalloporphyrins sustained protein synthesis whereas other metalloporphyrins, metal-deficient porphyrins, and non-porphyrin precursor and degradation products of protoporphyrin IX were ineffective. These same compounds were examined for their effectiveness in inhibiting the protein kinase activity of the hemin-controlled repressor with initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Most of the metalloporphyrins and porphyrins tested were inhibitory. The presence of the iron atom in the porphyrin was not essential for inhibition, but the maintenance of the integrity of the porphyrin ring was imperative. The porphyrins which inhibited the hemin-regulated protein kinase contained vinyl groups or ethyl groups, or were protonated in the 2- and 4-positions of the porphyrin ring, whereas those with bulky or acidic groups in these positions were ineffective. Precursor and degradation products of protoporphyrin IX and synthetic porphyrins modified at other positions had no effect on the enzyme. Both hemin and protoporphyrin IX inhibited phosphorylation of eIF-2 exogenously added to a reticulocyte lysate; however, hemin sustained protein synthesis in the lysate, whereas protoporphyrin IX did not. These results suggest that regulation of the protein kinase phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eIF-2 is not the only point at which hemin modulates protein synthesis in reticulocytes and reticulocyte lysates, since a correlation between inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of protein kinase activity, and phosphorylation of eIF-2 is not observed with all porphyrins."
https://openalex.org/W1504245566,"Net glucose uptake in a perfusion system including erythrocytes and isolated livers from fed rats was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a competitive inhibitor of glucokinase. Net glucose uptake also occurred in the system incorporating livers from 48-h fasted rats, but its inhibition by GlcNAc did not. This distinction could not be explained on the basis of a different sensitivity of glucokinase from fasted compared with fed rats to inhibition by GlcNAc. Nor could it be rationalized based on several other hepatic enzymes possibly involved in glucose utilization or production. Because erythrocytes were included in our system, other explanations were sought related to the total enzymic environment. The involvement of an indirect pathway including glycolysis of glucose to lactate in erythrocytes followed by conversion of this lactate to glucose-6-P and then glycogen in liver was considered. This pathway contributed no more than 17% to total net glucose uptake in the system incorporating livers from fed rats. This per cent contribution increased when hepatic glucokinase was reduced by fasting or through inhibition by GlcNAc. However, it was too small to explain observed overall rates of net glucose uptake. We propose that the presence of erythrocytes may also promote a greater net glucose uptake by the direct hepatic pathway. An enhanced inhibition of hepatic glucose-6-P hydrolysis by some intermediate metabolite generated in the presence of lactate infusion from erythrocytes may promote net glucose uptake independently of the mechanism of residual hepatic glucose phosphorylation. This may explain why we and others who have employed liver perfusion systems including erythrocytes have seen greater net glucose uptake than have workers using systems devoid of erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1482907175,"Bile acid-CoA:glycine-taurine N-acyltransferase was found to catalyze a reaction in the absence of glycine or taurine in which the substrate cholyl-CoA is cleaved with the release of CoA and the formation of a covalently bound enzyme-cholate intermediate. This unstable intermediate was trapped by a rapid mixing and denaturation procedure. The denatured protein was digested with trypsin and the cholate-labeled tryptic peptide was isolated. This cholate-peptide is considered to originate from the active site region of the enzyme based on the following criteria: cholyl-CoA does not react with any of the 20 common amino acids, the hydrolysis of cholyl-CoA is known to occur on the enzyme, the lack of reaction of the enzyme with just cholate, and the fact that labeling is extensive even at low (substrate level) concentrations of cholyl-CoA. The isolated cholate-peptide was submitted to amino acid analysis. It contained 32 amino acid residues and was devoid of cysteine, methionine, and tyrosine. Amino acid analysis of the N-acyltransferase was conducted. The enzyme was also shown to possess a blocked N terminus."

Purification was by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). [14C-ribosyl]3-Deazaguanosine was metabolized by Chinese hamster ovary cells to two metabolites, one major and one minor, eluting in the triphosphate region after HPLC analysis, and appeared to be incorporated into perchloric acid-insoluble material. Cell line TGR-3, deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) and resistant to 3-deazaguanine, also formed both metabolites. Line TGR-1/DGRR-9, deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and resistant to both 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaguanosine, formed greatly reduced levels of the major metabolite. 3-Deazaguanosine 5'-triphosphate, prepared enzymically from authentic 3-deazaguanosine 5'-monophosphate, co-eluted with the major metabolite peak during HPLC analysis. Treatment of a metabolite-containing extract with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) resulted in the formation of 3-deazaguanosine. These observations indicate that 3-deazaguanosine can be metabolized, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, to the triphosphate derivative in lieu of the action of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1533816238,"The effect of temperature, urea, guanidine HCl, ionic and nonionic detergents, organic solvents, chaotropic salts, pH, and divalent cations has been investigated on purified human histocompatibility antigens solubilized by papain (HLApap) or solubilized by sodium cholate (HLAchol). HLApap and HLAchol are fairly stable proteins to agents acting predominantly on hydrogen bonds (temperature, urea) or hydrophobic forces (ionic and nonionic detergents). However, agents which affect ionic interactions (pH, salts, divalent cations) dissociate the molecules into subunits. A single binding site for beta 2-microglobulin with an affinity constant of 1.0 X 10(7) M-1 was found for the alpha chain of HLAchol. The dissociated subunits can be separated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-rabbit IgG anti-human beta 2-microglobulin and reassociate in vitro when incubated under the appropriate conditions. The results point toward an important role of ionic interactions between subunits in the stabilization of the quaternary structure of HLA."
