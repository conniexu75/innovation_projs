https://openalex.org/W2141260882,"A new family of highly fluorescent indicators has been synthesized for biochemical studies of the physiological role of cytosolic free Ca2+. The compounds combine an 8-coordinate tetracarboxylate chelating site with stilbene chromophores. Incorporation of the ethylenic linkage of the stilbene into a heterocyclic ring enhances the quantum efficiency and photochemical stability of the fluorophore. Compared to their widely used predecessor, quin2, the new dyes offer up to 30-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength not just intensity upon Ca2+ binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca2+, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca2+ over other divalent cations. These properties, particularly the wavelength sensitivity to Ca2+, should make these dyes the preferred fluorescent indicators for many intracellular applications, especially in single cells, adherent cell layers, or bulk tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2034440981,"Recent evidence indicates the existence of a genetic locus in chromosome region 13q14 that confers susceptibility to retinoblastoma, a cancer of the eye in children. A gene encoding a messenger RNA (mRNA) of 4.6 kilobases (kb), located in the proximity of esterase D, was identified as the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene on the basis of chromosomal location, homozygous deletion, and tumor-specific alterations in expression. Transcription of this gene was abnormal in six of six retinoblastomas examined: in two tumors, RB mRNA was not detectable, while four others expressed variable quantities of RB mRNA with decreased molecular size of about 4.0 kb. In contrast, full-length RB mRNA was present in human fetal retina and placenta, and in other tumors such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. DNA from retinoblastoma cells had a homozygous gene deletion in one case and hemizygous deletion in another case, while the remainder were not grossly different from normal human control DNA. The gene contains at least 12 exons distributed in a region of over 100 kb. Sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones yielded a single long open reading frame that could encode a hypothetical protein of 816 amino acids. A computer-assisted search of a protein sequence database revealed no closely related proteins. Features of the predicted amino acid sequence include potential metal-binding domains similar to those found in nucleic acid-binding proteins. These results provide a framework for further study of recessive genetic mechanisms in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1984353960,"DNA repair was measured in the dihydrofolate reductase gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells, amplified for the gene, by quantitating pyrimidine dimers with a specific UV-endonuclease. More than two thirds of the dimers had been removed from a 14.1 kb restriction fragment of the gene by 26 hr after irradiation (20 J/m2), while little removal was detected in fragments upstream of the gene and only 15% were removed from the genome overall. This suggests that damage processing can vary according to function or activity of affected sequences, which has general implications for correlations of DNA repair with survival and mutagenesis. Perhaps preferential repair of vital sequences facilitates UV-resistance of these cells despite low overall repair levels."

https://openalex.org/W1981814275,"Using a combination of a transient expression assay and in vitro mutagenesis, we showed previously that the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) is composed of a series of discrete functional domains. Here we report the effects of selective deletion of each of these domains on hGR ability to activate transcription of the MTV-CAT fusion gene. Deletion of the immunogenic domain or the entire amino-terminal half of the protein reduces but does not abolish the ability of the hGR to induce transcriptional activation. Somewhat surprisingly, deletion of the steroid-binding domain engenders a constitutively active receptor, revealing that this domain normally represses receptor function. However, the central, cysteine-rich region contains all the information required for both DNA binding and trans-activation. Taken together, these data delineate a core domain in the hGR spanning 88 amino acids that determines both DNA-binding and transcriptional activation functions. This physical linkage distinguishes the glucocorticoid receptor from other described eukaryotic regulatory proteins, where these two functions have been shown to be separable."
https://openalex.org/W1969299547,"Lipoprotein lipase is a key enzyme of lipid metabolism that acts to hydrolyze triglycerides, providing free fatty acids for cells and affecting the maturation of circulating lipoproteins. It has been proposed that the enzyme plays a role in the development of obesity and atherosclerosis. The human enzyme has been difficult to purify and its protein sequence was heretofore undetermined. A complementary DNA for human lipoprotein lipase that codes for a mature protein of 448 amino acids has now been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence indicates that human lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase are members of a gene family. Two distinct species of lipoprotein lipase messenger RNA that arise from alternative sites of 3'-terminal polyadenylation were detected in several different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2049816249,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found in the peripheral and central nervous system differ from those found at the neuromuscular junction. Recently we isolated a cDNA clone encoding the alpha subunit of a neuronal acetylcholine receptor expressed in both the peripheral and central nervous system. In this paper we report the isolation of a cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of a second acetylcholine receptor expressed in the central nervous system. Thus it is clear that there is a family of genes coding for proteins with sequence and structural homology to the alpha subunit of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Members of this gene family are expressed in different regions of the central nervous system and, presumably, code for subtypes of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2068120916,"The availability of cloned cDNAs encoding the four subunits of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor, which can be expressed to make functional receptors in Xenopus oocytes, has made possible a detailed investigation of the functions of the different structural components of the receptor. The functional analysis of receptors with α-subunits altered at specific sites by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA has allowed the location of specific regions of the α-subunit molecule involved in acetylcholine binding and forming a transmembrane ionic channel."
https://openalex.org/W2095249666,"A general method for modifying eukaryotic genes by site-specific mutagenesis and subsequent expression in mammalian cells was developed to study the relation between structure and function of the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. Glycine residues at positions 216 and 226 in the binding cavity of trypsin were replaced by alanine residues, resulting in three trypsin mutants. Computer graphic analysis suggested that these substitutions would differentially affect arginine and lysine substrate binding of the enzyme. Although the mutant enzymes were reduced in catalytic rate, they showed enhanced substrate specificity relative to the native enzyme. This increased specificity was achieved by the unexpected differential effects on the catalytic activity toward arginine and lysine substrates. Mutants containing alanine at position 226 exhibited an altered conformation that may be converted to a trypsin-like structure upon binding of a substrate analog."
https://openalex.org/W1987459045,"The three-dimensional structure of Sindbis virus, an enveloped animal virus, has been determined to a resolution of 35 A by using a common lines procedure to combine cryoelectron micrographs of vitrified particles. The spikes of the virus appear as columnar trimers arranged on a T=4 lattice. The lipid bilayer of the virus envelope is polyhedral and surrounds a smooth T=3 nucleocapsid. Hence, a complete Sindbis virion (molecular weight 46.4 X 10(6)) contains 240 copies of each of the spike proteins and 180 copies of the capsid protein. The arrangement of the spike proteins is complementary to that of the nucleocapsid. Two types of spike-capsid interactions are seen. Spike trimers near the fivefold axes interact tightly with triplets of capsid elements, whereas those on the threefold axes interact more loosely."
https://openalex.org/W1545471300,"Two deoxyoligonucleotide probes (23-mer and 26-mer) carrying deoxyinosine residues (I) at positions corresponding to ambiguous nucleotides derived from amino acid sequence have been synthesized by the phosphotriester method using a polymer support. The 23-mer and 26-mer corresponded to the mRNA for 8 amino acids from gastrin and 9 amino acids from cholecystokinin, respectively. The dIs have been used where the base in the third position of the amino acid codon is ambiguous. These deoxyoligonucleotides were used as probes for hybridization with colonies containing the corresponding cDNAs or genes. The hybrid formed between a gastrin clone and the 23-mer that harbors 5 dIs was dissociated at 50-55 degrees C, suggesting that deoxyinosine did not significantly effect the stabilization or destabilization of the DNA duplex. A similar result was obtained using the 26-mer that contains 5 dIs and a phage clone DNA of the cholecystokinin gene. Thus oligonucleotide probes with deoxyinosine residues at ambiguous points seem to be useful as hybridization probes for cloning genes for proteins containing amino acids with degenerate codons."

https://openalex.org/W2013146925,"The chemistry of antibody recognition was studied by mapping the antigenicity of the protein myohemerythrin with peptide homologs of the protein sequence. The results suggest that the entire protein surface is antigenic, but the probability of there being antibodies to a given site is influenced by local stereochemistry. Although accessible to an antibody binding domain, the least reactive positions cluster in the most tightly packed and least mobile regions and are closely associated with narrow, concave grooves in the molecular surface containing bound water molecules. The most frequently recognized sites form three-dimensional superassemblies characterized by high local mobility, convex surface shape, and often by negative electrostatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2071861078,"Recognition at the molecular level is a fundamental characteristic of biochemical systems. Recent models developed in bioorganic chemistry have revealed the importance of complementarity in size, shape, and functional groups in molecular recognition. Structures that feature a cleft are particularly effective in regard to complementarity since functional groups attached to the interior of the cleft converge on substrates held inside. The molecular clefts offer the advantage of efficient construction; their surfaces can be tailored for specific applications. This article describes their use for recognition of acids, bases, amino acids, metal ions, and neutral substrates. Their ability to provide microenvironments complementary to asymmetric molecules and their future promise are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2088202340,"Induction of cytochrome P1-450 has been linked to susceptibility to certain chemically induced cancers in mouse and man. Treatment of the human cell line MCF-7 with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) results in high levels of aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase (P1-450) activity. This cell line was used to isolate a human P1-450 full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) clone. The cDNA is 2566 nucleotides in length, encodes a polyadenylated messenger RNA (2.8 kilobases in length), and has a continuous reading frame producing a protein with 512 residues (molecular weight, 58,151). The human P1-450 cDNA and protein are 63 percent and 80 percent similar to mouse P1-450 cDNA and protein, respectively. Whereas the mouse TCDD-inducible P-450 gene subfamily has two members (P1-450 and P3-450), the human TCDD-inducible gene subfamily appears to have only one gene (P1-450)."
https://openalex.org/W2004302307,"Cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to determine insect cuticle composition and cross-link structure during sclerotization or tanning. Unsclerotized cuticle from newly ecdysed pupae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., had a high protein content with lesser amounts of lipid and chitin. Concentrations of chitin, protein, and catechol increased substantially as dehydration and sclerotization progressed. Analysis of intact cuticle specifically labeled with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 revealed direct covalent linkages between ring nitrogens of protein histidyl residues and ring carbons derived from the catecholamine dopamine. This carbon-nitrogen adduct was present in chitin isolated from cuticle by alkaline extraction and is probably bound covalently to chitin. These data support the hypothesis that the stiffening of insect cuticle during sclerotization results primarily from the deposition of protein and chitin polymers and their crosslinking by quinonoid derivatives of catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1993559627,"Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP), synthesized in Xenopus oocytes after injection of cloned NP cDNA, enters and accumulates in the nucleus. We have used in vitro mutagenesis of this cDNA to study the cellular distribution of mutated NP polypeptides. Mutants lacking amino acids 327–345 of wild-type NP enter the nucleus but do not accumulate there to the same extent as the wild-type protein, suggesting that this region has a role in nuclear accumulation. This possibility is further strengthened by similar studies involving the production of fusion proteins in which various amino-terminal sequences of the NP gene are fused to the complete chimpanzee α-globin sequence: when globin cDNA was injected into and expressed in oocytes the protein remains exclusively in the cytosol; however, when the globin cDNA is fused to a portion of NP cDNA that includes the region encoding amino acids 327–345, the resulting fusion protein enters and accumulates in the nucleus. Fusion proteins lacking this region of the NP enter but do not accumulate in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1974861780,"The mechanisms of antibody binding to a protein were studied by an analysis of specific amino acid residues critical to nine antigenic sites on myohemerythrin. Rabbit antisera to the whole protein were assayed for binding to more than 1500 distinct peptide analogs differing from the protein sequence by single amino acid replacements. The results, combined with information from the three-dimensional crystallographic structure, were used to evaluate probable mechanisms of antibody binding at individual sites. The data from all sites examined indicate that initial binding to solvent-exposed amino acid residues may promote local side-chain displacements and thereby allow the participation of other, previously buried, residues."
https://openalex.org/W2010651552,"Data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's polar-orbiting meteorological satellites have been used to infer ecological parameters associated with Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral activity in Kenya. An indicator of potential viral activity was produced from satellite data for two different ecological regions in Kenya, where RVF is enzootic. The correlation between the satellite-derived green vegetation index and the ecological parameters associated with RVF virus suggested that satellite data may become a forecasting tool for RVF in Kenya and, perhaps, in other areas of sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1546681417,Agglutinates of native chicken erythrocytes caused by influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) at 4 degrees C were potently fused and lysed at low pH (optimum pH 5.3) at 37 degrees C. Exogenous gangliosides GM3 (Sia alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-ceramide) and GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4(Sia alpha 2-3)-Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-ceramide) were integrated into the membranes of chicken asialoerythrocytes within 5-min incubation at 37 degrees C. We found that the incorporation of ganglioside GM3 containing N-acetylneuraminic acid into asialoerythrocytes restored the biological responsiveness to the virus as established by agglutination at 4 degrees C and fusion and hemolysis at 37 degrees C at pH 5.3. Biological responsiveness of GM3-NeuAc-erythrocytes to the virus was considerably higher than that of GM3-NeuGc-erythrocytes under the same experimental conditions. Treatment of the GM3-NeuAc-erythrocytes with neuraminidase again resulted in the complete abolishment of the response to the virus. Erythrocytes containing GM2-NeuAc showed no detectable biological responses toward the virus. The above results indicate that the hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) recognizes the sialyloligosaccharide chain of ganglioside GM3 as its receptor which mediates the adsorption and fusion process on the virus entry into the host cells and has more preferential specificity for binding to N-acetylneuraminic acid-containing GM3 than that to N-glycolyl type in the target cell membranes.
https://openalex.org/W2154751897,"We have studied the transcripts of the embryonic, perinatal, and adult fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo before and after birth, and in vitro in myogenic cell lines. In vivo, in 15-day fetal muscle, embryonic and perinatal MHC mRNAs are both present, and the former is the major transcript. By 18 days the perinatal is predominant and the adult MHC mRNA appears. In beta-bungarotoxin-treated fetuses, a similar developmental pattern is detected, suggesting that it is nerve-independent and that primary myotubes alone undergo the same developmental changes. In vitro, in the absence of the nerve, embryonic, perinatal, and adult IIB MHC mRNAs accumulate. The level of the latter two isomRNAs is influenced by culture conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2106485577,"125I-labeled heparin cofactor II (HCII) was mixed with plasma and coagulation was initiated by addition of CaCl2, phospholipids, and kaolin or tissue factor. In the presence of 67 micrograms/ml of dermatan sulfate, radioactivity was detected in a band which corresponded to the thrombin-HCII complex (Mr = 96,000) upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No other complexes were observed. The thrombin-HCII complex was undetectable when 5 units/ml of heparin was present or when prothrombin-deficient plasma was used. In experiments with purified proteases, HCII did not significantly inhibit coagulation factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, kallikrein, activated protein C, plasmin, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, leukocyte elastase, the gamma-subunit of nerve growth factor, and the epidermal growth factor-binding protein. HCII inhibited leukocyte cathepsin G slowly, with a rate constant of 8 X 10(4) M-1 min-1 in the presence of dermatan sulfate. These results indicate that the protease specificity of HCII is more restricted than that of other plasma protease inhibitors and suggest that the anticoagulant effect of dermatan sulfate is due solely to inhibition of thrombin by HCII."
https://openalex.org/W2031621878,"Estuarine snails Ilyanassa obsoleta bearing larvae of the trematode Gynaecotyla adunca behave singularly in comparison with conspecifics lacking this parasite. Following high tides, and especially at night, infected snails were found stranded high on beaches and sandbars. Semiterrestrial crustaceans living well up on the shore serve as the next host, and the modified (induced) snail behavior is apparently a parasite adaptation facilitating cercarial transmission to these crustaceans. The altered behavior is unusual because of its apparent enhancement of host-to-host transmission by cercariae rather than predation, the process commonly recognized as being enhanced by parasitic modification of host behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1578030198,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes contain an oxidase system that can be activated to produce superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. A nonmitochondrial b cytochrome, functioning in the generation of these oxygen species, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from human polymorphonuclear phagocytes. After solubilization of the cytochrome with Triton X-100, the cell extract was subsequently chromatographed on Blue Sepharose and Sephacryl S-300. The final preparation was maximally purified 170-fold with a specific content of 5.33 +/- 2.03 nmol mg-1 of protein (mean +/- S.D.; n = 7) and a yield of 21 +/- 13% (n = 5). The apparent molecular mass of the nondenatured cytochrome was estimated by gel filtration to be 235 kDa. Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, a single polypeptide was found with a molecular mass of 127 kDa. From the pyridine hemochrome spectrum 1 protoheme IX/polypeptide was calculated. The light absorbance bands of the dithionite-reduced cytochrome were found to be at 558.5 (alpha), 529 (beta), and 426 nm (Soret), and that of the oxidized cytochrome at 413.5 nm. The difference absorbance coefficients are delta epsilon (426.5 - 440 nm) = 160.6 +/- 11 mM-1 cm-1 and delta epsilon (558.5 - 542 nm) = 29.3 +/- 2 mM-1 cm-1 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 5). Carbon monoxide binds to the cytochrome in a time-dependent fashion (maximum binding after 50-60 min). The midpoint potential of the solubilized nonpurified cytochrome is identical to the cytochrome in situ (Em7.0 = -218 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- S.D.; n = 5)). However, purified cytochrome b shows a significantly decreased midpoint potential, estimated at -407 +/- 18 mV (n = 4). The protein does not contain noncovalently bound FAD or FMN, and no spectral evidence was obtained for the presence of covalently bound flavin. Preliminary amino acid analysis of the cytochrome shows a high content of hydrophilic residues."
https://openalex.org/W1549660657,"Thymidine kinase and dihydrofolate reductase mRNA levels and enzyme activities were determined in two temperature-sensitive cell lines, tsAF8 and ts13, that growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle at the restrictive temperature. The levels of thymidine kinase mRNA and enzyme activity increased markedly in both cell lines serum stimulated from quiescence at the permissive temperature. At the nonpermissive temperature, the levels of thymidine kinase mRNA and enzyme activity remain at the low levels of quiescent G0 cells. The levels of dihydrofolate reductase mRNA as well as the enzyme activity also increase when both cell lines are serum stimulated at the permissive temperature. When ts13 cells are serum stimulated at the nonpermissive temperature dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity declines rapidly and dihydrofolate reductase mRNA is below detectable levels. On the contrary, when tsAF8 cells are serum stimulated at the nonpermissive temperature dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity increases and mRNA levels are detectable slightly above G0 levels, even though the cells are blocked in the G1 phase. Studies with 2 other cDNA clones (one with an insert whose expression is cell cycle dependent and the other with an insert whose expression is not cell cycle dependent) indicate that the results are not due to aspecific toxicity or the effect of temperature. We conclude that the expression of different genes is affected differently by the ts block in G1, even when these genes are all growth-related."
https://openalex.org/W2161649000,"The requirement of basic residues as substrate specificity determinants for the chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase has been studied using synthetic peptide analogs of the local phosphorylation site sequence in the myosin light chains, Lys-Lys-Arg13-Pro-Gln-Arg16-Ala-Thr-Ser19-Asn-Val-Phe- Ala. The basic residue, Arg-16, was found to have a strong influence on the kinetics of phosphorylation similar to that reported previously for the three adjacent residues, Lys-11, Lys-12, and Lys-13 (Kemp, B. E., Pearson, R. B., and House, C. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 7471-7475). The location of Arg-16 in relation to Ser-19 as well as the distance between Arg-13 and Arg-16 had a profound effect on both the kinetics and the site specificity of phosphorylation. Placement of Arg-16 at position 15 resulted in a complete switch in phosphorylation site specificity from Ser-19 to Thr-18. Increasing the number of alanine residues between Arg-13 and Arg-16 in the model peptide, Lys-Lys-Arg-(Ala)n-Arg-Ala-Thr-Ser-Asn-Val-Phe-Ala, also influenced the kinetics and site specificity of peptide phosphorylation. With two or three alanines (n = 2 or 3), the apparent Km was 7.5 and 10 microM, respectively, and 97% of the phosphate was esterified to Ser-19. Increasing or decreasing the number of alanines (n = O to n = 4) was accompanied by an increase in the apparent Km and phosphorylation of both Thr-18 and Ser-19. These results support the concept that both the presence and location of basic residues play an essential role in the substrate specificity of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1636165650,"We have cloned and sequenced the rat gene coding for the acute phase reactant protein alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in order to determine which sequences are necessary for its regulation by glucocorticoids and which sequences are responsible for the sensitivity of this regulation to protein synthesis inhibitors. The gene contains six exons, as determined from the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein cDNA sequence, and five introns. Primer extension and S1 nuclease experiments have shown that there are two transcriptional start sites 4 base pairs apart. After cotransfection into mouse L-cells, the gene retains its inducibility by glucocorticoids, indicating that the sequences required for induction are within or around the gene. The induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein levels in transfected L-cells is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors, implying that in addition to the glucocorticoid receptor another protein(s) is necessary for full induction."
https://openalex.org/W1565933460,"We have characterized a 32,000-36,000-dalton sialoglycoprotein group that is an integral component of the lipoprotein complex called pulmonary surfactant. Our results from the cell-free translation of human lung RNA show that this protein consists of two similarly-sized precursor components of about 29,000-31,000 daltons. Tunicamycin treatment of the lung tissue prevents formation of the normal protein and results in the accumulation of these precursor components which are also seen under normal conditions in very small amounts. Although in vitro translation in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes suggests that a cleavable signal peptide sequence is present in these precursor molecules, it does not appear that this cleavage occurs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2077700955,"Expression of the class I transplantation antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is suppressed in cells transformed by the oncogenic human adenovirus 12 (Ad12). This suppression of class I antigen expression, which contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype of the transformed cells, has also been observed in some naturally occurring cancers. In the present study, the rate of transcription initiation of class I genes was measured by a nuclear run-on assay in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed cells of three different types. The rate of transcription was the same in all three. The stability of the class I messenger RNA was also examined and found to be the same in all three cell types. The results indicate that in Ad12-transformed cells the suppression is caused by an inhibition of the post-transcriptional processing of class I MHC messenger RNA in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1504086164,"The interaction of recA protein with single-stranded (ss) phi X174 DNA has been examined by means of a nuclease protection assay. The stoichiometry of protection was found to be 1 recA monomer/approximately 4 nucleotides of ssDNA both in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor and in the presence of ATP. In contrast, in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) the stoichiometry was 1 recA monomer/approximately 8 nucleotides. No protection was seen with ADP. In the absence of a nucleotide cofactor, the binding of recA protein to ssDNA was quite stable as judged by equilibration with a challenge DNA (t1/2 approximately 30 min). Addition of ATP stimulated this transfer (t1/2 approximately 3 min) as did ADP (t1/2 approximately 0.2 min). ATP gamma S greatly reduced the rate of equilibration (t1/2 greater than 12 h). Direct visualization of recA X ssDNA complexes at subsaturating recA protein concentrations using electron microscopy revealed individual ssDNA molecules partially covered with recA protein which were converted to highly condensed networks upon addition of ATP gamma S. These results have led to a general model for the interaction of recA protein with ssDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1673643417,"Both glucagon and the structurally similar glucagon-like peptide proteolytically derived from preproglucagon were purified from the endocrine pancreas of the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctata). This study represents the first report of the isolation of glucagon-like peptide from any source. Peptide sequences of glucagon-like peptide from other species have only been deduced from the cDNA sequences for preproglucagon. The sequence of the 34-residue glucagon-like peptide was found to be HADGTYTSDVSSYLQDQAAKDFITWLKSGQPKPE. Catfish glucagon-like peptide shares sequence identity at 26 of 31 residues with the putative glucagon-like peptide from anglerfish preproglucagon II. The mass of catfish glucagon-like peptide was found by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry to be 3785, identical with the value predicted by sequence analysis. This suggests that no post-translational modification occurs beyond proteolytic processing. The sequence of catfish glucagon was determined to be HSEGTFSNDYSKYLETRRAQDFVQWLM(N,S). Catfish glucagon exhibits a high degree of immunologic similarity with porcine glucagon by radioimmunoassay, whereas catfish glucagon-like peptide does not."
https://openalex.org/W1518756578,"The physical and chemical properties of the mammalian aorta are known to vary as a function of distance from the heart. These properties are highly dependent collagen and elastic fibers. In order to evaluate the mechanisms which regulate the accumulation of these two connective tissue proteins, gene expression was evaluated at both the biosynthetic and messenger RNA levels. Short-term (3 h) explant cultures of the medial portion of four segments of the descending aorta in newborn pigs were incubated in the presence of [3H] proline. Collagen production was quantified by collagenase digestion and elastin production was determined by immunoprecipitation. Between the conus arteriosus and the bifurcation of the iliac arteries, relative collagen synthesis increased 2-fold (from 5.8 to 12.0% of total protein synthesis), while relative elastin synthesis declined 10-fold (from 16.4 to 1.6% of total protein synthesis). Similarly, collagen production increased more than 7-fold (from 6.7 to 49.8 X 10(3) molecules/cell/h) while elastin production was reduced more than 3-fold (from 71.8 to 21.0 X 10(3) molecules/cell/h) along this developmental gradient. Elastin synthesis appeared to be controlled to a significant extent by the availability of elastin mRNA, since both cell-free translation and molecular hybridization to a cloned elastin gene probe showed gradients of elastin gene expression. Similarly, collagen synthesis was apparently regulated, at least in part, by an inverse gradient of collagen mRNA, as measured with a cloned cDNA for the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene. Marked changes in the amount of non-elastin protein synthesis accompanied differentiation and accounted for larger changes in relative synthesis. These results suggest that the phenotype of the cells of the porcine artery wall is distinct in different regions of this organ at this developmental stage."

These criteria include the policies' macrodemographic impact on total population size and population aging; their microdemographic effects on the family's ability to support the elderly, its economic capabilities, and the position of women; and their cultural acceptability to the majority Han Chinese population. The results suggest that the least desirable strategy is to retain the present policy; all the two-child alternatives perform better than the current one-child policy in achieving the policy goals considered."
https://openalex.org/W1530611017,"The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was found to induce the biosynthesis and deposition of two cytoskeletal components in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 with apparent Mr = 55,000 and 46,000. A time course showed that maximal changes in these cytoskeletal components occurred as early as 24 h after treatment and were maintained at least as long as 72 h. By immunoprecipitation, one of the induced cytoskeletal components was identified as vimentin. There was approximately a 10-fold induction of vimentin biosynthesis following TPA treatment. The other TPA-induced protein was found to co-migrate with purified actin in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Neither of these proteins was induced in the closely related human erythroleukemic cell line, HEL. By in vitro protein synthesis directed by total cellular RNA isolated from K562 cells, induction of vimentin biosynthesis was found to correlate with increases in the level of vimentin mRNA activity. A time course showed that vimentin mRNA activity was detectably elevated as early as 3 h after TPA treatment and reached a maximum by 12 h then the level decreased. By RNA dot blot and Northern gel hybridization using a cloned human actin cDNA, we found that there was also an induction of actin mRNA. A time course showed that there was an elevation of actin mRNA as early as 1 h after TPA treatment. The level then increased to a maximum at 6 h, after which the level decreased. These results are consistent with the induction of vimentin and actin gene transcription by TPA in K562 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2076485015,"The earliest known response of eggs to sperm in many species is a change in egg membrane potential. However, for no species is it known what components of the sperm cause the opening of the egg plasma membrane channels. Protein isolated from sperm acrosomal granules of the marine worm Urechis caused electrical responses in oocytes with the same form, amplitude, and ion dependence as the fertilization potentials induced by living sperm. Sperm initiated fertilization potentials in oocytes when sperm-oocyte fusion, but not binding, was inhibited by clamping oocyte membrane potentials to positive values. Acrosomal protein also initiated electrical responses in clamped oocytes. These results support the hypothesis that it is the sperm acrosomal protein that opens ion channels in the oocyte membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1605431195,"A cDNA clone for cytochrome P-450e, a phenobarbitone-inducible species in rat liver, has been isolated and characterized. With the use of this cloned DNA, an attempt has been initiated to elucidate the factors regulating the cytochrome P-450 gene expression. Inhibitors of heme synthesis such as cobalt chloride and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole block the induction of cytochrome P-450e by phenobarbitone at the level of transcription. This is evident from the decrease in the rate of synthesis of cytochrome P-450e, a decrease in the levels of specific translatable messenger RNA, a decrease in the specific cytoplasmic and nuclear messenger RNA contents, and nuclear transcription of cytochrome P-450e gene, as revealed by hybridization to the cloned probe, under these conditions. It is proposed that heme is a general regulator of cytochrome P-450 gene expression at the level of transcription, whereas the drug or its metabolite would impart the specificity needed for the induction of a particular species."
https://openalex.org/W1529943797,"We have isolated three mammalian cell lines which are resistant to compactin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The drug resistance in all three cell lines is due to an increase of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Two of the three cell lines overaccumulate HMG-CoA reductase messenger RNA when grown in the presence of compactin. DNA hybridization experiments indicate that both a baby hamster kidney-derived compactin-resistant cell line, C100, and a cell line derived from mouse 3T6 cells, 3T6-40, exhibit amplifications of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. A third compactin-resistant cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, ML100, does not exhibit an amplification of the HMG-CoA reductase gene, nor does it show an elevated level of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, comparable to that seen in the other cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1528476635,"A sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis in vitro of LD1c (NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuGc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-NAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-Cer) has been characterized from 9 to 11-day-old embryonic chicken brains. The CMP-[14C]NeuAc:LM1(alpha 2-8)sialyltransferase (SAT-2) sedimented (75%) at the junction of 0.75 and 1.2 M on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient when still membrane bound. In addition to the biosynthesis of LD1c, the detergent-solubilized (0.4% Nonidet P-40) preparation also catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to O-8 of sialic acid in GM3 to form GD3 (NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuAc alpha 2 - 3Gal beta 1 - 4Glc - Cer). Substrate inhibition studies indicated that these two reactions are probably catalyzed by the same enzyme, SAT-2. The kinetic parameters of SAT-2 activity were determined. The Km values were 70 and 63 microM with CMP-[14C]NeuAc and LM1, respectively, when the detergent-solubilized supernatant fraction was used as enzyme source. The (alpha 2-8)-linkage between the terminal and penultimate sialic acids was determined using nonradioactive CMP-NeuAc and [Ac-14C]LM1 as substrates (Higashi, H., and Basu, S. (1982) Anal. Biochem. 120, 159-164) for the enzyme, followed by identification of the permethylated [14C]sialic acid of the product by radioautography. At 0.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, the SAT-2 activity was inhibited 50% whereas SAT-1 and SAT-3 activities (Basu, M., Basu, S., Stoffyn, A., and Stoffyn, P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12765-12769) remained uninhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1556774711,"Thiolase, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme which produces CoASAc from fatty acids, is shown to interact with citrate synthase, the mitochondrial matrix enzyme responsible for CoASAc utilization. The interaction is demonstrated in three ways: the two enzymes co-precipitate in polyethylene glycol; thiolase causes a change in the fluorescence anisotropy of labeled citrate synthase; and the two enzymes co-elute in gel permeation chromatography. The interactions are shown to be specific by the use of enzymes not metabolically related to citrate synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2045706319,"The regulation of amino-oligopeptidase (AOP), an intestinal brush border hydrolase essential for the surface digestion of peptide nutrients, was examined in rats in vivo. Short-term (30-minute) intraintestinal perfusion of a tetrapeptide substrate, Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly, or a synthetic substrate, leucyl-beta-naphthylamide, induced a doubling in the incorporation of [3H]leucine into the AOP in association with intracellular membranes. The subsequent conversion of AOP from nascent to mature enzyme and its membrane-associated transport to the brush border occurred at normal rates."

https://openalex.org/W1934913706,"We previously described a heat-stable factor from WEHI-7 mouse thymoma, rat liver, spleen, and human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that prevents degradation of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes (GRC) in cytosols from rat thymus and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia cells. We now show that the factor has many properties in common with calpastatin, a naturally occurring inhibitor of a family of neutral calcium-activated proteases called calpains. Liver GRC-stabilizing activity and calpastatin activity, in addition to surviving boiling, co-chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose ion exchange or agarose A-0.5M gel filtration matrices, and have identical isoelectric points of 5.1. This factor should be especially useful for studying GRC function in the presence of calcium."

https://openalex.org/W1561432667,"Small unilamellar liposomes with an average external diameter of approximately 550 A were prepared by high pressure extrusion in a French press. Liposomes, composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 7:1:2, were incubated with suspensions of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The cell-liposome interactions were characterized using fluorescence and radiotracer techniques. Transfer of the liposomal contents into the cytoplasm was visualized by fluorescence microscopy, using fluorescence-labeled macromolecules, and further documented by flow cytometry with liposome-entrapped 5,6-carboxy-fluorescein. The dose dependence, time course, and temperature dependence of the cell-liposome association, as determined by radioactive labeling both the liposomal membranes and their contents, indicate saturable interaction of the cells with intact liposomes (KappM approximately 5 X 10(-7) M lipid/10(6) cells at 37 degrees C). Using nonexchangeable fluorescent phospholipid analogs, the cell-liposome interactions were characterized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. From these latter experiments we conclude that after 1-h incubation of 10(6) cells with 1 microM lipid at 37 degrees C, 30% of the cell-associated liposomes will have fused with the plasma membranes, resulting in the delivery of the contents of approximately 1.25 X 10(5) liposomes into each cell. Thus, liposomal delivery is an effective means to gain access to the cytoplasm and can be exploited to modulate physiological responses from within intact chromaffin cells."

https://openalex.org/W1491032421,"The yolk sac of the pregnant rat which functions as a true placenta is a target organ for vitamin D. This tissue can hydroxylate in position 24 both 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3). The present report describes an in vitro model for the study of 1,25-(OH)2D3 action on the further metabolism of 25-OH[3H]D3 and 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 by yolk sac. The tissue explants were preincubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 18 h in a serum-free culture medium. Physiological concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were the most effective in stimulating (7.5-fold) the 1,25-(OH)2D3 24-hydroxylase, while the 25-OHD3 24-hydroxylase stimulation (4-fold) required a 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration of 10(-7) M. The stimulating effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the 1,25-(OH)2D3 24-hydroxylase was temperature-dependent, and, since its was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, required de novo protein synthesis. 1,24,25-(OH)3D3, 25-OHD3, and 24,25-(OH)2D3 were 10- to 1000-fold less potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 in inducing the 1,25-(OH)2D3 hydroxylase. Our results strongly suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulated the 1,25-(OH)2D3 24-hydroxylase by a receptor-mediated process. Furthermore, 1,25-(OH)2D3 at 10(-9) M induced within 4 h an increase of its own degradation and the formation of an as yet unidentified major 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 metabolite. We conclude that the yolk sac can participate in the regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration in the fetoplacental unit."
