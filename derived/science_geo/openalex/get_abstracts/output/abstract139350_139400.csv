https://openalex.org/W1980810506,"Many tumors overexpress mutant forms of p53. A growing number of studies suggest that the nature of a p53 mutation in a cell can impact upon cellular properties, clinical responses to therapy and prognosis of a tumor. To explore the cellular basis of these observations, experiments were designed to compare the properties of cells with and without p53 mutations within the same cell population. To that end, various tumor-derived human p53 mutants were introduced into p53-null H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Clonogenic survival assays revealed that cells overexpressing the p53His175 mutant, but not the p53His273 mutant, recover preferentially from etoposide treatment. Moreover, p53His175 as well as p53His179 reduced substantially the rate of etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas p53His273 and p53Trp248 had a much milder protective effect. In contrast, p53His175 and p53His273 exerted very similar effects on the cellular response to cisplatin; both conferred increased resistance to low concentrations of the drug (2.5 μg/ml), but did not protect at all against high concentrations (10 μg/ml). Hence particular p53 mutants may confer upon tumor cells a selective survival advantage during chemotherapy. These findings define a new type of mutant p53 selective gain of function, which may compromise the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2325557141,"Missense mutations in p53 frequently occur at 'hotspot' amino acids which are highly conserved and represent regions of structural or functional importance. Using the p53 mutation database and the p53 DNA sequences for 11 species, we more precisely defined the relationships among conservation, mutation frequency and protein structure. We aligned the p53 sequences codon-by-codon and determined the degree of substitution among them. As a whole, p53 is evolving at an average rate for a mammalian protein-coding gene. As expected, the DNA binding domain is evolving more slowly than the carboxy and amino termini. A detailed map of evolutionary conservation shows that within the DNA binding domain there are repeating peaks and valleys of higher and lower evolutionary constraint. Mutation hotspots were identified by comparing the observed distribution of mutations to the pattern expected from a random multinomial distribution. Seventy-three hotspots were identified; these 19% of codons account for 88% of all reported p53 mutations. Both high evolutionary constraint and mutation hotspots are noted at amino acids close to the protein-DNA interface and at others more distant from DNA, often buried within the core of the folded protein but sometimes on its surface. The results indicate that targeting highly conserved regions for mutational and functional analysis may be efficient strategies for the study of cancer-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W2006375405,"Genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by caspase family proteases as triggered by other stimuli. In this study, we found that the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin (cDDP) activated MAP kinase kinase kinase ASK1 and subsequent downstream subgroups of MAP kinase kinase, SEK1 (or MKK4) and MKK3/MKK6, which in turn activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK1/SAPK) and p38 MAP kinase prior to caspase family protease activation and the onset of apoptosis in human ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3) and human kidney (293T) cells. As reported previously, benzyloxy carbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2, 6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp), a preferential inhibitor of caspase family proteases, blocked the apoptosis of OVCAR-3 cells induced by the genotoxic stress cDDP. Z-Asp, however, did not inhibit ASK1 activation and the subsequent kinase cascades. Overexpression of kinase-negative ASK1 (K709R), which inhibited ASK1 activation and the downstream MKK3-p38 and MKK4-JNK1 pathways, also suppressed the caspase protease activation and apoptosis induced by cDDP. These results indicate that the ASK1 pathway is involved in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and mediates apoptosis at a step upstream of caspase protease activation."

https://openalex.org/W2021481573,"Drug design targeted at microtubules has led to the advent of some potent anti-cancer drugs. In the present study, we demonstrated that microtubule-binding agents (MBAs) taxol and colchicine induced immediate early gene (c-jun and ATF3) expression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. To elucidate the signal transduction pathways that mediate such biological activities of MBAs, we studied the involvement of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Treatment with taxol, colchicine, or other MBAs (vincristine, podophyllotoxin, nocodazole) stimulated the activity of c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, p38 was activated only by taxol and none of the MBAs changed the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2). Activation of JNK1 or p38 by MBAs occurred subsequent to the morphological changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton induced by these compounds. Furthermore, baccatine III and β-lumicolchicine, inactive analogs of taxol and colchicine, respectively, did not activate JNK1 or p38. These results suggest that interactions between microtubules and MBAs are essential for the activation of these kinases. Pretreatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid or vitamin E, blocked H2O2- or doxorubicin-induced JNK1 activity, but had no effect on JNK1 activation by MBAs, excluding a role for oxidative stress. However, BAPTA/AM, a specific intracellular Ca2+ chelator, attenuated JNK1 activation by taxol but not by colchicine, and had no effect on microtubule changes induced by taxol. Thus, stabilization or depolymerization of microtubules may regulate JNK1 activity via distinct downstream signaling pathways. The differential activation of MAP kinases opens up a new avenue for addressing the mechanism of action of anti-microtubule drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2031146595,"The proteins of the retinoblastoma family are potent inhibitors of cell cycle progression. It is well documented that their growth-inhibitory activity can be abolished by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by cyclin dependent kinases. In contrast, very little is known about the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma-family proteins. We report here the isolation, by virtue of its ability to associate with p107, of a novel Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit, named PR59. PR59 shares sequence homology with a known regulatory subunit of PP2A, PR72, but differs from PR72 in its expression pattern and its functional properties. We show that PR59 co-immunoprecipitates with the PP2A catalytic subunit, indicating that PR59 is a genuine component of PP2A holo-enzymes. In vivo, PR59 associates specifically with p107, but not with pRb. Elevated expression of PR59 results in dephosphorylation of p107, but not of pRb, and inhibits cell proliferation by causing cells to accumulate in G1. These data support a model in which the distinct PP2A regulatory subunits act to target the PP2A catalytic subunit to specific substrates and suggest a role for PP2A in regulation of p107."
https://openalex.org/W2016970095,"The small GTP-binding protein Rac plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse physiological events including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression, and transformation. Here we show an anti-apoptotic effect of Rac in interleukin-3-dependent murine hematopoietic BaF3 cells. Activated Rac(G12V), when ectopically expressed in BaF3 cells, rendered the cells resistant to apoptosis upon interleukin-3 deprivation, while activated mutants of Rho and Cdc42 displayed no significant anti-apoptotic effect. In contrast to activated Ras, which also supports cell survival in the absence of interleukin-3, Rac required fetal bovine serum for the prevention of cell death. The involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase downstream of Rac was demonstrated by the inhibition of Rac-induced cell survival by wortmannin and LY294002 and the presence of phosphatidylinositol kinase activity in the Rac immunoprecipitate. Furthermore, the serine/threonine kinase Akt was stimulated by activated Rac and fetal bovine serum in a synergistic manner. Rac-induced Akt activation was mediated by phosphorylation of threonine-308 and serine-473. In addition to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was crucial for Rac-dependent survival, whereas p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase nas not implicated in Ras-induced anti-apoptotic signaling. These findings provide evidence for the involvement of Rac in survival signaling of hematopoietic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2317640291,"We report here the production and the properties of single chain Fv fragments (scFvs) derived from the anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb421 and 11D3. 11D3 is a newly generated monoclonal antibody which exhibits properties very comparable to those of PAb421. The scFvs PAb421 and 11D3 are able to stably associate with p53 and to restore the DNA binding activity of some p53 mutants in vitro. When expressed in p53−/− human tumour cells, the scFv421 is essentially localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of p53, and in the nucleus when exogenous p53 is present. Thus, p53 is also able to stably associate with an anti-p53 scFv in cells. Cotransfection of p53−/− human tumour cells with expression vectors encoding the His273 p53 mutant and either scFv leads to restoration of the p53 mutant deficient transcriptional activity. These data demonstrate that, in human tumour cells, these scFvs are able to restore a function essential for the tumour suppressor activity of p53 and may represent a novel class of molecules for p53-based cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2330423715,"Human and mouse fibroblasts with normal p53 fail to enter mitosis when DNA synthesis is blocked by aphidicolin or hydroxyurea. Isogenic p53-null fibroblasts do enter mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA, revealing that p53 contributes to a checkpoint that ensures that mitosis does not occur until DNA synthesis is complete. When treated with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), which inhibits pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, leading to synthesis of damaged DNA from highly unbalanced dNTP pools, p53-null cells enter mitosis after they have completed DNA replication, but cells with wild-type p53 do not, revealing that p53 also mediates a checkpoint that monitors the quality of newly replicated DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1976052037,"O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a ubiquitous DNA repair protein, removes the mutagenic DNA adduct O6-alkylguanine, which is synthesized both endogenously and after exposure to alkylnitrosamines and alkylating antitumor drugs such as 2-chloroethyl-N-nitrosourea (CNU). The MGMT gene is highly regulated in mammalian cells and its overexpression, observed in many types of tumor cells, is often associated with cellular resistance to CNU. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, was found to increase MGMT expression in HeLa S3 cells, concomitant with their increased resistance to CNU. Two putative glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) were identified in the human MGMT (hMGMT) promoter. Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by an hMGMT promoter fragment containing these GREs was activated by dexamethasone. DNase I footprinting assays demonstrated the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to these sequences. In vitro transcription experiment showed that these DNA sequences are functional in glucocorticoid receptor signal-mediated activation of transcription. These results suggest glucocorticoid-mediated induction of the MGMT gene contributes to high level expression of MGMT."

https://openalex.org/W2317251742,"The Bc16 gene is located at chromosomal band 3q27, a breakpoint for translocation that frequently occurs in B cell lymphomas. Bc16 has been found to be preferentially expressed in germinal center B cells, and expression of this gene has been shown to be essential for germinal center formation in vivo. The physiological function of Bc16 and its role in lymphomagenesis, however, are not yet known. Since significant expression of Bc16 has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle, we have utilized a differentiation-inducible mouse myogenic cell line, C2C12, to elucidate the function of the Bc16 gene product. Expression of Bc16 mRNA was very low in growing myocytes, but was increased in differentiating myocytes cultured in serum-starved medium. Incubation of these cells with cytokines or chemicals that are known to block differentiation suppressed this increased Bc16 message abundance, indicating that Bc16 induction is related to the process of terminal differentiation in muscle cells. While a fraction of myocytes is known to undergo apoptosis after serum-starvation to induce differentiation, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Bc16 enhanced the viability of the differentiating cells by preventing the apoptosis. High levels of Bc16 antisense mRNA expression induced substantial apoptosis during the differentiation of C2C12 cells, but this was effectively prevented by infection with adenovirus that expressed Bc16 sense mRNA. These results indicate that Bc16 acts to prevent apoptotic cell death in differentiating myocytes. The deregulation of expression of this antiapoptotic gene may also contribute to the development of B cell lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2093197933,"Growth of non-transformed cells in vitro is regulated by density-dependent mechanisms via cell-cell contacts, leading to arrest in late G1-phase at confluency (contact-inhibition of growth). In the present study it is shown that this results from p16INK4-mediated dissociation of the complex cdk4-cyclin D1, which is responsible for the inactivation of the gate keeper of G1-S transition, the retinoblastoma protein pRb. As a consequence of the inactivation of cdk4, downstream the activation of cdk2 and hyperphosphorylation and thus inactivation of pRb was impaired. Direct evidence for the central role of p16INK4 in growth control comes from the observation that a competitive inhibitor of p16INK4 repressed contact inhibition of growth. These findings provide an explanation for the high incidence of mutation or loss of INK4 in human tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1993059330,"The BCL-6 proto-oncogene encodes a 92- to 98-kDa transcriptional repressor containing the BTB/POZ domain at its N-terminal region and the zinc finger domain at its C-terminal region, respectively. In the present study, we examined the function of BCL-6 by using a recombinant adenovirus expressing BCL-6 (Ax1CA-BCL-6) and the lacZ reporter gene (Ax1CA-lacZ). Viability of CV-1 and HeLa cells infected with Ax1CA-BCL-6 was markedly reduced due to apoptosis, suggesting that BCL-6-overexpression induces apoptosis in CV-1 and HeLa cells. FACS analysis revealed that BCL-6-overexpressing cells are accumulated not only at the sub-G1 but also at G2/M phase. Induction of apoptosis by BCL-6 was preceded by down-regulation of apoptosis repressors BCL-2 and BCL-X(L). These results suggest that BCL-6 induces apoptosis by regulating the expression of these apoptosis-regulating genes."
https://openalex.org/W2315607246,"We have previously shown that Sp1-mediated transcription is stimulated by Rb and repressed by cyclin D1. The stimulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity by Rb is conferred, in part, through a direct interaction with the TBP-associated factor TAFII250. Here we investigated the mechanism(s) through which cyclin D1 represses Sp1. We examined the ability of cyclin D1 to regulate transcription mediated by Gal4-Sp1 fusion proteins, which contain the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and Sp1 trans-activation domain(s). The domain of Sp1 sufficient to confer repression by cyclin D1 was mapped to a region important for interaction with TAFII110. We further demonstrate that TAFII250-cyclin D1 complexes can be immunoprecipitated from mammalian and baculovirus-infected insect cells and that recombinant GST-TAFII250 (amino acids 1 – 434) associates with cyclin D1 in vitro. Moreover, the overexpression of Rb or CDK4 reduced the level of TAFII250-cyclin D1 complex. The amino terminus of cyclin D1 (amino acids 1 – 100) was sufficient for association with TAFII250 and for repressing Sp1-mediated transcription. Taken together, the results suggest that cyclin D1 may regulate transcription by interacting directly or indirectly with TAFII250."
https://openalex.org/W2320776483,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15INK4b has been shown to be involved in human and rodent tumors and seems to act as a tumor suppressor gene in hematological malignancies. Alterations of this gene in tumors include mainly homozygous deletions and hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region. In this work, we describe a new area sensitive to methylation in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the murine p15INK4b gene. This region shows different levels of methylation depending on the tissues, being relatively highly methylated in brain and gut, and weakly methylated in liver, spleen or thymus. DNA methylation and expression is similar in both maternal and paternal alleles indicating no imprinting effect. Although methylation of the p15INK4b 3′-UTR is low in normal thymus, increased levels (up to 100%) of specific methylation in this region are found in up to 30% of radiation- or carcinogen-induced thymic lymphomas, correlating with decreased gene expression. Hypermethylation of the p15INK4b 3′-UTR frequently occurs in tumors with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) but without methylation of the promoter CpG island or intragenic mutations. Furthermore, in vitro CpG methylation of the 3′-UTR produces reduced levels of a luciferase reporter in cultured cells. Methylation of two CpG sites in a 120 bp region is sufficient to interfere with transcription of the reporter gene. These data suggest that although the levels of p15INK4b in normal tissues can be mainly determined by promoter regulatory elements, strong hypermethylation of the 3′-UTR can interfere with transcription. Thus, hypermethylation of the 3′-UTR may explain the lack of p15INK4b gene expression in a subset of tumors with no promoter methylation and could be a new alternative mechanism for tumor suppressor gene inactivation in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2319090485,"We have compared the DNase I hypersensitivity of the regulatory region of two estrogen-regulated genes, pS2 and cathepsin D in hormone-dependent and -independent breast carcinoma cell lines. This strategy allowed the identification of two important control regions, one in pS2 and the other in cathepsin D genes. In the hormone-dependent MCF7 cell line, within the pS2 gene 5'-flanking region, we detected two major DNase I hypersensitive sites, induced by estrogens and/or IGFI: pS2-HS1, located in the proximal promoter and pS2-HS4, located -10.5 Kb from the CAP site, within a region that has not been cloned. The presence of these two DNase I hypersensitive sites correlates with pS2 expression. Interestingly in MCF7 cells, estrogens and IGFI induced indistinguishable chromatin structural changes over the pS2 regulatory region, suggesting that the two transduction-pathways converge to a unique chromatin target. In two cell lines that do not express pS2, MDA MB 231, a hormone-independent cell line that lacks the estrogen receptor alpha, and HE5, a cell line derived from MDA MB 231 by transfection that expresses estrogen receptor alpha, there was only one hormone-independent DNase I hypersensitive site. This site, pS2-HS2, was located immediately upstream of pS2-HS1. In MCF7 cells, two major DNase I hypersensitive sites were present in the 5'-flanking sequences of the cathepsin D gene, which is regulated by estrogens in these cells. These sites, catD-HS2 and catD-HS3, located at positions -2.3 Kb and -3.45 Kb, respectively, were both hormone-independent. A much weaker site, catD-HS1, covered the proximal promoter. In MDA MB 231 cells, that express cathepsin D constitutively, we detected an additional strong hormone-independent DNase I hypersensitive site, catD-HS4, located at position -4.3 Kb. This region might control the constitutive over-expression of cathepsin D in hormone-independent breast cancer cells. All together, these data demonstrate that a local reorganization of the chromatin structure over pS2 and cathepsin D promoters accompanies the establishment of the hormone-independent phenotype of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082942801,"The WT1 tumor suppressor gene, implicated in hereditofamilial and sporadic Wilms' tumor, is required for normal renal development and is up-regulated during the mesenchymal-epithelial transition. NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing WT1 were less proliferative, larger in size and more firmly attached to tissue culture plastic, suggesting an alteration of their state of differentiation. These cells were studied in vivo by subcutaneous injection into nude mice. The resulting tumors exhibited epithelioid histopathology and formed desmosome-like structures. Molecular analyses of these WT1 expressing fibroblasts grown in culture and in nude mice revealed significant alterations in the expression of many kidney epithelial markers. These studies indicate that WT1 expression can initiate features of a program of epithelial differentiation consistent with a prominent role for WT1 in the mesenchymal epithelial transition that occurs during renal development. Through this work we identified a number of novel target genes for the WT1 transcription factor, including uvomorulin, integrin alpha8 and perlecan, and suggest that WTI may activate the IGF-II gene, also implicated in the development of Wilms' tumor."

https://openalex.org/W1966106148,"Utilizing the cytoplasmic tail of Transforming Growth Factor Receptor Type II (TGFβ RII) as bait in a yeast two hybrid system, we have identified human cyclin B2 as a direct physical partner of TGFβ RII. Analysis of deletion mutants of glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-cyclin B2 mapped its binding domain for TGFβ RII to the C-terminal and revealed a negative regulatory region immediately upstream of the cyclin box. Using recombinant proteins, Cdc2 was demonstrated to indirectly interact with TGFβ RII via cyclin B2. This interaction was reproduced in THP-1 monocytic cells, where TGFβ treatment markedly enhanced the ability of cyclin B2 and, correspondingly, Cdc2 from TGFβ-treated THP-l cells, to bind the GST-TGFβ RII fusion protein. More importantly, TGFβ RII co-precipitated with cyclin B2 in TGFβ-treated THP-1 cells. TGFβ treatment also caused threonine phosphorylation of Cdc2 in the TGFβ RII-cyclin B2-Cdc2 complex in THP1 cells, in parallel with down regulation of Cdc2 function as measured by histone H1 kinase activity. Cyclin B1 had the same capacity to bind TGFβ RII and mediate indirect Cdc2 binding. These results suggest an alternative mechanism that cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase caused by TGFβ may, in part, be due to inactivation of cyclin B/Cdc2 kinase, which is needed for entry into the G2/M phase."
https://openalex.org/W2325498452,"Cells from patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) are defective in the activation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation damage. In order to understand the role of ATM in checkpoint control we investigated whether Schizosaccaromyces pombe chk1, a protein kinase implicated in controlling the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, might alter the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. The fission yeast chkl gene was cloned into an EBV-based vector under the control of a metallothionein promoter and transfected into A-T lymphoblastoid cells. Induction of chk1 enhanced the survival of an A-T cell line in response to radiation exposure as determined by cell viability and reduction of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations. This can be accounted for at least in part by the restoration of the G2 checkpoint to chk1 expressing cells. There was no evidence that chk1 expression corrected either the G1/S checkpoint or radioresistant DNA synthesis in S phase in these cells. These results suggest that chk1 when overexpressed acts downstream from ATM to restore the G2 checkpoint in these cells and correct the radiosensitive phenotype. These data allow us to dissociate individual checkpoint events and relate them to the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004545851,"Adenovirus early region 1A (Ad E1A) is a multifunctional protein which is essential for adenovirus-mediated transformation and oncogenesis. Whilst E1A is generally considered to exert its influence on recipient cells through regulation of transcription it also increases the level of cellular p53 by increasing the protein half-life. With this in view, we have investigated the relationship of Ad E1A to the proteasome, which is normally responsible for degradation of p53. Here we have shown that both Ad5 and Ad12 E1A 12S and 13S proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated with proteasomes and that the larger Ad12 E1A protein binds strongly to at least three components of the 26S but not 20S proteasome. One of these interacting species has been identified as mammalian SUG1, a proteasome regulatory component which also plays a role in the cell as a mediator of transcription. In vitro assays have demonstrated a direct interaction between Ad12 E1A 13S protein and mouse SUG1. Following infection of human cells with Ad5 wt and Ad5 mutants with lesions in the E1A gene it has been shown that human SUG1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with full-length E1A and with E1A carrying a deletion in conserved region 1 which is the region considered to be responsible for increased expression of p53. We have concluded therefore that Ad E1A binds strongly to SUG1 but that this interaction is not responsible for inhibition of proteasome activity. This is consistent with the observation that purified Ad12 E1A inhibits the activity of the purified 20S but not 26S proteasomes. We have also demonstrated that SUG1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with SV40 T and therefore we suggest that this may represent a common interaction of transforming proteins of DNA tumour viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2322208399,"We targeted expression of human/fly chimeric Bcr-Abl proteins to the developing central nervous system (CNS) and eye imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster. Neural expression of human/fly chimeric P210 Bcr-Abl or P185 Bcr-Abl rescued abl mutant flies from pupal lethality, indicating that P210 and P185 Bcr-Abl can substitute functionally for Drosophila Abl during axonogenesis. However, increased levels of neurally expressed P210 or P185 Bcr-Abl but not Drosophila Abl produced CNS defects and lethality. Expression of P210 or P185 in the eye imaginal disc produced a dominant rough eye phenotype that was dependent on dosage of the transgene. Drosophila Enabled, previously identified as a suppressor of the abl mutant phenotype and substrate for Drosophila Abl kinase, had markedly increased phosphotyrosine levels in Bcr-Abl expressing Drosophila, indicating that it is a substrate for Bcr-Abl as well. Drosophila, therefore, is a suitable model system to identify Bcr-Abl interactions important for signal transduction and oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2038028772,"The VEGFR3/FLT4 receptor, which is involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, binds and phosphorylates SHC proteins on tyrosine residues. SHC contains two phosphotyrosine interaction domains: a PTB (Phosphotyrosine Binding) and a SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain. Previous studies have shown that SHC proteins are phosphorylated on Y239/Y240 and Y313 (Y317 in humans) by tyrosine kinases such as the EGF and IL3 receptors. We have investigated which of the SHC tyrosine residues are targeted by the VEGFR3/FLT4 kinase and the role of the SHC PTB and SH2 domains in this process. Our results show that Y239/Y240 and Y313 are simultaneously phosphorylated by the kinase, creating GRB2 binding sites. Mutation of SHC PTB, but not SH2, domain interferes with the SHC phosphorylation by VEGFR3/FLT4. Soft agar assay experiments revealed that the VEGFR3/FLT4 transforming capacity is increased by the mutation of Y239/Y240 to phenylalanines in SHC, suggesting that these two residues mediate an inhibitory signal for cell growth. Mutation of the two phosphorylation sites increases this effect, suggesting that they have a synergistic role."

https://openalex.org/W2332835363,"A community effect was found to occur between heterogeneous tumor cell populations leading to an overall increased tumorigenicity without a clonal dominance of the more tumorigenic clone. In the rat bladder carcinoma cell line NBT-II, this effect appears mediated by the Fibroblast Growth Factor-1 (FGF-1) through either a direct or an indirect signaling pathway. Neovascularization induced by FGF-1 was found not to be responsible for the community effect. The present study shows that the community effect does not involve a direct FGF-1 signaling since tumor cells expressing a dominant-negative FGF receptor mutant were still responding to the highly tumorigenic FGF-1 expressing cells. Tumors arising from inoculates of the FGF-1 producing NBT-II cells mixed with non tumorigenic epithelial MDCK cells contain only the tumorigenic cells indicating that MDCK cells may exerce a helper effect for the growth of the tumor not dependant on their own growth. Therefore the helper function of MDCK cells must be distinguished from a community effect where the contribution of low tumorigenic cells not only provides an in vivo growth advantage to few highly tumorigenic cells but become themselves highly tumorigenic indicating that the community effect may require cell-cell specific co-operativity independent from an helper effect."
https://openalex.org/W2323570835,"The NF1 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene, contains a GAP related domain (GRD) which accelerates hydrolysis of ras-bound GTP to GDP, thereby converting the ras oncogene from its active to inactive form. Two forms of the NF1 GRD transcript (Type I and Type II) are differentially expressed in neuroectodermal tumor tissue relative to differentiated neural cells, and in gastric cancer cell lines relative to normal stomach mucosa. We measured relative expression of NF1 Type II and Type I isoforms in cultured normal and malignant human ovarian surface epithelial cells(HOSE) and in invasive and borderline ovarian tumor tissue. We demonstrated an 11-fold increase in Type II: Type I ratio in 7 HOSE cultures relative to eight ovarian cancer cell lines. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in Type II isoform expression and increase in Type I expression in ovarian cancer cells and tumor tissue relative to HOSE cells. We also demonstrate an increase in Type II: Type I ratio, and a decrease in cell proliferation rate in three ovarian cancer cell lines on treatment with retinoic acid. We propose that differential expression of the NF1 Type I and Type II isoforms is related to cellular differentiation in ovarian epithelial cancer and strategies based on alteration in NF1 isoform expression may have thera-peutic potential in ovarian malignancies."
