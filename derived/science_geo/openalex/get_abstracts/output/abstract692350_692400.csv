Here, nonhuman primates that received mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 were boosted at week 41 with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron. Neutralizing titers against D614G were 4,760 and 270 reciprocal ID50 at week 6 (peak) and week 41 (preboost), respectively, and 320 and 110 for Omicron. 2 weeks after the boost, titers against D614G and Omicron increased to 5,360 and 2,980 for mRNA-1273 boost and 2,670 and 1,930 for mRNA-Omicron, respectively. Similar increases against BA.2 were observed. Following either boost, 70%–80% of spike-specific B cells were cross-reactive against WA1 and Omicron.

However, the timing and selection of a boost is a major scientific and clinical challenge during this evolving pandemic in which emerging VOC have distinctive patterns of transmission and virulence and against which vaccine-elicited antibody neutralization is reduced. The most recent VOC, B.1.1.529, henceforth referred to by its WHO designation of Omicron, was first identified in South Africa in November 2021 and was associated with a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases (Cele et al., 2022Cele S. Jackson L. Khoury D.S. Khan K. Moyo-Gwete T. Tegally H. San J.E. Cromer D. Scheepers C.

Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients in South Africa During the COVID-19 omicron wave compared With previous waves.JAMA. 2022; 327: 583-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Omicron is highly contagious, with a significant transmission advantage compared with Delta, which until recently was the dominant VOC worldwide (Viana et al., 2022Viana R. Moyo S. Amoako D.G. Tegally H. Scheepers C. Althaus C.L. Anyaneji U.J. Bester P.A. Boni M.F. Chand M. et al.Rapid Epidemic Expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Southern Africa.Nature. 2022; 603: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, if this advantage is due to differences in cell entry, enrichment in respiratory aerosols, or the ability to evade immunity conferred by vaccination or prior infection. Compared with the ancestral strain, the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron contains more than 30 mutations in the spike (S) gene, including S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, and Y505H in the receptor binding motif (RBM) alone. Neutralizing antibody titers in sera of individuals recently recovered from previous infection or shortly after immunization with two doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine are dramatically reduced to Omicron compared with the ancestral strains Wuhan-Hu-1, USA-WA1/2020 (WA1), and D614G. Numerous studies using both live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assays report a 60- to 80-fold reduction for convalescent sera and a 20- to 130-fold reduction for vaccinee sera (Edara et al., 2022Edara V.V.

Multiple reports have suggested that Omicron has reduced virulence compared with prior VOC in humans, mice, and hamsters (Davies et al., 2022Davies M.-A. Kassanjee R. Rousseau P. Morden E. Johnson L.

It is possible that reduced virulence of Omicron may result from preferential replication in the upper airway compared with the lungs, perhaps due to altered cellular tropism not reliant on expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Meng et al., 2022Meng B. Abdullahi A. Ferreira I.A.T.M. Goonawardane N. Saito A. Kimura I. Yamasoba D. Gerber P.P. Fatihi S.

However, the effect of any reduction in intrinsic viral pathogenicity may be somewhat offset in the context of reduced vaccine efficacy and enhanced virus transmission in human populations worldwide. Together, these data reinforce the value of boosting to limit the extent of infection from Omicron. Variant-matched boosts have been suggested as a strategy to enhance neutralizing and binding antibody titers to the corresponding VOC beyond the levels conferred by existing FDA-approved boosts, which are homologous to the original ancestral WA1-matched primary vaccine regimen. We previously showed that boosting mRNA-1273 immunized nonhuman primates (NHP) with either mRNA-1273 or a boost matched to the Beta VOC spike (mRNA-1273.351 or mRNA-Beta) resulted in a significant enhancement of neutralizing antibody responses across all VOC tested and an expansion of S-specific memory B cells with ∼80%–90% able to bind both WA1 and Beta spikes. Moreover, both boosts provided substantial and similar protection against Beta replication (Corbett et al., 2021aCorbett K.S. Gagne M. Wagner D.A. O’Conell S. Narpala S.R. Flebbe D.R. Andrew S.F. Davis R.L. Flynn B. et al.Protection against SARS-CoV-2 beta variant in mRNA-1273 vaccine-boosted nonhuman primates.Science. 2021; 374: eabl8912Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These NHP data were confirmed in a study in humans that compared an mRNA-1273 boost with mRNA-Beta ∼6 months after the participants had received the standard two-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine regimen (Choi et al., 2021Choi A. Koch M. Wu K. Chu L. Ma L. Hill A. Nunna N. Huang W. Oestreicher J. Colpitts T. et al.Safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variant mRNA vaccine boosters in healthy adults: an interim analysis.Nat. Med. 2021; 27: 2025-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following either boost, neutralizing titers were substantially increased against D614G and several variants including Beta and were comparable between boost groups. Of note, the level of neutralizing antibodies to Beta after either boost were about 10-fold higher than after the initial vaccination suggesting affinity maturation or epitope focusing of the B cell response. Together, these data suggest that the variant Beta boost did not uniquely enhance immunity or protection compared with existing ancestral strain-matched boosts. However, as Omicron contains more mutations in S compared with Beta and demonstrates even more substantial escape from vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies than Beta, it is unclear whether an Omicron-specific boost would provide an additional protective benefit against Omicron infection beyond that of WA1-matched boosts. The nonhuman primate (NHP) model has been useful for demonstrating immune correlates, mechanisms, and durability of vaccine-elicited protection against SARS-CoV-2 and has been largely predictive for what has been observed in humans in terms of protective efficacy (Corbett et al., 2021bCorbett K.S.

Here, we vaccinated NHP with 100 μg mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4, which is a similar dose and schedule as used in humans. Animals were then boosted about ∼9 months later with 50 μg of either a homologous dose of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529, which is matched to Omicron S (henceforth referred to as mRNA-Omicron). For the duration of these 9 months, we collected sera, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and nasal washes to analyze the kinetics of antibody binding and neutralization as well as the frequency of S-specific B cells for WA1 and Omicron as well as Beta and Delta. Four weeks after boost, NHP were challenged with Omicron. Viral replication in upper and lower airways and lung inflammation were measured to compare boost-elicited protection against Omicron. Indian-origin rhesus macaques (n = 8) were immunized with 100 μg of mRNA-1273 at weeks 0 and 4 (Figure S1A). Sera were collected at weeks 6 (peak) and 41 (memory) to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to WA1 S and a panel of VOC, including Omicron (Figure 1A). Unless stated otherwise, we used the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron for all analysis. At week 6, we observed a clear hierarchy of binding titers with WA1 > Delta > Beta > Omicron. Geometric mean titers (GMT) to WA1 and Omicron were 8 × 1019 and 3 × 1015 area under the curve (AUC). Antibody titers waned markedly by week 41, with GMT of 2 × 1012 and 2 × 108 AUC for WA1 and Omicron, reflecting a 7-log decline for each strain. Similar antibody kinetics and hierarchy of potency were observed when measuring binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the same variants, with titers to Omicron of 7 × 1011 AUC at week 6 and 8 × 107 AUC at week 41 (Figure 1B). Nine months after the second dose of mRNA-1273 (week 41), NHP were boosted with 50 μg of homologous mRNA-1273 or heterologous virus challenge-matched mRNA-Omicron (n = 4/group) (Table S1). S-binding titers were restored to the same level as observed at week 6 following either a homologous or heterologous boost (Figure 1E), and titers to Omicron were still lower than all other variants.Figure 1Kinetics of serum antibody responses following mRNA-1273 immunization and boost with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-OmicronShow full caption(A–F) Sera were collected at weeks 6, 40 or 41, and 43 post-immunization.(A and B) IgG-binding titers to (A) variant S and (B) variant RBD expressed in AUC.(C and D) Neutralizing titers to (C) live virus and (D) lentiviral pseudovirus expressed as the reciprocal ID50.(E) p values listed for week 43 titers compared with week 6 or 41 as indicated in Figures 1A–1D.(F) Avidity index for WA1 S-2P- and Omicron S-2P-binding serum antibodies. p values for comparison of avidity index at weeks 6 versus 40 were identical for both boost cohorts.Circles represent geometric means.

See also Figure S1 for experimental schema and neutralizing responses to BA.2, Table S1 for mRNA-Omicron sequence, and Table S2 for detailed neutralizing titers. Neutralizing antibody titers were then assessed using a live-virus assay (Figure 1C; Table S2). At week 6, neutralizing titers were highest to D614G followed by Delta, then Beta and Omicron. Titers to all variants markedly declined by week 41, including a drop in reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) titers for D614G from 5,560 at week 6 to 330 at week 41 and for Omicron from 110 at week 6 to 33 at week 41. However, following either boost, neutralizing titers to D614G and Delta were increased similar to week 6 and titers to Beta and Omicron were greater than they had been at week 6 (Beta: p = 0.05 and 0.035; Omicron: p = 0.041 and 0.01 for mRNA-1273 and mRNA-Omicron, respectively) (Figure 1E). We substantiated these findings using a lentiviral pseudovirus neutralization assay similar to the one used to assess immune responses in human clinical trials (Figures 1D and 1E). Following either boost, pseudovirus neutralizing titers were greater to Beta and Omicron than they had been at the week 6 time point, including an increase in Omicron titers from 320 GMT to 2,980 GMT in the mRNA-1273 boost group and 1,930 GMT in the mRNA-Omicron boost group (Beta: p = 0.022 and < 0.0001; Omicron: p = 0.049 and 0.002 for mRNA-1273 and mRNA-Omicron, respectively). Further, titers to the two circulating sublineages of Omicron, BA.1 and BA.2, were comparable after either boost (Figure S1B). The increase in neutralizing titers to all VOC tested after the third dose could suggest continued antibody maturation (Gaebler et al., 2021Gaebler C. Wang Z. Lorenzi J.C.C. Muecksch F. Finkin S.

To extend this analysis, we measured antibody avidity over time following immunization (Figure 1F). Serum antibody avidity to WA1 S-2P increased from a geometric mean avidity index of 0.43–0.61 from weeks 6 to 40, a comparable increase to our previous findings (Corbett et al., 2021aCorbett K.S.

Similarly, avidity to Omicron S-2P rose from 0.44 to 0.67 (WA1 and Omicron S-2P: p < 0.0001). Following the boost, no further change was observed (p > 0.05). Collectively, these data show that boosting with the homologous mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron leads to comparable and significant increases in neutralizing antibody responses against all VOC including Omicron. Upper and lower airway antibody responses are critical for mediating protection against SARS-CoV-2 and were assessed following immunization. Nasal washes (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) were collected at weeks 8 (4 weeks after the initial mRNA-1273 immunizations), 39 (preboost), and 43 (2 weeks after the boost). At all time points, BAL and NW IgG S-binding titers followed the hierarchy of WA1 > Delta > Beta > Omicron (Figures 2A and 2B ), the same trend detected in our serological assays. In BAL, immediately prior to the boost, GMT were 6.8 × 106, 4.0 × 106, 1.3 × 106, and 2.4 × 104 AUC for WA1, Delta, Beta, and Omicron, respectively. These titers correlated with a 2-fold reduction for Delta compared with WA1, a 5-fold reduction for Beta, and a 280-fold reduction for Omicron. Following either boost, titers were increased by 3–4 logs for all variants. In NW, titers decreased from ∼1011 for WA1, Delta, and Beta at week 8 to 1.3 × 106, 3.7 × 105, and 1.9 × 105 at week 39 for WA1, Delta, and Beta, respectively. GMT to Omicron similarly declined from 8.8 × 108 to 8.7 × 103 AUC and were lower than WA1 and all other variants. Consistent with the findings in the BAL, either boost increased nasal antibody titers ∼6–7 logs, with a GMT of ∼1012 for WA1, Delta, and Beta and ∼1010 for Omicron. In a number of prior NHP studies, we have not been able to detect antibody neutralizing titers using pseudo- or live-virus assays from NW or BAL. However, based on its high sensitivity, we have used the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) inhibition assay to measure antibody function as a surrogate for neutralization capacity (Corbett et al., 2021aCorbett K.S.

Although the antigen for determination of binding titers was wild-type (WT) S, our ACE2 inhibition assay used stabilized S-2P (Table S3). In the BAL, 25%–50% median binding inhibition was observed for all variants at week 8, except for Omicron S-2P in which binding inhibition was low to undetectable (Figure 2C). ACE2 binding inhibition declined to a median of <15% for all variants by week 39. Following a boost with either mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron, we observed greater ACE2 inhibition, although this increase did not reach significance due to the small number of animals in each group. Of note, although ACE2 inhibition of Omicron S-2P increased following the boost, it remained lower than all other variants. In the upper airway, ACE2 inhibition was low to undetectable at week 39 following the initial vaccine regimen for all variants. However, after either boost, there was an increase across all variants including Omicron to values higher than the initial peak at week 8 (Figure 2D). Thus, boosting with either vaccine was important for enhancing mucosal antibody binding and neutralization responses.

https://openalex.org/W4224232962,"The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infected many vaccinated and convalescent individuals1-3. Despite the reduced protection from infection, individuals who received three doses of an mRNA vaccine were highly protected from more serious consequences of infection4. Here we examine the memory B cell repertoire in a longitudinal cohort of individuals receiving three mRNA vaccine doses5,6. We find that the third dose is accompanied by an increase in, and evolution of, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cells. The increase is due to expansion of memory B cell clones that were present after the second dose as well as the emergence of new clones. The antibodies encoded by these cells showed significantly increased potency and breadth when compared with antibodies obtained after the second dose. Notably, the increase in potency was especially evident among newly developing clones of memory cells, which differed from persisting clones in targeting more conserved regions of the RBD. Overall, more than 50% of the analysed neutralizing antibodies in the memory compartment after the third mRNA vaccine dose neutralized the Omicron variant. Thus, individuals receiving three doses of an mRNA vaccine have a diverse memory B cell repertoire that can respond rapidly and produce antibodies capable of clearing even diversified variants such as Omicron. These data help to explain why a third dose of a vaccine that was not specifically designed to protect against variants is effective against variant-induced serious disease."
https://openalex.org/W4226021421,"Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but patients relapse, highlighting the need to understand the mechanisms of resistance. We discovered that in primary breast cancer, tumor cells that resist T cell attack are quiescent. Quiescent cancer cells (QCCs) form clusters with reduced immune infiltration. They also display superior tumorigenic capacity and higher expression of chemotherapy resistance and stemness genes. We adapted single-cell RNA-sequencing with precise spatial resolution to profile infiltrating cells inside and outside the QCC niche. This transcriptomic analysis revealed hypoxia-induced programs and identified more exhausted T cells, tumor-protective fibroblasts, and dysfunctional dendritic cells inside clusters of QCCs. This uncovered differential phenotypes in infiltrating cells based on their intra-tumor location. Thus, QCCs constitute immunotherapy-resistant reservoirs by orchestrating a local hypoxic immune-suppressive milieu that blocks T cell function. Eliminating QCCs holds the promise to counteract immunotherapy resistance and prevent disease recurrence in TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4224213348,"Interest in harnessing natural killer (NK) cells for cancer immunotherapy is rapidly growing. However, efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapy remains limited in most trials. Strategies to augment the killing efficacy of NK cells are thus much needed. In the current study, we found that mitochondrial apoptosis (mtApoptosis) pathway is essential for efficient NK killing, especially at physiologically relevant effector-to-target ratios. Furthermore, NK cells can prime cancer cells for mtApoptosis and mitochondrial priming status affects cancer-cell susceptibility to NK-mediated killing. Interestingly, pre-activating NK cells confers on them resistance to BH3 mimetics. Combining BH3 mimetics with NK cells synergistically kills cancer cells in vitro and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. The ideal BH3 mimetic to use in such an approach can be predicted by BH3 profiling. We herein report a rational and precision strategy to augment NK-based immunotherapy, which may be adaptable to T cell-based immunotherapies as well."
https://openalex.org/W4224243049,"Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) makes ancestral genetic polymorphisms persist during rapid speciation events, inducing incongruences between gene trees and species trees. ILS has complicated phylogenetic inference in many lineages, including hominids. However, we lack empirical evidence that ILS leads to incongruent phenotypic variation. Here, we performed phylogenomic analyses to show that the South American monito del monte is the sister lineage of all Australian marsupials, although over 31% of its genome is closer to the Diprotodontia than to other Australian groups due to ILS during ancient radiation. Pervasive conflicting phylogenetic signals across the whole genome are consistent with some of the morphological variation among extant marsupials. We detected hundreds of genes that experienced stochastic fixation during ILS, encoding the same amino acids in non-sister species. Using functional experiments, we confirm how ILS may have directly contributed to hemiplasy in morphological traits that were established during rapid marsupial speciation ca. 60 mya."
https://openalex.org/W4226162365,"The emergence of Omicron (B.1.1.529), a new Variant of Concern in the COVID-19 pandemic, while accompanied by the ongoing Delta variant infection, has once again fueled fears of a new infection wave and global health concern. In the Omicron variant, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein is heavily mutated, a feature critical for the transmission rate of the virus by interacting with hACE2. In this study, we used a combination of conventional and advanced neural network-based in silico approaches to predict how these mutations would affect the spike protein. The results demonstrated a decrease in the electrostatic potentials of residues corresponding to receptor recognition sites, an increase in the alkalinity of the protein, a change in hydrophobicity, variations in functional residues, and an increase in the percentage of alpha-helix structure. Moreover, several mutations were found to modulate the immunologic properties of the potential epitopes predicted from the spike protein. Our next step was to predict the structural changes of the spike and their effect on its interaction with the hACE2. The results revealed that the RBD of the Omicron variant had a higher affinity than the reference. Moreover, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations concluded that the RBD of the Omicron variant exhibits a more dispersed interaction network since mutations resulted in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with hACE2."

This study aimed to assess the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including anti-spike protein 1 (S1) immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) total Ig, anti-S1 IgA, and neutralizing antibody against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 over time in a cohort of patients who were previously infected with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Between March and May 2020, 531 individuals with virologically confirmed cases of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in our immunological study. Blood samples were collected at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post symptom onset or detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in asymptomatic individuals). The neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 95.2%, 86.7%, 85.0%, and 85.4% of recovered COVID-19 patients at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after symptom onset, respectively. The seropositivity rate of anti-S1 IgG, anti-RBD total Ig, anti-S1 IgA, and neutralizing titers remained at 68.6%, 89.6%, 77.1%, and 85.4%, respectively, at 12 months after symptom onset. We observed a high level of correlation between neutralizing and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibody titers. The half-life of neutralizing titers was estimated at 100.7 days (95% confidence interval = 44.5-327.4 days, R2 = 0.106). These results support that the decline in serum antibody levels over time in both participants with severe disease and mild disease were depended on the symptom severity, and the individuals with high IgG antibody titers experienced a significantly longer persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than those with lower titers."
https://openalex.org/W4224263981,"Various efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates have been employed in the United States. We sought to rapidly investigate public reactions to these efforts to increase vaccination, including self-reported responses to widespread reduced masking behavior, monetary incentive programs to get vaccinated, and work vaccination requirements. Using a unique method for data collection (Random Domain Intercept Technology), we captured a large ( N = 14,152), broad-based sample of the United States Web-using population (data collected from June 30 –July 26, 2021). About 3/4 of respondents reported being vaccinated. The likelihood of vaccination and vaccination intention differed across various demographic indicators (e.g., gender, age, income, political leaning). We observed mixed reactions to efforts aimed at increasing vaccination rates among unvaccinated respondents. While some reported that specific efforts would increase their likelihood of getting vaccinated (between 16% and 32%), others reported that efforts would decrease their likelihood of getting vaccinated (between 17% and 42%). Reactions differed by general vaccination intention, as well as other demographic indicators (e.g., race, education). Our results highlight the need to fully understand reactions to policy changes, programs, and mandates before they are communicated to the public and employed. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of understanding how reactions differ across groups, as this information can assist in targeting intervention efforts and minimizing potentially differential negative impact."

However, the potential geographic extent of ASF infection is unknown. Here we combined a modeling framework with the assembled contemporary records of ASF cases and multiple covariates to predict the risk distribution of ASF at a global scale. Local spatial variations in ASF risk derived from domestic pigs is influenced strongly by livestock factors, while the risk of having ASF in wild boars is mainly associated with natural habitat covariates. The risk maps show that ASF is to be ubiquitous in many areas, with a higher risk in areas in the northern hemisphere. Nearly half of the world’s domestic pigs (1.388 billion) are in the high-risk zones. Our results provide a better understanding of the potential distribution beyond the current geographical scope of the disease."

This study aimed to promote a better cross-cultural understanding of the correlates and predictors of favorable attitudes toward cosmetic surgery among women in China (an Eastern country where cosmetic surgery is increasing most rapidly) and the Netherlands (a Western country). Questionnaire data were obtained from 763 adult women; 245 were Chinese women in China (Mage = 29.71), 265 were Chinese women in the Netherlands (Mage = 25.81), and 253 were Dutch women (Mage = 29.22). Facial appearance concerns and materialistic belief were significant predictors of favorable attitudes towards cosmetic surgery for all three cultural groups. Body appreciation was a significant positive predictor among Chinese women in both China and the Netherlands, whereas age and beauty-ideal internalization were significant positive predictors only among Chinese women in China. The findings and their implications are discussed with respect to the characteristics of Chinese culture that could explain the identified differences between Chinese and Dutch women."
https://openalex.org/W4224230339,"National Health Service (NHS) 111 helpline was set up to improve access to urgent care in England, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of first-contact health services. Following trusted, authoritative advice is crucial for improved clinical outcomes. We examine patient and call-related characteristics associated with compliance with advice given in NHS 111 calls. The importance of health interactions that are not face-to-face has recently been highlighted by COVID-19 pandemic. In this retrospective cohort study, NHS 111 call records were linked to urgent and emergency care services data. We analysed data of 3,864,362 calls made between October 2013 and September 2017 relating to 1,964,726 callers across London. A multiple logistic regression was used to investigate associations between compliance with advice given and patient and call characteristics. Caller's action is 'compliant with advice given if first subsequent service interaction following contact with NHS 111 is consistent with advice given. We found that most calls were made by women (58%), adults aged 30-59 years (33%) and people in the white ethnic category (36%). The most common advice was for caller to contact their General Practitioner (GP) or other local services (18.2%) with varying times scales. Overall, callers followed advice given in 49% of calls. Compliance with triage advice was more likely in calls for children aged <16 years, women, those from Asian/Asian British ethnicity, and calls made out of hours. The highest compliance was among callers advised to self-care without the need to contact any other healthcare service. This is one of the largest studies to describe pathway adherence following telephone advice and associated clinical and demographic features. These results could inform attempts to improve caller compliance with advice given by NHS 111, and as the NHS moves to more hybrid way of working, the lessons from this study are key to the development of remote healthcare services going forward."
https://openalex.org/W4224235425,"Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) threaten human health and cause a large number of hospitalizations every year. However, as one of the most common pathogen that cause acute respiratory tract infection, the molecular epidemiological information relating to human adenoviruses (HAdVs) among patients with SARI is limited. Here, we evaluate the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized patients with SARI from January 2017 to December 2019 in Huzhou, China.From January 2017 to December 2019, a total of 657 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from inpatients with SARI were screened for HAdV and other common respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time PCR. All samples that tested positive for HAdV were further typed by sequencing partial sequences of hexon gene. Genotypes of HAdV were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software.251 (38.20%) samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus. HAdV was the second common viral pathogen detected, with a detection rate of 7.08%. Infection with HAdV was found in all age groups tested (0<2, 2<5, 5<15, 15<50, 50<65, ≥65). Children under 15 years old accounted for 84.62% (44/52) of the infections. Higher activity of HAdV infection could be seen in spring-early autumn season. Seven different types of HAdV belonging to 4 species (HAdV-A, B, C, E) were identified in hospitalized SARI cases, with HAdV-B3 as the most prevalent HAdV types, followed by HAdV-B7 and HAdV-E4. HAdV-B3 was the most frequently detected genotype in 2017 and 2019, accounting for 75.00% (9/12) and 63.64% (7/11) of typed HAdV infections in 2017 and 2019, respectively. No predominant strain was responsible for HAdV infections in 2018, although HAdV-B7 (28.57%, 2/7) and HAdV-C1 (28.57%, 2/7) were the major causative genotypes.This study revealed the prevalence and the molecular epidemiological characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized patients with SARI in Huzhou from January 2017 to December 2019. The HAdV prevalence is related to age and season. As the most prevalent HAdV types, HAdV-B3 was co-circulating with other types and presented an alternate prevalence pattern."
https://openalex.org/W4224242071,"Digital platforms such as Airbnb have become a major economic and political force in recent years, presenting themselves as a “sharing economy”–a new, more just way of organizing social and economic activity–while functioning as owners and managers of proprietary markets. These platforms have in recent years been subject to variegated but growing regulations, begging questions of how these affect their platform markets. This paper examines these claims by a large-scale international comparative analysis of the revenue distribution of Airbnb markets in 97 cities and regions, focusing on the level and evolution of revenue inequality, and estimating the racial and gender revenue gaps by using machine learning classification of host profile pictures. Examining 834,722 listings, 513,785 hosts, and 13,466,854 reviews, the paper finds an average Gini coefficient of 0.68, implying that a majority of the market revenue tends to go to about 10% of the hosts. The level of centralization varies significantly across cities, but is consistently growing over time, with government regulation appearing as a counteracting factor, which however only temporarily slows down the growing dominance of a small minority of large-scale hosts. The paper furthermore finds large gender and race revenue gaps, as Black hosts receive on average 22% less revenue for their listings, and women an average of 12% less. These findings contribute important data to ongoing academic and policy debates, as well as a starting point for further research on inequality in the sharing economy, and how it can be regulated."
https://openalex.org/W4224291746,"Background Studies indicate that physical activity during leisure and work have opposite associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, referred to as the physical activity health paradox. We investigated how sedentary behaviour and physical activity types during leisure and work are associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), waist circumference (WC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in an adult general population sample using compositional data analysis. Methods Participants wore accelerometers for 7 days (right thigh and iliac crest; 24 h/day) and had their SBP, WC, and LDL-C measured. Accelerometer data was analysed using the software Acti4 to derive daily time spent in sedentary behaviour and physical activity types. The measure of association was quantified by reallocating time between sedentary behaviour and 1) walking, and 2) high-intensity physical activity (HIPA; sum of climbing stairs, running, cycling, and rowing), during both domains. Results In total, 652 participants were included in the analyses (median wear time: 6 days, 23.8 h/day). During leisure, the results indicated that less sedentary behaviour and more walking or more HIPA was associated with lower SBP, while during work, the findings indicated an association with higher SBP. During both domains, the findings indicated that less sedentary behaviour and more HIPA was associated with a smaller WC and lower LDL-C. However, the findings indicated less sedentary behaviour and more walking to be associated with a larger WC and higher LDL-C, regardless of domain. Conclusions During leisure, less sedentary behaviour and more walking or HIPA seems to be associated with a lower SBP, but, during work, it seems to be associated with a higher SBP. No consistent differences between domains were observed for WC and LDL-C. These findings highlight the importance of considering the physical activity health paradox, at least for some risk factors for CVD."

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new antibiotics to treat gonococcal infections. In our previous study, the gold-containing drug auranofin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against clinical isolates of N . gonorrhoeae , including multidrug-resistant strains. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo activity of auranofin against N . gonorrhoeae using a murine model of vaginal infection. A significant reduction in N . gonorrhoeae recovered from the vagina was observed for infected mice treated with auranofin compared to the vehicle over the course of treatment. Relative to the vehicle, after three and five days of treatment with auranofin, a 1.04 (91%) and 1.40 (96%) average log 10 -reduction of recovered N . gonorrhoeae was observed. In conclusion, auranofin has the potential to be further investigated as a novel, safe anti-gonococcal agent to help meet the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents for N . gonorrhoeae infection."
https://openalex.org/W4224255241,"This paper investigates the causal relationship between bank development and economic growth in the US before and after the financial crisis in 2008. Based on the quarterly panel data of US states for 2002Q1-2012Q4, this paper uses two-step system GMM method to test the long-term and short-term impact of bank on growth. In addition, panel Granger causality test is used to verify the causality between bank and growth in different periods. The study finds that banks have played a significant role in the long-run economic growth process and there exists a bidirectional causality between bank and growth among US states. In the short term, the financial crisis has corrected the short-run relationship between bank and growth. The relationship between bank and growth has changed from one-way causality before the crisis to two-way causality after the crisis. Before the crisis, economic growth promotes bank credit, but bank development does not promote growth. After the crisis, banks play the role of economic driver through credit, savings and services, and economic growth drives bank savings and scale expansion. The financial intermediary service functions of banks, especially credit to private sector and absorbing savings to transfer loans, determine the role of bank development in economic growth. Policy makers should support bank development in the long run to establish a mature financial intermediary system and promote regional economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4224264527,"Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, a major cause of kidney allograft dysfunction, has been linked to premature cellular senescence. The mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin protects from senescence in experimental models, but its antiproliferative properties have raised concern early after transplantation particularly at higher doses. Its effect on senescence has not been studied in kidney transplantation, yet. Rapamycin was applied to a rat kidney transplantation model (3 mg/kg bodyweight loading dose, 1.5 mg/kg bodyweight daily dose) for 7 days. Low Rapamycin trough levels (2.1-6.8 ng/mL) prevented the accumulation of p16INK4a positive cells in tubules, interstitium, and glomerula. Expression of the cytokines MCP-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α, defining the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype, was abrogated. Infiltration with monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was reduced and tubular function was preserved by Rapamycin. Inhibition of mTOR was not associated with impaired structural recovery, higher glucose levels, or weight loss. mTOR inhibition with low-dose Rapamycin in the immediate posttransplant period protected from premature cellular senescence without negative effects on structural and functional recovery from preservation/reperfusion damage, glucose homeostasis, and growth in a rat kidney transplantation model. Reduced senescence might maintain the renal regenerative capacity rendering resilience to future injuries resulting in protection from interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy."

The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to evaluate the insomnia and the sleep apnea was evaluated through a simple questionnaire method. The blood samples were collected to perform significant blood tests for clinical investigations. Current research revealed that the individuals in the educational community had poor sleep quality. A total of 1998 individuals from the educational community were surveyed, 1584 (79.28%) of whom had a sleep disorders, including insomnia (45.20%) and sleep apnea (34.08%). The measured onset of age for males and females was 30.35 years and 31.07 years respectively. The Clinical investigations showed that the sleep had significant impact on the hematology of the patients. Higher levels of serum uric acid and blood sugar were recorded with a sleep disorder. The individuals of the educational community were using the sleeping pills. The other associated diseases were mild tension, headaches, migraines, depression, diabetes, obesity, and myopia. The use of beverage, bad mood, medical condition, mental stress, disturbed circadian rhythms, workload and extra use of smartphone were major risk factors of sleep disorders. It was concluded that the insomnia was more prevalent than the sleep apnea. Furthermore, life changes events were directly linked with disturbance of sleep.

They were asked to provide a temporal type of CPS in weeks, together with their level of confidence for each prediction (0-100%). We analyzed the accuracy of CPS, the association between CPS and the prognostic confidence, and the characteristics of patients showing inaccurate CPS.A total of 200 advanced cancer patients were enrolled and the median overall survival was 7.6 months. CPS was accurate in 67 (33.5%) patients, underestimated in 87 (43.5%), and overestimated in 46 (23.0%). The overall accuracy of CPS for 12-week, 24-week, 36-week, and 48-week survival was 83.0%, 72.0%, 75.5%, and 74.0%, respectively. The specificity was highest for 12-week survival (90.2%) and the sensitivity was highest for 48-week survival (96.1%). The sensitivity of 12-week CPS was 51.4% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.87). The prognostic confidence of clinicians was not significantly associated with the accuracy of prediction (P = 0.359). Patients with overestimated survival had significantly poorer global health status and physical/role/emotional functioning in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Additionally, they showed significantly higher levels of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, and loss of appetite.The overall accuracy of CPS in predicting 12-week to 48-week survival was high in medical oncology outpatients. However the sensitivity of 12-week CPS was low and prognostic confidence was not associated with the accuracy of CPS.

https://openalex.org/W4224249007,"Humans use a family of more than 400 olfactory receptors (ORs) to detect odorants. However, deorphanization of ORs is a critical issue because the functional properties of more than 80% of ORs remain unknown, thus, hampering our understanding of the relationship between receptor function and perception. HEK293 cells are the most commonly used heterologous expression system to determine the function of a given OR; however, they cannot functionally express a majority of ORs probably due to a lack of factor(s) required in cells in which ORs function endogenously. Interestingly, ORs have been known to be expressed in a variety of cells outside the nose and play critical physiological roles. These findings prompted us to test the capacity of cells to functionally express a specific repertoire of ORs. In this study, we selected three cell lines that endogenously express functional ORs. We demonstrated that human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP) cell lines successfully identified novel ligands for ORs that were not recognized when expressed in HEK293 cells. Further experiments suggested that the LNCaP cell line was effective for functional expression of ORs, especially with a high basal activity, which impeded the sensitive detection of ligand-mediated activity of ORs. This report provides an efficient functional assay system for a specific repertoire of ORs that cannot be characterized in current cell systems."

Stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis) are one of the only native non-waterfowl bird species that can be legally hunted in Australia, where it is commonly hunted with lead shot. The aim of this study was to characterize lead contamination in quail harvested with lead-based ammunition. The frequency, dimensions, and number of lead fragments embedded in carcasses were assessed through use of radiography (X-ray). From these data, the average quantity of lead available to scavenging wildlife was estimated along with potential risks to human consumers. We radiographed 37 stubble quail harvested by hunters using 12-gauge (2.75"") shotguns to fire shells containing 28 g (1 oz) of #9 (2 mm or 0.08"" diameter) lead shot in western Victoria, Australia, in Autumn 2021. Radiographs revealed that 81% of carcasses contained embedded pellets and/or fragments with an average of 1.62 embedded pellets detected per bird. By excising and weighing a sample of 30 shotgun pellets (all had a mass of 0.75 grain or 48.6 mg), we calculated an average lead load of 78 mg/100 g of body mass. This was a conservative estimate, because fragments were not considered. This level of lead contamination was comparable to hunted bird species examined using similar methods in Europe. The quantity and characteristics of lead ammunition residues found suggest that predatory and scavenging wildlife and some groups of human consumers will be at risk of negative health impacts."

Effective screening would facilitate timely and appropriate prevention and management of preeclampsia.To develop an early cost-effectiveness analysis to assess both costs and health outcomes of a new screening test for preeclampsia from a healthcare payer perspective, in the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.A decision tree over a 9-month time horizon was developed to explore the cost-effectiveness of the new screening test for preeclampsia compared to the current screening strategy. The new test strategy is being developed so that it can stratify healthy low risk nulliparous women early in pregnancy to either a high-risk group with a risk of 1 in 6 or more of developing preeclampsia, or a low-risk group with a risk of 1 in 100 or less. The model simulated 25 plausible scenarios in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women, in which the sensitivity and specificity of the new test were varied to set a benchmark for the minimum test performance that is needed for the test to become cost-effective. The input parameters and costs were mainly derived from published literature. The main outcome was incremental costs per preeclampsia case averted, expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty.Base case results showed that the new test strategy would be more effective and less costly compared to the current situation in the UK. In the Netherlands, the majority of scenarios would be cost-effective from a threshold of €50,000 per preeclampsia case averted, while in Ireland and Sweden, the vast majority of scenarios would be considered cost-effective only when a threshold of €100,000 was used. In the best case analyses, ICERs were more favourable in all four participating countries. Aspirin effectiveness, prevalence of preeclampsia, accuracy of the new screening test and cost of regular antenatal care were identified as driving factors for the cost-effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia.The results indicate that the new screening test for preeclampsia has potential to be cost-effective. Further studies based on proven accuracy of the test will confirm whether the new screening test is a cost-effective additional option to the current situation."
https://openalex.org/W4225985452,"More than a year since the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many questions about the disease COVID-19 have been answered; however, many more remain poorly understood. Although the situation continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations, both for potential future waves, as well as the implications for future pandemics. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted population density (PWPD), some “stay at home” metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race/ethnicity, and chronic low-respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWPD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWPD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of “lock-down” orders should be tailored to the local PWPD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present."

The study setting is a hypothetical college campus of 5,000 students and 455 faculty members during the Fall 2021 academic semester, when the Delta variant was the predominant strain. For sensitivity analysis, we vary the screening frequency, daily vaccination rate, initial vaccine coverage, and screening and vaccination compliance; and consider scenarios that represent low/medium/high transmission and test efficacy. Model parameters come from publicly available or published sources.With low initial vaccine coverage (30% in our study), even aggressive vaccination and screening result in a high number of infections: 1,020 to 2,040 (1,530 to 2,480) with routine daily (every other day) screening of the unvaccinated; 280 to 900 with daily screening extended to the newly vaccinated in base- and worst-case scenarios, which respectively consider reproduction numbers of 4.75 and 6.75 for the Delta variant.Integrated vaccination and routine screening can allow for a safe opening of a college when both the vaccine effectiveness and the initial vaccine coverage are sufficiently high. The interventions need to be customized considering the initial vaccine coverage, estimated compliance, screening and vaccination capacity, disease transmission and adverse outcome rates, and the number of infections/peak hospitalizations the college is willing to tolerate."

The significance of training and education for experts has been increasingly acknowledged in Japan, where the number of infectious disease (ID) specialists is reportedly insufficient. In this paper, we report the results of a web-based survey that was conducted to reveal the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced medical students' awareness of ID specialists and future career choices.This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in March 2021 and targeted 717 medical students belonging to Medical School of Okayama University, Japan. The questionnaire consisted of four questions meant to assess students' knowledge and future intentions of becoming ID specialists.We obtained 328 eligible questionnaires (response rate: 45.7%). Of 227 (69.2%) students who were aware of ID specialists, 99 (43.6%) answered that they came to know about them only after the pandemic, 12 (3.7%) answered that their interest in being an ID specialist arose during the pandemic, while 36 (11.0%) responded that they would rather not become ID specialists. At the time of the survey, 5 students (1.5%) were aiming to become ID specialists.We observed a very low rate of interest to be an ID specialist among medical students. The experience of the pandemic does not seem to have influenced Japanese medical students to choose ID as a specialty for their careers. Continuous efforts to increase the number of ID specialists are necessary in Japan as a countermeasure against the coming pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4224240295,"At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing access to data (properly optimised regarding personal data protection) plays a crucial role in providing the general public and media with up-to-date information. Open datasets also represent one of the means for evaluation of the pandemic on a global level. The primary aim of this paper is to describe the methodological and technical framework for publishing datasets describing characteristics related to the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic (epidemiology, hospital-based care, vaccination), including the use of these datasets in practice. Practical aspects and experience with data sharing are discussed. As a reaction to the epidemic situation, a new portal COVID-19: Current Situation in the Czech Republic (https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19) was developed and launched in March 2020 to provide a fully-fledged and trustworthy source of information for the public and media. The portal also contains a section for the publication of (i) public open datasets available for download in CSV and JSON formats and (ii) authorised-access-only section where the authorised persons can (through an online generated token) safely visualise or download regional datasets with aggregated data at the level of the individual municipalities and regions. The data are also provided to the local open data catalogue (covering only open data on healthcare, provided by the Ministry of Health) and to the National Catalogue of Open Data (covering all open data sets, provided by various authorities/publishers, and harversting all data from local catalogues). The datasets have been published in various authentication regimes and widely used by general public, scientists, public authorities and decision-makers. The total number of API calls since its launch in March 2020 to 15 December 2020 exceeded 13 million. The datasets have been adopted as an official and guaranteed source for outputs of third parties, including public authorities, non-governmental organisations, scientists and online news portals. Datasets currently published as open data meet the 3-star open data requirements, which makes them machine-readable and facilitates their further usage without restrictions. This is essential for making the data more easily understandable and usable for data consumers. In conjunction with the strategy of the MH in the field of data opening, additional datasets meeting the already implemented standards will be also released, both on COVID-19 related and unrelated topics."
https://openalex.org/W4224241653,"The flipped classroom is a teaching strategy used to enhance the engagement of students in the learning process. Replacing didactic lectures with active learning strategies through flipped classroom sessions fosters independence and the opportunity for students to engage in different passive learning styles. Although many studies of the flipped classroom approach have been conducted with medical students, few have focused on the effect of flipped classroom sessions on students in other medical professional fields. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the flipped classroom approach on the performance of medical laboratory science students in a hematology course and their perception of the flipped classroom as an active learning strategy. In addition, students' perceptions regarding the flipped classroom as an active learning strategy were assessed. Of two cohorts in hematology courses, cohort 2 attended flipped classroom sessions, whereas cohort 1 underwent traditional class sessions. Students' learning outcomes, achievements and performance on examinations in hematology courses were assessed. In addition, a satisfaction survey was distributed to the students to evaluate their perception of the flipped classroom as a student-centred learning strategy. Students in cohort 2 performed significantly better in the knowledge and cognitive domains than did those in cohort 1 (p < 0.001). Cohort 2 students completed the course successfully with an average grade of 81%, and few students received low grades; in comparison, cohort 1 students completed the course with an average grade of 73%, and 7 students received a grade of F. Of students in cohort 2, 83% believed that the flipped classroom provided a better understanding of the subject matter and appropriate knowledge and skills. The results indicate the effectiveness of flipped classrooms as an active learning style in enabling students to obtain desirable knowledge and improve their academic performance. Moreover, students zrecognized that the flipped classroom as an active learning style was more beneficial than the traditional teaching approach."
https://openalex.org/W4224246019,"We sought to identify a usable biomarker from blood samples to characterize early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, in order to facilitate rapid diagnosis, early therapeutic intervention, and monitoring of clinical trials. We compared metabolites from blood plasma in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease patients with blood plasma from healthy controls using two different analytical platforms: Amino Acid Analyzer and Tandem Mass-Spectrometer. Early-stage Alzheimer’s patient blood samples were obtained during an FDA-approved Phase IIa clinical trial (Clinicaltrial.gov NCT03062449). Participants included 25 early-stage Alzheimer’s patients and 25 healthy controls in the United States. We measured concentrations of 2-aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate and taurine in blood plasma samples. We found that plasma concentrations of a phospholipid metabolite, 2-aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate, normalized by taurine concentrations, distinguish blood samples of patients with early-stage AD. This possible new Alzheimer’s biomarker may supplement clinical diagnosis for early detection of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4224222337,"The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical lifeworld of rehabilitation practitioners who work with patients in disordered states of consciousness (DoC) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We interviewed 21 practitioners using narrative interviewing methods from two specialty health systems that admit patients in DoC to inpatient rehabilitation. The overarching theme arising from the interview data is ""Experiencing ambiguity and uncertainty in clinical reasoning about consciousness"" when treating persons in DoC. We describe practitioners' practices of looking for consistency, making sense of ambiguous and hard to explain patient responses, and using trial and error or ""tinkering"" to care for patients. Due to scientific uncertainty about diagnosis and prognosis in DoC and ambiguity about interpretation of patient responses, working in the field of DoC disrupts the canonical meaning-making processes that practitioners have been trained in. Studying the lifeworld of rehabilitation practitioners through their story-making and story-telling uncovers taken-for-granted assumptions and normative structures that may exist in rehabilitation medical and scientific culture, including practitioner training. We are interested in understanding these canonical breaches in order to make visible how practitioners make meaning while treating patients."
https://openalex.org/W4224237424,"Natural ecosystems are comprised of diverse species and their interspecific interactions, in contrast to an ecological theory that predicts the instability of large ecological communities. This apparent gap has led ecologists to explore the mechanisms that allow complex communities to stabilize, even via environmental changes. A standard approach to tackling this complexity-stability problem is starting with a description of the ecological network of species and their interaction links, exemplified by a food web. This traditional description is based on the view that each species is in an active state; that is, each species constantly forages and reproduces. However, in nature, species' activities can virtually stop when hiding, resting, and diapausing or hibernating, resulting in overlooking another situation where they are inactive. Here I theoretically demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic change in active and inactive modes may be the key to understanding food web dynamics. Accurately switching activity modes can greatly stabilize otherwise unstable communities in which coexistence is impossible, further maintaining strong stabilization, even in a large complex community. I hypothesize that adaptive plastic change in activity modes may play a key role in maintaining ecological communities."
https://openalex.org/W4224244009,"Purpose The demand for high-throughput genetic profiling of somatic mutations in cancer tissues is growing. We sought to establish a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel test for clinical oncology practice. Methods Customized probes were designed to capture exonic regions of 141 genes selected for the panel, which was aimed for the detection of clinically actionable genetic variations in cancer, including KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , ALK , ROS1 , KIT and EGFR . The size of entire targeted regions is 0.8 Mb. Library preparation used NEBNext Ultra II FS kit coupled with target enrichment. Paired-end sequencing was run on Illumina NextSeq 500 at a read length of 150 nt. A bioinformatics workflow focusing on single nucleotide variant and short insertions and deletions (SNV/indel) discovery was established using open source, in-house and commercial software tools. Standard reference DNA samples were used in testing the sensitivity and precision and limit of detection in variant calling. Results The general performance of the panel was observed in pilot runs. Average total reads per sample ranged from 30 million to 48 million, 73% ~82% unique reads. All runs had more than 99% average mapping rate. Mean target coverage ranged from 727x to 879x. Depth of coverage at 50x or more reached 87% of targeted region and 60% of targeted region received 500x or more coverage depth. Using OncoSpan HD827 DNA, which bears 144 variants (SNV/indel) from 80 genes that are within the targeted region on the panel, our somatic variant calling pipeline reached 97% sensitivity and 100% precision respectively, with near 48 million reads. High concordance with orthogonal approaches in variant detection was further verified with 7 cancer cell lines and 45 clinical specimens. Conclusion We developed a NGS panel with a focus on clinically actionable gene mutations and validated the performance in library construction, sequencing and variant calling. High concordance with reference materials and orthogonal mutation detection was observed."

All patients who visited the vitreoretinal clinic for the first time during the study period were studied. Data were collected with standardized data extraction format entered into SPSS statistical package Version 20 and analyzed.A total of 739 new patients who visited the vitreoretinal clinic were included in the study. The mean age was 50.26 +/- 19 years. The age group between 21-60 years accounted for 59.7% of study patients. Male's accounted for 63.1% and 58.7% of the participants were from urban areas. Bilateral disease was diagnosed in 504 (68.2%) of patients and 220 (29.7%) were bilaterally blind at presentation. Three hundred eighty nine (52.6%) of them had duration of illness six months and above. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Rhegmatoginous Retinal Detachment (RRD) were the top three retinal diseases accounting for 21.3%(196), 17.3% (128) and 12.4% (92) of diagnoses respectively. Systemic comorbidities were found in 44% (325) of the patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia being the commonest, occurring in 27.8%, 6.3% and 2.8% of study patients respectively. Cataract was the commonest ocular comorbidity seen in 33.5% of study participants.Vitreoretinal diseases affected a significant number of patients presented to our center and most of the study patients presented late with significant vision loss and blindness. Males were affected more than females and the age group between 21-60 years accounted nearly two-third of study patients. This is the working age group suffering from vision loss from vitreoretinal diseases. DR, AMD and RRD were the commonest retinal pathologies accounting for nearly half of the vitreoretinal diseases and these conditions are treatable either surgically or medically. However, available facilities for the management of these diseases are not adequate at the center. Strengthening the vitreoretinal services of UoG-TECTC with relevant equipment is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4224265019,"The highly conserved, cardiotonic steroid binding site (also termed ouabain binding site) on the primary α subunit of Na,K-ATPase plays a receptor signaling role in a range of vital cell processes and is a therapeutic target for human disease. Mouse lines with altered affinity for cardiotonic steroids on the α1 or α2 subunit isoform of Na,K-ATPase, without any change in pump activity, were developed by the late Jerry B Lingrel and are a valuable tool for studying its physiological roles and drug actions. In one model, the normally ouabain resistant α1 isoform was rendered sensitive to ouabain binding. In a second model, the normally sensitive α2 isoform was rendered resistant to ouabain binding. Additional useful models are obtained by mating these mice. To further advance their use, we developed a rapid, real-time PCR method that detects mutant alleles using specific primers and fluorescent probes. PCR is performed in fast mode with up to 15 samples processed in 40 min. The method was validated by Sanger sequencing using mice of known genotype, and by comparing results with a previous two-step method that used PCR amplification followed by gel electrophoresis. In addition, we clarified inconsistencies in published sequences, updated numbering to current reference sequences, and confirmed the continued presence of the mutations in the colony. It is expected that a wider availability of these models and a more efficient genotyping protocol will advance studies of the Na,K-ATPase and its cardiotonic steroid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W4224214760,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be utilized clinically for treatment of conditions that result from excessive inflammation. In a pro-inflammatory environment, MSCs adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype resulting in immunomodulation. A sub-type of MSCs referred to as ""marrow-isolated adult multilineage inducible"" (MIAMI) cells, which were isolated from bone marrow, were utilized to show that the addition of autophagy modulators, tamoxifen (TX) or chloroquine (CQ), can alter how MIAMI cells respond to IFNγ exposure in vitro resulting in an increased immunoregulatory capacity of the MIAMI cells. Molecularly, it was also shown that TX and CQ each alter both the levels of immunomodulatory genes and microRNAs which target such genes. However, the role of other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the response of MSCs to inflammation has been poorly studied. Here, we utilized transcriptomics and data mining to analyze the putative roles of various differentially regulated lncRNAs in MIAMI cells exposed to IFNγ with (or without) TX or CQ. The aim of this study was to investigate how the addition of TX and CQ alters lncRNA levels and evaluate how such changes could alter previously observed TX- and CQ-driven changes to the immunomodulatory properties of MIAMI cells. Data analysis revealed 693 long intergenic non-coding RNAS (lincRNAs), 480 pseudogenes, and 642 antisense RNAs that were differentially regulated with IFNγ, IFNγ+TX and IFNγ+CQ treatments. Further analysis of these RNA species based on the existing literature data revealed 6 antisense RNAs, 2 pseudogenes, and 5 lincRNAs that have the potential to modulate MIAMI cell's response to IFNγ treatment. Functional analysis of these genomic species based on current literature linking inflammatory response and ncRNAs indicated their potential for regulation of several key pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, including NFκB signaling, cytokine secretion and auto-immune responses. Overall, this work found potential involvement of multiple pro-and anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules in modulating MIAMI cells' response to inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4224225900,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) remain a prevalent undiagnosed condition frequently encountered in primary care. Objective We aimed to find the parameters that optimize the diagnostic accuracy of pulse palpation to detect AF. We also aimed to create a simple algorithm for selecting which individuals would benefit from pulse palpation and, if positive, receive an ECG to detect AF. Methods Nurses from four Cardiology outpatient clinics palpated 7,844 pulses according to a randomized list of arterial territories and durations of measure and immediately followed by a 12-lead ECG, which we used as the reference standard. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the palpation parameters. We also assessed whether diagnostic accuracy depended on the nurse’s experience or on a list of clinical factors of the patients. With this information, we estimated the positive predictive values and false omission rates according to very few clinical factors readily available in primary care (age, sex, and diagnosis of heart failure) and used them to create the algorithm. Results The parameters associated with the highest diagnostic accuracy were palpation of the radial artery and classifying as irregular those palpations in which the nurse was uncertain about pulse regularity or unable to palpate pulse (sensitivity = 79%; specificity = 86%). Specificity decreased with age. Neither the nurse’s experience nor any investigated clinical factor influenced diagnostic accuracy. We provide the algorithm to select the ≥40 years old individuals that would benefit from a pulse palpation screening: a) do nothing in &lt;60 years old individuals without heart failure; b) do ECG in ≥70 years old individuals with heart failure; c) do radial pulse palpation in the remaining individuals and do ECG if the pulse is irregular or you are uncertain about its regularity or unable to palpate it. Conclusions Opportunistic screening for AF using optimal pulse palpation in candidate individuals according to a simple algorithm may have high effectiveness in detecting AF in primary care."

Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify associated factors. P-value <0.05 with 95% confidence level were used to declare statistical significance.Overall, 37.5% (95%CI: 32%, 43%) of health care providers had a good practice on non-pharmacological labor pain management. Clinical experience of 5 years and above (AOR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.60, 5.42), favorable attitude (AOR = 2.82, 95%CI: 1.56, 5.07), midwife profession (AOR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.98, 4.27), and working in satisfactory delivery rooms (AOR = 3.45, 95%CI: 2.09, 7.43), were significantly associated with a health professional good practice of labor pain management.This study showed that the practice of non-pharmacological labor pain management was poor in public health facilities in Gamo and Gofa zone. It was observed that having a favorable attitude, having ≥5 years of work experience, being a midwife by professional, and having a satisfactory delivery room were found to be significant predictors of the practice of non -pharmacological labor pain management. Therefore, all health facilities and concerned bodies need efforts to focus on providing training to midwives on non-pharmacological labor pain management practice."

The impact of liver resection on metastasis remains controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate whether liver resection can offer better survival outcomes in cases of isolated liver metastases from breast cancer. Methods We conducted a nationwide cohort study using a claims dataset from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We identified all patients with breast cancer (diagnostic code ICD-9: 174.x) from the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patient Database (RCIPD) of the NHIRD who underwent mastectomy between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008. Patients with other malignancies (history, initially, or during follow-up), those with a history of metastasis prior to or at initial admission for mastectomy, and those without liver metastases were excluded. Patients with other metastases between mastectomy and liver metastasis and those who died at first admission for liver resection were also excluded. All patients were followed up until December 31, 2013, or withdraw from the database because of death. Results Data were analyzed for 1,116 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (resection group: 89; non-resection group: 1,027). There were no differences in age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, or major coexisting diseases except renal disease between two groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that the liver resection group had significantly better overall survival (OS) than the non-resection group. (1-year: 96.6% vs. 52.3%, 2-year: 86.8% vs. 35.4%, 3-year: 72.3% vs. 25.2%, 5-year: 51.6% vs. 16.9%, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Cox analysis revealed that the liver resection group exhibited a significant improvement in patient survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.321, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.234–0.440, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion These findings indicate that liver resection may offer better survival benefit in patients with breast cancer who develop new liver metastases post mastectomy."

However, whether these changes persist after removal of the stressor is unknown, and the aim of this study was to determine if stress-induced changes in voiding behaviour and bladder function recover following removal of the stressor. Adult female mice were allocated to three groups: Unstressed, Stressed or Stressed + Recovery. Animals in the stressed groups were exposed to water avoidance stress for 1h/day for 10-days, with unstressed animals age-matched and housed under normal conditions. For recovery studies, animals were housed without stress exposure for an additional 10-days. Voiding behaviour was assessed periodically and animals sacrificed on day 10 (Unstressed and Stressed) or day 20 (Unstressed and Stressed + Recovery). Isolated whole bladder studies were used to assess compliance, urothelial mediator release and contractile responses. Exposure to stress increased plasma corticosterone levels almost three-fold (P<0.05) but this returned to baseline during the recovery period. Contractile responses of the bladder to carbachol and KCl were also increased following stress, and again fully recovered after a 10-day stress-free period. In contrast, stress increased urinary frequency four-fold (P<0.001), but this did not return fully to baseline during the recovery period. Bladder compliance was unchanged by stress; however, it was increased in the stressed + recovery group (P<0.05). Thus, following a stress-free period there is partial recovery of voiding behaviour, with an increase in bladder compliance possibly contributing to the compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4224260726,"In urban and other complex environments, satellite navigation signals are vulnerable to multipath interference, especially medium- and short-delay multipath interference, which seriously affects the positioning accuracy. Aiming at the problem that the effect of traditional methods on medium and short multipath suppression is not obvious and it is difficult to accurately estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) when beamforming is used, a multipath suppression scheme based on a postcorrelation and independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, the satellite navigation signal on each array element is despread and demodulated by postcorrelation technology to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and then the direct signal component is directly extracted by the ICA algorithm to filter the noise while suppressing the multipath interference. Simulation results show that this method can effectively suppress medium and short multipath interference when the SNR of satellite navigation signals is as low as -30 dB, significantly improve the SNR of navigation messages and reduce the bit error rate, which provides a new solution for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) multipath suppression."

Although it has been shown that using a mobile phone alters whole-body dynamic stability, no clear information exists on its impacts on motor variability during gait. This study aimed at assessing the impacts of various types of mobile phone use on motor variability during gait; quantified using the short- and long-term Lyapunov Exponent (λ S and λ L ) of lower limb joint angles and muscle activation patterns, as well as the centre of mass position. Fourteen females and Fifteen males (27.72 ± 4.61 years, body mass: 70.24 ± 14.13 Kg, height: 173.31 ± 10.97 cm) walked on a treadmill under six conditions: normal walking, normal walking in low-light, walking while looking at the phone, walking while looking at the phone in low-light, walking and talking on the phone, and walking and listening to music. Variability of the hip (p λ S = .015, λ L = .043) and pelvis (p λ S = .039, λ L = .017) joint sagittal angles significantly increased when the participants walked and looked at the phone, either in normal or in low-light conditions. No significant difference was observed in the variability of the centre of mass position and muscle activation patterns. When individuals walk and look at the phone screen, the hip and knee joints are constantly trying to adopt a new angle to regulate and maintain gait stability, which might put an additional strain on the neuromuscular system. To this end, it is recommended not to look at the mobile phone screen while walking, particularly in public places with higher risks of falls."

Globally, 27% of the world’s population is anaemic, of which developing countries account for more than 89%. The global prevalence is worse in Africa and Asia. Anaemia has the potential of maintaining the cycle of poverty, as it prevents children from attaining their full development potential. An important part of anaemia in children under-five years are preventable. Locally available dietary (LAD) interventions may be the sustainable interventions to address the high prevalence of anaemia in our communities. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of counselling on Locally Available Diet, on anaemia among children aged 6–59 months in the Kumbungu District of the Northern Region, Ghana. This study will be a community-based cluster randomized, controlled trial, with two parallel arms; Iron + Folic Acid (IFA arm) hereby referred to as the Standard care arm and Iron + Folic Acid + Counselling on Locally available dietary intervention (IFA+LAD arm) referred to as the Standard Plus arm. Study participants are children between the ages of 6 to 56 months. All study participants would receive iron plus folic acid. The minimum number of children per arm is 330 and the number of community clusters is 10 (5 per study arm). Also, considering this study proposes two parallel arms, the total minimum study sample size of children under five years is 496, the minimum total number of community clusters is 10 and a minimum of 25 households per community cluster, 124 households per study arm and 248 households for the study. Randomization is at the level of the clusters (selected communities). The intervention group receives counselling on LAD at a household level aimed at promoting the intake of locally available iron, folate and vitamin B12 rich foods. Also encourage the intake of food rich in enhancers of iron absorption and discouraging the intake of food rich in inhibitors of iron absorption. The primary outcome is mean haemoglobin levels in study arms. Secondary outcomes would include measurement of weight, height/length, mid upper arm circumference, dietary record, serum iron, ferritin, and other parameters of full blood count.

https://openalex.org/W4224291301,"The direct observation method is commonly used for data collection in family business case studies. Nevertheless, in research on family business succession that is mainly based on retrospective data, it is difficult to directly observe an event or situation at a given time. This paper thus first explores the application of observation data in the published research results of some family business case studies through a literature review. It then describes our observation methodology, i.e., sampling process, method, observation process, and reevaluation of our interview data, through a case study. Finally, the conclusion offers suggestions for using these observation methods, i.e., employing different types of observation, by considering running time and financial cost, familiarizing observers with various observation occasions, and seeking the assistance of relevant professionals for a research topic."
https://openalex.org/W4224293093,"Every day, we make many value-based decisions where we weigh the value of options with other properties, e.g. their time of delivery. In the laboratory, such value-based decision-making is usually studied on a trial by trial basis and each decision is assumed to represent an isolated choice process. Real-life decisions however are usually embedded in a rich context of previous choices at different time scales. A fundamental question is therefore how the dynamics of value-based decision processes unfold on a time scale across several decisions. Indeed, findings from perceptual decision making suggest that sequential decisions patterns might also be present for vale-based decision making. Here, we use a neural-inspired attractor model as an instance of dynamic models from perceptual decision making, as such models incorporate inherent activation dynamics across decisions. We use the model to predict sequential patterns, namely oscillatory switching, perseveration and dependence of perseveration on the delay between decisions. Furthermore, we predict RT effects for specific sequences of trials. We validate the predictions in two new studies and a reanalysis of existing data from a novel decision game in which participants have to perform delay discounting decisions. Applying the validated reasoning to a well-established choice questionnaire, we illustrate and discuss that taking sequential choice patterns into account may be necessary to accurately analyse and model value-based decision processes, especially when considering differences between individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4224294272,"Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks is considered a polyphagous pest of diverse agricultural and ornamental crops of global economic significance. Its distribution, host range, variety of symptoms, morphological differences, chaetotaxy and several ontogeny reports have advanced the idea of P. latus as a species complex. Correct pest identification leads to suitable control treatment. Therefore, the objective of this study was the identification of mites collected in two different geographic regions in Mexico (Chiapas and Guanajuato) that had been tentatively designated as Polyphagotarsonemus sp. Biometric differences on the morphology of adults as well the genetic variability were determined by taxonomical and molecular (mitochondrial COI gene) characterization techniques. The identity of the mites from both populations was confirmed as P. latus based on taxonomic characters. Biometric parameter variations were found between both populations (70.58% and 53.84% for females and males, respectively). The average sequenced fragment size was 447 bp (both populations). A homology search against six P. latus sequences available in the GenBank database revealed that sequence KM580507.1 (from India) shows 83.0-86.41% and 99.26-99.52% similarity with the sequences from Guanajuato and Chiapas, respectively. Molecular data indicated a significant divergence between the populations. The genetic distance demonstrates the population from Chiapas has a higher genetic correspondence (0.010) to the sequence from India (KM580507.1) whereas the population from Guanajuato is more distant (0.191). The genetic distance between the populations of this study and other GenBank sequences is even larger. We consider our results strengthen the hypothesis of P. latus consisting of a species-complex. However, it is essential to extend the study to other regions including its country of origin (Sri Lanka), and to include ultrastructural features."
https://openalex.org/W4224300578,"The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is classified as a threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act in Washington, Oregon, and California USA due to population declines, loss of breeding habitat, and other factors. To date, population assessments have focused on breeding season at-sea surveys. Consequently, there is little information on this species' distribution, abundance, and population trends during the non-breeding season, when murrelets are found exclusively in the marine environment. To address this information need, we assessed non-breeding (Sep-Mar) at-sea murrelet abundance patterns and population trends over 8 years, in a portion of its range where breeding season surveys indicate a 20-year population decline, Puget Sound, Washington, USA. This allowed us to assess whether non-breeding population trends mirrored those observed during the breeding season suggesting regional year-round conservation concerns and to also identify important over-wintering areas (areas of high abundance). We integrated our non-breeding abundance information with breeding season information to assess year-round patterns of abundance. This allowed us to test the prediction that murrelets move into the relatively protected inner marine waters of Puget Sound from harsher outer coastal habitats during the non-breeding season to molt and over-winter. Similar to trends from the breeding season, we observed strong murrelet density declines across the entire non-breeding period (Sep and Apr) with declines most pronounced in the fall and early winter (lateSep-Dec) survey windows when birds molt and in the spring just prior to breeding (Mar-Apr). Despite these declines, there was essentially no change in murrelet density in mid-winter (January-February) when overall density was lower. Puget Sound murrelet density exhibited a strong north-south gradient with relatively high densities to the north and low densities to the south; murrelets were largely absent from Central Puget Sound. For strata other than Central Puget Sound, density varied seasonally with birds more evenly distributed among strata between September and December but in the late winter/early spring period (Jan-Apr), murrelets were largely absent from all strata except the most northerly Admiralty Inlet Stratum, which appears to be important to murrelets year-round. Depending on the year, non-breeding season densities were nearly the same or higher than breeding season densities indicate that murrelets were not moving into the relatively protected inner marine waters of Puget Sound from more outer coastal environments during the non-breeding season as predicted."
https://openalex.org/W4224300981,"Due to an increasing number of parental union dissolutions, a growing number of fathers does not cohabit with their biological children. This article analyses individual and societal gender role attitudes as well as societal father practices as determinants of nonresident father-child contact. Previous research shows that individual-level factors influence the relationship between nonresident fathers and their children. Research on resident fathers indicates that individual attitudes and societal contexts affect father-child involvement. Little is known on the relationship between individual gender role attitudes as well as societal gender role attitudes and father practices and nonresident fathers’ involvement in their children’s lives. To shed more light thereon, we examine data from eleven Eastern and Western European countries from the first wave of the Gender and Generations Survey. We analyze two samples: One consisting of nonresident fathers of children aged 0 to 13 and one of fathers of adolescents aged 14 to 17. Logistic regression models assess if individual and societal gender role attitudes as well as societal father practices predict the probability of monthly father-child contact. Contact between nonresident fathers is affected by different factors depending on whether the focus is on children or adolescents. Societal gender role attitudes and societal father practices predict the probability of monthly contact between fathers and their children; individual gender role attitudes are less important. Individual gender role attitudes, on the other hand, predict the probability of monthly contact between nonresident fathers and their adolescent children; societal factors matter less for this age group."

This study investigates 11 numerical simulation programs using a realistic failure process analysis software. The influence of size and JRC on the shear strengths of the structural planes was studied. The stress-strain curves of different JRCs and their sizes were analyzed. Mathematical models of the shear strength of structural planes and JRC and sizes were formulated and proposed, and their expressions were obtained. Moreover, mathematical models of JRC and the characteristic size and strength of the structural planes were established."
https://openalex.org/W4224306289,"Presenteeism is the practice of being present at workplace, but not being able to carry out all the tasks due to health problems. Social support globally associated with health and wellbeing might positively influence presenteeism and consequently, the quality of life of these professionals. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between presenteeism, quality of life and social support in the work of non-teaching and non-research professionals within the context of higher education. A cross-sectional study was conducted, in which sociodemographic data were collected and the Portuguese versions of the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS-6) (which includes the dimensions work-completed and distraction avoided) and Quality of Life Index (EUROSHIS-QOL-8) and the subscales of Supervisor's Social Support and Peers' Social Support of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) were used. The questionnaire was applied online, and 322 professionals from a public university higher education institution in Northern Portugal participated in the study. Presenteeism was reported by 97 (30.1%) professionals. The peers' social support was positively associated with quality of life. The supervisor's social support was positively associated with distraction avoided and work completed and positively indirectly associated with quality of life, and the association was mediated by distraction avoided. We conclude that implementing strategies that can promote social support in the work context, namely strengthening networks between colleagues and competent and well-trained supervisors may prevent or reduce presenteeism in higher education professionals, as well as, provide a better quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4224307349,"This paper examines the effect of pandemic vaccination on asset prices in a simple asset pricing model à la Lucas 1978. In this model, asset prices depend on susceptible individuals' saving motives to insure against a reduction in labour income due to getting they get the virus. Hence distributing vaccine reduces precautionary saving motives and asset prices. This implies that reducing the income gap between susceptible and infected individuals, such as by cash handouts, eases the negative effect of vaccine supply on asset prices."
