The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3045497015,"In vitro scratch wound healing assay, a simple and low-cost technique that works along with other image analysis tools, is one of the most widely used 2D methods to determine the cellular migration and proliferation in processes such as regeneration and disease. There are open-source programs such as imageJ to analyze images of in vitro scratch wound healing assays, but these tools require manual tuning of various parameters, which is time-consuming and limits image throughput. For that reason, we developed an optimized plugin for imageJ to automatically recognize the wound healing size, correct the average wound width by considering its inclination, and quantify other important parameters such as: area, wound area fraction, average wound width, and width deviation of the wound images obtained from a scratch/ wound healing assay. Our plugin is easy to install and can be used with different operating systems. It can be adapted to analyze both individual images and stacks. Additionally, it allows the analysis of images obtained from bright field, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopes. In conclusion, this new imageJ plugin is a robust tool to automatically standardize and facilitate quantification of different in vitro wound parameters with high accuracy compared with other tools and manual identification."
https://openalex.org/W3045202423,"Oxytocin (OT) is a great facilitator of social life but, although its effects on socially relevant brain regions have been extensively studied, OT neuron activity during actual social interactions remains unexplored. Most OT neurons are magnocellular neurons, which simultaneously project to the pituitary and forebrain regions involved in social behaviors. In the present study, we show that a much smaller population of OT neurons, parvocellular neurons that do not project to the pituitary but synapse onto magnocellular neurons, is preferentially activated by somatosensory stimuli. This activation is transmitted to the larger population of magnocellular neurons, which consequently show coordinated increases in their activity during social interactions between virgin female rats. Selectively activating these parvocellular neurons promotes social motivation, whereas inhibiting them reduces social interactions. Thus, parvocellular OT neurons receive particular inputs to control social behavior by coordinating the responses of the much larger population of magnocellular OT neurons. Charlet, Grinevich et al. show that social touch between female rats activates parvocellular oxytocin neurons; these neurons control social behavior by coordinating the responses of the much larger population of magnocellular oxytocin neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3045625006,"This study employed deep-learning convolutional neural networks to stage lung disease severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on portable chest x-ray (CXR) with radiologist score of disease severity as ground truth. This study consisted of 131 portable CXR from 84 COVID-19 patients (51M 55.1±14.9yo; 29F 60.1±14.3yo; 4 missing information). Three expert chest radiologists scored the left and right lung separately based on the degree of opacity (0–3) and geographic extent (0–4). Deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict lung disease severity scores. Data were split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Correlation analysis between AI-predicted versus radiologist scores were analyzed. Comparison was made with traditional and transfer learning. The average opacity score was 2.52 (range: 0–6) with a standard deviation of 0.25 (9.9%) across three readers. The average geographic extent score was 3.42 (range: 0–8) with a standard deviation of 0.57 (16.7%) across three readers. The inter-rater agreement yielded a Fleiss’ Kappa of 0.45 for opacity score and 0.71 for extent score. AI-predicted scores strongly correlated with radiologist scores, with the top model yielding a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.90 (range: 0.73–0.90 for traditional learning and 0.83–0.90 for transfer learning) and a mean absolute error of 8.5% (ranges: 17.2–21.0% and 8.5%-15.5, respectively). Transfer learning generally performed better. In conclusion, deep-learning CNN accurately stages disease severity on portable chest x-ray of COVID-19 lung infection. This approach may prove useful to stage lung disease severity, prognosticate, and predict treatment response and survival, thereby informing risk management and resource allocation."

https://openalex.org/W3045118514,"Sexual and aggressive behaviors are fundamental to animal survival and reproduction. The medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are essential regions for male sexual and aggressive behaviors, respectively. While key inhibitory inputs to the VMHvl and MPN have been identified, the extrahypothalamic excitatory inputs essential for social behaviors remain elusive. Here we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1)-expressing cells in the posterior amygdala (PA) as a main source of excitatory inputs to the hypothalamus and key mediators for mating and fighting in male mice. We find two largely distinct PA subpopulations that differ in connectivity, gene expression, in vivo responses and social behavior relevance. MPN-projecting PAEsr1+ cells are activated during mating and are necessary and sufficient for male sexual behaviors, while VMHvl-projecting PAEsr1+ cells are excited during intermale aggression and promote attacks. These findings place the PA as a key node in both male aggression and reproduction circuits. Yamaguchi et al. identify a little-known amygdalar region, the posterior amygdala, as a key node in male mouse social behaviors. Two largely non-overlapping subpopulations in the posterior amygdala form parallel projections to distinct hypothalamic regions to regulate mating and fighting."
https://openalex.org/W3045866379,"The crisis facing the world’s oceans from plastics is well documented, yet there is little knowledge of the perspectives, experiences and options of the coastal communities facing overwhelming quantities of plastics on their beaches and in their fishing waters. In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods—a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models—we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste."

The lung is a structurally and functionally intricate organ with several diverse cell types. Appreciable changes in the composition of the epithelial stem cell and mesenchymal cell compartments along the proximo-distal axis of the airway contribute to its striking complexity. At its most proximal portion, the cartilaginous conducting airways play a vital role in host defense that protects mammals from airborne pathogens. This is accomplished by a highly specialized simple pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that arises from anatomically defined, resident adult airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) marked by Keratin 5 (K5) expression (Cole et al., 2010Cole B.B.

In contrast, the non-cartilaginous bronchiolar, alveolar, and bronchioalveolar tissues of the airway have region-specific adult stem cell populations (Barkauskas et al., 2013Barkauskas C.E.

Following injury, the tracheal repair response occurs in two distinct phases. Denuding of the epithelium triggers an initial proliferative expansion phase in which ABSCs undergo symmetric followed by asymmetric division that gives rise to K8+ early progenitors (Paul et al., 2014Paul M.K.

A phase of differentiation then proceeds, ultimately leading to repair of the pseudostratified epithelium with the optimal proportion of ABSCs and mucociliary cells. Dysregulated repair can lead to a multitude of pathologies, including mucous metaplasia, ABSC hyperplasia, and stepwise progression to squamous lung cancer (SqLC) (Hogan et al., 2014Hogan B.L.

As such, developing a nuanced understanding of tracheal homeostatic mechanisms is of paramount importance. Conducting airways of the trachea are lined with C-shaped cartilage rings that serve as a structural scaffold, equipping it with a rigidity that prevents its collapse. The subepithelial intercartilaginous zone (ICZ) of the airway harbors diverse cell types including, but not limited to, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and nerves that together have been speculated to comprise an intricate ABSC niche (Borthwick et al., 2001Borthwick D.W. Shahbazian M. Krantz Q.T. Dorin J.R. Randell S.H. Evidence for stem-cell niches in the tracheal epithelium.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Biol. 2015; 15: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous work observed that the epithelial surface above the ICZ contains a greater density of ciliated cells in comparison with regions above cartilage in the adult rodent trachea (Oliveira et al., 2003Oliveira M.J. Pereira A.S. Guimarães L. Grande N.R. de Sá C.M. Aguas A.P.

Physiol. 2005; 289: L454-L459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Efforts have also identified that the IL-6 from ICZ cells signals onto ABSCs to promote STAT3 activity and subsequently regulate ciliated cell formation from basal cells (Tadokoro et al., 2014Tadokoro T. Wang Y. Barak L.S. Bai Y. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L. IL-6/STAT3 promotes regeneration of airway ciliated cells from basal stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E3641-E3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These findings implicate cell-cell communication between the ICZ and surface airway epithelium (SAE); however, the dynamics of this ICZ niche during injury repair and aging remain unexplored. Recent studies have characterized the active epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in murine bronchiolar and alveolar homeostasis, of which Wnt signaling plays an increasingly defined role (Lee et al., 2017Lee J.H.

In the trachea, however, the effects of Wnt signaling on proliferation, differentiation, and injury repair are poorly understood. Prior work from others has suggested an importance for β-catenin in basal cell fate decisions (Giangreco et al., 2012Giangreco A. Lu L. Vickers C. Teixeira V.H. Groot K.R. Butler C.R. Ilieva E.V.

Conditional stabilization of beta-catenin expands the pool of lung stem cells.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, current limitations in our understanding stem from a dearth of studies that dissect the spatiotemporally dynamic role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during distinct phases of repair, as well as aging, and how this is contextualized within signaling niches in vivo. Here, we employ several transgenic mouse models to dissect the dynamic mechanisms by which Wnt signaling modulates proximal ABSC homeostasis, injury repair, and aging in vivo. We show that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is responsible for the proliferative phase of tracheal repair following injury in vivo and is mediated by phosphorylation of β-catenin protein at tyrosine 489. We reveal that a transiently activated Pdgfrα+ lineage in the ICZ marks a Wnt-producing niche necessary for driving proximal airway epithelial proliferation in vivo. The proximal airway then undergoes a dynamic cellular switch to form an intra-epithelial niche that directs differentiation to ciliated cells in vivo, because K5+ ABSCs secrete Wnt ligand to facilitate their formation. Importantly, the aging proximal airway ICZ niche is marked by the emergence of K5+ ABSC-derived glandular-like epithelial invaginations (GLEIs) that contribute to repair after injury and can be formed by constitutively activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the ABSCs of young mice. Our efforts thus demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamism of Wnt signaling across multiple proximal airway niches that together act as critical regulators of distinct phases of regeneration, as well as aging. At steady state, the mouse proximal airway epithelium has a slow turnover of approximately one ABSC every 7–10 days (Rock et al., 2010Rock J.R. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L. Airway basal stem cells: a perspective on their roles in epithelial homeostasis and remodeling.Dis. Model. Mech. 2010; 3: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). As such, to study mechanisms of ABSC self-renewal, we employ an injury model whereby we administer intratracheal (i.t.) polidocanol to slough the proximal airway epithelium, as previously described (Borthwick et al., 2001Borthwick D.W. Shahbazian M. Krantz Q.T. Dorin J.R. Randell S.H. Evidence for stem-cell niches in the tracheal epithelium.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The few remaining ABSCs subsequently undergo an initial phase of symmetric division to repopulate the ABSCs. This is followed by a period of asymmetric division, during which ABSCs give rise to the optimal proportion of differentiated mucociliary cells. Previous work has shown that 48 h post-injury (hpi) is the point of maximal proliferation following injury, with a notable decrease by 72 hpi as differentiation commences (Paul et al., 2014Paul M.K. Bisht B. Darmawan D.O. Chiou R. Ha V.L. Wallace W.D. Chon A.T. Hegab A.E. Grogan T.

Because the role of Wnt signaling remains poorly understood in proximal ABSC homeostasis and injury repair in vivo, we sought to analyze its activity in vivo. Mice were administered i.t. polidocanol and sacrificed at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi (Figure 1A). We performed quantitative real-time PCR to determine the mRNA expression of varying Wnt signaling components and known downstream target genes in the epithelial compartment. In comparison with uninjured mouse tracheas, we observed increased mRNA expression of varying Wnt signaling components, including known canonical signaling target genes Axin2 and Ccnd1 (encodes Cyclin D1) (Figure 1B). In situ hybridization studies also demonstrated increased Axin2 mRNA at 48 hpi in the SAE relative to uninjured airways (Figure 1C). We next assessed the spatiotemporal expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway components in the normal repairing airway.

To determine whether β-catenin PTMs might be important in the setting of ABSC proliferation following injury, we performed immunofluorescences (IFs) for several known β-catenin phosphorylation sites. We observed that β-catenin phosphorylated at tyrosine 489 (p-β-cateninY489) robustly localized to the nucleus in the repairing SAE relative to uninjured control animals (Figure 1D). This stood in contrast with other phosphorylated forms of β-catenin that primarily remained cytoplasmic or membranous (Figures S1B and S1C). We additionally employed TCF/Lef:H2B/GFP reporter mice to monitor Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity following injury in vivo. In contrast with uninjured airways that displayed minimal reporter activity, mice injured with polidocanol exhibited induced nuclear TCF/Lef activity that was statistically significant (Figures 1E and 1F). These data collectively demonstrate that the canonical Wnt/p-β-cateninY489 signaling axis is activated during repair following injury in vivo. To test whether β-catenin signaling was necessary for repair in vivo, we utilized K5-CreER;Ctnnb1fl/fl transgenic mice, a tamoxifen-inducible system that selectively deletes the β-catenin gene in K5-expressing cells. Mice were administered 75 mg/kg tamoxifen intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 24 h for 5 days, followed by 1 day of rest, to induce Cre-mediated recombination. Mice airways were then injured using i.t. polidocanol and sacrificed at 48 hpi to assess ABSC proliferation (Figure 1G). Effective deletion of β-catenin was first determined by IF in tamoxifen-treated K5-CreER;Ctnnb1fl/fl mice relative to Ctnnb1fl/fl control littermate mice that lacked the K5-CreER transgene (Figure S1D). Further, in comparison with control airways, K5-CreER;Ctnnb1fl/fl mice tracheas displayed scant bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake and instead had an attenuated epithelium at 48 hpi (Figure 1H). Taken together, these experiments illustrate that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for driving the proliferative phase of proximal airway regeneration following injury in vivo. With knowledge that β-catenin is essential for proliferation in repair, we next sought to determine whether this process was regulated by upstream Wnt ligand secretion. Porcupine is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein known to palmitoylate all 19 mammalian Wnt ligands that are necessary for their secretion (Barrott et al., 2011Barrott J.J. Cash G.M. Smith A.P. Barrow J.R. Murtaugh L.C. Deletion of mouse Porcn blocks Wnt ligand secretion and reveals an ectodermal etiology of human focal dermal hypoplasia/Goltz syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 12752-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Biechele et al., 2011Biechele S. Cox B.J. Rossant J. Porcupine homolog is required for canonical Wnt signaling and gastrulation in mouse embryos.Dev. Biol. 2011; 355: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As such, Porcupine plays an integral role by functioning as an upstream regulator of the Wnt signaling cascade. To determine whether Wnt secretion regulates airway epithelial proliferation after injury in vivo, we administered wild-type mice either vehicle or small-molecule Porcupine inhibitor, LGK974, prior to polidocanol-induced airway injury as shown in the schematic in Figure 2A. Relative to vehicle-treated mice, LGK974-treated mice exhibited an attenuated SAE with few BrdU+ ABSCs (Figures 2B and 2C), thereby phenocopying the repair response of K5-CreER;Ctnnb1fl/fl mouse tracheas. LGK974-treated mice also displayed reduced TCF/Lef:H2B/GFP reporter activity in comparison with vehicle-treated controls following injury, indicating suppression of the canonical Wnt signaling (Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of K5+ ABSCs that harbored nuclear p-β-cateninY489 in mice treated with LGK974 when compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figures 2D and 2E). We additionally treated human ABSCs (hABSCs) in vitro with LGK974 and identified that those treated with Wnt secretion inhibition displayed a significant reduction in the percentage of hABSCs with nuclear p-β-cateninY489 (Figures S2C and S2D). Taken together, these efforts indicate that Porcupine-dependent phosphorylation of β-cateninY489 is necessary for ABSC proliferation. In light of our data that Wnt ligand secretion is necessary for the ABSC proliferative response to injury, we next sought to determine the potential cellular sources of Wnt ligand that mediate this phase of repair. To this end, we performed Porcupine IF staining in the repairing wild-type mouse airway to demarcate Wnt-producing cells within signaling niches (Tammela et al., 2017Tammela T. Sanchez-Rivera F.J. Cetinbas N.M. Wu K. Joshi N.S. Helenius K. Park Y. Azimi R. Kerper N.R. Wesselhoeft R.A. et al.A Wnt-producing niche drives proliferative potential and progression in lung adenocarcinoma.Nature. 2017; 545: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tracheas at 48 hpi harbored Porcupine+ cells in the SAE, as well as subepithelial cells in the ICZ niche, a strong upregulation in comparison with uninjured controls (Figure 3A). Additionally, the Wnt-secreting ICZ niche was dynamic and transiently activated, because 72 hpi airways exhibited Porcupine expression only in the SAE and not in cells of the ICZ (Figure 3A). These data offered two possible distinct cellular mechanisms by which Wnt-mediated proliferation occurs: one in which stem cell-derived Wnt ligand promotes proliferation or a second in which the ICZ niche provides this cue. To dissect whether Wnt secretion from K5+ ABSCs was necessary for repair following injury, we utilized K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice that harbor selective blockade of Porcupine and Wnt secretion in exclusively K5+ ABSCs. The repairing tracheas of these mice therefore receive only stromal paracrine Wnt contribution. We injured the K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice and Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG control littermate mice and analyzed the repair response at varying time points post-injury (Figure 3B). In the absence of tamoxifen treatment, all cells have membrane-targeted tdTomato. Tamoxifen administration therefore allowed for selective Porcupine deletion in K5+ cells and triggered membrane-targeted EGFP in these cells. Effective Porcupine deletion in K5-expressing cells was first confirmed by IF. 81.97% ± 7.18% of K5+ ABSCs in K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice underwent recombination upon tamoxifen treatment (Figures 3C and S3A). We administered polidocanol via oropharyngeal aspiration in adherence with recently published protocols (Plasschaert et al., 2018Plasschaert L.W. Žilionis R. Choo-Wing R. Savova V. Knehr J. Roma G. Klein A.M. Jaffe A.B. A single-cell atlas of the airway epithelium reveals the CFTR-rich pulmonary ionocyte.Nature. 2018; 560: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We first identified that the repair response timeline is identical to that of mice receiving i.t. polidocanol (data not shown). H&E staining demonstrated that the repairing airways of mouse tracheas with Porcupine deletion in K5+ ABSCs were phenotypically indistinguishable from those of control mice (Figure S3B). Assessment of BrdU incorporation from these mice at 48 hpi showed no statistically significant difference (Figures 3D and 3E). Immunostaining analysis also identified that the 48 hpi K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG SAE contained uniformly GFP+ cells, indicating that the repairing airway was comprised of ABSCs devoid of Porcupine and therefore Wnt secretion (Figure S3C). Further, control K5-CreER;ROSAmT/mG and experimental K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice exhibited no differences in the formation of K8+ early progenitors at 96 hpi (Figures 3F and 3G). Together, these results collectively demonstrate that ABSC-derived Wnt ligand is dispensable for ABSC proliferation and K8+ early progenitor formation. Our data thus far indicated that although Wnt secretion was necessary for ABSC proliferation following injury, this process was not driven by the ABSC lineage. We therefore next reasoned that the dynamic, transiently activated Wnt-secreting ICZ niche was necessary to drive ABSC proliferation following injury. To address this possibility, we administered K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice either tamoxifen and vehicle to selectively block Wnt secretion from only the ABSC lineage, or tamoxifen and LGK974 to block global Wnt secretion prior to injury (Figure 4A). Analysis of tracheas at 48 hpi illustrated that K5-CreER;Porcnfl/fl;ROSAmT/mG mice treated with LGK974 exhibited an attenuated SAE with a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of proliferating BrdU+ K5+ ABSCs in comparison with those treated with vehicle (Figures 4B and 4C). These data offered the insight that the Wnt-producing ICZ niche is necessary for airway epithelial proliferation following injury. The ICZ has been speculated to serve as a signaling niche for the proximal SAE and is rich in Pdgfrα+ fibroblasts (Borthwick et al., 2001Borthwick D.W. Shahbazian M. Krantz Q.T. Dorin J.R. Randell S.H. Evidence for stem-cell niches in the tracheal epithelium.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar; Tadokoro et al., 2014Tadokoro T. Wang Y. Barak L.S. Bai Y. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L. IL-6/STAT3 promotes regeneration of airway ciliated cells from basal stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E3641-E3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To further characterize the Wnt-secreting ICZ compartment during proximal airway regeneration, we utilized tamoxifen-inducible Pdgfrα-CreER;ROSAmT/mG mice to label the Pdgfrα+ lineage prior to injury. We treated these mice with tamoxifen before injury, administered polidocanol, and sacrificed them at 48 hpi to determine whether the Pdgfrα+ lineage in the ICZ secretes Wnt ligand during repair (Figure 4D). We first confirmed that the Pdgfrα+ cell lineage, marked by GFP, localizes to the ICZ (Figure 4E). Further lineage-tracing analysis and IF staining showed that a subset of Pdgfrα+ cells in the ICZ were Porcupine+ at 48 hpi (Figure 4E), while only sparse Pdgfrα+ cells were also Porcupine+ in the uninjured state (∼1%) (Figure 4F). We further quantified at 48 hpi that of the cells that exp"

It has been proposed that the first step in anaerobic microbial degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds is a UbiD-mediated carboxylation. In this study, we use the UbiD enzyme ferulic acid decarboxylase (Fdc) in combination with a carboxylic acid reductase to create aromatic degradation-inspired cascade reactions, leading to efficient functionalization of styrene through CO2 fixation. We reveal that rational structure-guided laboratory evolution can expand the substrate scope of Fdc, resulting in activity on a range of mono- and bicyclic aromatic compounds through a single mutation. Selected variants demonstrated 150-fold improvement in the conversion of coumarillic acid to benzofuran + CO2 and unlocked reactivity towards naphthoic acid. Our data demonstrate that UbiD-mediated C–H activation is a versatile tool for the transformation of aryl/alkene compounds and CO2 into commodity chemicals. Biocatalytic cascade reactions using engineered variants of ferulic acid decarboxylase coupled to carboxylic acid reductase utilize carbon dioxide fixation to enable the carboxylation and functionalization of styrene and other aromatic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3045003856,"The p53 homolog TAp63α is the transcriptional key regulator of genome integrity in oocytes. After DNA damage, TAp63α is activated by multistep phosphorylation involving multiple phosphorylation events by the kinase CK1, which triggers the transition from a dimeric and inactive conformation to an open and active tetramer that initiates apoptosis. By measuring activation kinetics in ovaries and single-site phosphorylation kinetics in vitro with peptides and full-length protein, we show that TAp63α phosphorylation follows a biphasic behavior. Although the first two CK1 phosphorylation events are fast, the third one, which constitutes the decisive step to form the active conformation, is slow. Structure determination of CK1 in complex with differently phosphorylated peptides reveals the structural mechanism for the difference in the kinetic behavior based on an unusual CK1/TAp63α substrate interaction in which the product of one phosphorylation step acts as an inhibitor for the following one. TAp63α monitors the genome integrity in oocytes. After DNA damage, TAp63α is activated, involving multiple phosphorylation steps by CK1 with different kinetics due to an unusual CK1/TAp63α interaction in which the product of one step inhibits the next."

The outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. Thus, identification of regions with high risk for COVID-19 outbreak and analyzing the behaviour of the infection is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak for identifying the areas having high risk of infection and to evaluate the behaviour of infection in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS)-based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID-19 in Fars Province, Iran whereas the daily observations of infected cases were tested in the—polynomial and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of the disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors were selected for spatial modelling of outbreak risk. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) that displays a good prediction of outbreak risk change detection. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARIMA models in the province revealed an increasing trend with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although a more volatile growth of the infected cases is expected in the province. The results of this study might assist better programming COVID-19 disease prevention and control and gaining sorts of predictive capability would have wide-ranging benefits."

However, the enduring effects of this period on human brain structure and cognition in late life is unknown. Here we use magnetic resonance imaging to examine differences in cortical thickness related to parenthood in late life, for both sexes. In 235 healthy older women, we find a positive relationship between parity (number of children parented) and memory performance in mothers. Parity was also associated with differences in cortical thickness in women in the parahippocampus, precuneus, cuneus and pericalcarine sulcus. We also compared non-parents to parents of one child, in a sub-sample of older women (N = 45) and men (N = 35). For females, six regions differed in cortical thickness between parents and non-parents; these regions were consistent with those seen earlier in life in previous studies. For males, five regions differed in cortical thickness between parents and non-parents. We are first to reveal parenthood-related brain differences in late-life; our results are consistent with previously identified areas that are altered during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that neural changes associated with early stages of parenthood persist into older age, and for women, may be related to marginally better cognitive outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3045883804,"Background Cannabis is one of the most widely used substances among vulnerable young people (<26 years of age) experiencing street entrenchment. Although previous research has documented the role cannabis can play in harm reduction, substance use and mental health treatment and pain management, this research has predominantly been quantitative and focused on adult drug-using populations. Little qualitative work has examined how young people who use drugs understand, experience, and engage with cannabis in the context of street entrenchment and drug use trajectories that include the use of other substances such as alcohol, opioids and crystal methamphetamine (meth). Methods Semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between 2017 and 2019 with 56 young people recruited from a cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. We also conducted 13 interviews with 12 youth-focused care providers across the same time period. Interview data were triangulated by drawing on the findings of a program of anthropological research conducted by the senior author since 2008. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted. Results The vast majority of study participants engaged in daily, intensive cannabis use at the same time as they cycled on and off other substances that were perceived as much more harmful (primarily alcohol, fentanyl, heroin and meth). While most participants derived significant pleasure from the use of cannabis, no participants in our study described using cannabis for purely recreational purposes. A number of participants explicitly framed cannabis as a form of mental health and substance use treatment that was more effective and “healthier” than the long-term use of psychopharmaceuticals and medication-assisted substance use treatment (e.g., opioid agonist therapies). Cannabis use was also understood to ameliorate some of the harms of, or even facilitate transitions out of, periods of street-based homelessness. While the majority of our participants highlighted the positive effects of regular cannabis consumption, some described how intensive cannabis use could generate significant harms. Conclusion In the context of the recent legalization of non-medical cannabis use in Canada and amid ongoing overdose and housing crises, it is imperative that future policy and programming interventions and provider education and training be responsive to the ways in which vulnerable youth in our setting are actively using cannabis to navigate their everyday lives and healthcare needs."
https://openalex.org/W3045857024,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a particularly vulnerable tissue to age-dependent degeneration. Over the life span, the RPE develops an expanded endo-lysosomal compartment to maintain the high efficiency of phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) necessary for photoreceptor survival. As the assembly and activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) occur on the lysosome surface, increased lysosome mass with aging leads to higher mTORC1 activity. The functional consequences of hyperactive mTORC1 in the RPE are unclear. In the current study, we used integrated high-resolution metabolomic and genomic approaches to examine mice with RPE-specific deletion of the tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) gene which encodes an upstream suppressor of mTORC1. Our data show that RPE cells with constitutively high mTORC1 activity were reprogramed to be hyperactive in glucose and lipid metabolism. Lipolysis was suppressed, mitochondrial carnitine shuttle was inhibited, while genes involved in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis were upregulated. The metabolic changes occurred prior to structural changes of RPE and retinal degeneration. These findings have revealed cellular events and intrinsic mechanisms that contribute to lipid accumulation in the RPE cells during aging and age-related degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3045594897,"Diadromous fishes have drastically declined over the last century, especially in Europe. Several authors have highlighted the role of large dams in this decline, but in fact, its causes are potentially multiple and cumulative, including degradation of local environmental conditions and widespread fragmentation of hydrographic networks associated with the pervasive establishment of smaller barriers. Consequently, there is a need to improve the identification and prioritization of the drivers of diadromous species loss in order to identify and apply the most appropriate conservation and restoration measures. In this study, we used both historical sources (from mid-18th to early 20th century) and current data to quantify the long-term loss of diadromous taxa over 555 sites throughout the French river network. Then, we modeled the effects of several anthropogenic pressures (e.g. barriers, water quality, hydrological and river morphological alterations) on diadromous taxon loss. Lastly, we assessed the potential consequences of four different scenarios of anthropogenic pressure reduction. Due to uncertainties in historical sources, some species were grouped into taxa leading to a potential underestimation of actual species extinctions. Despite this limitation, our results showed that the decline in diadromous assemblages is widespread but with contrasting magnitudes depending on site locations. The maximum height and density of barriers appeared as the major factors of taxon loss. Over the scenarios tested, we observed that exclusively improving local conditions have much more limited effects than restoring river continuity. Focusing actions on large dam removal did not show the strongest responses compared to removing medium and small-sized barriers. For effective and sustainable restoration of diadromous fish assemblage, (1) historical occurrences of diadromous fishes should be used as an indicator for assessing recovery, and (2) undertaken measures must be adapted to each basin to target and limit the number of barriers to remove while allowing diadromous fish recovery."

This study analyzed the sociodemographic factors responsible for intimate partner violence and its overall association with reproductive healthcare–specifically miscarriages, stillbirths and induced abortions (MSA)–using Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2007, which contains the latest available intimate partner violence data till date, with the hypothesis that intimate partner violence is associated with miscarriages, stillbirths and induced abortions. The generalized linear regression model was fitted to 3,920 women adjusting survey weights and cluster/strata variations. The study concluded that 1 out of every 4 women who reported experiencing intimate partner violence also reported having one or more of miscarriages, stillbirths and induced abortions. The results revealed that intimate partner violence and miscarriages, stillbirths and induced abortions were significantly associated with the age of the women, residence, age of the women at their first birth, sex of household head and the household’s financial condition. Furthermore, the odds of having one or more miscarriages, stillbirths and abortions was increased by 35% for women who were victims to intimate partner violence, establishing a significant association between miscarriages, stillbirths and abortions and intimate partner violence. There appeared to be a need to address the issue in both paradigms, particularly for the poor rural women in Bangladeshi patriarchal society. These findings demand a combined intervention effort in the vulnerable cohorts, especially if Bangladesh intends to attain the goals 3.1 and 5.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030."

Since 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-derived lipid mediators such as lipoxin A4 (LXA4 ) and protectin D1 (PD1) protect against corneal epithelial cell damage, the major cell types that express 12/15-LOX and contribute to the corneal wound healing process are of particular interest. Here, we found that eosinophils were the major cell type expressing 12/15-LOX during the corneal wound healing process. Eosinophils were recruited into the conjunctiva after corneal epithelium wounding, and eosinophil-deficient and/or eosinophil-specific 12/15-LOX knockout mice showed delayed corneal wound healing compared with wild-type mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based mediator lipidomics revealed that a series of 12/15-LOX-derived mediators were significantly decreased in eosinophil-deficient mice and topical application of 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDoHE), a major 12/15-LOX-derived product, restored the phenotype. These results indicate that 12/15-LOX-expressing eosinophils, by locally producing pro-resolving mediators, significantly contribute to the corneal wound healing process in the eye."

However, the microbiota may rapidly change to a polymicrobial state that has been linked to a number of diseases. In the present study, the temporal changes of the vaginal microbiota in patients treated for sexually transmitted diseases or bacterial vaginosis (BV) and in untreated controls were studied for 26 days. The patients included 52 women treated with azithromycin, tetracyclines or moxifloxacin for present or suspected infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Mycoplasma genitalium. Women with concurrent BV were also treated with metronidazole. The controls were 10 healthy women of matching age. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, specific qPCRs and microscopy. There was generally good correlation between Nugent score and community state type (CST) and qPCR confirmed the sequencing results. By sequencing, more than 600 different taxa were found, but only 33 constituted more than 1 ‰ of the sequences. In both patients and controls the microbiota could be divided into three different community state types, CST-I, CST-III and CST-IV. Without metronidazole, the microbiota remained relatively stable regarding CST although changes were seen during menstrual periods. Administration of metronidazole changed the microbiota from CST-IV to CST-III in approximately 50% of the treated patients. In contrast, the CST was generally unaffected by azithromycin or tetracyclines. In 30% of the BV patients, Gardnerella vaginalis was not eradicated by metronidazole. The majority of women colonized with Ureaplasma parvum remained positive after azithromycin while U. urealyticum was eradicated."

Black women’s HIV diagnosis rates are 15 times higher than White women, and is among the leading causes of death among Black women in the US. Previous studies support the association between substance use and HIV risk, yet it is essential to better understand the specific factors experienced within the context of substance misuse and recovery among vulnerable Black women at-risk for substance misuse, HIV, and adverse life experiences. We conducted qualitative interviews with 31 black women (age M = 32.13, range 18–57) four times over six months. Eligible participants were 18+ years, identified as a Black/African-American woman, had unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a man in the past 30 days, and spoke fluent English. All transcripts were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed used thematic content analysis. Two groups of participants emerged: 1) those in recovery from their drug of choice (n = 11, 7 of whom misused alcohol or marijuana during the study), and 2) those who misused their drug of choice during the study (active use group; n = 20). Four themes emerged in the context of substance use: cultural factors, structural factors (i.e., housing and employment), past and present adverse life experiences, and individual factors (i.e., substance use to cope with stress, self-medicating with substances for mental health symptoms, intimate partner violence, and sex exchange). While participants in both groups used substances to cope with regard to these factors, the recovery group tended to use substances at lower frequencies and did not relapse with their drug of choice during the study. The active use group reported more substance use with regard to structural factors and recent adverse life events, had more difficulty regarding employment, and less instances of intimate partner violence (IPV) but were more likely to cope using substances. Substance use interventions tailored to vulnerable Black women should consider including trauma-informed interventions and support groups that address the structural, social, and individual factors to better serve their needs."

Here, we compare the aggressive behaviors and body size of V. velutina nigrithorax with five native hornet species to identify the interspecific hierarchies that influence the rate of spread of this species. Aggressive behaviors were classified into 11 categories, and each interaction was scored as a win, loss, or tie. We found that V. velutina was superior to V. simillima in fights that V. velutina won and showed a high incidence of threatening behavior. V. mandarinia outperformed V. velutina in fights that V. mandarinia won and grappling behavior was common. V. analis was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. analis won and showed a high degree of threatening behavior. V. crabro was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. crabro won and showed a high rate of threatening behavior. V. dybowskii was superior to V. velutina in fights that V. dybowskii won and showed a high incidence of threatening and grappling behaviors. The body size of V. velutina was greater than V. simillima (although not statistically significant) and smaller than all other Vespa species. Therefore, according to this study, the low interspecific hierarchies of V. velutina seem to be a major cause of the slower spread in Korea than in Europe. However, over time, its density has gradually increased within the forest, where it seems to be overcoming its disadvantages and expanding its range, possibly because the large colonies and good flying abilities of this species help it secure food."

We previously demonstrated that hepatic six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) may represent a suitable target for NAFLD. We investigated the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of recombinant FGF21 on NAFLD, focusing on the involvement of hepatic STAMP2. In this study, we used human nonalcoholic steatosis patient pathology samples, C57BL/6 mice for a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced in vivo NAFLD model, and used human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells for oleic acid (OA)-induced in vitro NAFLD model. We observed that recombinant FGF21 treatment ameliorated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance through the upregulation of STAMP2 expression. We further observed hepatic iron overload (HIO) and reduced iron exporter, ferroportin expression in the liver samples obtained from human NAFLD patients, and HFD-induced NAFLD mice and in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Importantly, recombinant FGF21 improved HIO through the hepatic STAMP2-mediated upregulation of ferroportin expression. Our data suggest that hepatic STAMP2 may represent a suitable therapeutic intervention target for FGF21-induced improvement of NAFLD accompanying HIO."
https://openalex.org/W3045903820,"Grafting is a well-established agricultural practice in cherry production for clonal propagation, altered plant vigor and architecture, increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, precocity, and higher yield. Mobile molecules, such as water, hormones, nutrients, DNAs, RNAs, and proteins play essential roles in rootstock-scion interactions. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 19 to 30-nucleotides (nt) RNA molecules that are a group of mobile signals in plants. Rootstock‐to‐scion transfer of transgene‐derived small interfering RNAs enabled virus resistance in nontransgenic sweet cherry scion. To determine whether there was long-distance scion-to-rootstock transfer of endogenous sRNAs, we compared sRNAs profiles in bud tissues of an ungrafted ‘Gisela 6’ rootstock, two sweet cherry ‘Emperor Francis’ scions as well as their ‘Gisela 6’ rootstocks. Over two million sRNAs were detected in each sweet cherry scion, where 21-nt sRNA (56.1% and 55.8%) being the most abundant, followed by 24-nt sRNAs (13.1% and 12.5%). Furthermore, we identified over three thousand sRNAs that were potentially transferred from the sweet cherry scions to their corresponding rootstocks. In contrast to the sRNAs in scions, among the transferred sRNAs in rootstocks, the most abundant were 24-nt sRNAs (46.3% and 34.8%) followed by 21-nt sRNAs (14.6% and 19.3%). In other words, 21-nt sRNAs had the least transferred proportion out of the total sRNAs in sources (scions) while 24-nt had the largest proportion. The transferred sRNAs were from 574 cherry transcripts, of which 350 had a match from the Arabidopsis thaliana standard protein set. The finding that “DNA or RNA binding activity” was enriched in the transcripts producing transferred sRNAs indicated that they may affect the biological processes of the rootstocks at different regulatory levels. Overall, the profiles of the transported sRNAs and their annotations revealed in this study facilitate a better understanding of the role of the long-distance transported sRNAs in sweet cherry rootstock-scion interactions as well as in branch-to-branch interactions in a tree."
https://openalex.org/W3046134589,"Background New hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments spurred the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to adopt a strategy to eliminate HCV as a public health threat by 2030. To achieve this, key policies must be implemented. In the absence of monitoring mechanisms, this study aims to assess the extent of policy implementation from the perspective of liver patient groups. Methods Thirty liver patient organisations, each representing a country, were surveyed in October 2018 to assess implementation of HCV policies in practice. Respondents received two sets of questions based on: 1) WHO recommendations; and 2) validated data sources verifying an existing policy in their country. Academic experts selected key variables from each set for inclusion into policy scores. The similarity scores were calculated for each set with a multiple joint correspondence analysis. Proxy reference countries were included as the baseline to contextualize results. We extracted scores for each country and standardized them from 0 to 10 (best). Results Twenty-five countries responded. For the score based on WHO recommendations, Bulgaria had the lowest score whereas five countries (Cyprus, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and Sweden) had the highest scores. For the verified policy score, a two-dimensional solution was identified; first dimension scores pertained to whether verified policies were in place and second dimension scores pertained to the proportion of verified policies in-place that were implemented. Spain, UK, and Sweden had high scores for both dimensions. Conclusions Patient groups reported that the European region is not on track to meet WHO 2030 HCV goals. More action should be taken to implement and monitor HCV policies."
https://openalex.org/W3046170260,"Studies on wife abuse in Bangladesh predominantly include the mainstream Bengali population, although there are at least 27 ethnic minority communities including a few ‘female-centered’ matrilineal groups living in the country. This study explored ethnic differences in the attitudinal acceptance of wife abuse among matrilineal ethnic minority Garo, patrilineal ethnic minority Santal, and mainstream patriarchal Bengali communities in rural Bangladesh. Adopting a cross-sectional design, the study included 1,929 women and men randomly selected from 24 Garo, Santal, and Bengali villages. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed to predict the number of contextual events, where the respondents attitudinally endorsed wife abuse. Of the sample, 33.2% were from Garo, 33.2% from Santal, and 33.6% from the Bengali communities. The acceptance of wife abuse was high in the sample; specifically, 34.1% of the respondents accepted physical wife abuse, 67.5% accepted emotional abuse, and 71.6% accepted any abuse (either physical or emotional) at least on one contextual reason provided in a 10-item scale. The mean for accepting any abuse was 3.0 (SD = 2.8), emotional abuse 2.3 (SD = 2.2), and physical abuse 0.8 (SD = 1.4). The study showed that the rates of accepting any abuse and physical abuse were respectively 16% and 56% lower among Garo as well as 14% and 33% lower among Santal than that of the Bengali community. Data also revealed that individual level factors like younger age, higher education, prestigious occupation as well as family level factors such as higher income, female mobility, and female family authority were inversely associated with the acceptance of wife abuse in the sample. It appears that the gender regime of a society has a great influence on the attitudes toward wife abuse. We argue that a comprehensive socio-cultural transformation of the patriarchal societies into a gender equal order is imperative for the prevention of widespread wife abuse in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3045494124,"Globally, elderly population with impaired cognitive function, such as dementia, has been accelerating, and Myanmar is no exception. However, cognitive function among elderly in Myanmar has rarely been assessed. This study aimed to identify the rate of cognitive impairment and its risk factors among the elderly in Myanmar.This cross-sectional study was conducted at rural health centers in Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory, Myanmar, from December 2018 to January 2019. In total, 757 elderly individuals aged 60 years or over (males: 246 [32.5%], females: 511 [67.5%]) were interviewed using a face-to-face method with a pre-tested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.The rate of impaired cognitive function among participants was 29.9% (males: 23.6%; females: 32.9%). The following participants were more likely to present cognitive impairment: those aged 70-79 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.70) and 80 years or older (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.25-6.76); those who were illiterate (AOR = 9.1; 95% CI: 3.82-21.51); and those dependent on family members (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.04-2.44). The elderly livening with their families and those who reported having good health (AOR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.44-0.99) were less likely to have cognitive impairment.Using the HDS-R Myanmar version, this study reported that there out of five elderly participants had cognitive impairment, and its risk factors, altering policy makers that Myanmar needs to prepare for adequate healthcare services and social support for elderly with cognitive impairment. Future research should be performed not only to detect general cognitive impairment but also to differentiate specific cognitive domains impairments among Myanmar elderly. Longitudinal studies are needed to observe the causal and protective factors associated with cognitive impairments in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W3045727257,"The impacts of changes in climate are often most readily observed through the effects of extremes in local weather, effects that often propagate through multiple ecosystem levels. Precise effects of any extreme weather event depend not only on the type of event and its timing, but also on the ecosystem affected. Here the cascade of effects following the arrival of an atmospheric river (directed by record-breaking Storm Desmond) across terrestrial, freshwater and coastal zones is quantified, using the Burrishoole system on the Atlantic coast of Ireland as a natural observatory. We used a network of high-frequency in-situ sensors to capture in detail the effects of an unprecedented period of rainfall, high wind speeds and above-average winter air temperatures on catchment and estuarine dynamics. In the main freshwater lake, water clarity decreased and acidity increased during Storm Desmond. Surface heat input, due to a warm and moist above-lake air mass, was rapidly distributed throughout the water column. River discharge into the downstream coastal basin was estimated to be the highest on record (since 1976), increasing the buoyancy flux by an order of magnitude and doubling the water column stratification stability. Entrainment of salt into the outflowing freshwater plume exported resident salt from the inner estuarine basin, resulting in net salt loss. Here, the increased stratification markedly reinforced isolation of the bottom waters, promoting deoxygenation. Measurements of current between the inner estuarine basin and the adjacent coastal waters indicated a 20-fold increase in the volume of seaward flowing low-salinity water, as a result of storm rainfall over the watershed. Storm impacts spanned the full catchment-to-coast continuum and these results provide a glimpse into a potential future for hydrological systems where these severe hydroclimatic events are expected to occur more frequently."
https://openalex.org/W3045826191,"Tryptic digestion of proteins followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis is an extensively used approach in proteomics research and biopharmaceutical product characterization, owing to the high level of cleavage fidelity produced with this technique. However, nonspecific trypsin cleavages have been frequently reported and shown to be related to a number of digestion conditions and predigestion sample treatments. In this work, we reveal that, for a number of commercial trypsins, reconstitution and storage conditions can have a significant impact on the occurrence of trypsin nonspecific cleavages. We analyzed the tryptic digestion of a variety of biotherapeutics, using trypsins reconstituted under different conditions. The results indicate that, for many commercial trypsins, commonly recommended reconstitution/storage conditions (mildly acidic, e.g., 50 mM acetic acid, 1 mM HCl) can actually promote nonspecific trypsin activities, which are time dependent and can be as high as 20% in total relative abundance. In contrast, using water for reconstitution and storage can effectively limit nonspecific cleavages to 1%. Interestingly, the performances of different commercial trypsins were found to be quite distinct in their levels of nonspecific cleavages and responses to the two reconstitution conditions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of choosing the appropriate trypsin for tryptic digestion and the necessity of assessing the impact of trypsin reconstitution and storage on nonspecific cleavages. We advocate for manufacturers of commercial trypsins to reevaluate manufacturing processes and reconstitution/storage conditions to provide good cleavage specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3045984407,"Cachexia is a common multifactorial syndrome in the advanced stages of cancer and accounts for approximately 20–30% of all cancer-related fatalities. In addition to the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, cancer results in impairments in cardiac function. We recently demonstrated that WFA attenuates the cachectic skeletal muscle phenotype induced by ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ovarian cancer induces cardiac cachexia, the possible pathway involved, and whether WFA attenuates cardiac cachexia. Xenografting of ovarian cancer induced cardiac cachexia, leading to the loss of normal heart functions. Treatment with WFA rescued the heart weight. Further, ovarian cancer induced systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction Treatment with WFA preserved systolic function in tumor-bearing mice, but diastolic dysfunction was partially improved. In addition, WFA abrogated the ovarian cancer-induced reduction in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Finally, treatment with WFA ameliorated fibrotic deposition in the hearts of tumor-bearing animals. We observed a tumor-induced MHC isoform switching from the adult MHCα to the embryonic MHCβ isoform, which was prevented by WFA treatment. Circulating Ang II level was increased significantly in the tumor-bearing, which was lowered by WFA treatment. Our results clearly demonstrated the induction of cardiac cachexia in response to ovarian tumors in female NSG mice. Further, we observed induction of proinflammatory markers through the AT1R pathway, which was ameliorated by WFA, in addition to amelioration of the cachectic phenotype, suggesting WFA as a potential therapeutic agent for cardiac cachexia in oncological paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W3045585126,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) causes ototoxicity by inducing oxidative stress, microangiopathy, and apoptosis in the cochlear sensory hair cells. The natural anti-oxidant pterostilbene (PTS) (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystylbene) has been reported to relieve oxidative stress and apoptosis in DM, but its role in diabetic-induced ototoxicity is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dose-dependent PTS on the cochlear cells of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The study included 30 albino male Wistar rats that were randomized into five groups: non-diabetic control (Control), diabetic control (DM), and diabetic rats treated with intraperitoneal PTS at 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day during the four-week experimental period (DM + PTS10, DM + PTS20, and DM + PTS40). Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests were performed at the beginning and end of the study. At the end of the experimental period, apoptosis in the rat cochlea was investigated using caspase-8, cytochrome-c, and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of the following genes: CASP-3, BCL-associated X protein (BAX), and BCL-2. Body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the rat groups were evaluated. The mean DPOAE amplitude in the DM group was significantly lower than the means of the other groups (0.9–8 kHz; P < 0.001 for all). A dose-dependent increase of the mean DPOAE amplitudes was observed with PTS treatment (P < 0.05 for all). The Caspase-8 and Cytochrome-c protein expressions and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hair cells of the Corti organs of the DM rat group were significantly higher than those of the PTS treatment and control groups (DM > DM + PTS10 > DM + PTS20 > DM + PTS40 > Control; P < 0.05 for all). PTS treatment also reduced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the mRNA expression of the anti-apoptosis BCL2 gene and by decreasing the mRNA expressions of both the pro-apoptosis BAX gene and its effector CASP-3 and the ratio of BAX/BCL-2 in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all). PTS treatment significantly improved the metabolic parameters of the diabetic rats, such as body weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and MDA levels, consistent with our other findings (P < 0.05 compared to DM for all). PTS decreased the cochlear damage caused by diabetes, as confirmed by DPOAE, biochemical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings. This study reports the first in vivo findings to suggest that PTS may be a protective therapeutic agent against diabetes-induced ototoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3046209462,"Grasslands contribute to global biogeochemical cycles and can host a high number of plant species. Both-species dynamics and biogeochemical fluxes-are influenced by abiotic and biotic environmental factors, management and natural disturbances. In order to understand and project grassland dynamics under global change, vegetation models which explicitly capture all relevant processes and drivers are required. However, the parameterization of such models is often challenging. Here, we report on testing an individual- and process-based model for simulating the dynamics and structure of a grassland experiment in temperate Europe. We parameterized the model for three species and confront simulated grassland dynamics with empirical observations of their monocultures and one two-species mixture. The model reproduces general trends of vegetation patterns (vegetation cover and height, aboveground biomass and leaf area index) for the monocultures and two-species community. For example, the model simulates well an average annual grassland cover of 70% in the species mixture (observed cover of 77%), but also shows mismatches with specific observation values (e.g. for aboveground biomass). By a sensitivity analysis of the applied inverse model parameterization method, we demonstrate that multiple vegetation attributes are important for a successful parameterization while leaf area index revealed to be of highest relevance. Results of our study pinpoint to the need of improved grassland measurements (esp. of temporally higher resolution) in close combination with advanced modelling approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3010188784,"Caesarean section (CS) rates throughout Europe have risen significantly over the last two decades. As well as being an important clinical issue, these changes in mode of birth may have substantial resource implications. Policy initiatives to curb this rise have had to contend with the multiplier effect of women who had a CS for their first birth having a greater likelihood of requiring one during subsequent births, thus making it difficult to decrease CS rates in the short term. Our study examines the long-term resource implications of reducing CS rates among first-time mothers, as well as improving rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC), among an annual cohort of women over the course of their most active childbearing years (18 to 44 years) in two public health systems in Europe. We found that the economic benefit of improvements in these two outcomes is considerable, with the net present value of the savings associated with a five-percentage-point change in nulliparous CS rates and VBAC rates being €1.1million and £9.8million per annual cohort of 18-year-olds in Ireland and England/Wales, respectively. Reductions in CS rates among first-time mothers are associated with a greater payoff than comparable increases in VBAC rates. The net present value of achieving CS rates comparable to those currently observed in the best performing Scandinavian countries was €3.5M and £23.0M per annual cohort in Ireland and England/Wales, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3045505033,"Genetic variation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was found to modulate the insulin resistance of adipose tissues, but the underlying mechanism was not clear. To investigate how the IRS-1 was involved in the browning of white adipose tissue through miRNA, we identified a mutated Irs-1 (Irs-1-/- ) mice model and found that this mice had a reduced subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) and increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the interscapular region. So we isolated the bone marrow stromal cells and analyzed differentially expressed miRNAs and adipogenesis-related genes with miRNA arrays and PCR arrays. Irs-1-/- mice showed decreased miR-503 expression, but increased expression of its target, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1a (BMPR1a). Overexpression of miR-503 in preadipocytes downregulated BMPR1a and impaired adipogenic activity through the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway, while the inhibitor had the opposite effect. In both Irs-1-/- and cold-induced models, sWAT exhibited BAT features, and showed tissue-specific increased BMPR1a expression, PI3K expression, and Akt phosphorylation. Thus, our results showed that IRS-1 regulated brown preadipocyte differentiation and induced browning in sWAT through the miR-503-BMPR1a pathway, which played important roles in high-fat diet-induced obesity."

Phylogeographic analysis estimated that Ae. aegypti arose as a species ~614 thousand years ago (kya) in the late Pleistocene. At 545 kya an ""early"" East African clade arose that continued to differentiate in East Africa, and eventually gave rise to three lineages one of which is distributed throughout all tropical and subtropical regions, a second that contains Southeast Asian/Sri Lankan mosquitoes and a third that contains mostly New World mosquitoes. West African collections were not represented in this early clade. The late clade continued to differentiate throughout Africa and gave rise to a lineage that spread globally. The most recent branches of the late clade are represented by South-East Asia and India/Pakistan collections. Analysis of migration rates suggests abundant gene flow between India/Pakistan and the rest of the world with the exception of Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3045763523,"The increasing prevalence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as components of new functional materials has the unintended consequence of causing increases in CNT concentrations in aqueous environments. Aqueous systems are reservoirs for bacteria, including human and animal pathogens, that can form biofilms. At high concentrations, CNTs have been shown to display biocidal effects; however, at low concentrations, the interaction between CNTs and bacteria is more complicated, and antimicrobial action is highly dependent upon the properties of the CNTs in suspension. Here, impact of low concentrations of multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) on the biofilm-forming opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is studied. Using phase contrast and confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and antibiotic tolerance assays, it is found that sub-lethal concentrations (2 mg/L) of MWCNTs promote aggregation of P. aeruginosa into multicellular clusters. However, the antibiotic tolerance of these ""young"" bacterial-CNT aggregates is similar to that of CNT-free cultures. Overall, our results indicate that the co-occurrence of MWCNTs and P. aeruginosa in aqueous systems, which promotes the increased number and size of bacterial aggregates, could increase the dose to which humans or animals are exposed."
https://openalex.org/W3045862572,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a worldwide health concern related to cardiovascular disease. Stress at work increases the risk for MetS, whereas physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CF) have been shown to be potential buffers against stress. The aim of this study was to test the stress-buffering effects of physical activity and CF on the relationship between work stress and MetS. In a prospective study, we followed 97 police officers (mean age = 39.7 years; mean body mass index = 25.74 kg/m2) over one year and assessed MetS, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Stress at work was measured with the Job Content Questionnaire, as well as the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire. Physical activity was assessed objectively via 7-day accelerometry. CF was assessed with the Åstrand bicycle ergometer test. Hierarchical linear regression models were carried out to predict MetS at follow-up (mean overall MetS score = 1.22), after controlling for baseline levels and sociodemographic background (mean overall MetS score = 1.19). Higher CF levels were significantly associated with lower MetS risk at follow-up (β = -.38). By contrast, no main effects were found for physical activity and work stress. However, high effort and demand were significantly correlated with increased blood pressure (effort: r = .23 for systolic blood pressure; r = .21 for diastolic blood pressure) and waist circumference (effort: r = .26; demand: r = .23). Moreover, no significant interaction effects occurred between work stress and CF/physical activity. The results emphasize the importance of high levels of CF in the prevention of MetS in police officers. Accordingly, provision of regular training opportunities and repeated CF testing should be considered as a strategy in overall corporate health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3045921070,"The purposes of this study were 1) to analyse the different pacing behaviours based on athlete's performance and 2) to determine whether significant differences in each race split and the runner's performance implied different race profiles. A total of 2295 runners, which took part in Berlin’s marathon (2017), met the inclusion criteria. 4 different groups were created based on sex and performance. Men: Elite (<02:19:00 h), Top 1 (<02:30:00 h), Top 2 (<02:45:00 h) and Top 3 (<03:00:00 h); women: Elite (02:45:00 h), Top 1 (<03:00:00 h), Top 2 (<03:15:00 h), Top 3 (<03:30:00 h). With the aim of comparing the pacing between sex and performance the average speed was normalized. In men, no statistically significant changes were found between performance group and splits. A large number of significant differences between splits and groups were found amongst women: 5–10 km Top 2 vs Top 3 (P = 0.0178), 10–15 km Top1 vs Top 2 (P = 0.0211), 15–20 km Top1 vs Top 2 (P = 0.0382), 20–21.1 km Elite vs Top 2 (P = 0.0129); Elite vs Top 3 (P = 0.0020); Top1 vs Top 2 (P = 0.0233); Top 1 vs Top 3 (P = 0.0007), 25–30 km Elite vs Top 2 (P = 0.0273); Elite vs Top 3 (P = 0.0156), 30–35 km Elite vs Top 2 (P = 0.0096); Top 1 vs Top 2 (P = 0.0198); Top2 vs Top3 (P = 0.0069). In men there were little significant differences based on athletes’ performance which implied a similar pacing behaviour. Women presented numerous differences based on their performance which suggested different pacing behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3045818043,"Objective Sit-stand workstations have been shown to be effective in reducing sitting time in office workers. The aim of this study was to explore reasons for use and non-use of sit-stand workstations and strategies to decrease sitting and increase physical activity in the workplace from perspectives of users and non-users, as well as from managers and ergo-coaches. Methods Six group interviews with employees who have had access to sit-stand workstations for several years were conducted in a large semi-governmental organisation in the Netherlands. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Open coding was conducted by three researchers and codes and themes were discussed within the research team. Results Thematic analysis resulted in two major themes: 1) Reasons for use and non-use and 2) Strategies to increase standing and physical activity in the workplace. Shared and distinct reasons for use and non-use were identified between users and non-users of the sit-stand workstations. The most important reasons for use indicated by users were that they had experiencing immediate benefits, including staying alert and increasing focus; these benefits were not acknowledged by non-users. Non-users indicated that sitting was comfortable for them and that they were therefore not motivated to use the standing option. Strategies to increase the use of the standing option included an introductory phase to become familiar with working while standing and to experience the immediate benefits that come from using the standing option. Furthermore, providing reminders to use the standing option was suggested as a strategy to increase and sustain the use of sit-stand workstations. Increased use may lead to a change in the sitting culture within the organisation, as more employees would adopt active movement behaviours. Conclusion Immediate benefits of the use of the standing option–only mentioned by the users–was the most distinct reason to use sit-stand workstations. Future research should explore how to motivate potential users to adhere to an introductory phase in order to experience these immediate benefits, whether it is linked to the use of sit-stand workstations or other interventions to reduce sitting time."
https://openalex.org/W3045874614,"Background A Malaria Short Course (MSC) was conceptualized to build the capacity of program managers for malaria control due to the lack of a single comprehensive broad-based programmatic training in Nigeria. Prior to its implementation, a needs assessment was conducted based on the perspectives of stakeholders to plan and develop the curriculum. Methods This was an exploratory qualitative study. Fifty-six purposively selected stakeholders at local, state and national levels were interviewed. Opinions on the need for training, its perceived impact, priority focus, likelihood of participation, sustainability of and planned support for the MSC were explored using a pretested researcher-designed interview guide. Interviews were audiotape recorded, and the transcripts were subjected to thematic content analysis. Results Participants included Directors of Primary Health Care (50%), State Malaria Program Officers (8.9%), State Directors of Public Health Services (7.1%) and Roll Back Malaria Officers (5.4%). Participants’ mean number of years of experience in their current positions was 6.2 (SD 4.7) years. The dominant view was “malaria remains a problem in Nigeria, exacerbated by poor funding, knowledge deficit, lack of training opportunities for program managers and prioritized training budget”. A common viewpoint was “to achieve the malaria policy goals, MSC should focus on improving program managers’ knowledge of the disease, novel interventions, data audit and use of data for decision making, supportive supervision as well as leadership and management skills. The prioritized thematic areas were malaria epidemiology, case management and data management. The consensus opinion was the MSC would have a positive impact on the performance of program managers. All managerial participants were willing to release their staff for the MSC and encouraged step-down training. However, most participants opined they could not guarantee that their institutions would provide financial support to the MSC attendees. Conclusions Implementing the MSC for program managers was considered essential towards achieving malaria control. Moreover, there is need for prioritized funding and sustainability mechanisms to actualize the implementation of the course."
https://openalex.org/W3045678816,"The aim of this work is to build a framework that comprehends inverse planning procedure and plan optimization algorithm tailored to a novel directional beam intensity-modulated brachytherapy (IMBT) of cervical cancer using a rotatable, single-channel radiation shield. Inverse planning is required for finding optimal beam emitting direction, source dwell position and dwell time, which begin with creating a kernel matrix for each structure based on Monte-Carlo simulated dose distribution in the rotatable shield. For efficient beam delivery and less transit dose, the number of source dwell positions and angles needs to be minimized. It can be solved by L0-norm regularization for fewest possible dwell points, and by group sparsity constraint in L2,p-norm (0≤p<1) besides L0-norm for fewest active applicator rotating angles. The dose distributions from our proposed algorithms were compared to those of conventional tandem-based intracavitary brachytherapy (ICR) plans for six cervical cancer patients. The algorithmic performance was evaluated in delivery efficiency and plan quality relative to the unconstrained algorithm. The proposed framework yielded substantially enhanced plan quality over the conventional ICR plans. The L0-norm and (group sparsity+L0-norm) constrained algorithms reduced the number of source dwell points by 60 and 70% and saved 5 and 8 rotational angles on average (7 and 11 angles for highly modulated cases), relative to the unconstrained algorithm, respectively. Though both algorithms reduced the optimal source dwell positions and angles, the group sparsity constrained optimization with L0-norm was more effective than the L0-norm constraint only, mainly because of considering physical constraints of the new IMBT applicator. With much fewer dwell points compared to the unconstrained, the proposed algorithms led to statistically similar plan quality in dose volume histograms and iso-dose lines. It also demonstrated that the plan optimized by rotating the applicator resulted in much better plan quality than that of conventional applicator-based plans."

Treatment-related mortality (TRM) within 1 or 3 months after kidney transplantation has been seldom reported. We designed a retrospective observational cohort study using a national population-based database, which included information about all kidney recipients between 2003 and 2016. A total of 16,073 patients who underwent kidney transplantation were included. The mortality rates 1 month (early TRM) and 3 months (TRM) after transplantation were 0.5% (n = 74) and 1.0% (n = 160), respectively. Based on a multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR = 3.02; P = 0.002), and hemodialysis compared with pre-emptive kidney transplantation (HR = 2.53; P = 0.046) were the risk factors for early TRM. Older age (HR = 1.07; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR = 2.88; P < 0.001), and hemodialysis (HR = 2.35; P = 0.004) were the common independent risk factors for TRM. In contrast, cardiac arrhythmia (HR = 1.98; P = 0.027) was associated only with early TRM, and fungal infection (HR = 2.61; P < 0.001), and epoch of transplantation (HR = 0.34; P < 0.001) were the factors associated with only TRM. The identified risk factors should be considered in patient counselling, selection, and management to prevent TRM."

In cases where the recipient of an intervention is highly vulnerable, proxy completion may be necessary. This study adds to the limited existing evidence on proxy completion of ICECAP-A specifically and adopts the novel approach of investigating multiple proxy responses for the same four (hypothetical) individuals.62 members of the public who were participating in a series of one day deliberative workshops on public health and social care completed ICECAP-A on behalf of four hypothetical individuals, described in vignettes. Quantitative analysis explored the range of proxy responses for each of the four hypothetical individuals, and any possible correlation between participants' own characteristics and their proxy responses. Participants discussed their proxy responses after completing the task; this discussion was audio recorded and analysed using Framework Analysis.Wide variation in ICECAP-A scores was observed across proxy respondents for each hypothetical individual. Participants' demographic characteristics and own well-being do not appear to have systematically influenced proxy responses. Qualitative analysis suggests two principal approaches (or perspectives) were adopted by participants: Empathetic (adopting the perspective of the 'subject') and factual (a factual assessment of the subject's well-being). Participants also drew on their own experiences to varying degrees. There were differing interpretations of the Independence attribute on ICECAP-A and some evidence that participants' ideas of what constituted achievement were context (including life-stage and condition/health) specific.The factual versus empathetic approaches identified from qualitative analysis in this study match to the concept of a proxy-proxy versus proxy-patient perspective, previously outlined in the literature. Researchers should consider specifying which perspective proxy raters should adopt. Findings also suggest proxy responses can be influenced by external points of reference and interpretation of measure attributes."

Methods A qualitative methodology was used to explore the views of a multidisciplinary group of diabetes health professionals and adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The views of nine health professionals working at a specialised diabetes care centre were gathered at two focus groups (four and five) that included doctors, nutritionists, health educators and nurses. Individual interviews with 12 patients with type 2 diabetes (six females and six males) attending the centre were also carried out. Recurring themes through the translated transcripts were studied and treated by the research group under pre-set protocols. Results Focus groups with health professionals revealed three main themes. 1. Resources: availability of resources and how they impacted on performance and patients’ care; 2.Familiarity with self-management education programmes: educating patients and raising awareness among them; and 3. Lifestyle: patients’ lifestyle and how it could affect their compliance with self-management programmes. Interviews with patients also revealed three main themes. 1. Habits: post diagnosis changes in patients’ attitudes and behaviours towards diet and physical activity; 2. Health education: awareness of managing type 2 diabetes through health centre advice or self-education; and 3. Culture and society: a lack of cultural or social support created by some social practices or conventions. Conclusion The findings from this study highlight a gap in type 2 diabetes care system that can be breached through the development of a Saudi specific self-management programme for type 2 diabetes. The identified barriers and facilitators can be used for adapting a self-management programme to the Saudi context. However, initial training is needed for local health professionals to understand the mechanisms of self-management programmes. Such programmes will need to infiltrate to the society, and the patients’ families, in particular to tackle the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia and provide a friendlier, more supportive environment for the current patients to self-manage their diabetes."

While the question of what is life has occupied mankind for centuries, there is a lack of empirical research examining the basic concepts of life scientists within SB themselves refer to and build on. In order to gain insights into these fundamental concepts, we conducted a qualitative interview study with scientists working in the field of SB. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the underlying understandings, principles, and characteristics of (synthetic) life on the one hand, and the entangled consequences for the conducted experiments and studies as well as the pursued scientific approaches. We identified four primarily underlying basic concepts of life which serve as a fundamental framework for current and further scientific research within SB and have implications for research questions, approaches and aims as well as for the evaluation of scientific results."
https://openalex.org/W3045577981,"The strong geographic variations in the incidence rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease are not solely related to variations in the population's needs, such as the prevalence of diabetes or the deprivation level. Inequitable geographic access to health services has been involved in different countries but never in France, a country with a generous supply of health services and where the effect of the variability of medical practices was highlighted in an analysis conducted at the geographic scale of districts. Our ecological study, performed at the finer scale of townships in a French area of 8,370,616 inhabitants, investigated the association between RRT incidence rates, socioeconomic environment and geographic accessibility to healthcare while adjusting for morbidity level and medical practice patterns.Using data from the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network registry, we estimated age-adjusted RRT incidence rates during 2010-2014 for the 282 townships of the area. A hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model was used to examine the association between incidence rates and 18 contextual variables describing population health status, socioeconomic level and health services characteristics. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs) for each variable were estimated for a 1-SD increase in incidence rate.During 2010-2014, 6,835 new patients ≥18 years old (4231 men, 2604 women) living in the study area started RRT; the RRT incidence rates by townships ranged from 21 to 499 per million inhabitants. In multivariate analysis, rates were related to the prevalence of diabetes [RR (95% CrI): 1.05 (1.04-1.11)], the median estimated glomerular filtration rate at dialysis initiation [1.14 (1.08-1.20)], and the proportion of incident patients ≥ 85 years old [1.08 (1.03-1.14)]. After adjusting for these factors, rates in townships increased with increasing French deprivation index [1.05 (1.01-1.08)] and decreased with increasing mean travel time to reach the closest nephrologist [0.92 (0.89-0.95]).These data confirm the influence of deprivation level, the prevalence of diabetes and medical practices on RRT incidence rates across a large French area. For the first time, an association was found with the distance to nephrology services. These data suggest possible inequitable geographic access to RRT within the French health system."
https://openalex.org/W3046190713,"Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging (DITI) has much potential in the field of maternal-fetal health and wellbeing research. The fact that it is totally non-invasive is particularly important in this context. The purpose of this study was, for the first time, to assess DITI’s ability to record fetal presentation and position, and other pregnancy-related physiological factors, via their superficial thermal prints. Ten healthy pregnant women (approximately 34–37 weeks of gestation) were recorded with two thermal imaging cameras (Flir C3 and i3 TE-Q1) from five different viewpoints. Participants’ views about the use of DITI in research and clinical practice were also assessed by a completion of a survey. Free hand polygon region of interests (ROIs) were drawn in order to include the entire anatomical area for investigation. The use of free hand polygon ROIs showed high reliability. Thermal images analysis revealed that fetuses presenting cephalically can be identified by the use of DITI, under specific conditions. Fetal movements influenced the thermal patterns that were produced. Future studies need to verify the heat patterns on the skin related to the placenta location, in order to understand the produced thermal recordings. Pregnant women rated the idea of using DITI in research and clinical practice very highly. This work represents a first contribution towards the use of DITI for the recording of fetal presentation and position. As it does not require direct contact and since it is completely non-invasive, it could be used to record maternal-fetal dynamic dyadic interaction in pregnancy. However, although the preliminary results are promising, further trans-disciplinary studies with a well-established protocol, more sophisticated thermal cameras, and bigger cohorts are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3045723621,"Creating a homologous restorer line for Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (Ogu-CMS) in Brassica napus is meaningful for the wider application of Ogu-CMS system in rapeseed production. Previously, an independent development of a new Ogu-CMS restorer line (CLR650) was reported locally from crossing between Raphanobrassica (AACCRR, 2n = 56) and B. napus and a new version of Ogu CMS lines CLR6430 derived from CLR650 was characterized in this study. The results showed that the fertility restoration gene in CLR6430 presented a distorted segregation in different segregating populations. However, the majority of somatic cells from roots had a regular chromosome number (2n = 38) and no radish signal covered a whole chromosome was detected using GISH. Thirty-two specific markers derived from the introgressed radish fragments were developed based on the re-sequencing results. Unique radish insertions and differences between CLR6430 and R2000 were also identified through both radish-derived markers and PCR product sequences. Further investigations on the genetic behaviors, interactions between the fertility restoration and other traits and specific molecular markers to the introgression in CLR6430 were also conducted in this study. These results should provide the evidence of nucleotide differences between CLR6430 and R2000, and the specific markers will be helpful for breeding new Ogura restore lines in future."

The purple stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker) is currently reported to be expanding their northern distributions and causing damage to summer maize in Xinxiang, China. However, their method of coping with the lower temperature in the new northern breeding area in winter is largely unknown. This paper investigates the overwinter site of S. inferens, and identifies the cold hardiness of larvae collected from a new breeding area in winter and explores a potential distribution based on low temperature threshold and on species distribution model MaxEnt. The results show that the overwintering location of the S. inferens population is more likely to be underground with increasing latitude and the population gradually moved down the corn stalk and drilled completely underground in later winter (February) in the north. The cold hardiness test shows the species is a moderate freeze-tolerant one, and Supercooling Points (SCP), Freezing Points (FP) and the incidence of mortality during the middle of winter (January, SCP: -7.653, FP: -6.596) were significantly lower than early winter (October) or late winter (March). Distribution in the new expansion area was predicted and the survival probability area was below N 35° for the Air Lower Lethal Temperature (ALLT50) and below N 40° for the Underground Lower Lethal Temperature (ULLT50). The suitable habitat areas for S. inferens with MaxEnt were also below N 40°. This study suggests the overwinter strategies of S. inferens have led to the colonization of up to a five degree more northerly overwintering latitude."
https://openalex.org/W3045613131,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease in which immune tolerance defects drive production of pathogenic anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Anergic B cells are considered a potential source of these autoantibodies due to their autoreactivity and overrepresentation in SLE patients. Studies of lupus-prone mice have shown that genetic defects mediating autoimmunity can breach B cell anergy, but how this breach occurs with regards to endogenous nuclear antigen remains unclear. We investigated whether B and T cell defects in congenic mice (c1) derived from the lupus-prone New Zealand Black strain can breach tolerance to nuclear self-antigen in the presence of knock-in genes (Vκ8/3H9; dKI) that generate a ssDNA-reactive, anergic B cell population.Flow cytometry was used to assess splenic B and T cells from 8-month-old c1 dKI mice and serum autoantibodies were measured by ELISA. dKI B cells stimulated in vitro with anti-IgM were assessed for proliferation and activation by examining CFSE decay and CD86. Cytokine-producing T cells were identified by flow cytometry following culture of dKI splenocytes with PMA and ionomycin. dKI B cells from 6-8-week-old mice were adoptively transferred into 4-month-old wild type recipients and assessed after 7 days via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy.c1 dKI mice exhibited B cell proliferation indicative of impaired anergy, but had attenuated autoantibodies and germinal centres compared to wild type littermates. This attenuation appeared to stem from a decrease in PD-1hi T helper cells in the dKI strains, as c1 dKI B cells were recruited to germinal centres when adoptively transferred into c1 wild type mice.Anergic, DNA-specific autoreactive B cells only seem to drive profound autoimmunity in the presence of concomitant defects in the T cell subsets that support high-affinity plasma cell production."
