https://openalex.org/W1984800782,In situ x-ray diffraction measurements of MgSiO 3 were performed at high pressure and temperature similar to the conditions at Earth's core-mantle boundary. Results demonstrate that MgSiO 3 perovskite transforms to a new high-pressure form with stacked SiO 6 -octahedral sheet structure above 125 gigapascals and 2500 kelvin (2700-kilometer depth near the base of the mantle) with an increase in density of 1.0 to 1.2%. The origin of the D″ seismic discontinuity may be attributed to this post-perovskite phase transition. The new phase may have large elastic anisotropy and develop preferred orientation with platy crystal shape in the shear flow that can cause strong seismic anisotropy below the D″ discontinuity.
https://openalex.org/W2167194856,"The idea that new memories undergo a time-dependent consolidation process after acquisition has received considerable experimental support. More controversial has been the demonstration that established memories, once recalled, become labile and sensitive to disruption, requiring “reconsolidation” to become permanent. By infusing antisense oligodeoxynucleotides into the hippocampus of rats, we show that consolidation and reconsolidation are doubly dissociable component processes of memory. Consolidation involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) but not the transcription factor Zif268, whereas reconsolidation recruits Zif268 but not BDNF. These findings confirm a requirement for BDNF specifically in memory consolidation and also resolve the role of Zif268 in brain plasticity, learning, and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2115857132,"In nature, key molecular processes such as communication, replication, and enzyme catalysis all rely on a delicate balance between molecular and supramolecular chirality. Here we report the design, synthesis, and operation of a reversible, photoresponsive, self-assembling molecular system in which molecular and supramolecular chirality communicate. It shows exceptional stereoselectivity upon aggregation of the molecules during gel formation with the solvent. This chirality is locked by photochemical switching, a process that is subsequently used to induce an inverted chiral supramolecular assembly as revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The optical switching between different chiral aggregated states and the interplay of molecular and supramolecular chirality offer attractive new prospects for the development of molecular memory systems and smart functional materials."
https://openalex.org/W2012333728,"Apoptosis is triggered by activation of initiator caspases upon complex-mediated clustering of the inactive zymogen, as occurs in the caspase-9–activating apoptosome complex. Likewise, caspase-2, which is involved in stress-induced apoptosis, is recruited into a large protein complex, the molecular composition of which remains elusive. We show that activation of caspase-2 occurs in a complex that contains the death domain–containing protein PIDD, whose expression is induced by p53, and the adaptor protein RAIDD. Increased PIDD expression resulted in spontaneous activation of caspase-2 and sensitization to apoptosis by genotoxic stimuli. Because PIDD functions in p53-mediated apoptosis, the complex assembled by PIDD and caspase-2 is likely to regulate apoptosis induced by genotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2136857252,"Osteoclasts are specialized macrophages that resorb bone. Mice lacking the AP-1 component c-Fos are osteopetrotic because of a lack of osteoclast differentiation and show an increased number of macrophages. The nature of the critical function of c-Fos in osteoclast differentiation is not known. Microarray analysis revealed that Nfatc1, another key regulator of osteoclastogenesis, was down-regulated in Fos-/- osteoclast precursors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that c-Fos bound to the Nfatc1 and Acp5 promoters in osteoclasts. In vitro promoter analyses identified nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)/AP-1 sites in the osteoclast-specific Acp5 and Calcr promoters. Moreover, in Fos-/- precursors gene transfer of an active form of NFAT restored transcription of osteoclast-specific genes in the presence of receptor activator of the NF-κB ligand (RANKL), rescuing bone resorption. In the absence of RANKL, however, Fos-/- precursors were insensitive to NFAT-induced osteoclastogenesis unlike wild-type precursors. These data indicate that lack of Nfatc1 expression is the cause of the differentiation block in Fos-/- osteoclast precursors and that transcriptional induction of Nfatc1 is a major function of c-Fos in osteoclast differentiation.

AP-1 refers to a family of dimeric transcription factors composed of Fos (c-Fos, Fra1, Fra2, and FosB) and Jun proteins (1Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K.

Transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; M-CSF, macrophage/colony-stimulating factor; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IL, interleukin; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. and AP-1, both critically involved in osteoclast differentiation, are activated in the presence of macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also known as CSF-1) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (3Teitelbaum S.L.

Therefore, a role of c-Fos appears to enhance production of Fos proteins during osteoclastogenesis. c-Fos also transcriptionally induces β-interferon, which then negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis by down-regulating c-Fos at the protein level (12Takayanagi H.

Beyond the Fos family, however, c-Fos target genes that rescue osteoclastogenesis in Fos-/- precursors are not known. NFATc1 is a member of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) family of transcription factors (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4, as accepted by HUGO and the Genome Data Base, corresponding to NFAT2, NFAT1, NFAT4, and NFAT3, respectively) (13Hoey T.

In this study, we explore the cause of the differentiation block in Fos-/- precursors by analyzing transcriptional target genes of c-Fos, especially Nfatc1, during osteoclast differentiation. Cell Culture—ST2-T cells were established by infecting the mouse stromal line ST2 with the retroviral vector expressing RANKL (18Lean J.M. Matsuo K. Fox S.W. Fuller K. Gibson F.M. Draycott G. Wani M.R. Bayley K.E. Wong B.R. Choi Y. Wagner E.F. Chambers T.J. Bone. 2000; 27: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For co-culture, bone marrow cells or splenocytes were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/cm2 with 6 × 104/cm2 ST2-T cells and cultured in the presence of 10-8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 10-7m dexamethasone. For osteoblast-free culture, non-adherent hematopoietic precursor cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml recombinant human M-CSF (Genzyme) and 10–30 ng/ml recombinant mouse RANKL (R&D Systems). RAW264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (TIB-71). Transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Microarray—Oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChip Murine Genome U74Av2, Affymetrix) were used to monitor the relative abundance of transcripts. Gene Expression Omnibus accession numbers: Fos+/+ splenocytes (GSM10341), Fos-/- splenocytes (GSM10342), Fos+/+ bone marrow (GSM10343), Fos-/- splenocytes expressing ΔNFAT (GSM10344), Fos-/- splenocytes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GSM10345). Western Blotting—Total cell extracts were prepared in a standard SDS lysis buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Mature osteoclasts were prepared from femurs of 3-day-old wild-type mice by curetting with a scalpel into medium. After 1 h incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies used were anti-NFATc1 (7A6) or anti-NFATc2 (G1-D10). Plasmids—Mouse Acp5-luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed in pGL3 vector (Promega) by transferring the promoter regions (-1453 down to the end of intron 1) from pKB5 (a gift from D. Roodman), and the NFAT site mutation was introduced by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). ΔNFAT was constructed by assembling PCR-amplified fragments encoding amino acids 1–239 of enhanced GFP (Clontech) followed by Ser-Arg (an XbaI site) and amino acids 317–902 of human NFATc4 (20Molkentin J.D.

The 2.5-kb ΔNFAT fragment was cloned into both the cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector pRK5 and the retroviral vector pMX (21Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). pBJ5-human NFATc1 expression plasmid (pSH102) was a gift from G. R. Crabtree. The -797 and -94 Calcr-P3-pGL3basic constructs have been described (22Anusaksathien O. Laplace C. Li X. Ren Y. Peng L. Goldring S.R. Galson D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22663-22674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additional Calcr-P3 5′-deletion constructs were generated by PCR using different forward Calcr primers with a BglII site and a common reverse Calcr primer with a HindIII site. The NFAT site mutations were incorporated into each deletion by sequential PCR reactions using mutant Calcr primers and vector primers. The c-Fos expression vector pMX-c-Fos-IRES-GFP was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment of mouse c-Fos cDNA in pBabe-c-Fos (10Matsuo K. Owens J.M. Tonko M. Elliott C. Chambers T.J. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The sequence of each construct was confirmed. The small interfering RNA vectors were based on RVH1 and LTRH1 (23Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14943-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (a gift from R. Medzhitov).

Recombinant NFATc1 protein was synthesized in vitro from wtNFATc1-pCITE4 plasmid (a gift from N. A. Clipstone). Competition reactions included a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Calcr transcripts were quantitated on ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green and were normalized to c-fms and Gapdh transcripts for co-cultures and osteoblast-free cultures, respectively. Bone Resorption Assay—The surface of bone slices was visualized by backscattered electron imaging using a scanning electron microscope (S-2500CX, Hitachi). The extent of bone resorption was quantified with Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (24Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (Ab-2, Oncogene) or normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were quantified by real-time PCR on ABI PRISM 7000. The PCR primers used were: Nfatc1-disF046, 5′-cgcccatgcaatctgttagtaa-3′; Nfatc1-disR248, 5′-gccctgagaaagctactctccc-3′; Acp5-1474F, 5′-tgcccagtacacattaccatcag-3′; Acp5-1715R, 5′-ggaccaaaagcggtgatcac-3′. NFATc1 Is Down-regulated in Fos-/-Osteoclast Precursors—We set out to identify genome-wide novel c-Fos target genes in the osteoclast lineage. Three osteoclastogenic cultures derived from wild-type and Fos-/- splenocytes and wild-type bone marrow were prepared and co-cultured with stromal ST2-T cells. By day 6, the wild-type cultures produced abundant multinucleated osteoclasts, which were tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive, whereas no such cells were generated in the Fos-/- culture (data not shown). The cocultured cells were harvested in toto, and gene expression was analyzed by microarrays. The genes in which expression was detectable in wild-type cultures but absent or very low in the Fos-/- culture are summarized in Table I. The numbers for wild-type splenocytes (Sp+/+), Fos-/- splenocytes (Sp-/-), and wild-type bone marrow cells (Bm+/+) are GeneChip scores indicating RNA levels. In the Fos-/- culture, the expression of Nfatc1 was undetectable, and the expression of known osteoclast marker genes (25Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R.

These include Acp5 (encoding TRAP), Ctsk (cathepsin K), Car2 (carbonic anhydrase 2), Mmp9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), and Calcr (calcitonin receptor). However, Marco, a macrophage receptor, was not reduced in the Fos-/- culture (Table I).Table IIdentification of c-Fos target genes by transcriptional profiling ΔNFAT/GFP, -fold increase between ΔNFAT- and GFP-expressing Fos-/- splenocytes in osteoclastogenic cultures.

Consistent with the RNA data, NFATc1 was not detectable in the Fos-/- culture (Fig. 1A). The size variation of NFATc1 in the wild-type bone marrow culture may be caused by either degradation products or by different isoforms of NFATc1 (26Sherman M.A. Powell D.R. Weiss D.L. Brown M.A. J.

Next we examined the subcellular localization of NFATc1 in mature osteoclasts freshly isolated from the femurs of wildtype mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed nuclear staining of NFATc1 but not NFATc2 in mature multinucleated osteoclasts generated in vivo (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from the macrophage-osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells demonstrated that nuclear NFATc1 was detectable only after RANKL stimulation (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that RANKL stimulates NFATc1 synthesis via c-Fos. c-Fos Binds to the Nfatc1 Promoter—Putative c-Fos binding sites have been mapped in the promoter region of Nfatc1 (Fig. 2A) (27Chuvpilo S.

To examine whether the Nfatc1 promoter could be directly regulated by c-Fos in osteoclast precursors, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using primary wild-type bone marrow cells and Fos-/- splenocytes treated with RANKL. The Nfatc1-P1 promoter fragment containing the distal block of homology between human and mouse sequences (27Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Tyrsin D. Akimzhanov A. Moroz D. Jha M.K. Schulze-Luehrmann J.

The proximal block of homology could not be analyzed because of difficulty in PCR amplification. We also tested whether the Acp5 promoter (Fig. 3A) was precipitated by anti-c-Fos antibody (Fig. 2B). In wild-type cells, c-Fos is present on the Acp5 promoter in the absence of RANKL, and c-Fos occupancy of the Acp5 promoter increases after RANKL treatment. These results suggest that c-Fos binds to the NFATc1 and Acp5 promoters during osteoclastogenesis.Fig. 3Identification of NFAT/AP-1 site in theAcp5promoter.A, conserved Acp5 promoter sequences in mouse (M), human (H), and pig (P).

To study the molecular mechanisms by which NFAT is involved in the regulation of osteoclast-specific gene expression we examined promoter sequences of Acp5 and Calcr, two potential c-Fos target genes (Table I). First we searched for such composite binding sites for NFAT and AP-1 (NFAT/AP-1 sites) in mouse, human, and pig Acp5 promoter sequences. Two short stretches were highly conserved around the multiple transcription start sites, which we termed Acp5-160 and Acp5-120, respectively (Acp5 elements located at -160 and -120 relative to the 3′ end of exon 1). Sequences of the conserved Acp5-120 were found to be similar to the prototypical 15-bp NFAT/AP-1 site in the IL-2 promoter (15Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Acp5-160 contains the binding site for the microphthalmia transcription factor (31Luchin A. Suchting S.

From EMSA results, the binding activity at Acp5-120 was indistinguishable from that observed with the IL-2 site (Fig. 3B). Binding of c-Fos to the Acp5 promoter in osteoclasts was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2B). Then we mutated the putative NFAT site in Acp5-120 from GGAGAA to GGCCCG in Acp5-luciferase reporter plasmids. Both human and mouse wild-type Acp5-luciferase constructs were most efficiently activated with NFATc4 compared with NFATc1, NFATc2, and NFATc3 in transient transfection assays (data not shown). Thus we constructed a constitutively active nuclear form of NFATc4, ΔNFAT (20Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), fused to GFP. When the wildtype and mutant reporter plasmids were co-transfected with a ΔNFAT expression plasmid into RAW264.7 cells, ΔNFAT activated the wild-type Acp5 promoter more efficiently than the mutant promoter (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the Acp5 promoter activity was enhanced by a co-transfected c-Fos expression vector and suppressed by small interfering RNA vectors for c-Fos in transient transfection assays (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that Acp5-120 is a functional NFAT/AP-1 binding site in the Acp5 promoter. Next we searched for NFAT/AP-1 sites in the mouse osteoclast-specific Calcr-P3 promoter (22Anusaksathien O. Laplace C. Li X. Ren Y. Peng L. Goldring S.R. Galson D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22663-22674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and found eight putative NFAT/AP-1 sites in the -797 Calcr-P3 promoter (Fig. 4A). Co-transfection of both the Calcr-P3-luciferase reporter plasmids and the ΔNFAT-expression vector into RAW264.7 cells resulted in a 30-fold increase in promoter activity above constitutive levels. Sequential 5′ deletion of the Calcr-P3 promoter demonstrated that the -178 construct containing the putative NFAT/AP-1 sites 1–4 was sufficient for full activity. Site-specific mutagenesis of each NFAT site from GGAAAN to GGCCCG revealed that site 2 at -93 was critical and that sites 1, 3, and 4 appear to cooperate with site 2 (Fig. 4A). In EMSA, site 2 was bound by NFATc1 using either RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 nuclear extracts or in vitro translation products (Fig. 4B). Next we transfected RAW264.7 cells with Calcr-P3-luciferase reporters and treated them with the calcium ionophore A23187. We observed that the Calcr promoter activities were enhanced only when site 2 was present presumably through activation of endogenous NFAT (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of A23187 was blunted by pretreatment of the cells with cyclosporin A (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that site 2 is the critical NFAT site in the Calcr promoter. NFAT Rescues Osteoclast Differentiation in Fos-/-Precursors—To test whether NFAT activity could rescue osteoclastogenesis in the absence of c-Fos, we introduced GFP or the GFP fusion ΔNFAT into Fos-/- splenocytes by retroviral gene transfer. Infected cells were co-cultured with the ST2-T cells under osteoclastogenic conditions. At day 6, mRNA was harvested and microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression between GFP and ΔNFAT virus-infected Fos-/- cells. Strikingly, expression of ΔNFAT activated about two-thirds of the genes that failed to be induced in Fos-/- cells including Acp5, Calcr, Ctsk, and endogenous Nfatc1 (Table I, ΔNFAT/GFP). This indicated that the differentiation block was to a large extent overcome by ΔNFAT in the absence of c-Fos when RANKL from ST2-T cells was present. Indeed, whereas abundant GFP-positive cells were observed by day 6 with both viruses, TRAP-positive cells were generated only with ΔNFAT virus (Fig. 5A). Next we tested whether the ΔNFAT-expressing Fos-/- osteoclasts could resorb bone. Although resorption pits were not visible on bone slices in cultures of GFP virus-infected Fos-/- splenocytes, co-cultures containing ΔNFAT virus-infected Fos-/- cells generated multiple resorption pits (bone surface resorbed, 2.3 ± 0.5%) (Fig. 5B). Next we compared the rescue efficiency in two types of osteoclastogenic cultures, coculture using ST2-T cells and osteoblast-free cultures using only soluble M-CSF and RANKL. In co-cultures, the rescue with ΔNFAT was comparable with that with c-Fos as judged by Calcr expression, TRAP-positive cell numbers, and resorption (Fig. 5C, st). In contrast, in the absence of stromal cells the rescue with ΔNFAT was lower than that of c-Fos based on all three parameters (Fig. 5C, M+R). Apart from the differences in efficiency in both cultures, ΔNFAT substituted at least in part for the osteoclastogenic function of c-Fos to the extent that Fos-/- splenocytes formed bone resorption pits in the presence of RANKL. In addition, gene transfer of the human full-length NFATc1 also rescued Fos-/- osteoclastogenesis in vitro (data not shown). These data collectively indicate that the lack of NFATc1 is a major reason for the differentiation block in Fos-/- osteoclast precursors. NFAT Rescue of Fos-/-Precursors Is RANKL-dependent—To examine the role of RANKL in NFAT-induced osteoclast formation, we introduced the GFP fusion ΔNFAT into RAW264.7 cells by transient transfection. This resulted in the induction of the endogenous Acp5 and Calcr genes as early as 1 day after transfection even in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 6A). This is consistent with the reported osteoclastogenic activity of NFATc1 in the absence of RANKL (5Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether ΔNFAT could rescue Fos-/- precursors in the absence of RANKL. ΔNFAT produced bone-resorbing TRAP-positive cells from wild-type precursors (Bm+/+, Sp+/+) in the absence or presence of RANKL (Fig. 6B). However, Fos-/- precursors (Sp-/-) hardly produced any TRAP-positive cells upon introduction of ΔNFAT in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 6B), and no bone resorption pits were observed (data not shown). These data suggest that the rescue of Fos-/- cells with NFAT activity requires receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) signaling. It has been established that the lack of c-Fos expression results in a differentiation block in the osteoclast lineage (7Wang Z.Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 8Johnson R.S. Spiegelman B.M. Papaioannou V.

Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, whether this is a cumulative effect of numerous deregulated c-Fos target genes or an effect of one critical c-Fos target gene is unclear. Our results show that the absence of Nfatc1 expression in Fos-/- precursors is the major cause of the differentiation block because an active form of NFAT alone rescued osteoclast-specific gene expression and bone resorptive function. We have identified NFAT/AP-1 sites in the Acp5 and Calcr promoters. EMSA showed that NFAT and AP-1 cooperatively bind to the Acp5 NFAT/AP-1 site, and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that c-Fos binds to the Acp5 promoter in osteoclasts. These observations are consistent with the idea that NFATc1 and c-Fos synergize to activate the Acp5 promoter (5Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the rescue of osteoclastogenesis by ΔNFAT alone in the absence of c-Fos clearly demonstrates that c-Fos is not essential for activation of the Acp5 promoter. To activate these promoters in Fos-/- precursors, ΔNFAT may interact with Jun-Jun homodimers (32Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) or may act alone in the absence of cooperative partners (33Stroud J.C. Chen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). EMSA using Fos-/- cell extract in combination with in vitro translated NFATc1 will help to address this issue. Although binding of NFAT to the Calcr promoter was unambiguously demonstrated by EMSA, binding of AP-1 to the Calcr promoter needs to be rigorously tested in the future. Importantly, osteoclast-specific gene expression is not entirely rescued with ΔNFAT. Those genes for which expression is not rescued, for example Mmp9, may be more strictly dependent on c-Fos or additional c-Fos-dependent transcription factors. Curiously, the rescue activity of ΔNFAT was similar to that of c-Fos when Fos-/- precursors were co-cultured with ST-2 but was lower than that of c-Fos when soluble M-CSF and RANKL were used. Therefore, c-Fos dependence appears to increase as stromal factors decrease. One of the stromal factors involved might be the ligand of osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) (34Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Whereas in wild-type precursors ΔNFAT or NFATc1 induce osteoclast differentiation even in the absence of RANKL (5Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar), ΔNFAT expression in Fos-/- precursors failed to rescue osteoclast differentiation in the absence of RANKL. This suggests that in the absence of RANKL, NFAT requires c-Fos, presumably as a binding partner or possibly indirectly to exert its osteoclastogenic function. It also suggests that RANKL may induce an alternative partner for NFAT that can substitute for c-Fos function in Fos-/- cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a major function of c-Fos during osteoclast formation is to trigger a transcriptional regulatory cascade by producing and cooperating with NFATc1, thereby activating a number of target genes involved in osteoclast differentiation and function. These yet to be identified novel target genes together with Nfatc1 may provide additional drug targets for bone diseases including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. We thank H.

These processes lead to the accumulation of a residual dislocation network, producing inhomogeneous strain and an irreversible broadening of the Bragg peaks in x-ray diffraction. We show that during plastic deformation of electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel, the peak broadening is reversible upon unloading; hence, the deformation process does not build up a residual dislocation network. The results were obtained during in situ peak profile analysis using the Swiss Light Source. This in situ technique, based on well-known peak profile analysis methods, can be used to address the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties in nanostructured materials."

In animals with heart failure and in patients with inherited forms of exercise-induced SCD, depletion of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the ryanodine receptor–calcium release channel (RyR2) complex causes an intracellular Ca 2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias. A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca 2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias. Thus, enhancing the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 may be a therapeutic strategy for common ventricular arrhythmias."

Here, we demonstrate that SFN treatment causes an irreversible arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest induced by SFN was associated with a significant decrease in protein levels of cyclin B1, cell division cycle (Cdc) 25B, and Cdc25C, leading to accumulation of Tyr-15-phosphorylated (inactive) cyclin-dependent kinase 1. The SFN-induced decline in Cdc25C protein level was blocked in the presence of proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, but lactacystin did not confer protection against cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, SFN treatment also resulted in a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser-216, leading to its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm because of increased binding with 14-3-3β. Increased Ser-216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C upon treatment with SFN was the result of activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), which was associated with Ser-1981 phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, generation of reactive oxygen species, and Ser-139 phosphorylation of histone H2A.X, a sensitive marker for the presence of DNA double-strand breaks. Transient transfection of PC-3 cells with Chk2-specific small interfering RNA duplexes significantly attenuated SFN-induced G2/M arrest. HCT116 human colon cancer-derived Chk2-/- cells were significantly more resistant to G2/M arrest by SFN compared with the wild type HCT116 cells. These findings indicate that Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25C plays a major role in irreversible G2/M arrest by SFN. Activation of Chk2 in response to DNA damage is well documented, but the present study is the first published report to link Chk2 activation to cell cycle arrest by an isothiocyanate.

https://openalex.org/W2056171616,"Apoptosis induced by p53 has been proposed to involve activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Here we describe the novel molecular mechanism through which p53 and DNA-damaging agents activate NF-κB. NF-κB induction by p53 does not occur through classical activation of the IκB kinases and degradation of IκBα. Rather, p53 expression stimulates the serine/threonine kinase ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1), which in turn phosphorylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The lower affinity of RSK1-phosphorylated p65 for its negative regulator, IκBα, decreases IκBα-mediated nuclear export of shuttling forms of NF-κB, thereby promoting the binding and action of NF-κB on cognate κB enhancers.

These findings highlight a rather unusual pathway of NF-κB activation, which is utilized by the p53 tumor suppressor. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a key cellular mechanism that participates in the regulation of normal growth, development, and homeostasis of organisms. Apoptosis also likely plays a key role in halting the growth of tumor cells early in their development. In this regard, the p53 tumor suppressor acts by inducing apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. Because of its central role as a negative regulator of cell growth, p53 activity is tightly regulated, principally at the level of protein stability (1Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). By various mechanisms, DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation lengthen the intracellular half-life of p53, resulting in its accumulation and increased action in the nucleus. The most important inhibitory regulator of p53 is Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase that both targets p53 for degradation in the 26 S proteasome (2Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

However, the mechanism by which p53 activates NF-κB is unknown.The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors regulates the expression of various genes involved in growth, differentiation, development, apoptosis, and inflammation. These factors function as either homo- or heterodimers with p50/p65 corresponding to the prototypical NF-κB complex (6Sen R. Baltimore D.

In resting cells, NF-κB is largely sequestered in the cytoplasm by its association with the IκBα inhibitor. However, more recent studies indicate that this complex shuttles into and out of the nucleus but remains transcriptionally inactive because of its association with the IκBα protein (8Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

In addition to differences conferred by the type of cell involved, the function of NF-κB as an antiapoptotic or proapoptotic factor likely depends on the nature of the inducing stimulus. Indeed, in the same cells, NF-κB antagonizes TNF-α-activated apoptosis yet promotes H2O2-induced apoptosis (32Kaltschmidt B. Kaltschmidt C. Hofmann T.G. Hehner S.P. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Eur. J.

The timing and duration of NF-κB activity relative to the death stimulus may play a key role in determining which of these cellular responses occurs (27Lin K.I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A.

Interestingly, many proapoptotic stimuli, including DNA-damaging agents, hypoxia, oxygen radicals, and ionizing irradiation, activate both p53 and NF-κB. Ryan et al. (5Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) suggested a link between these responses, showing that p53 expression directly activates NF-κB and that this NF-κB activity is required for p53-induced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 activates NF-κB remains unclear. We now describe a series of studies dissecting the novel mechanism by which p53 activates NF-κB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The following expression vectors were obtained from the indicated sources: wild-type p53 (Dr. B. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore) (35Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B.

The expression vector for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, Tax was as described previously (38Beraud C. Sun S.C. Ganchi P. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-p65-(1–180), GST-p65-(181–364), and GST-p65-(365–551) vectors were prepared by subcloning of the corresponding p65 fragments from the T7-p65 vector (14Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) into pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant baculovirus-expressed p65 was provided by Dr. R. T. Lin (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). NF-κB- and p53-dependent luciferase reporter genes were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human TNF-α (Endogen, Cambridge, MA) was used at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Antibodies to p53 (DO-1), IκBα (C-21), p65 (C-20), IKK1 (H-744), NEMO (FL-419), RSK1 (C-21), His (H-15), and GST (B-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Antibodies to phosphorylated IκBα, phosphorylated RSK1, and p65 phosphorylated on serine 536 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Recombinant active RSK1 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Saos cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of p53 (Saos-2-Tet-On-p53) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Vousden (NCI, National Institutes of Health) (5Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and IKK1/2-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast were graciously provided by Dr. I. M. Verma (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA).Transfections and Reporter Gene Assay—Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the indicated expression vectors together with κB- or p53-dependent reporter luciferase genes with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). In each experiment, cells were cotransfected with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to permit normalization of differences in transfection efficiency occurring in the individual cultures. Cell extracts were prepared 18 h later or as indicated, and luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with the Galacto-Light β-galactosidase assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA).Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Kinase Assays—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Precleared lysates (15,000 × g, 3 min) were immunoprecipitated for 3 h with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were collected using protein A-conjugated agarose (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.When used in in vitro kinase assays, the immunoprecipitates were washed in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaF, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Recombinant active RSK1 (0.1 μg) (Upstate Biotechnology) was employed instead of immunoprecipitates in some assays. [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi, specific activity 6,000 Ci/μmol) and 1 μg of a substrate were added to the kinase reactions followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fractionation of cell lysates was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using a Superose 6 molecular sieving column (Amersham Biosciences).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSA was performed as described (39Bohuslav J. Kravchenko V.V. Parry G.C. Erlich J.H. Gerondakis S. Mackman N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1645-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In brief, cells in 6-well plates were washed in phosphatebuffered saline, harvested, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After 10 min, 23 μl of Nonidet P-40 was added, and the sample was vortexed for 2 s. Nuclei were separated from cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 s. To isolate nuclear proteins, pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 25 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. After 30 min, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s, and supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected. Nuclear proteins were analyzed in binding reactions performed with radiolabeled consensus κB enhancer oligonucleotides (Promega) and resolved on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels.In Vitro Binding Assays—GST-IκBα or His-p65 (0.5 μg) were phosphorylated by recombinant active RSK1 as described above, except that 1 μm unlabeled ATP was used in the kinase reaction. GST-IκBα or phosphorylated GST-IκBα was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the beads were washed with lysis buffer. His-p65 or phosphorylated His-p65 (0.5 μg) was added to the beads and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed in lysis buffer, and the binding of p65 or phosphorylated p65 to GST-IκBα was analyzed by immunoblotting.Small Interfering RNA-mediated Gene Silencing—Control small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). siRNA for RSK1 was designed according to Elbashir et al. (40Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar) and prepared by Dharmacon Research. Transfections of siRNA were performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were replated and transfected with a second dose of siRNA, together with κB-dependent reporter gene and expression vectors for p53 and p65. Alternatively, the cells were activated as indicated and analyzed for reporter gene activity. The amount of RSK1 in each of the cell extracts was determined by immunoblotting with anti-RSK1 antibodies.RESULTSTranscriptionally Inactive Mutants of p53 Effectively Induce NF-κB—To assess the role of the individual domains within p53 in the activation of NF-κB, we used Saos-2 cells, which do not express endogenous p53. We transfected Saos-2 cells with p53 mutants characterized previously (Fig. 1A) and analyzed the ability of these mutants to activate an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Wild-type p53 activated both p53- and NF-κB-dependent reporter genes (Fig. 1B). The amino-terminal region of p53 contains a transcriptional activation domain. Leu-22 and Trp-23 within this region are required for the binding of transcriptional coactivators and for the transcriptional activation of p53-dependent genes (41Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Although the compound mutant p53(L22Q,W23S) failed to activate the p53-dependent reporter gene (Fig. 1B), this p53 mutant strongly activated an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Indeed, the p53(L22Q,W23S) mutant induced a severalfold increase in NF-κB activity compared with wild-type p53. Thus, the ability of p53 to activate expression of p53-dependent target genes is apparently not required for p53 activation of NF-κB.p53 sequence-specific transcriptional activity determined by the central part of the protein is preserved when the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p53 (amino acids 1–80) is replaced with the transactivation domain from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein (VP16-p53-(80–393)) (37Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Despite effective p53-dependent gene expression, this fusion protein displayed a nearly complete loss of NF-κB-inducing activity (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that the amino-terminal region of p53 is required for NF-κB activation, although this requirement is distinct from the role played by this amino-terminal region in the activation of p53 target genes.p53 contains five copies of the motif PXXP located between residues 61 and 94. These proline-rich motifs form recognition sites for SH3 domains, and their deletion impairs p53-induced apoptosis (36Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Consistent with results described previously (36Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), a p53 mutant lacking this proline-rich region (p53(ΔPP)) retained p53-induced transcriptional activity. However, the p53(ΔPP) mutant exhibited a severely reduced ability to activate NF-κB reporter gene activity (Fig. 1B). These results further confirm that p53-mediated activations of p53-dependent and NF-κB-dependent target genes are separable biological responses.Next, we analyzed p53-induced NF-κB DNA binding in EM-SAs. Consistent with our prior functional studies, transient expression of both wild-type p53 and the transcriptionally inactive p53(L22Q,W23S) mutant induced NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the p53(L22Q,W23S) mutant induced higher levels of NF-κB binding than wild-type p53. The NF-κB-binding complex induced by wild-type p53 and p53(L22Q,W23S) consisted principally of p50/p65 heterodimers, based on supershifting studies with antibodies specific for different members of the Rel family of proteins (data not shown). An NF-κB complex with identical mobility was activated similarly by other NF-κB inducers, including the NF-κB-inducing kinase and TNF-α (Fig. 1C).p53 Activation of NF-κB Does Not Involve the Degradation of IκBα—The ability of p53 to activate NF-κB without inducing the transcription of p53-dependent genes suggests that p53 directly engages a signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB induction. In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered chiefly in the cytoplasm through binding to its inhibitor, IκBα. Translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and engagement of κB enhancers generally result from signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα, followed by ubiquitylation and degradation of this inhibitor by the 26 S proteasome.To investigate whether p53 activation of nuclear NF-κB involves IκBα degradation, we used Saos-2 cells in which p53 expression can be induced by the addition of doxycycline (Saos-2-Tet-On-p53) (5Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Resting Saos-2-Tet-On-p53 cells express very low levels of p53. After incubation of the cells with doxycycline, p53 expression increased markedly between 4 and 18 h (Fig. 2A), mimicking activation of p53 by protein stabilization. As in the transient transfection system (Fig. 1C), p53 expression induced NF-κB DNA binding activity; however, this response was not evident until 12–18 h (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the kinetics of p53 activation of NF-κB are quite slow. The p53-induced NF-κB response persisted for the entire 48 h of the experiment (data not shown). During this time, the intracellular levels of IκBα did not change (Fig. 2C), nor was there evidence for marked IκBα phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 (Fig. 2D). Conversely, treatment of these cells with TNF-α both induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 2C) and increased the levels of phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 2D). Expression of p53 also did not alter the cellular content of the IκBα homologs IκBβ and IκBϵ (data not shown). Together, these findings indicate that p53 activation of NF-κB occurs slowly and does not involve IκBα degradation.Fig. 2Analyses of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and nuclear p65 accumulation after induction of p53 expression. Saos-2-Tet-On-p53 cells were incubated with doxycycline (Dox) to activate expression of p53 or with TNF-α for the indicated times. A, whole cell extracts were prepared, and the expression of p53 was analyzed by immunoblotting (WB) with an antibody specific for p53. Note increasing levels of p53 expression between 4 and 18 h. B, nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for binding to 32P-radiolabeled κB enhancer oligonucleotide by EMSA followed by autoradiography. Note the delayed appearance of NF-κB DNA binding activity at 18 h in Saos cells induced to express p53. C, the content of IκBα was determined by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with an antibody specifically reacting with IκBα. Note that TNF-α induced depletion of IκBα within 15 min, whereas IκBα levels did not change over the entire time course of p53 induction. D, phosphorylation of IκBα was analyzed by immunoblotting of the whole cell extracts with an antibody specific for phosphorylated serines 32 and 36 of IκBα. Note induction of phospho-IκBα (P-IκBα) by TNF-α but not by p53. E, to inhibit degradation of IκBα by the proteasome, cells were treated with the inhibitor MG132 for the last 2 or 8 h of the incubation with doxycycline. Alternatively, TNF-α was added for the last 8 or 15 min of incubation with MG132. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and the content of IκBα was determined by immunoblotting with an antibody specific to IκBα. Positions of IκBα and the more slowly migrating phosphorylated IκBα are indicated. F, Saos cells were treated with MG132 similarly as in E. Nuclear extracts were analyzed for p65 by immunoblotting. The position of a nonspecific band is indicated (N.S.). Note that MG132 impairs nuclear translocation of p65 induced by TNF-α but not by p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize further the p53-induced pathway of NF-κB activation, we next tested the effects of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, which effectively blocks NF-κB activation upon TNF-α treatment by preventing the degradation of phosphorylated and ubiquitylated IκBα. As expected, treatment with MG132 promoted accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα in the cytoplasm after TNF-α stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with MG132 for 2 or 8 h markedly increased the amount of the more slowly migrating, phosphorylated form of IκBα in cells activated with TNF-α. In contrast, no changes in the amount of phosphorylated IκBα were observed in cells expressing p53 (Fig. 2E). As expected, MG132 treatment efficiently blocked TNF-α-induced translocation of p65 into the nucleus (Fig. 2F). In contrast, MG132 had no effect on p53-induced accumulation of p65 in the nucleus (Fig. 2F). Together, these findings suggest that the activation of NF-κB by p53 does not involve an action of the 26 S proteasome.p53 Activates NF-κB Independently of the IκB Kinases: Possible Role of RSK1—The signalsome, a multimolecular complex containing IKK1 and IKK2 and the noncatalytic adaptor molecule NEMO/IKKγ, mediates phosphorylation of IκBα in response to most NF-κB-inducing stimuli (9Mercurio F.

Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The absence of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation during activation of NF-κB by p53 prompted us to evaluate whether p53 activates NF-κB in the absence of a functional signalsome. For these studies, we used MEF lacking both IKK1 and IKK2 (IKK1/2–/–). As expected, TNF-α induced NF-κB activity in wild-type MEF but not in the IKK1/2–/– MEF (Fig. 3A). Conversely, NF-κB was effectively induced by p53 in the IKK1/2–/– MEF. This finding indicates that IKK1 and IKK2 are not required for the activation of NF-κBbyp53 and further strengthens the notion that a distinct “nonclassical” pathway of NF-κB induction is involved. Surprisingly, p53 did not activate NF-κB in wild-type MEF. This binding is likely explained by the fact that transfection of wild-type MEF with p53 expression vectors consistently results in lower levels of p53 than found in IKK1/2–/– MEF (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the IKK1/2–/– MEF, wild-type MEF express substantially higher levels of the NF-κB-inducible Mdm2 protein, a ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation (42Tergaonkar V. Pando M. Vafa O. Wahl G. Verma I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, accelerated degradation of p53 in the wild-type MEF likely explains the lower levels of p53 expression and the lack of NF-κB induction in these cells.Fig. 3RSK1, but not IKK1/2, may play a role in p53-induced activation of NF-κB.A, wild-type or IKK1/2–/– MEF were transfected with the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and p53 expression vector DNA or activated with TNF-α. Cells were harvested 24 h after the transfection, and luciferase activity was quantitated. The results are presented as fold induction of normalized luciferase activities compared with control. Error bars indicate the S.D. values derived from triplicate samples. B, wild-type or IKK1/2–/– MEF were transfected with 0.2 or 1.0 μg of p53 expression vector. Cells were harvested, and the expression of p53 was evaluated by immunoblotting (WB) with an antibody reactive with p53. Immunoblotting with an antibody specific for lamin A was performed to verify equal loading. C, Saos-2-Tet-On-p53 cells were incubated with doxycycline (Dox) for various times to induce expression of p53 or with TNF-α and PMA, and the whole cell extracts were prepared. Signalsomes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-NEMO antibodies. The activities of coimmunoprecipitated IKK1/2 were analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay with GS"

In the case of consumers competing for similar resources, the diversity of those resources is thought to provide some degree of niche diversification in which a diverse set of consumer species can coexist. If, however, the diverse resources are not sufficiently distinct from one another, from the standpoint of the consumer species, such niche diversification will not exist. We experimentally show that a diverse array of twigs attracted 80% more species of twig-nesting ants than a monospecific collection of twigs. The specific tree species from which the twigs were derived did not explain the pattern.

In the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, glucose uptake by β-cells initiates a cascade of cellular events resulting in insulin secretion. A key response leading to insulin release is the change in transmembrane potential associated with the opening and closing of ion channels. Glucose uptake and metabolism increases the ratio of ATP/ADP, leading to the blockade of ATP-sensitive potassium (K+-ATP) channels. Inhibition of these channels results in cell membrane depolarization and subsequent activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) 1The abbreviations used are: CaV, voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; KV, voltage-gated K+ channel; Kir, inward-rectifying K+ channel; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor 1; Cm, cell capacitance; MES, 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid; F, farad. channels.

To support this notion, the dominant-negative knockout of KV2.1 channel or pharmacological blockade with a selective KV2.1 antagonist reduces steady-state outward KV currents by ∼60-70% (2MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M.F. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar, 5MacDonald P.E. Sewing S. Wang J. Joseph J.W.

In addition to KV2.1, other KV channel α subunits are expressed in pancreatic β-cells to a lesser extent, including KV1.4 and KV1.6, which account for less than 25% of outward K+ currents measured in these cells (2MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M.F. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar). The central role of CaV channels in insulin secretion is well recognized (1Rorsman P. Renström E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Google Scholar). The predominant CaV channel in β-cells is the L-type channel (long-lasting; CaV1.2/α1C-a and CaV1.3/α1D) (6Namkung Y. Shrypnyk N. Jeong M.-J. Lee T. Lee M.-S. Kim H.-L. Chin H. Suh P.-G. Kim S.-S.

The L-type CaV channel antagonists nifedipine and verapamil inhibit glucose-induced insulin release (6Namkung Y. Shrypnyk N. Jeong M.-J. Lee T. Lee M.-S. Kim H.-L. Chin H. Suh P.-G. Kim S.-S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3844-3854Google Scholar), whereas L-type CaV channel agonists (BAY-K 8644 and CGP28392) augment the release of insulin (8Malaisse-Lagae F. Mathias P.C.F. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1062-1068Google Scholar, 9Morgan N.G. Short C.D. Rumford G.M. Montague W. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 629-634Google Scholar). Recent evidence from Hofmann and co-workers (7Schulla V. Renström E. Feil R. Feil S. Franklin I. Gjinovci A. Jing X.J. Laux D. Lundquist I. Magnuson M.A. Obermuller S. Olofsson C.S. Salehi A. Wendt A. Klugbauer N. Wollheim C.B. Rorsman P. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3844-3854Google Scholar) has demonstrated a greater role of CaV1.2 in regulating insulin secretion in comparison with CaV1.3 in mouse β-cells. Specifically, tissue-directed knockout of CaV1.2 inhibited the first phase of insulin secretion (7Schulla V. Renström E. Feil R. Feil S. Franklin I. Gjinovci A. Jing X.J. Laux D. Lundquist I. Magnuson M.A. Obermuller S. Olofsson C.S. Salehi A. Wendt A. Klugbauer N. Wollheim C.B. Rorsman P. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3844-3854Google Scholar), whereas in contrast, CaV1.3 knockout either had no effect on β-cell function (10Platzer J. Engel J. Schrott-Fisher A. Stephan K. Bova S. Chen H. Zhen H. Striessnig J. Cell. 2000; 102: 89-97Google Scholar) or caused some developmental alterations in β-cell growth and proliferation (6Namkung Y. Shrypnyk N. Jeong M.-J. Lee T. Lee M.-S. Kim H.-L. Chin H. Suh P.-G. Kim S.-S. Shin H.-S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1015-1022Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are specialized membrane microdomains highly enriched with glycosphingolipids and cholesterol unlike other membrane regions, which are comprised mainly of phospholipids (reviewed in Refs. 11Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar and 12Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Google Scholar). The lipid composition of these raft domains and the tight packing of the acyl lipid chain make these membrane fractions resistant to Triton X-100 or Na2CO3 solubilization. This characterization and their buoyancy on sucrose gradients have been utilized to purify lipid rafts. Caveolin, a key structural protein of caveolae, has been used as a marker protein to isolate caveolae (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Google Scholar). Interest in caveolae has emerged due to the numerous associated membrane and cell signaling proteins within this complex, including ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, insulin receptor, kinases, adenylate cyclase, structural proteins, and SNARE proteins, which are collectively important for exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones (13Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the localization of pancreatic β-cell ion channels and SNARE proteins in cholesterol-rich lipid raft domains. We demonstrate that KV2.1 and CaV1.2, but not Kv1.4, Kir6.2, or SUR1, are enriched in lipid rafts. Furthermore, the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 target to lipid rafts but not n-Sec1 or Munc-13-1. Depletion of membrane cholesterol results in redistribution of these proteins out of lipid rafts and consequently alter KV2.1 but not CaV1.2 channel amplitude and gating. Moreover, there is a marked enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion and single-cell exocytic events following cholesterol depletion. These results suggest that the targeting of ion channels and SNARE proteins to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in β-cells is important for coordinating cellular excitability and insulin exocytosis. Materials—Antibodies against KV2.1, KV1.4, CaV1.2, and Kir6.2 were purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel), and the SUR1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Caveloin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The SNARE proteins were probed with mouse anti-syntaxin 1A antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-SNAP-25 antibody (SMI-25, Sternberger Monoclonal, Lutherville, MD), or rabbit anti-nSec1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Rabbit anti-VAMP-2 antibodies were generated as described previously (14Wheeler M.B. Sheu L. Ghai M. Bouquillon A. Grondin G. Weller U. Beaudoin A.R. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1340-1348Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal Munc-13 antibody was kindly provided to us by Dr. N. Brose (Max-Planck-Institut für Experimentelle Medizin, Göttingen, Germany). Guinea pig anti-insulin antibody was a gift from Dr. R. Pederson (University of British Columbia, British Columbia, Canada). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and all other reagents were from Sigma. Rat Islet and β-Cell Isolations—Isolation of rat islets by collagenase digestion was performed as described previously (15Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H. Sheu L. Tsuk S. Lotan I. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17532-17538Google Scholar). Dispersion of islets with 0.015% trypsin in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline was used to isolate single β-cells. Both islets and β-cells were cultured in low glucose Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RMPI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.25% HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin-100 μg/ml streptomycin. β-cells were cultured for up to 4 days. Cell Culture—Hamster HIT-T15 cells were provided to us by Dr. R. P. Robertson (Pacific Northwest Research Institute, Seattle, WA). Rat INS-1 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection, and mouse MIN6 cells were a gift from Dr. Susumu Seino (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan). HIT-T15 and INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and MIN6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-100 μg/ml streptomycin. For INS-1 and MIN6 insulinoma cells, the media were supplemented with 2 μl/500 ml β-mercaptoethanol. Membrane cholesterol depletion of HITT15 cells was performed by incubating 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (16Sheu L. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Huang X. Gao X. Varoqueaux F. Brose N. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27556-27563Google Scholar). Rat islets and β-cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 0.5 h at room temperature, blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin for 0.5 h at room temperature, and then immunolabeled with mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 or -2 (1:20 dilution) and guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were rinsed with 0.1% saponin and phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (either rhodamine red or fluorescein isothiocyanate) for 1 h at room temperature and mounted on slides in a fading retarder (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in glycerol). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Lipid Raft Isolation—HIT-T15 cells were harvested and lysed in a sodium carbonate solution (500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, supplemented with protease inhibitors) using a sonicator. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of a 90% sucrose solution in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and placed into an Ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above the 45% sucrose-HIT-T15 lysate, and the sample was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16-20 h at 4 °C. Gradient fractions (600 μl) were collected from the top, and 30 μl of each fraction was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride-plus membranes (Fisher) and immunoblotted with the desired primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were labeled with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, Amersham Biosciences), and membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Insulin Secretion Assay—HIT-T15 cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/well. The following day, cells were washed twice and preincubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing (in mm): 115 NaCl, 5 KCl, 24 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. After the preincubation period, cells were washed thoroughly with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 10 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (200 μl) were taken at the end of the incubation period and stored at -20 °C until assayed for insulin. Radioimmunoassays were performed using the rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Electrophysiology—Single HIT-T15 cells were voltage-clamped in the whole cell configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch electrodes were fabricated from 1.5-mm thin-walled borosilicate glass and polished to a tip resistance of 3-4 megaohms when filled with intracellular solution. For measuring KV currents, the pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.2). The bath solution consisted of (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). For the measurement of CaV currents, pipettes were filled with (in mm): 120 CsCl, 20 tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.2). The external solution comprised of (in mm): 100 NaCl, 20 BaCl2, 20 tetraethylammonium, 4 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). tetraethylammonium was used to block KV currents. Current recordings were performed at room temperature (21-23 °C), and normalized to cell capacitance. To elicit both KV and CaV currents, cells were held at -80 mV and depolarized from -80 to +60 mV in 10 mV increments using either 500- or 200-ms step pulses, respectively. Steady-state inactivation properties were investigated by depolarizing the cells with either 5-s prepulses from -120 to 20 mV (KV currents) or 1-s prepulses from -100 to 60 mV (CaV currents). Steady-state inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzmann equation: I/Imax = 1/(1 + exp(V-V½)/k), where V½ is the voltage at which half of the channels are inactivated, and k is the slope factor. Single-cell Capacitance Measurement—Patch electrodes were coated with orthodontic wax (Butler, Guelph, ON, Canada) close to the tips and fire-polished. Pipette resistance ranged from 2 to 5 megaohms when pipettes were filled with the intracellular pipette solutions. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 125 K-glutamate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 0.05 EGTA, 0.1 cAMP, and 4 MgATP, pH to 7.1. The extracellular solutions consisted of (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2.6 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2.5 d-glucose, pH to 7.4. Some rat islet β-cells were preincubated with the extracellular solutions containing 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextran for 20-50 min at 32 °C before recordings. Cell capacitance was estimated by the Lindau-Neher technique (17Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Google Scholar), implementing the “Sine + DC” feature of the Lock-in module (40 mV peak-to-peak and a frequency of 500 Hz) in the standard whole cell configuration. Recordings were conducted using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier and Pulse software. Exocytic events were elicited by a train of eight 500-ms depolarizing pulses (1-Hz stimulation frequency) from -70 to 0 mV. All recordings were performed at 32 °C. Statistical Analysis—Data points represent mean ± S.E. An unpaired Student's t test was used to compare control values from methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated groups. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The presence of lipid rafts and caveolin-1 has been described in the neuroendocrine pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line and pancreatic exocrine acinar cells and shown to be important in exocytosis (18Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 369-375Google Scholar, 19Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Google Scholar, 20Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Google Scholar). The thorough identification and characterization of lipid rafts in β-cells has yet to be reported. Therefore, we initially examined the expression of caveolin, a protein localized to specialized lipid raft domains (caveolae), in pancreatic islets and insulinoma cells. Western blot analyses revealed abundant expression of both caveolin-1 and -2 in isolated rat whole islets and considerably lower expression of both caveolin proteins in HIT-T15, MIN6, and INS-1 cells (Fig. 1A). No expression of muscle-specific caveolin-3 was detected in either islets or insulinoma cells (data not shown). Pancreatic islets are comprised of insulin-secreting β-cells (>60%), as well as non-β-cells (i.e. α- and δ-cells). Therefore, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the cellular distribution and localization of caveolin in the islet cells. Immunolabeling of both caveolin-1 (Fig. 1B) and caveolin-2 (Fig. 1D) demonstrated their abundant expression in rat islets. Coimmunolabeling of the islets with insulin to identify the β-cells revealed that both caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 were present in β-cells. Caveolin-2 was also present in non-insulin-containing cells. Caveolin is important for the formation of caveolae, which are uncoated flask-shaped invaginations on the plasma membrane, and for trafficking of cholesterol to the cell surface membrane (11Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar). Since caveolae were not observed in electron micrographs of islet β-cells (21Olofsson C.S. Göpel S.O. Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Ma X. Salehi A. Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 444: 43-51Google Scholar), we therefore examined the cellular localization of caveolin-1 in enzymatically dispersed islet β-cells. To our surprise, caveolin-1 only showed intracellular labeling and very little expression on the plasma membrane. Moreover, caveolin-1 appeared to be colocalized with insulin (Fig. 1C). Ion channels and SNARE proteins have been demonstrated to be enriched in non-caveolar lipid rafts (19Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Google Scholar, 20Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Google Scholar, 22Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Google Scholar). Proteins localized in lipid rafts cannot be removed by sodium carbonate or high salt, are resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization, and can be separated on discontinuous sucrose gradients (18Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 369-375Google Scholar). As HIT-T15 cells had relatively more abundant caveolin expression as compared with the other insulinoma cell lines (Fig. 1A), this is an appropriate model to examine for the presence of lipid rafts and its content proteins. We probed HIT-T15 cells membranes, which were treated with sodium carbonate (pH 11) and separated on a sucrose gradient, for the presence of ion channels and SNARE proteins in the lipid raft fractions. Western blot analyses detected that KV2.1 and CaV1.2 channels co-migrated with caveolin-1 and -2 to the 5-30% sucrose interface, suggesting that these proteins target to lipid rafts. In contrast, neither KV1.4 nor the K+-ATP channel subunits, Kir6.2 and SUR1, migrated to the lipid raft fractions. We and other investigators have demonstrated both KV2.1 and CaV1.2 channels to be functionally coupled with the SNARE proteins, syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 (15Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 248-253Google Scholar). We found syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 (syntaptobrevin-2), but not Munc-13-1 or n-Sec1, to localize to the lipid raft rich fractions. Effects of Cholesterol Depletion on Channel Gating—To determine that KV2.1 and CaV1.2 channels and the SNARE proteins were localized to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, we depleted membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Incubation of HIT-T15 cells with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in the redistribution of KV2.1 and CaV1.2 out of the lipid raft fraction (Fig. 2B), as well as the SNARE proteins, syntaxin-1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 (Fig. 2B), indicating that these proteins are indeed localized to lipid raft domains. However, caveolin-1 (Fig. 2B) and caveolin-2 (data not shown) remained in the buoyant fractions after cyclodextrin pretreatment. This is not unexpected given that these proteins appear to be predominantly targeted intracellularly (Fig. 1, B and C), and methyl-β-cyclodextrin can only deplete surface membrane cholesterol since it is membrane-impermeable. Membrane cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin has been shown to alter the gating but not current amplitude of heterologous expressed KV2.1 in Ltk-cells (22Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Google Scholar). We examined the effects of cholesterol depletion on KV and CaV channel gating in HIT-T15 cells. There was a marked reduction in peak KV current amplitude in HIT-T15 cells after pretreatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 3, A and B). Peak outward KV currents were reduced from 276 ± 15 pA/pF (control) to 187 ± 31 pA/pF in methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated cells (p < 0.05; n = 4). The remaining outward KV currents displayed a prominent inactivating component, similar to the currents we observed following inhibition of KV2.1 expression or blockade of these channels in β-cells (2MacDonald P.E. Ha X.F. Wang J. Smukler S.R. Sun A.M. Gaisano H.Y. Salapatek A.M.F. Backx P.H. Wheeler M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1423-1435Google Scholar, 5MacDonald P.E. Sewing S. Wang J. Joseph J.W.

We have identified these currents to be KV1.4 channels. The reduction in KV currents is not the result of a large hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state current inactivation as observed by Martens et al. (22Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Google Scholar), which could lead to reduction in measured KV currents. There was a small, yet significant, leftward shift in the steady-state inactivation curve with a V½ of -27 ± 2 mV in control to -36 ± 1mV after treating the cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (p < 0.05; n = 4 for each group) (Fig. 3C). We observed no changes in the voltage dependence of channel activation. In contrast, there were no significant changes to either CaV current amplitude (Fig. 4, A and B) or gating (data not shown).Fig. 4Effects of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on L-type CaV channels in HIT-T15 insulinoma cells. A, representative whole cell recordings of L-type CaV currents recorded using 20 mm BaCl2 in the bath solution and 20 mm tetraethylammonium inside and outside to block KV currents. Currents were elicited from a holding potential of -80 mV with step depolarizations from -60 to +80 mV. A 30-min preincubation with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin had no significant effect on peak IBa currents.

Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Google Scholar, 20Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether cholesterol depletion might have similar effects on β-cells (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, in contrast to PC-12 cells, methyl-β-cyclodextrin enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells from 164 ± 12 pg of insulin/h to 261 ± 18 pg of insulin/h (n = 3; p < 0.01). We then examined the effects of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on insulin granule exocytosis per se by performing patch clamp capacitance measurements (ΔCm) on single islet β-cells (16Sheu L. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Huang X. Gao X. Varoqueaux F. Brose N. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27556-27563Google Scholar, 17Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Google Scholar). We elicited exocytosis by eight depolarizing pulses from -70 mV to 0 mV to measure both the size of the readily releasable pool of insulin granules and the extent of refilling of this pool from the reserve pool (1Rorsman P.

Preincubation of the cells with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin increased ΔCm by 213 ± 34 fF (n = 6); however, this did not achieve statistical significance from control (p = 0.07) (Fig. 5). A more marked effect was observed following seven additional depolarizing trains whereby control ΔCm increased by 266 ± 47 fF from baseline, whereas cholesterol depletion resulted in a rise of 698 ± 74 fF (n = 6; p < 0.001), indicating a greater capacity to fill up the readily releasable pool and amplify exocytosis.

Mutations in COMP or matrilin-3 cause related forms of human chondrodysplasia, and the COMP mutation D469Δ, which is found in patients with pseudoachondroplasia, has been shown to cause a reduced calcium binding. Despite this, the mutation causes only a slight decrease in matrilin-4 binding. This indicates that impaired binding of COMP to matrilins does not cause the pseudoachondroplasia phenotype but rather that matrilins may be coretained in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum where COMP accumulates in the chondrocytes of patients.

IntroductionAlthough the cartilage extracellular matrix contains only a limited number of structural proteins, many aspects of their assembly into a functional matrix remain to be described. Cartilage collagen fibrils and aggrecan, assembled into large aggregates, form the major networks that provide tensile strength and elasticity, whereas other matrix proteins are believed to mediate additional steps in the matrix assembly. Of these proteins, COMP 1The abbreviations used are: COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; TC, C-terminal COMP domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; T3, thrombospondin type 3 repeat-containing COMP domain; VWA, von Willebrand factor A.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) are among the most abundant and share the feature of having an oligomeric structure, allowing polyvalent interactions.COMP is a homopentameric member of the thrombospondin protein family (for review see Ref. 3Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal α-helical coiled-coil oligomerization domain is followed by four epidermal growth factor-like domains, eight calcium-binding thrombospondin type 3 (T3) repeats, and a globular domain (TC) at the C terminus. COMP is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments and has been shown to bind to collagens I, II, and IX (4Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D.

Mutations in COMP can lead to two related human diseases, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (7Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).The matrilins constitute a recently discovered family of extracellular matrix proteins (2Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Matrilin-2 and -4 have broad tissue distributions in both dense and loose connective tissue, whereas matrilin-1 and -3 are expressed almost exclusively in skeletal tissues. In the extracellular matrix of cultured cells, matrilins are deposited in fibrillar networks. All matrilins have a similar modular composition, with von Willebrand factor A (VWA)-like and epidermal growth factor-like domains followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It is thought that matrilins play a role in mediating interactions between major components of the extracellular matrix such as collagens and proteoglycans (8Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the three forms abundant in cartilage, namely matrilin-1, -3, and –4, are indeed associated with native collagen type VI microfibrils extracted from rat chondrosarcoma tissue (9Wiberg C.

Here the matrilins are bound to the small leucinerich repeat proteoglycans biglycan and decorin, which, in turn, interact with the N-terminal globular domains of the collagen VI molecules. When located at the periphery of the microfibrillar complex, matrilins mediate interactions with aggrecan or collagen II. Matrilin-3 is strongly up-regulated in human osteoarthritic cartilage (10Pullig O. Weseloh G. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Swoboda B. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2002; 10: 253-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a missense mutation in the human matrilin-3 gene was recently found to coincide with hand osteoarthritis in a group of patients in the Icelandic population (11Stefansson S.E.

As in the case of COMP, mutations in the matrilin-3 gene have been shown to cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (12Chapman K.L. Mortier G.R. Chapman K. Loughlin J. Grant M.E. Briggs M.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified an interaction between COMP and members of the matrilin family that is likely to be of importance both in extracellular matrix assembly and in the pathogenesis of chondrodysplasias.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGel Filtration Analysis—The extraction of matrix proteins from bovine cartilage was performed essentially as described earlier (13DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Carlson C.S. Pasumarti S. Paulsson M. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In brief, fresh cartilage (∼100 g, wet weight) from adult bovine shoulder joints was homogenized using a Moulinex MiniPro homogenizer at full speed in 200 ml of prechilled extraction buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) without EDTA. Tissue residue was collected by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. This wash cycle was repeated twice, each time with 10 min of homogenization. The tissue residue was then suspended in 200 ml of the same buffer containing, in addition, 10 mm EDTA and extracted for 2 h with stirring at 4 °C. The extraction with the EDTA-containing buffer was repeated twice, and the extracts were pooled.The crude extract was cleared by filtration and concentrated 100-fold by ultrafiltration. Gel filtration was performed using a pre-packed Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with extraction buffer. For detection of the calcium-dependent co-elution of matrix proteins, the concentrated cartilage extract was dialyzed against extraction buffer without EDTA and, finally, against extraction buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2, which was also used during gel filtration. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were visualized by silver stain. Peptide mapping and identification of protein bands by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed as described previously (14Sengle G. Kobbe B. Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50240-50249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—After SDS-PAGE, protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human COMP (12-C4) (15Vilim V.

Primary antibodies were detected using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates and the ECL chemoluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—A bovine cartilage extract was dialyzed extensively against distilled water containing 10 μm EDTA to capture endogenous calcium. CaCl2 was then added at concentrations as indicated in Fig. 1C, and samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-treated with matrilin-1 antibody. After precipitation the protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with PBS, and co-precipitated COMP was detected by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody to COMP (12-C4).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant expression in human embryonic kidney 293/Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen cells and conventional chromatographic purification as well as the use of affinity chromatography in the purification of tagged proteins have been described previously (5Thur J.

The cDNAs encoding full-length matrilin-3 and monomeric matrilin-4 lacking the coiled-coil domain were amplified by PCR using primers that inserted an SpeI restriction site at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end, respectively (matn3 forward, 5′-GCCCACTAGTCCGTTTGGCCCGCGCGAGC-3′, and matn3 reverse, 5′-CAATGCGGCCGCACGATGTACTTGTCCATATTC-3′; matn4m forward, 5′-GCCACTAGTCCAGCTCCAGTCTGCAGGTCC-3′, and matn4m reverse, 5′-CAATGCGGCCGCCTCTGGGCAAATGCTGCCTTTG-3′). After digestion with SpeI and NotI, the amplified cDNA fragments were inserted into the expression vector pCEP-Pu-StrepII-tag (C-terminal) in-frame with the sequence of the signal peptide of BM40 (20Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding matrilin-4 VWA1 and VWA2 was amplified by PCR using primers that inserted an NheI restriction site at the 5′-end and a NotI site 3′ to the stop codon (matn4A1 forward, 5′-GCCACTAGTCTGCTATAATGGGCCCCTGGATT-3′, and matn4A1 reverse, 5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTACCCGCACAGGCGGCCCTG-3′; matn4A2 forward, 5′-GCCCACTAGTCTGCCGGGAGGGCCACGTG-3′, and matn4A2 reverse, 5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTTAGCAAATGCTGCCTTTGAGATTC-3′).

Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids carrying cDNAs encoding full-length matrilin-3 and matrilin-4 VWA1 and VWA2 were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293/Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen cells (Invitrogen) using FuGENE6 (Roche). Transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluency. Secretion of recombinant proteins into the cell culture medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE performed on medium samples from transfected cells and by immunoblotting using specific antisera directed against matrilin-3 and matrilin-4, respectively. The serum-free cell culture supernatant containing the C-terminally Strep-tag II-tagged matrilin-3 was applied to a Strep-tactin column (1.5 ml; IBA) and eluted with 2.5 mm desthiobiotin and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Purification of the recombinant His6-tagged matrilin-4 proteins from serum-free cell culture supernatants was carried out using TALON metal affinity columns (Clontech) following the supplier's protocol. C-terminally Strep-tag II-tagged matrilin-4 full-length wild type protein was expressed and purified as described earlier (16Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Macht M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17267-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The recombinant full-length wild type COMP, the truncated COMP carrying the T3 and TC domains, the COMP TC domain alone, and the COMP full-length protein carrying the D469Δ mutation were expressed carrying a N-terminal His6-Myc-factorX tag as described (18Spitznagel L. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Zaucke F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 479-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COMP monomer was expressed without a tag and subsequently purified on a Q-Sepharose FastFlow ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and a Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration column (Amersham Bioscience) as described (19Thur J. The Effects of Chondrodysplasia-associated Mutations on the Structure and Function of the Cartilage Oligometric Matrix Protein. University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany2000Google Scholar). The COMP and matrilin-4 coiled-coil domains were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described earlier (21Efimov V.P. Engel J. Malashkevich V.N.

After the removal of proteoglycans on a DEAE-Sepharose FastFlow column (Amersham Biosciences), the flow-through was concentrated on an SP-Sepharose FastFlow column (Amersham Bioscience), and the matrilin-1-containing eluate fractions were submitted to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Bioscience) as described (8Hauser N.

Proteins in the panel used for ligand screening were kind gifts of M. Aumailley (laminin-1 and fibronectin), U. Hansen (collagen XI), M. Koch (collagens XII, XIV, and XXII), M. Mörgelin (chondroadherin and the proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein), N. Smyth (decorin), and F. Zaucke (COMP) or were purchased from Sigma (collagens I and II). Purified proteins were diluted in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and coated at 10 μg/ml (500 ng/well) overnight at 4 °C onto 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorb). After washing with Tris-buffered saline and 05% Tween 20, plates were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline and 5% milk powder. Fluid phase ligands were diluted to concentrations between 0.01 and 50 nm for titration experiments or to 20 nm for single point determinations and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, bound ligands were detected with specific polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against matrilin-1 (23Hauser N. Paulsson M. J.

Absorption was measured at 450 nm after stopping the reaction with 10% sulfuric acid.RESULTSCOMP and Matrilin-1 Co-elute in Gel Filtration Performed in the Presence of CaCl2—To identify the components of the cartilage extracellular matrix that interact in a calcium-dependent manner, the gel filtration elution profile of a bovine cartilage extract obtained in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 was compared with that of an extract chromatographed in the absence of divalent cations. A comparison of fractions by reducing SDS-PAGE revealed that a band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa was markedly shifted toward the void volume in the presence of calcium where it co-eluted with a band of 100-kDa apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1A). By in-gel trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis (not shown) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B) the 60-kDa protein was identified as matrilin-1, and the 100-kDa protein was identified as COMP by immunoblot (Fig. 1B). The COMP peak was also shifted slightly toward the void volume in the presence of calcium, indicating an increase in mass of the COMP-containing complex. The formation of a calcium-dependent complex between COMP and matrilin-1 was confirmed by the co-precipitation of COMP when matrilin-1 was immunoprecipitated from a cartilage extract (Fig. 1C). The interaction between COMP and matrilin-1 was already saturated by the addition of calcium at a concentration of 1 μm.Screen for Matrilin Ligands Using an ELISA-style Binding Assay—A panel of different purified proteins and proteoglycans from the cartilage extracellular matrix was tested for interactions with matrilin-1, -3, and -4, the three matrilins most abundant in cartilage, in an ELISA-style ligand binding assay. COMP was identified as the protein giving the highest signal (Fig. 2). The fact that all three matrilins showed significant binding to COMP indicated a conservation of the COMP interaction among matrilins.Fig. 2Screen for matrilin ligands using an ELISA-style ligand binding assay. A panel of different proteins and proteoglycans from cartilage extracellular matrix was tested for interactions with matrilin-1, -3, and -4. The proteins in the panel (10 μg/ml) were coated to the plastic and incubated with full-length matrilin-1 (A), matrilin-3 (B), and matrilin-4 (C) (concentration equalling 50 nm; matrilin-1, 8.7 μg/ml; matrilin-3, 10.7 μg/ml; and matrilin-4, 11.0 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h.

Abs., absorbance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Shorter constructs of COMP and matrilin-4 were tested in ELISA-style ligand binding assays with each of the proteins being studied both in the fluid and on the solid phase. When full-length COMP was coated and different matrilin-4 proteins were used as ligands in the fluid phase (Fig. 4, A and B), the matrilin-4 full-length protein showed the strongest binding, followed by a moderate binding of a matrilin-4 monomer lacking the coiled-coil oligomerization domain. However, the single VWA domains as well as the isolated coiled-coil domain did not bind to the immobilized COMP. In an inverted assay we coated full-length matrilin-4 and the shorter forms using both full-length wild type COMP and a mutant form (D469Δ) as ligands in the fluid phase (Fig. 4C). The COMP D469Δ mutation found in chondrodysplasia patients results in a decreased binding capacity for calcium (5Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M.

When matrilin-4 was coated, the D469Δ mutant bound to the same extent as did wild type COMP (Figs. 4C and 5C). The binding to matrilin-4 was moderately decreased by the mutation when the mutant COMP was immobilized (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the results indicate only a mild influence of the mutation on matrilin-4 binding, whereas the addition of EDTA completely abolished the interaction (not shown). Significant binding to full-length matrilin-4 was seen, whereas only weak binding to both VWA domains was detected, and no binding to the matrilin-4 coiled-coil domain was found (Fig. 4, C and D).Fig. 4Binding of full-length and truncated matrilin-4 to COMP and D469Δ COMP in an ELISA-style ligand binding assay.

In all assays the proteins were coated onto plastic at 10 μg/ml, and the ligands in the liquid phase were used at 20 nm in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2.

After incubation with full-length matrilin-4 in the fluid phase, strong signals were detected for both full-length wild type and mutant COMP. A weak signal was seen with the coiledcoil domain alone, whereas the monomeric COMP and the shorter constructs showed no significant binding. The addition of EDTA abolished binding (not shown). When the plate was coated with full-length matrilin-4 in an inverted assay (Fig. 5C), full-length COMP as well as the mutant COMP bound strongly, whereas monomeric COMP, the T3+TC domain pair, and the TC domain alone showed only weak interactions.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified and characterized a calcium-dependent interaction between COMP and matrilins, proteins thought to mediate assembly of the cartilage extracellular matrix. The identification of a complex between COMP and matrilin-1 in CaCl2-containing cartilage extracts indicates a physiological role for a COMP-matrilin interaction. Both COMP and matrilins have been shown to associate with cartilage collagen fibrils (4Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, matrilins are components of the collagen VI-containing microfibrils found in cartilage (9Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here the leucine-rich-repeat proteoglycans decorin and biglycan bind to the N-terminal non-collagenous domains of collagen VI molecules and then, in turn, also to matrilins. The matrilins at the periphery of the microfibrillar structure show association with both collagen II molecules and aggrecan and presumably act as adaptors connecting the microfibrils to the other macromolecular networks. The interactions between COMP and matrilins are, at least in part, likely to take place at the surface of the collagen fibrils and may be of importance in creating a “perifibrillar” matrix of a defined composition. They also may be of relevance for the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and for interactions between collagen fibrils, issues to be the subjects of further studies.An indication of a pathophysiological relevance for the COMP-matrilin interaction comes from the fact that mutations in either COMP, collagen IX, or matrilin-3 have been shown to cause the related pseudoachondroplasia or multiple epiphyseal dysplasia forms of chondrodysplasia (7Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In pseudoachondroplasia patients carrying mutations in COMP as well as in cell culture models of this disease, COMP is retained in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum of the chondrocytes, and collagen IX co-accumulates, presumably due to the COMP-collagen IX interaction (24Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11412-11417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Dinser R. Zaucke F. Kreppel F. Hultenby K. Kochanek S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present how the mutations in matrilin-3 result in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Possibly, mutations in any of these three interacting proteins, namely COMP, collagen IX, or matrilin-3, result in the retention of a similar set of molecules independent of which protein actually harbors the mutation. This may explain why changes in any of these three proteins lead to a similar clinical phenotype. Indeed, in a recent review of the etiology of chondrodysplasias, Briggs and Chapman mentioned preliminary data on a high affinity binding of matrilin-3 to COMP in this context, but, in contrast to our results, the interaction was described as being cation-independent (7Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In all our experiments the binding was completely abolished by the addition of EDTA. The calcium binding to COMP is well studied, and it has been determined that the T3 repeats can bind 14–17 Ca2+ ions (5Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11412-11417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The chondrodysplasia-causing D469Δ mutation leads to a partial loss of calcium binding sites and also to a slightly reduced affinity for collagens I, II, and IX (5Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium the mutant protein does not show the compact shape of wild type COMP but instead a more extended conformation (27Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was shown that the secondary structure of COMP is not dramatically affected and that the collagen affinity is only slightly diminished (5Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), indicating that the structure of the individual domains is at least partially retained and that the remaining Ca2+ binding sites are sufficient for ligand binding. This could explain why the D469Δ mutation only mildly influences the COMP-matrilin interaction in our experiments. The matrilin-4 binding was moderately reduced only in assays where the mutant COMP was immobilized, whereas binding of wild type and mutant COMP to immobilized matrilin-4 was comparable. Thus, it is likely that mutant COMP retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum would have the capacity to interact with matrilins and reduce their secretion.Full-length COMP binds to full-length matrilin-4 with high affinity (Fig. 3). When either full-length COMP or monomeric COMP lacking the oligomerization domain was immobilized on ELISA plates, only the full-length, pentameric protein bound matrilin-4. In contrast, immobilized full-length matrilin-4 is able to bind the COMP monomer, although this interaction appears to be much weaker than that between the oligomers. Immobilized full-length COMP binds monomeric matrilin-4, but the amount bound is significantly decreased as compared with the oligomeric form. The preference for the oligomeric protein forms indicates a multivalent binding mechanism. This is of interest because both COMP and matrilins have been shown to be prone to degradation by proteolysis (16Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Macht M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17267-17275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Neidhart M. Hauser N. Paulsson M. DiCesare P.E. Michel B.A. Häuselmann H.J. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 36: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It could be that limited proteolysis, which in both cases occurs at sites close to the coiled-coil oligomerization domains and releases almost complete but monomeric subunits, also regulates COMP-matrilin interactions in vivo. The cooperative nature of the interaction did, however, hamper our attempts to determine the protein domains in COMP and matrilin-4 that are directly involved in binding, as the truncated proteins employed gave only weak or no binding. It is likely that residual affinity remains also in truncated, monomeric proteins and that future experiments employing more sensitive binding assays or artificially oligomerized subunits will be more informative. IntroductionAlthough the cartilage extracellular matrix contains only a limited number of structural proteins, many aspects of their assembly into a functional matrix remain to be described. Cartilage collagen fibrils and aggrecan, assembled into large aggregates, form the major networks that provide tensile strength and elasticity, whereas other matrix proteins are believed to mediate additional steps in the matrix assembly. Of these proteins, COMP 1The abbreviations used are: COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; TC, C-terminal COMP domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; T3, thrombospondin type 3 repeat-containing COMP domain; VWA, von Willebrand factor A. (1Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the four members of the matrilin family (for review see Ref. 2Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) are among the most abundant and share the feature of having an oligomeric structure, allowing polyvalent interactions.COMP is a homopentameric member of the thrombospondin protein family (for review see Ref. 3Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal α-helical coiled-coil oligomerization domain is followed by four epidermal growth factor-like domains, eight calcium-binding thrombospondin type 3 (T3) repeats, and a globular domain (TC) at the C terminus. COMP is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments and has been shown to bind to collagens I, II, and IX (4Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D.

Mutations in COMP can lead to two related human diseases, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (7Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).The matrilins constitute a recently discovered family of extracellular matrix proteins (2Deák F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Matrilin-2 and -4 have broad tissue distributions in both dense and loose connective tissue, whereas matrilin-1 and -3 are expressed almost exclusively in skeletal tissues. In the extracellular matrix of cultured cells, matrilins are deposited in fibrillar networks. All matrilins have a similar modular composition, with von Willebrand factor A (VWA)-like and epidermal growth factor-like domains followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It is thought that matrilins play a role in mediating interactions between major components of the extracellular matrix such as collagens and proteoglycans (8Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the three forms abundant in cartilage, namely matrilin-1, -3, and –4, are indeed associated with native collagen type VI microfibrils extracted from rat chondrosarcoma tissue (9Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here the matrilins are bound to the small leucinerich repeat proteoglycans biglycan and decorin, which, in turn, interact with the N-terminal globular domains of the collagen VI molecules. When located at the periphery of the microfibrillar complex, matrilins mediate interactions with aggrecan or collagen II. Matrilin-3 is strongly up-regulated in human osteoarthritic cartilage (10Pullig O. Weseloh G. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Swoboda B. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2002; 10: 253-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a missense mutation in the human matrilin-3 gene was recently found to coincide with hand osteoarthritis in a group of patients in the Icelandic population (11Stefansson S.E.

As in the case of COMP, mutations in the matrilin-3 gene have been shown to cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (12Chapman K.L. Mortier G.R. Chapman K. Loughlin J. Grant M.E. Briggs M.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified an interaction between COMP and members of the matrilin family that is likely to be of importance both in extracellular matrix assembly and in the pathogenesis of chondrodysplasias."

The E6 protein of HPV 16 mediates the rapid degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, although this is not the only function of E6 and cannot completely explain its transforming potential. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that E6 can protect cells from tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis by binding to the C-terminal end of tumor necrosis factor R1, thus blocking apoptotic signal transduction. In this study, E6 was shown to also protect cells from apoptosis induced via the Fas pathway. Furthermore, use of an inducible E6 expression system demonstrated that this protection is dose-dependent, with higher levels of E6 leading to greater protection. Although E6 suppresses activation of both caspase 3 and caspase 8, it does not affect apoptotic signaling through the mitochondrial pathway. Mammalian two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays were then used to demonstrate that E6 binds directly to the death effector domain of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), with deletion and site-directed mutants enabling the localization of the E6-binding site to the N-terminal end of the FADD death effector domain. E6 is produced in two forms as follows: a full-length version of ∼16 kDa and a smaller version of about half that size corresponding to the N-terminal half of the full-length protein. Pull-down and functional assays demonstrated that the full-length version, but not the small version of E6, was able to bind to FADD and to protect cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, binding to E6 leads to degradation of FADD, with the loss of cellular FADD proportional to the amount of E6 expressed. These results support a model in which E6-mediated degradation of FADD prevents transmission of apoptotic signals via the Fas pathway.

Here we examine the fitness effects of 18 random insertion mutations in E. coli in two resource environments and five genetic backgrounds. We tested each mutation for plasticity and epistasis by comparing its fitness effects across these ecological and genetic contexts. Some mutations had no measurable effect in any of these contexts. None of the mutations had effects on phenotypic plasticity that were independent of genetic background. However, half the mutations had epistatic interactions such that their effects differed among genetic backgrounds, usually in an environment-dependent manner. Also, the pattern of mutational effects across backgrounds indicated that epistasis had been shaped primarily by unique events in the evolutionary history of a population rather than by repeatable events associated with shared environmental history."

One proposed survival mechanism is the production of protective antioxidant proteins to neutralize oxidative damage resulting from the host's immune response as well as self-generated oxygen radicals (3LoVerde P.T.

Therefore, we sought to identify additional schistosome antioxidant enzymes that would neutralize H2O2. Potentially the identification and characterization of these enzymes will contribute to an anti-schistosome vaccine or chemotherapy targeting the redox system of the parasite. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a novel class of antioxidants recently described in a wide variety of organisms (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In our previous work we described a Prx (referred to as thioredoxin peroxidase) in schistosomes with biochemical properties similar to known Prx enzymes using thioredoxin as an electron donor (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was reasonably abundant in all stages tested and was found at elevated levels in the parasite egg and egg secretions (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J.

During its catalytic cycle Prx becomes oxidized through the formation of sulfenic acid derivatives of cysteine (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 14Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). Reduction of these intermediates is accomplished by thioredoxin (Trx) in most eukaryotic cells. Thioredoxin itself is maintained in the reduced state by Trx reductase (TrxR), an NADPH-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase (16Gromer S. Urig S. Becker K. Med. Res. Rev. 2004; 24: 40-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A parallel thiol-based redox system utilizing GPx, glutathione (GSH), and GSH reductase (GR) exists in most cells (17Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol-based reducing system in S. mansoni has been shown to have unique properties. Schistosomes lack both TrxR and GR and instead have an unusual pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase Trx-GSH reductase (TGR) functioning on both Trx and GSH reduction (18Alger H.M. Williams D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 121: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this context, thiol-dependent redox mechanisms in schistosomes appear intriguing. Therefore, in this study we sought to further our understanding of thiol-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism in S. mansoni. Two novel schistosome Prx enzymes were identified, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and biochemically characterized. As expected, the new proteins were active with Trx on a range of hydroperoxide substrates. Additionally, these new proteins showed an unusual ability to utilize GSH as reducing agent. Furthermore, GSH affinity was shown to be conferred by the 22 C-terminal amino acids. The new proteins also were shown to be sensitive to overoxidation by hydroperoxides; the previously characterized Prx was found to be remarkably resistant to overoxidation. The evolution of Prx enzymes in schistosomes as GSH-utilizing and -sensitive/-resistant isoforms shows the importance of these enzymes in the thiol-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism of this important human parasite.

A novel Prx sequence (Prx2) was identified in EST MAAD0093.RAR, which was obtained from Dr. Jucara Para, Belo Horizonte, Brazil and sequenced in its entirety. The complete Prx2 cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™ with the accession number AF157561. A second novel Prx sequence (Prx3) was identified in the EST data base and cloned by PCR from a mixed-sex adult cDNA library. The 5′-end was cloned using a primer (5′-CCACCACCGCTGTTCCGCAG-3′) designed from EST AW017130 and the T3 promoter primer of pBluescript. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced, and a primer was designed (5′-CGTCGTGACGTTCGGAGATG-3′) to amplify the 3′-end of the gene from the cDNA library with the T7 promoter primer of pBluescript. The complete cDNA sequence of Prx3 was deposited in GenBank™ with the accession number AF301001. Analysis of S. mansoni encoded Prx proteins was by ClustalW (version 1.7) (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Isolation from the Sm1 BAC library and sequencing of S. mansoni Prx genes was as described previously (20Foulk B.W. Pappas G. Hirai Y. Hirai H. Williams D.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Production and Purification—The entire open reading frame of each S. mansoni Prx was amplified by PCR (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers modified to contain BamHI and HindIII restriction sites to facilitate subcloning afterward into pRSETA expression plasmid (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers used were Prx2F (5′-CATGGATCCATGTTGTTACCAAATCAACC-3′), Prx2R (5′-CTGAAGCTTTCAGTGACAAGAGGAGAA-3′), Prx3F (5′-CTCAGGATCCGTTATGTCGTCATTATGCAGC-3′), and Prx3R (5′-CTGCAAGCTTAATTAACCTTATGAAAATATTC-3′). The 33 N-terminal amino acids constituting the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of Prx3 were not included in the expression plasmid. Open reading frames in pRSETA were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The induction of recombinant proteins in E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) was performed as described (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Prx2 and Prx3 cells were sonicated in 5% monothioglycerol (3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and 10 mm imidazole in start buffer (0.07 m Na2HPO4, 0.01 m NaH2PO4, and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4). The supernatant was filtered and applied to pre-equilibrated His-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences). The desired protein was then eluted from the column by using increasing concentrations of imidazole ± 5% monothioglycerol in start buffer. Protein concentration was then checked by Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein purity was checked by using SDS-PAGE. The purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at –20 °C until used. Expression and Purification of Recombinant E. coli Thioredoxin and Thioredoxin Reductase—The coding sequences for E. coli (Ec)Trx and EcTrxR were cloned into pRSETA as described above. Primers used were EcTrx-F (5′-GCGGGATCCAGCGATAAAATTATTCACCTG-3′); EcTrx-R (5′-GCGAAGCTTTTACGCCAGGTTAGCGTCGAG-3′); EcTrxR-F (5′-GCGGGATCCGGCACGACCAAACACAGT-3′); and EcTrxR-R (5′-GCGAAGCTTTTATTTTCGCTCAGCTAAACC-3′). Expression and purification of His6-tagged recombinant EcTrx and EcTrxR were accomplished in E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS as described above. Flavin mononucleotide was added to sonicates of cells expressing EcTrxR to fully saturate the enzyme. PCR-mediated Site-directed Mutagenesis of S. mansoni Prx2—The BamHI-HindIII fragment that represents the complete S. mansoni Prx2 coding sequence ligated into pRESTA-expressing vector served as PCR template. The forward mutated primer (mutated sequences are underlined) 5′-CAT GGC GAA GTT TCT CCA GCG AAC-3′ was used with Prx2R to amplify the first mutated strand in PCR1. The reverse mutated Prx2 primer 5′-CCA GTT CGC TGG AGA AAC TTC GCC-3′ was used with Prx2F to amplify the complementary strand in PCR2. The two primary PCR products were then mixed equally, denatured, and allowed to re-anneal at 40 °C. The overlapping (21 nucleotides) heteroduplexes with recessed 3′-ends were extended by 40 cycles at (96 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 3 min) in PCR3. The extended product from PCR3 was amplified with Prx2F and Prx2R primers in PCR4. The product from PCR4 was cloned into PCRII vector using TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen). The sequence of mutagenized Prx2 in which Cys168 is replaced by serine (C168S) was verified by sequencing. The Prx2 C168S expression plasmid was generated by digestion the PCRII vector with BamHI and HindIII, separating the desired fragment on low melting agarose gel, using β-agarose (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) digestion for 1 h at 40 °C, purified with phenol/chloroform extraction, and ligated into predigested and purified pRSETA expression vector with the Quick Ligase kit (New England Biolabs). The entire sequence was verified again by sequencing before transformation into chemically competent (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) BLR(DE3)pLysS cells. Induction and purification of recombinant protein was performed as described above. Tailed S. mansoni Prx1 Cloning and Overexpression—The 12 C-terminal amino acids (174KRGQHGIKVNQK185) of Prx1 were replaced with the 22 C-terminal amino acids of Prx2 (173KPNSATIKPDPVASLSYFSSVH194) using PCR reaction with specifically designed primers. A 93-oligonucleotide reverse primer, including the 22 C-terminal amino acids of Prx2 plus an 18-amino acid overlapping sequence with Prx1 (5′-GCG AAG CTT TCA GTC CAC AGA GGA GAA GTA GGA GAG AGA AGC AAC AGG ATC AGG TTT TAT TGT TGC TGA ATT TGG TTT CCA GTT CAC CGG ACA-3′) was used with Prx1F (5′-CACGGATCCACCATGGTATTGTTGCCTAA-3′). The tailed Prx1 was then cloned into PCRII using a TOPO TA cloning kit. The sequence of the tailed Prx1 insert was verified. Recombinant tailed SmPrx1 was generated in a pRESTA expression system and purified as described above. C-terminally Truncated SmPrx2—The 21 amino acid C-terminally (C-) truncated Prx2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers Prx2F and Prx2MR 5′-GCGAAGCTTTTATTTCCAGTTCGCTGGACA-3′ with BamHI and HindIII restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. C-truncated Prx2 protein terminates after residue Lys173. The amplified C-truncated Prx2 was cloned into PCRII vector and into expression vector pRSETA as described above. The sequence was verified in both vectors. The induction and purification of recombinant C-truncated Prx2 protein was done as described above with the addition of 5% monothioglycerol and 10% glycerol to sonication buffer. Specific Activity Determinations of S. mansoni Peroxiredoxins—Reduction of H2O2, t-butylhydroperoxide, and cumene hydroperoxide by purified recombinant schistosome peroxiredoxins was measured in a coupled reaction (8Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) with EcTrx and EcTrxR by consumption of NADPH at 25 °C in a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. The reaction mixture contained 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NADPH, and where appropriate, 16 μm EcTrx and 0.15 μm EcTrxR, or 1 mm glutathione and 0.1 unit/ml yeast GR (Calbiochem). Background NADPH consumption was measured in the absence of peroxiredoxins. Enzymatic oxidation of NADPH was initiated by adding hydroperoxide (0.5 mm) to the sample cuvette and monitoring A340 for 2 min. Background rates were subtracted from the experimental rates. The specific activity of the sample was determined from the equation, units of Prx/mg of protein = {[(ΔA/ΔT × Vt)/(6.22 × Vs)] × 1000}/[protein] (in milligrams/ml), where 6.22 = extinction coefficient of NADPH (mm–1 · cm–1), Vt is the total reaction volume, Vs is the sample volume, and 1000 is used to convert to nanomoles. One unit of Prx activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to cause the oxidation of 1 nmol of NADPH per min under the assay conditions described. Kinetic Analysis of S. mansoni Peroxiredoxins—Detailed steadystate kinetic analysis was performed using the assay described above with the conditions described by Dalziel (22Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 27670-27678Google Scholar). Concentrations of EcTrx (4–100 μm), GSH (100–500 μm), and hydroperoxide (50–500 μm) were selected. Overoxidation of S. mansoni Peroxiredoxins—Trx-dependent NADPH oxidation expressed as decrease in A340 was monitored at 25 °C for Prx1 and C-truncated Prx2 with H2O2 concentrations of 0.1–30 mm and for Prx2 and tailed-Prx1 with H2O2 concentrations of 0.1–2.5 mm. The rate of NADPH consumption at each time interval was expressed as a percentage of the initial enzyme rate. The rate of peroxide inactivation of Prx1, Prx2, C-truncated Prx2, and tailed-Prx1 was calculated by plotting the slopes of rates versus H2O2 concentrations as described (23Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins of S. mansoni—Screening the existing S. mansoni EST data base identified two novel 2-cysteine Prx genes that were cloned and sequenced. Sequences of Prx1 (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Prx2, and Prx3 were verified by sequencing genomic clones identified in the Sm1 BAC library (24Le Paslier M.C. Pierce R.J. Merlin F. Hirai H. Wu W. Williams D.L. Johnston D. LoVerde P.T. Le Paslier D. Genomics. 2000; 65: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and submitted to GenBank™ with the accession numbers AF301002–AF301004 (data not shown). The three predicted schistosome Prx proteins are ∼60% identical to each other (Fig. 1) and to Prx from numerous other organisms. Conservation of both peroxidatic and resolving cysteines and neighboring amino acids places them in 2-Cys Prx family (11Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Prx3 is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein with a probability of export to mitochondria of 0.85 and a cleavage site after Ala33 (25Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). All S. mansoni Prx proteins and mutants were expressed at high levels in E. coli (Fig. 2). Several proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies and were effectively solubilized in 5% (v/v) monothioglycerol (tailed-Prx1, Prx2, Prx2 C168S, and Prx3) or in 5% monothioglycerol plus 10% (v/v) glycerol (C-truncated-Prx2).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant S. mansoni peroxiredoxins.Lane 1, Coomassie Blue-stained 16% polyacrylamide gel with purified recombinant Prx1; lane 2, Prx2; lane 3, Prx3; lane 4, Prx2 C168S; lane 5, C-truncated Prx2; lane 6, tailed Prx1.

Prx2 and Prx3 are highly active with Trx and GSH, the first two-Cys peroxiredoxins to have such activity. The activity with GSH appears to be conferred by the C-terminal portion of the protein as tailed-Prx1; Prx1, with the 22 C-terminal amino acids of Prx2, is also highly active with GSH. As shown previously (12Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J. Parasitol. 2000; 86: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Prx1 has ∼10% of the activity with GSH compared with Trx. The newly identified Prx2 and Prx3 were found to be more active with cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide than Prx1. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of Recombinant S. mansoni Prx—Peroxiredoxins characterized to date have non-saturable behavior typical of a double displacement (ping-pong) mechanism (11Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism of parasite Prx1 was determined by single curve progression analysis (22Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 27670-27678Google Scholar) at several fixed concentrations of E. coli Trx. The H2O2 concentration was selected such that the assay rate was dependent on its concentration. The reciprocal initial velocities multiplied by the enzyme molar concentration were plotted against the reciprocal concentrations of H2O2. These plots yielded parallel lines (Fig. 4A), which implies non-saturable kinetics as described by Dalziel equation for bi-substrate reactions as shown in Equation 1, Â[E]0/v=Î¦0+Î¦1/[A]+Î¦2/[B]Â(Eq. 1) where [E]0,[A], and [B] are the molarities of enzyme, hydroperoxide, and reduced thioredoxin. In this case ternary complexes between the enzymes and both substrates (Φ1,2/[A][B]) are not formed during the catalysis. The ordinate intercepts represent apparent maximum velocities for infinite H2O2 concentrations at defined concentrations of Trx. In the secondary plot (Fig. 4B) these intercepts are plotted against the reciprocal Trx concentrations to yield the real maximum velocity. The real maximum velocity of Prx1 was determined to be infinite (Table I). Φ0 was found to be zero, indicating that enzyme saturation by substrate cannot be achieved. Therefore, Prx1 catalysis looks like two independent reactions. First, the reduced Prx1 is oxidized by a hydrogen peroxide (Reaction 1), Prx1red+HOOH→k1′Prx1oxd+H2O Second, the reduced enzyme is regenerated again by reduced thioredoxin (Reaction 2), Prx1oxd+Trxred→k2′Prx1red+Trxoxd+H2O The Dalziel coefficients Φ1 and Φ2 are the reciprocal values of the apparent net forward rate constants k′1 and k′2, respectively (Table I).Table 1Dalziel coefficients Φ0, Φ1, and Φ2for the wild type S. mansoni recombinant Prx1 and C-truncated Prx2 with different hydroperoxidesEnzyme (thiol system)Kinetic parametersSubstrateΦ0Φ1Φ2kcatsμm ss-1SmPrx1 (Trx/TR)H2O203.516∞Cumene OOH01.320∞t-bOOH01.24.5∞SmPrx1 (GSH/GR)H2O205.70.4∞Cumene OOH02.11.0∞t-bOOH02.90.1∞C-truncated Sm Prx2 (Trx/TR)H2O204.520∞Cumene OOH02.827∞t-bOOH01.38.0∞ Open table in a new tab As indicated earlier, Prx2 and Prx3 are active with both thiol-reducing systems (Fig. 3). Prx2 and Prx3 exhibit saturable, Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics, in which saturation conditions were achieved with different hydroperoxide substrates tested. Michaelis constants (Km), catalytic constants (kcat), and catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were determined (Tables II and III). The Km for E. coli Trx was ∼9 μm and ∼200 μm for GSH for both Prx2 and Prx3. The Km for hydroperoxide substrates was dependent on the thiol-reducing agent present. Prx2 had a higher affinity for hydroperoxides in the presence of GSH (Km 2–5 times lower with GSH than with Trx), whereas Prx3 had a higher affinity for hydroperoxides in the presence of Trx (Km 1.3–6 times lower with Trx than with GSH). The catalytic efficiencies of Prx2 and Prx3 were similar to those for other peroxiredoxins (104–105m–1 s–1) (15Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). Catalytic efficiencies were generally higher with GSH than with Trx for both Prx2 and Prx3 resulting primarily from a higher catalytic rate (kcat) with GSH than with Trx. Affinity for the three hydroperoxide substrates were similar for Prx2 and Prx3, with a slight decrease in activity (H2O2 > cumene hydroperoxide > t-butylhydroperoxide) seen with Prx2. Further analysis indicated that Prx2 (results not shown) and Prx3 indeed displayed a single displacement-like mechanisms (Fig. 5). Significant inhibition of a Prx2 and Prx3 activity at higher concentrations of hydroperoxide substrate was seen (results not shown).Table IISaturation kinetic constants for wild type and mutated S. mansoni peroxiredoxins and hydroperoxide dependenceEnzymeSubstrateHydrogen peroxideCumene hydroperoxidet-ButylhydroperoxideKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1SmPrx2GSH99192 × 105808.21 × 1051359.27 × 104Trx2159.85 × 1044284.91 × 1045804.57 × 103SmPrx3GSH316411 × 1052969.63 × 1043208.63 × 104Trx1664.02 × 1042213.01 × 104522.24 × 104Tailed SmPrx1GSH82201 × 105627.61 × 1051167.06 × 104Trx3165.51 × 1043992.97 × 1034133.37 × 103 Open table in a new tab Table IIISaturation kinetic constants for wild type and mutated S. mansoni peroxiredoxins, thiol dependenceEnzymeSubstrateThioredoxinGlutathioneKmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1μms-1m-1 s-1SmPrx28.74.35 × 10521610.34 × 104SmPrx39.53.33 × 10519520.21 × 105Tailed SmPrx17.34.26 × 1052349.14 × 104 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analysis of Recombinant Mutant S. mansoni Prxs—To understand the unusual activity of both Prx2 and Prx3 with the GSH/GR system and their saturable kinetic behavior, we generated three mutant enzymes. A significant difference between Prx1 and Prx2/Prx3 is the presence of a C-terminal extension in Prx2 and Prx3 that is absent in Prx1. In modeling studies the C-terminal extension is thought to form an additional α-helix (23Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar).2 Swapping of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of Prx2 to Prx1 (tailed-Prx1) changed the reaction kinetics of Prx1 to more closely resemble those of Prx2. Tailed-Prx1 exhibited substrate saturation typical of Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with similar kinetic constants and catalytic efficiencies to Prx2 (Tables II and III) and similar and high activities with both Trx and GSH thiol reducing systems (Tables II and III, and Fig. 3). Deletion of the 21 C-terminal amino acids of Prx2 (C-truncated Prx2) resulted in an enzyme with non-saturable kinetics and activity restricted to the Trx-reducing system similar to Prx1. Dalziel constants for C-truncated Prx2 were found to be similar to Prx1 (Table I). It has been determined that certain 1-Cys peroxiredoxins use GSH instead of Trx (26Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y.

Because schistosome Prx2 and Prx3 function better with GSH than with Trx, we wanted to determine if these two enzymes functioned more like 1-Cys Prx than 2-Cys Prx. Therefore, we generated a mutant Prx2 by PCR-directed mutagenesis. The substitution of Cys168 with Ser (C168S) yielded a completely inact"

This impairment can be simulated in vitro by chronic culture of 832/13 insulinoma cells with high concentrations of free fatty acids, or by study of lipid-laden islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Here we show that impaired GSIS is not a simple result of saturation of lipid storage pathways, as adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a cytosolically localized variant of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in either cellular model results in dramatic lowering of cellular triglyceride stores but no improvement in GSIS. Instead, the glucose-induced increment in “pyruvate cycling” activity (pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates measured by 13C NMR), previously shown to play an important role in GSIS, is completely ablated in concert with profound suppression of GSIS in lipid-cultured 832/13 cells, whereas glucose oxidation is unaffected. Moreover, GSIS is partially restored in both lipid-cultured 832/13 cells and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats by addition of a membrane permeant ester of a pyruvate cycling intermediate (dimethyl malate). We conclude that chronic exposure of islet β-cells to fatty acids grossly alters a mitochondrial pathway of pyruvate metabolism that is important for normal GSIS.

A major contributing factor to the development of type 2 diabetes is inadequate insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance. A hallmark of this β-cell dysfunction is the impairment and eventual complete loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). 1The abbreviations used are: GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; DMM, dimethyl malate; Glc, glucose, HBSS, HEPES-buffered saline; MCD, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; TG, triglycerides; FFA, free fatty acids; ZDF, Zucker diabetic fatty; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pfu, plaque-forming units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Hyperlipidemia, and the consequent accumulation of triglycerides (TG) and other lipid-derived intermediates in β-cells, is now well recognized as a variable that correlates with development of impaired insulin secretion (1Sako Y.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a biochemical mechanism linking chronic exposure of islet cells to high levels of free fatty acids and impairment of GSIS has not emerged. To gain more insight into this important issue, two independent model systems were exploited. First, we have described recently (10Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) stable subclones of the rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line with robust GSIS, such as cell line 832/13. As shown here, chronic culture of these cells in 1 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1) causes profound impairment of GSIS. Second, islets from ZDF rats are both lipid-laden and poorly glucose-responsive (3Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using these model systems, two hypotheses about the mechanism of lipid-induced impairment of GSIS were tested. The first is that accumulation of lipid-derived metabolites caused by chronic exposure of β-cells to fatty acids plays a direct role in the functional impairment. To test this idea, we have employed a recombinant adenovirus encoding a variant, cytosolically localized form of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (AdCMV-MCDΔ5) (11Mulder H. Lu D. Finley J.T. An J. Cohen J.

Application of this method caused a dramatic lowering of TG levels in both lipid-cultured 832/13 cells and in islets from ZDF rats but failed to improve GSIS. This led us to test a second hypothesis based on our recent discovery of a critical link between pyruvate carboxylase (PC)-mediated pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (“pyruvate cycling”) and GSIS (12Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This link between pyruvate cycling and GSIS was uncovered by NMR-based analysis of [U-13C]glucose metabolism in a set of variously glucose-responsive INS-1-derived cell lines. More precisely, pyruvate cycling refers either to the “pyruvate/malate cycle,” involving PC-catalyzed conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, reduction of oxaloacetate to malate, and decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate via malic enzyme and/or to the “pyruvate/citrate cycle,” wherein the first and last steps are the same as in the pyruvate/malate cycle. Oxaloacetate formed in the PC reaction is converted to citrate, after which malate is regenerated via citrate lyase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (12Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The NMR methods that we employ are not capable of distinguishing between these cycles but do discriminate total cycling activity relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. In the current study, we demonstrate that the profound impairment of GSIS that occurs in response to chronic exposure of 832/13 cells to fatty acids is accompanied by complete ablation of the normal glucose-induced increment in pyruvate cycling, with no change in the rates of glucose oxidation at basal or stimulatory glucose. Furthermore, we demonstrate that addition of a membrane-permeant ester of a pyruvate cycling intermediate, dimethyl malate (DMM), restores a significant portion of GSIS in both fat-cultured 832/13 cells and fat-laden islets from ZDF rats. Thus, our data support a model for lipid-induced impairment of GSIS in which chronic exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids alters a mitochondrial pathway of pyruvate metabolism that is involved in GSIS. Materials were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cell Culture—A clonal β-cell line, 832/13 (10Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B.

Cells were cultured in 6- or 12-well plates at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, and media were changed routinely every 2nd day. For studies of lipid-induced impairment of GSIS, we prepared a 10 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1 molar ratio) stock solution complexed to 10% fat-free bovine serum albumin (8Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Beltrandel Rio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This was added at a final concentration of 1 mm to cells at a state of 30–90% confluency in complete RPMI medium, dependent upon the planned duration of lipid exposure. Cells were then cultured for an additional 2–7 days as indicated in the figure legends or text. Experimental Animals—Lean wild type(+/+) male ZDF rats and obese homozygous (fa/fa) male ZDF rats were bred at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Dallas, TX. 11-Week-old male rats were used for the experiments. Rats were fed with standard chow (Harlan/Teklad 4% 7001; Madison, WI) ad libitum and had free access to water. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) was overexpressed in the cytoplasmic compartment of 832/13 cells and islets by treatment with a recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding human MCD, modified by removal of its N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence and its C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (AdCMV-MCDΔ5 (11Mulder H.

As controls, other groups of cells were treated either with a virus encoding a catalytically inactive form of MCD (AdCMV-MCDmut (11Mulder H. Lu D. Finley J.T. An J. Cohen J. Antinozzi P.A.

A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar)). Adenovirus Transduction of 832/13 Cells—832/13 cells at a confluency of ∼90% were treated with 10 or 20 m.o.i. (multiplicity of infection) of the various recombinant adenoviruses for 2 h. Cells were washed once in RPMI and cultured for an additional 24–72 h. Islet Isolation and Adenovirus Transduction—To overexpress MCD in islets of obese and diabetic rats, pancreases of 11-week-old male ZDF (fa/fa) rats were perfused for 1 h with 1 × 1012 plaque-forming units (pfu) of AdCMV-MCDΔ5, suspended in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 4.5% dextran T70, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5.6 mm glucose, and 5 mm each of sodium pyruvate, sodium glutamate, and sodium fumarate (16Wang M.Y. Koyama K. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were then isolated by the method of Naber et al. (17Naber S.P. McDonald J.M. Jarett L. McDaniel M.L. Ludvigsen C.W. Lacy P.E. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with modifications (8Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Beltrandel Rio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Isolated islets were either used immediately or were cultured for 48 h in RPMI 1640 with 8 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase Activity Assay—MCD activity was determined as the rate of decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA as described previously (18Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In brief, the rate of acetyl-CoA formation was monitored by cleavage of its thioester bond by acetylcarnitine transferase over 5–10 min, a period when the rate of product accumulation was linear. Oil Red O Staining of Lipid Droplets—832/13 cells were cultured with or without 1 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1) for 6 days. Aliquots of cells cultured in the presence of fat were treated with 10 or 20 m.o.i. of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 virus, or were left untreated as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. After viral treatment, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in the presence of fatty acids. Following this period, media were removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Fisher) for 15 min. Glutaraldehyde was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and then treated for 20 min with Oil Red O staining solution. After a wash with PBS, images of stained lipids were obtained using a Nikon phase contrast ELWD 0.3 microscope at high magnification. Triglyceride Content of 832/13 Cells or Islets—832/13 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1) for 6 days, treated with the various recombinant adenoviruses, and harvested 24 h after transduction. Islets from lean or obese ZDF rats were cultured for 48 h prior to harvesting. Measurement of TG content was based on assay of glycerol produced by hydrolysis of neutral lipids in the presence of lipoprotein lipase. Islets or cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and re-centrifuged. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and the lower phase was evaporated under N2. The samples were resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform, and 10 μl was air-dried. The dry pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of Thesit (ICN). A standard curve (1–50 μg) was prepared using triolein diluted in chloroform/methanol 2:1, and 10 μl of sample or standard were assayed in duplicate by adding 200 μl of GPO Trinder Reagent and measurement of absorbance at 540 nm. Insulin Secretion Studies—832/13 cells were grown in the presence or absence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1) for the periods indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBSS) with 114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 25.5 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.2), containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by a 2-h preincubation in the same buffer. Insulin secretion was then measured by static incubation of the cells for 2 h in HBSS containing either 3 or 12 mm glucose. DMM (Aldrich) was added at a final concentration of 10 mm in certain experiments during this second incubation. Insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay using the DPC Coat-A-Count kit (Los Angeles, CA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and expressed as nanograms of insulin per mg of cellular protein. For studies of insulin secretion from ZDF islets, cells were washed with PBS and preincubated in HBSS containing 3 mm glucose for 1 h. Insulin secretion was then measured with the same static incubation protocol as described for 832/13 cells, using two uniformly sized islets/condition in triplicate and exposed to 3 or 16.7 mm glucose. NMR Measurements—832/13 cells were cultured for 3 days in 15-cm Petri dishes in the presence or absence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate (2:1). Cells were washed once with PBS, preincubated in HBSS for 1 h, and then incubated with 3 or 12 mm [U-13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) in HBSS. An incubation time of 4 h was chosen based on previous experiments showing that glutamate became highly enriched in 13C in these cells within this time, and isotopic steady state is reached by ≈3 h (12Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation, the assay buffer was collected for determination of insulin levels, and cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and extracted with 3.5% ice-cold perchloric acid. Extracts from three dishes were pooled and neutralized with KOH in an ice bath. The KClO4 precipitate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted and lyophilized. The sample was then dissolved in 2H2O for mass isotopomer analysis of extracted glutamate by 13C NMR. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz 14T Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer by using a 45° pulse and a 3-s repetition time in a 5-mm tunable broadband probe. The areas of the multiplets arising from 13C to 13C spin-spin coupling in the glutamate C2, C3, and C4 resonances were determined by using the line-fitting routine in the PC-based NMR program, NUTS (Acorn NMR, Fremont, CA). These multiplet areas were used to perform a 13C-isotopomer analysis with the program tcaCALC described previously (19Jeffrey F.M. Storey C.J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E788-E799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The program was applied using the same model parameters as reported recently (12Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to determine a metabolic profile for metabolism of [U-13C6]glucose in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. O2 Consumption and Conversion of Relative Fluxes to Absolute Fluxes—Oxygen consumption was measured at 37 °C using an Oxytherm electrode connected to an Oxygraph Measurement System (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK). 832/13 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate in 6-well plates for 3 days. Tissue culture medium was removed, and cells were washed and preincubated in HBSS containing 3 mm glucose. Two hours later, cells were switched to 2 ml of the same buffer containing either 3 or 12 mm glucose for another hour. Before collecting the cells, the measurement system was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each measurement, cells from three wells were gently scraped free and pooled in a total volume of ∼350 μl, and 250 μl of the cell suspension was immediately added to the oxygen electrode chamber. Oxygen consumption rates were expressed as nanomoles of oxygen/mg of protein/min. 13C NMR isotopomer analysis (19Jeffrey F.M. Storey C.J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E788-E799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Berliner L.J. Robitaille P.-M.L. In Vivo Carbon-13 NMR, Biological Magnetic Resonance. 15.

Physiol. 1990; 259: H987-H995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided a direct measure of the fraction of acetyl-CoA contributed by [U-13C6]glucose (commonly designated as FC3), the fraction of acetyl-CoA contributed by endogenous unlabeled substrates (by difference, FC0 = 1 - FC3), and pyruvate cycling flux relative to total tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Given well established relationships between tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (NADH and FADH2 production) and O2 consumption, these NMR determined parameters were then converted into absolute flux values (22Malloy C.R. Jones J.G. Jeffrey F.M. Jessen M.E. Sherry A.D. Magn. Reson. Mater. Phys. Biol. Med. 1996; 4: 35-46Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, given that complete oxidation of 1 mol of acetyl-CoA consumes 2 mol of molecular oxygen (one cycle turn nets 4 reducing equivalents or 8 electrons), one can derive the proportionality factor (Ri = Qi/Ci) relating O2 consumption (Qi) to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (Ci) for any given substrate. For example, glycolysis yields 2 triose units. Complete oxidation per triose unit produces 4 reducing equivalents in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and 2 additional reducing equivalents, 1 in glycolysis and the other at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase, for a total of 6; hence, Ri = 3 for each triose unit of glucose. The Ri values for other common substrates have been tabulated elsewhere (22Malloy C.R. Jones J.G. Jeffrey F.M. Jessen M.E. Sherry A.D. Magn. Reson. Mater. Phys. Biol. Med. 1996; 4: 35-46Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Total O2 consumption by tissue may be defined as Qt = Q0 + Qglucose, where Q0 refers to O2 consumption from oxidation of endogenous triglycerides or fats and Qglucose to O2 consumption from oxidation of glucose. Similarly, total tricarboxylic acid cycle flux is defined as Ct = C0 + Cglucose, where C0 refers to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux due to oxidation of endogenous substrates and Cglucose to oxidation of glucose. Since the Ri factor for each substrate relates O2 consumption to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, it follows that Qt = C0R0 + CglucoseRglucose. Given that the FCi variables are defined by the fraction any given substrate makes to total acetyl-CoA entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle, FC0 = C0/Ct and FC3 = C3/Ct (where FC0 and FC3 is the fraction of acetyl-CoA derived from fats or glucose, respectively). These relationships can be combined to yield Qt/Ct = FC0R0 + FC3Rglucose. Hence, if O2 consumption (Qt) can be determined as an absolute flux (using an oxygen electrode for instance), and the FCi values measured by 13C NMR and the Ri factor for each substrate are known, then tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (Ct) may be calculated. It should be noted that this equation applies only when anaplerosis can be ignored. However, anaplerosis was also determined as a fraction of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (y), and separate proportionality factors exist for anaplerotic substrates (Ra) (Ra is 0 for carboxylation of exogenous pyruvate and 0.5 for carboxylation of pyruvate derived from glucose) (22Malloy C.R. Jones J.G. Jeffrey F.M. Jessen M.E. Sherry A.D. Magn. Reson. Mater. Phys. Biol. Med. 1996; 4: 35-46Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, after measuring oxygen consumption, the fractional contribution of each substrate to acetyl-CoA and anaplerosis, Ct, is easily determined as shown in Equation 1. Qt/Ct=FC0R0+FC3Rglucose+yRα (Eq. 1) It follows then that absolute glucose oxidation is simply FC3Ct, and endogenous lipid oxidation is FC0Ct. Furthermore, since pyruvate cycling is determined as a fraction of Ct, it too can be expressed as an absolute flux. Let us then consider the example of the control cells incubated with 12 mm glucose. The complete isotopomer analysis of the NMR data indicated that acetyl-CoA was derived from endogenous lipids (FC0 = 0.19) or glucose (FC3 = 0.81) and that anaplerosis was high (y = 0.95, we assume from glucose-derived pyruvate). Oxygen consumption was determined by oxygen electrode to be 12.5 nmol/min/mg protein. One can then estimate the contribution from each term in Equation 1 to O2 consumption as follows: FC0 = 0.19, R0 for lipids is ∼2.8 (based on known R0 for palmitate), hence term 1 = 0.19 × 2.8 = 0.53; FC3 = 0.81, R3 for glucose is 3, hence term 2 = 0.81 × 3 = 2.4; y = 0.95, Ra = 0.5, hence term 3 = 3.2 × 0.5 = 0.48. Thus, the proportionality constant (Qt/Ct) relating total tricarboxylic acid cycle flux to total O2 consumption is 3.4, and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux is 12.5/3.4 = 3.7 nmol of acetyl-CoA/min/mg of protein; endogenous lipid oxidation is 0.19 × 3.7 = 0.70 nmol of acetyl-CoA/min/mg of protein; and glucose oxidation is 0.81 × 3.7 = 3.0 nmol of acetyl-CoA/min/mg of protein. Statistical Methods—Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, assuming unequal variances. MCD Expression Reduces TG Content—Functional impairment of β-cells has been correlated with elevated TG stores in a number of different model systems. However, these studies have not addressed the issue of whether saturation of lipid storage pathways participates directly in loss of GSIS. To address this point, we used a recombinant adenovirus to express a modified form of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (AdCMV-MCDΔ5) in 832/13 cells. MCDΔ5 is preferentially localized to the cytosol and completely blocks the glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA levels (11Mulder H. Lu D. Finley J.T. An J. Cohen J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6479-6484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 832/13 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate for 6 days and then treated with one of the following viruses: AdCMV-MCDΔ5, a control virus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene AdCMV-βGAL (15Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), or a control virus containing a catalytically inactive form of MCD, AdCMV-MCDmut (11Mulder H. Lu D. Finley J.T. An J. Cohen J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6479-6484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and cultured for an additional 24 h in the presence of lipids. Another group of 832/13 cells was simply cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mm oleate/palmitate for the total experimental period of 7 days, with no addition of viruses. Cells treated with AdCMV-MCDΔ5 had ∼5 times more MCD enzymatic activity than either control group (1.5 ± 0.2 versus 0.3 ± 0.1 μmol/min/mg protein, respectively). Treatment of lipid-cultured 832/13 cells with AdCMV-MCDΔ5 caused a dramatic decrease in Oil Red O staining of stored lipids (Fig. 1) and also lowered TG content to levels indistinguishable from those in cells cultured in the absence of exogenous fatty acids (from 332 ± 31 to 118 ± 15 ng/mg protein; Fig. 2). MCD Overexpression Fails to Reverse Lipid-induced Impairment of GSIS in 832/13 Cells or Islets from ZDF Rats—We next investigated the effect of these maneuvers on GSIS (Fig. 3). A culture of 832/13 cells in 1 mm oleate/palmitate for 7 days resulted in clear impairment of insulin secretion during stimulation with 12 mm glucose. When normalized to basal secretion at 3 mm glucose, GSIS fell from 10.6 ± 2.5-, 9.4 ± 2.3-, and 9.6 ± 1.7-fold in cells cultured in normal medium containing 11 mm glucose (without supplemental fatty acids) to 2.3 ± 0.4-, 2.4 ± 0.4-, and 2.7 ± 0.6-fold in cells cultured in 1 mm oleate/palmitate for 7 days, in the AdCMV-βGAL, AdCMV-MCDΔ5, and AdCMV-MCDmut-treated groups, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, normalization of cellular TG levels by overexpression of MCDΔ5 did not prevent the lipid-induced impairment in GSIS. Consistent with our previous work, overexpression of MCDΔ5 did not affect GSIS in cells cultured in the absence of fat (11Mulder H. Lu D. Finley J.T. An J. Cohen J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We also performed experiments in which the three adenoviruses were delivered after 4 days of culture in fatty acids, followed by 3 more days of culture in the presence of the exogenous lipids and assay of GSIS at day 7 of culture. In this experimental design, AdCMV-MCDΔ5 treatment prevented the rise in TG content but again did not prevent the fat-induced impairment in GSIS (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that factors other than TG overstorage are involved in the lipid-induced impairment of GSIS in 832/13 cells. One potential criticism of the studies just summarized is that chronic culture of an insulinoma cell line in elevated fatty acids may not be fully reflective of β-cell deterioration that occurs in vivo in animals or humans with type 2 diabetes and chronic hyperlipidemia. To investigate this further, we delivered the AdCMV-MCDΔ5 virus to lipid-laden islets from obese ZDF (fa/fa) rats by pancreas perfusion (16Wang M.Y. Koyama K. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H.

ClC-3 was packed in SLMV along with the AP-3-targeted synaptic vesicle protein ZnT3. Co-segregation of ClC-3 and ZnT3 to common intracellular compartments was functionally significant as revealed by increased vesicular zinc transport with increased ClC3 expression.

Our work has identified a synaptic vesicle protein in which trafficking to synaptic vesicles is regulated by AP-3. In addition, our findings indicate that ClC-3 and ZnT3 reside in a common vesicle population where they functionally interact to determine vesicle luminal composition. IntroductionSynaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters and neuromodulators by virtue of specific membrane transporters and channels that pump ions and small molecule mediators into these vesicles (1Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Bellocchio E.E. Edwards R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Adaptor-dependent biogenesis and sorting mechanisms are critical to deliver these and other synaptic membrane proteins into these secretory vesicles (2Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev.

The adaptor complex AP-3 is involved in the biogenesis of lysosomes, lysosome-related organelles and synaptic vesicles (10Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S.

AP-3-deficient mouse models mocha and mocha2J develop a complex neurological phenotype that at the cellular level is characterized by the lack of intravesicular synaptic vesicle ionic zinc (7Kantheti P.

Vesicles are devoid of zinc because the synaptic vesicle-specific zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) does not reach a specialized population of synaptic vesicles (7Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A.

The defective sorting of ZnT3 to mocha synaptic vesicles most probably occurs because ZnT3 possesses cytosolic determinants robustly recognized by the adaptor complex AP-3 (9Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).So far, ZnT3 is the only known synaptic vesicle protein in which targeting to these vesicles is defective in the absence of functional AP-3 (7Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

Genome. 2003; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the pleiotropic neurological defects observed in mocha alleles are not fully recapitulated by a ZnT3-null mutant mouse (12Cole T.B. Robbins C.A. Wenzel H.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Epilepsy Res. 2000; 39: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This suggests that AP-3 could regulate the targeting of as-yet-unidentified proteins to synaptic vesicles that determine their luminal composition.To address this question, we performed a search for synaptic vesicle membrane proteins endowed with transport or channel activity in which targeting to synaptic vesicles was impaired in the context of an AP-3 deficiency (mocha). We found that the sorting of a synaptic vesicle channel, ClC-3, was defective in the absence of functional AP-3. ClC-3 is an anion/chloridepermeant channel that provides an anionic shunt for the establishment of a proton gradient generated by the vacuolar ATPase (14Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Perturbation of chloride membrane permeability impairs the acidification of synaptic vesicles and affects the luminal accumulation of neurotransmitters (17Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Biochemical and morphological analyses in wild-type and mocha brain revealed that ClC-3 content in synaptic vesicles was reduced by the presence of the mocha allele. These defects were not restricted to neuronal cells or synaptic vesicles because fibroblasts lacking the adaptor complex accumulated ClC-3 in distinct subcellular compartments. In PC-12 cells, ClC-3 was present in transferrin receptor-positive endosomes, where it was targeted to synaptic vesicles, also known as synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMV), by a brefeldin A-sensitive mechanism. ClC-3 and ZnT3 co-segregated to a common SLMV population. The co-existence of ClC-3 and ZnT3 on the same vesicles was functionally tested in zinc transport assays, which revealed that vesicular zinc content was under control of the vesicular ClC-3 levels. Our work has identified a new synaptic vesicle protein whose trafficking to synaptic vesicles is regulated by AP-3. These results indicate that the functional interplay of chloride and zinc-permeant membrane proteins trafficked by AP-3 determine the intravesicular milieu.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—PC-12 KB cells were maintained as described previously (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Immortalized mocha fibroblasts transduced with an empty retrovirus or a retrovirus carrying the AP-3 delta subunit were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) (4.5 g/l glucose), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro), and hygromicin (200 μg/ml). Transfections were performed with Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer protocols. Permanently transfected cells were selected in 0.8 mg/ml G418 and maintained in 0.25 mg/ml G418. Expression was induced by 6 mm sodium butyrate for 12–24 h, as described previously (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Plasmids—Antibodies used in this study were: anti-synaptophysin (SY38; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), SV2 (10H4; a gift of Dr R. Kelly, University of California, San Francisco); antibodies against VAMP II (69.1), anti-116-kDa subunit of the vacuolar ATPase, obtained from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany); anti-transferrin receptor (H68.4; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA); anti-FLAG epitope (generous gift from Dr. A. H. Kowalczyk, Emory University, Atlanta, GA); anti-HA (12CA5; a gift from Dr. Y. Altschuler, Hebrew University, Jerusalem); and anti LAMP I and AP-3 delta subunits (from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa). Affinity purified antibodies directed against the chloride channel 3 were a gift from Dr. D. J. Nelson (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) (19Huang P. Liu J. Di A. Robinson N.C. Musch M.W. Kaetzel M.A. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20093-20100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins encompassing ZnT3 residues 1–78 as well as HA- and GFP-tagged ZnT3 cDNAs have been described previously (9Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 13-GFP was a gift from Dr. R. Scheller (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Flag-tagged ClC-3 short and long isoforms as well as a GFP-tagged form of the short isoform of ClC-3 were gifts from Dr. S. Weinman (University of Texas, Galveston, TX).Immunolocalizations—Cells were washed in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+. After washing, cells were fixed for 20 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (20Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Wei M.L. Bonzelius F. Scully R.M. Kelly R.B. Herman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Either two wild-type or mocha mouse brains (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were simultaneously fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde, sliced coronally, and embedded in paraffin. To assure identical processing, slices containing wild-type and mocha brain hippocampi were included in the same block and sectioned together (8 μm). AP-3 δ, ZnT3, VAMP II, and ClC-3 antigen retrieval was by microwave treatment in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6, for 10 min. All stainings were performed in duplicate in at least two independent experiments. Primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 4 °C and immunocomplexes detected by species-specific VEC-TASTAIN avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) according to manufacturer instructions.Confocal Microscopy/Two-photon Microscopy—To image zinc-containing compartments, cells were loaded with 25 μm ZnSO4 in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C. Free zinc was washed at 4 °C and cells were loaded with 25 μm Zinquin in 10 mm glucose Dulbecco's PBS for 30 min at 37 °C (22Zalewski P.D. Millard S.H. Forbes I.J. Kapaniris O. Slavotinek A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Excess dye was extensively washed at 4 °C, and cells were kept at 4 °C until processed. GFP-PC-12 cells were imaged at 37 °C on MatTek dishes warmed with a Bioptechs objective heating system. A single image was taken before the addition of the drug. Time series were taken from each dish with 201.6-s intervals between images. Specimens were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 m microscope coupled to a HeNe1, argon ion and a coherent Verdi-pumped titanium: sapphire laser. Zinquin was excited with the Ti:sapphire laser tuned at 750 nm. Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 sp1 software. Emission filters used for acquisition from live imaging experiments were LP505 and BP465 IR. The emission filters used for immunofluorescence were LP505 and BP 500–550 IR. All images were viewed and acquired using a Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective.Morphometric analysis was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). Areas were scored in individual 1-μm confocal optical slices that cross-sectioned the cell nucleus. Identical color thresholds were set for all images, and region measurements were performed after automatic software-driven selection of regions around objects.Cell Fractionation—PC-12 cells or fibroblasts were homogenized in intracellular buffer (38 mm potassium aspartate, 38 mm potassium glutamate, 38 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 5 mm sodium carbonate, 2.5 mm magnesium sulfate, and 2 mm EGTA) using a cell cracker with a 12-μm clearance according to Clift-O'Grady et al. (24Clift-O'Grady L. Desnos C. Lichtenstein Y. Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. Methods. 1998; 16: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The homogenate was sedimented for 5 min at 1000 × g to obtain an S1 supernatant. Fibroblast S1 supernatants were sedimented in 10–45% velocity sucrose gradients at 116,000 × g for 1 h using a Beckman SW55 rotor (25Lichtenstein Y. Desnos C. Faundez V. Kelly R.B. Clift-O'Grady L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PC-12 S1 fractions were sedimented at 27,000 × g for 35 min to generate S2 supernatants. S2 fractions were spun either at 210,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TLA120.2 rotor (P3) or through glycerol velocity gradients (5–25%) prepared in intracellular buffer at 218,000 × g for 75 min in a SW55 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The synaptic vesicle peak was determined by immunoblot. All procedures were performed at 4 °C in the presence of the antiprotease mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).Frozen brains from mocha AP-3 deficient (gr/gr, mh/mh); and wild-type (gr/gr) mice were a generous gift of Dr. M. Burmeister (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Brains were pulverized to a fine powder using porcelain mortars under a continuous supply of liquid nitrogen. Extracts were thawed at 4 °C in 5 volumes of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm MgCl2) plus Complete antiprotease mixture (26van de Goor J. Ramaswami M. Kelly R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5739-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Homogenates were sedimented at 1000 × g for 10 min to generate S1 supernatants. S1 were further fractionated at 27,000 × g for 45 min to obtain high speed supernatants, which were resolved in glycerol velocity gradients as described above.Gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblot and immunoreactivity was revealed by ECL. The synaptic vesicle peak was defined as fractions 7–12 except for ClC-3 blots, in which we integrated the immunoreactivity signal only in fractions 8–12 to exclude fraction 7, which overlapped with the larger membranes seen in mocha (fractions 2–7). Immunoreactive bands were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. J.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2591-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Immunomagnetic Isolations—PC-12 SLMV isolated by glycerol velocity gradient (fractions 7–12) were used in the assays. All the reactions and washes were done at 4 °C in the presence of Complete anti-protease mixture. SV used as input pool were processed in identical conditions as the vesicles bound to beads except that beads and BSA were omitted. Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were preincubated with antibodies either against LAMP, HA epitope, or VAMPII. All incubations and washes were done in PBS-BSA 5%. Vesicle binding to beads was performed for 3 h at 4 °C. Incubations were terminated by washing the beads four times for 10 min each. Unbound membranes were diluted in 1 volume of PBS to dilute BSA and sedimented at 200,000 × g for 1 h in a tabletop Beckman TLA ultracentrifuge. Complexes and unbound membrane pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. Immune complexes were detected by ECL.Transferrin Internalization Assays—Transferrin internalization assays were performed with Alexa 568-conjugated human transferrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. J.

In brief, PC-12 cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed at 4 °C, and transferrin (50 μg/ml) binding to the cell surface was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 2 h. Unbound ligand was washed away at 4 °C, and internalization was resumed at 37 °C. Assays were stopped in ice-cold PBS followed by paraformaldehyde fixation on ice.Flow Cytometry—PC-12 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of ZnSO4 and/or Zinquin as described above. Cells were extensively washed at 4 °C, and Zinquin and GFP fluorescence were determined in a MoFlo high performance cell sorter from DakoCytomation (Fort Collins, CO). The laser used for the forward and side scatter was a Coherent I-305, 488-nm argon laser. Zinquin was excited with a Coherent I-90 krypton laser set to 305 nm. The filters used were a long-pass filter at 440 nm and a 450/65 in front of the photo multiplier tube. Data analysis was performed using FloJo version 4.3.2. To depict the data in a normalized fashion, we used percentage of maximum, defined as the number of cells in each bin (256) divided by the number of cells in the bin that contained the largest number of cells.Other Procedures—Protein assays were performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad) using BSA as standard. All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed t test.RESULTSClC-3 Targeting to Brain Small Vesicles Is Selectively Modified in AP-3 Deficiencies—It is presently unknown whether other membrane proteins present in synaptic vesicles, in addition to ZnT3 (7Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M.

Genome. 2003; 14: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), might be targeted to this organelle by an AP-3-dependent mechanism. To address this question, we analyzed whether a series of known synaptic vesicle proteins were properly targeted to synaptic vesicles of AP-3 deficient neurons (Fig. 1). High-speed supernatants (S2) from wild-type and AP-3-deficient brain homogenates were fractionated in glycerol velocity gradients. This procedure discriminates particles by size, resolving large membranes from those that are the size of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles peak in the middle of the gradient in fractions 7–9 (28Desnos C. Clift-O'Grady L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Clift-O'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Schmidt A. Hannah M.J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, their synaptic vesicle nature has been established by the redistribution of synaptic vesicle markers to larger membrane fractions in Drosophila melanogaster shibire mutants at restrictive temperature (26van de Goor J. Ramaswami M. Kelly R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5739-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).We used ZnT3 as a bona fide AP-3-interacting membrane protein in which synaptic vesicle content is AP-3-dependent. ZnT3-containing synaptic vesicles peaked at fractions 7–9 (Fig. 1, A and E), comigrating with the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin and VAMP II (Fig. 1B). As described previously, ZnT3 content was reduced to 20% of control values, in both synaptic vesicles and in the P1 and P2 pellets from mocha brain (Fig. 1I) (9Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, synaptophysin and VAMP II levels remained constant in mocha brain membranes and synaptic vesicles (Fig. 1, B and H). In contrast, the velocity sedimentation of membranes containing the synaptic vesicle chloride channel 3 (ClC-3) was affected by AP-3 deficiency (Fig. 1, C, F, and H). Rather than a generalized reduction of ClC-3, as seen with ZnT3, we observed that in the mocha background the majority of ClC-3 was redistributed from the synaptic vesicle peak to a region of the gradient containing larger membranes (fractions 2–7, compare plots in E and F). ClC-3 distribution in P1 and P2 pellet was not affected by the mocha allele (Fig. 1I), showing that the changes in ClC-3 distribution in AP-3-deficient brain were restricted to a limited set of small vesicles. To assess the ClC-3 content in the synaptic vesicle-containing fractions, we integrated the immunoreactivity signal in fractions 8–12 to exclude fraction 7, which overlapped with the larger membranes seen in mocha (fractions 2–7). Thus, we estimated that in mocha brain, the ClC-3 content in vesicles the size of synaptic vesicles was reduced by at least half (55.4 ± 10%, n = 3) (Fig. 1H). P1, P2, and synaptic vesicle levels of SV2 (p > 0.08), and the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, p > 0.5) were not significantly different between wild-type and mocha brain membranes (Fig. 1H), indicating that the effects of the mocha allele upon ClC-3 and ZnT3 were selective.ClC-3 is targeted to synaptic vesicles in brain (17Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), yet it is present in late endosome-lysosome compartments in non-neuronal cells (31Li X. Wang T. Zhao Z. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1483-C1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To explore whether synaptic vesicle-positive fractions cosedimented with membranes containing lysosomal antigens on glycerol gradients, we tested for the presence of the AP-3-sorted lysosomal protein LAMPI on them. LAMPI was detected in fractions 7–9 comigrating with the synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, VAMP II, and ZnT3 (Fig. 1, compare D with A–C and open circles in G with E and F). In the absence of AP-3, LAMPI immunoreactivity along the glycerol gradient was generally reduced (Fig. 1D), whereas its content in P2 membranes was increased (Fig. 1I). Nonetheless, like ClC-3, the remaining LAMPI present in these gradients appeared in faster sedimenting membranes in the absence of AP-3 (fractions 2–7), whereas the LAMPI content in fractions 8–12 was reduced to 42.9 ± 10.4 (Fig. 1H, n = 2). These results suggest that at least part of the ClC-3 protein present in brain is bound to late endosome/lysosomes in vesicles that possess physical properties identical to those of synaptic vesicles.In summary, these results indicate that AP-3 deficiency selectively affects the targeting of ClC-3 and LAMPI to a vesicle population with physical properties similar to those of synaptic vesicles. Moreover, they suggest that ClC-3 targeting to synaptic vesicles may be impaired in mocha nerve terminals.ClC-3 Content Decreases in Nerve Terminals from AP-3-deficient Brain—We analyzed the distribution of ClC-3 in hippocampal mossy fiber synaptic terminals from wild-type and mocha brain sections to define whether the ClC-3 targeting defects observed in mocha small membranes reflected alterations in targeting to synaptic vesicles. We focused in mossy fiber nerve terminals because they can be easily identified at the light microscopic level (32Lim C. Blume H.W. Madsen J.R. Saper C.B. J. Comp.

In addition, ZnT3 and ClC-3 transcript levels are high in the hippocampus (17Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bosl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R.

Two hallmarks of the mocha phenotype were readily identified in stained hippocampal brain sections. First, AP-3 immunoreactivity was reduced in the mocha allele in relation to wild type in both cell bodies and mossy fibers of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, mossy fiber ZnT3 content was dramatically decreased in AP-3 deficiency (Fig. 2, C and D). In sections stained in parallel, we obser"

The mutation of the nearby residue, threonine 288, to nonphosphorylatable alanine has also been shown to reduce the ubiquitination of cyclin D1, suggesting that phosphorylation at threonine 288 may also lead to degradation of cyclin D1. We now demonstrate that the G0/G1-active arginine-directed protein kinase Mirk/dyrk1B binds to cyclin D1 and phosphorylates cyclin D1 at threonine 288 in vivo and that the cyclin D1-T288A construct is more stable than wild-type cyclin D1. Transient overexpression of Mirk in nontransformed Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells blocked cells in G0/G1. Depletion of endogenous Mirk by RNA interference increased cyclin D1 protein levels but not mRNA levels, indicating that Mirk destabilizes cyclin D1 protein. Destabilization was confirmed by induction of a stable Mirk transfectant of Mv1Lu cells, which blocked cell migration (Zou, Y., Lim, S., Lee, K., Deng, X., and Friedman, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49573-49581), and caused a decrease in the half-life of endogenous cyclin D1, concomitant with an increase in Mirk expression. In vitro cyclin D1 was phosphorylated in an additive fashion by Mirk and GSK3β. Mirk-phosphorylated cyclin D1 mutated at the GSK3β phosphorylation site and was capable of phosphorylating cyclin D1 in the presence of the GSK3β inhibitor LiCl. Mirk may function together with GSK3β to assist cell arrest in G0/G1 by destabilizing cyclin D1.

Cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. The D-type cyclins, D1, D2, and D3, increase in nuclear abundance in G1 in response to mitogens, facilitate the import of CDK4 into the nucleus (1Diehl J. Sherr C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7362-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and assemble combinatorially with CDK4 or CDK6 into complexes that phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein, releasing factors needed for the progression into S phase. Cyclin D1 is translocated into the cytoplasm during S phase where it is destroyed by the proteasome following phosphorylation at threonine 286 by GSK3β (2Diehl J. Zindy F. Sherr C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Diehl J. Cheng M. Roussel M. Sherr C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Mutant cyclin D1-T286A, which cannot be phosphorylated by GSK3β, is stabilized in the nucleus and is capable of transforming murine fibroblasts, whereas overexpression of wild-type cyclin D1 cannot act alone to transform such cells (4Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A cyclin D1 isoform derived by alternative splicing was shown to lack threonine 286, enabling this cyclin D1 isoform to remain nuclear throughout the cell cycle, remain highly expressed, and function to facilitate transformation of NIH3T3 cells (5Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). This cyclin D1 splice variant was also found in tumor-derived cells and primary human esophageal tumors (5Lu F. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7056-7061PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurs in several cancers including breast, pancreatic, and esophageal (6Diehl J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting that either increased transcription, transcription of stable splice variants, or dysregulation of cyclin D1 turnover may frequently occur in cancer.In this study, we have studied the interaction of the ubiquitously expressed protein kinase Mirk/dyrk1B with cyclin D1. Mirk/dyrk1B is an arginine-directed serine/threonine kinase (7Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), which functions as a transcriptional co-activator and is activated through the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MKK3 (8Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that Mirk stabilizes the CDK inhibitor p27kip1 in the G0 phase of the cell cycle in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whereas depletion of Mirk by RNA interference increases cell cycling as measured by increased PCNA expression (9Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mirk expression is decreased by mitogen activation of the MEK-ERK pathway during G1 (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), restricting Mirk function primarily to G0 and early G1.We now confirm that transient overexpression of Mirk in nontrans-formed Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells increases the length of G0/G1 by FACS analysis and that Mirk targets the G1 cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1, to maintain cells in growth arrest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the N terminus of Mirk were raised as described previously (7Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to cyclin D1 and GSK3β were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody to GSK3β phosphorylated at serine 9 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Recombinant purified N-terminal histidine-tagged GSK3β was from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane Immobolin-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen. All of the radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. All of the other reagents were from Sigma.Plasmid Construction—The murine pFLEX-cyclin D1 construct and FLAG-tagged cyclin D1-T286A derivative were the kind gifts of Drs. Martine Roussel and Charles Sherr, and the wild-type GSK3β construct was the kind gift of Dr. Alan Diehl. Plasmids pcDNA3.1 (Mirk) and pcDNA3.1 (kinase-inactive YF Mirk) had been generated previously (7Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type cyclin D1 was subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) to make GST-tagged mutants by site-directed mutagenesis by the GeneEditor system (Promega). Constructs were subcloned into pCMV-tag2B to generate FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 constructs. All of the mutant cyclin D1 constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutated sequence.Cell Culture—Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, modified, and supplemented as described previously (11Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). The Mirk-inducible Mv1Lu C9 subline was isolated by stably transfecting cells with a pCMVLac1-repressor construct, selecting the hygromycin-resistant clone, and then stably transfecting Mirk in a pOPRSV1/MCS vector using G418 (LacSwitch II System, Stratagene) (12Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending upon the experiment, 10-50 μg of cell lysates were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST plus 4% bovine serum albumin, and proteins were detected subsequently by enhanced chemiluminescence. All of the Mirk blots used affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to the Mirk-unique C terminus.Transient Transfections—Mv1Lu cells were transfected transiently by adding a complex of PLUS reagent (3 μl/μg DNA) and LipofectAMINE (2-4 μl/μg DNA) in serum-free media for 3 h and then allowing the expression in growth medium for 24-36 h, or they were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (3 μl/μg DNA) in serum-containing medium for 24-36 h as noted. The amount of total DNA used was kept constant by the addition of empty vector DNA.Co-immunoprecipitation of Mirk and Cyclin D1—Mirk and cyclin D1 expression plasmids were co-transfected into MV1Lu cells and allowed to express for 48 h. After lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors, cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated by adding antibodies to the FLAG epitope followed by rocking overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein G-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) then was added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads in each tube were washed three times followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.Co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3β and Cyclin D1—Endogenous GSK3β and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated following lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors by adding antibody to GSK3β (2 μg to 1 mg of total lysate) followed by rocking overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A-agarose conjugates then were added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads in each tube were washed three times followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The second immunoprecipitation of GSK3β-associated cyclin D1 was performed by diluting the immunoprecipitates (in SDS sample buffer without dye) from 50 μl to 1 ml by adding 2% bovine serum albumin. The diluted sample was then incubated with anti-cyclin D1-conjugated protein G-agarose. The agarose beads were washed three times followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This method was adapted from Borja, et al. (13Borja P.F. d. Collins N.K. Du P. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Mudryj M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5737-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).In Vitro Kinase Reactions—GST-Mirk or its kinase-inactive YF mutant form was incubated together with GST-cyclin D1 as noted in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with protease and phosphatase inhibitors containing 10 μm cold ATP plus 2.5 μCi of [32P]ATP) for 10 min at 30 °C. In some experiments as noted, 40 mm LiCl was added to the reaction mixture to inhibit GSK3β. Reaction mixtures then were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Peptide Mapping—The cyclin D1 mutants were subcloned into pGEX-6P1 to take advantage of the cold cleavage conditions using the PreScission enzyme (Amersham Biosciences). Following an in vitro kinase reaction, the phosphorylated cyclin D1 band was cut from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel slice was washed five times with water for 20 min each and then soaked in a solution of urea/water/acetic acid (1 g/1 ml/1 ml) for 20 min and then in this solution containing 0.015 mN-chlorosuccinimide for 1 h. After washing with water, the slice was loaded onto a precast 10-20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and then subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography. V8 protease mapping was performed exactly as detailed previously (14Lee H. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8181-8187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RNA Interference (RNAi)—The RNAi to Mirk (si1) was synthesized and used as described previously (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Positively transfected cells were sorted by co-transfected GFP using a BD FACSVantage SE cell sorter.Band Density in Autoradiograms and Western Blots—Band density was measured using a Lacie Silverscanner and Silverscanner III software and analyzed using the IP LabGel program.Metabolic Labeling—Mv1Lu cells were incubated for 5 h in serum-free low phosphate medium (9:1 ratio phosphate-free medium/normal medium) with 150 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/2 ml of medium.Northern Analysis—3.5 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and cross-linked by baking. The membranes were hybridized to a cDNA probe containing the cyclin D1 coding sequence in pCMV5,which had been labeled with 32P by random priming. The blot was hybridized overnight at 68 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed at room temperature twice for 15 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then washed for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and autoradiographed.RESULTSCyclin D1 Turnover Enhanced by the G0/G1Kinase Mirk—Mv1Lu cells were chosen to study the interaction between Mirk and cyclin D1, because Mv1Lu cells are nontransformed epithelial cells that exhibit some normal cell cycle regulation. Mv1Lu cells growth arrest in G0/G1 in response to transforming growth factor-β1 or to culture in serum-free conditions, whereas treatment with a cellular mitogen releases this arrest (15Tsubari M. Taipale J. Tiihonen E. Keski-Oja J. Laiho M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we recently have made a stable Mirk-inducible subline from Mv1Lu cells and have shown that the induction of Mirk inhibited the migration of these cells in wounding experiments and inhibited their invasion through polycarbonate Transwell filters (12Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we know that Mirk exhibits biological activity in these epithelial cells. We transiently transfected Mirk into subconfluent Mv1Lu cells, allowed the expression of Mirk for 24 h in serum-free medium, and arrested cells in G0 by continued culture in serum-free medium for an additional 48 h. In both Mirk-transfected cultures and vector control transfectants, 78-79% of cells were in G0/G1 phase (Fig. 1A). An examination of cultures by fluorescence microscopy for co-transfected enhanced GFP showed that ∼60-70% of cells were transfected. The rate of entry into S phase was determined by examining cultures by flow cytometry 7 and 12 h after the culture medium was changed to serum-containing growth medium. Both Mirk transfectants and control transfectants remained in G1 at 7 h after release (data not shown). However, 66% of vector control transfectants entered S phase 12 h after the addition of serum, whereas only half of that many, 33% of Mirk transfectants, entered the S phase at this time (Fig. 1A). Thus, transient overexpression of Mirk in epithelial cells blocked cells in G0/G1. In earlier studies, we had made a stable Mirk-inducible subline from nontransformed Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells (12Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The induction of Mirk caused a 30-40% inhibition of Mv1Lu cell entry into S phase as measured by decreased uptake of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 1B), confirming the results of our transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1A). Complete cessation of growth did not occur in the presence of serum mitogens, but increased levels of Mirk inhibited cell cycling.Transient overexpression of Mirk in Mv1Lu cells decreased cyclin D1 protein levels as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the induction of Mirk protein in the stable Mirk-inducible Mv1Lu subline C9 decreased cyclin D1 levels by half, whereas treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG115 blocked the Mirk-induced reduction in cyclin D1 abundance (Fig. 2B). Translation arrest experiments with cycloheximide confirmed that the induction of Mirk decreased the half-life of cyclin D1 from ∼40 to 20 min in Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells cultured in serum-free conditions (Fig. 2, C and D). The faster migrating cyclin D1 form (Fig. 2C, long arrow) is lost rapidly upon Mirk induction. Thus, Mirk enhanced the normal proteasomal turnover of cyclin D1 in Mv1Lu cells. Mirk is a kinase most active in G0/G1 in NIH3T3 cells when it is predominately localized in the nucleus (9Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The major kinase that controls cyclin D1 levels in mammalian cells is GSK3β (2Diehl J. Zindy F. Sherr C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 3Diehl J. Cheng M. Roussel M. Sherr C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar), which is localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region during G1 in NIH3T3 cells and enters the nucleus during S phase. Possibly, Mirk maintains cells in G0 by limiting the abundance of nuclear cyclin D1 in G0 or, alternatively, functions in G1 to enhance the later occurring phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by GSK3β.Fig. 2Increased Mirk expression inhibits Mv1Lu lung epithelial cell growth by decreasing the half-life of cyclin D1.A, Mv1Lu cells were transfected transiently with a Mirk expression plasmid, a vector-only plasmid, or left untreated (control), and the amount of Mirk, cyclin D1, and tubulin was determined by Western blotting (WB) at 0-16 h post-transfection. B, the stable Mirk-inducible Mv1Lu subline C9 was treated with 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h to induce Mirk or left untreated. The cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG115 as indicated for 15 min before cell lysis and examination for Mirk, cyclin D1, and actin levels by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The abundance of Mirk and cyclin D1, each normalized to the abundance of actin, is listed below the appropriate lanes. C, the stable Mirk-inducible Mv1Lu subline C9 was treated with 200 μm IPTG for 16 h to induce Mirk or left untreated. Cycloheximide (CH) was added at 40 μg/ml in serum-free medium to arrest translation, and the levels of Mirk and cyclin D1 were determined at the times indicated by Western blotting. D, the data from panel C and the data from two additional experiments were averaged and plotted. CT, control-untreated cells. Mean values are shown. The mean ± S.E. of repeat measurements was 6% (not shown). Data were subjected to exponential curve fitting, and the y intercepts and r2 values were calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mirk Binds to Cyclin D1—We further explored the interaction between Mirk and cyclin D1 by determining whether they interact in vivo. Nontransformed Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were co-transfected for 24 h with Mirk, FLAG-cyclin D1, or an equal amount of vector control DNA, cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium, and then immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to a unique sequence at the N terminus of Mirk (Fig. 3A), affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk (Fig. 3B), or antibody to the FLAG epitope on the cyclin D1 expression plasmid. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the abundance of Mirk and of FLAG-cyclin D were determined by Western blotting using the C-terminal directed antibody for Mirk and antibody to the FLAG epitope for cyclin D1. Five percent of the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting (Input panel in A). Antibody directed to the N terminus of Mirk was able to co-immunoprecipitate cyclin D1 with Mirk (Fig. 3A), whereas antibody directed to the C terminus of Mirk could only immunoprecipitate Mirk and not cyclin D1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Mirk interacts with cyclin D1 through Mirk-unique C terminus. Antibody to the FLAG epitope could also co-immunoprecipitate cyclin D1 and Mirk (Fig. 3B, last lane). Thus, Mirk and cyclin D1 interact in vivo within Mv1Lu cells as shown by their co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed either to Mirk or to cyclin D1.Fig. 3Co-immunoprecipitation of Mirk and cyclin D1. Nontransformed Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were co-transfected for 24 h with Mirk, FLAG-cyclin D1, or an equal amount of vector control DNA and then cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer. Cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody to the FLAG epitope (panels A and B), affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to a unique sequence at the N terminus of Mirk (panel A), or affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk (panel B). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the abundance of Mirk was determined by Western blotting (WB) using affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk or antibody to the FLAG epitope to detect cyclin D1. Five percent of the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as above (Input panel in A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depletion of Mirk by RNAi in Postmitotic C2C12 Myoblasts Increases Cyclin D1 Abundance—We wished to determine the effect of depleting endogenous Mirk on cyclin D1 stability. However, RNA interference experiments could not be performed reliably in Mv1Lu cells because Mirk had not been sequenced in the mink cell. We chose murine C2C12 myoblasts because Mirk mediates their differentiation into postmitotic fused myotubes when cells are placed into differentiation medium (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of Mirk and cyclin D1 during the initial hours of differentiation was determined first. Mirk is expressed at very low levels in proliferating myoblasts but is rapidly induced at least 10-fold when primary-cultured muscle satellite cells or myoblast cell lines are placed in differentiation medium (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The induction of Mirk in C2C12 myoblasts was accompanied by a sharp decrease in cyclin D1 levels detected within 6 h (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Increased Mirk expression in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts is associated with reduced cyclin D1 levels, whereas depletion of Mirk by RNA interference increases cyclin D1 protein levels and decreases phosphorylation of cyclin D1.A, C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum overnight and then switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1-6 h to begin differentiation to postmitotic myo-tubes. Cell lysates were examined by Western blotting (WB) for Mirk, cyclin D1, GSK3β, and phosphorylated GSK3β. B, RNAi to Mirk increases cyclin D1 abundance by a posttranscriptional mechanism. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for Mirk RNAi and enhanced GFP, or vector DNA and enhanced GFP selected by cell sorting for enhanced GFP were placed in growth medium for 1 day and then switched to differentiation medium for 2 days. Vc, vector. Left panel, cell lysates were examined by Northern blotting for cyclin D1. 28 and 18 S rRNA staining by ethidium bromide is shown. The ratio of the abundance of cyclin D mRNA to the abundance of the 28 S rRNA is given below the appropriate lanes. Right panel, cell lysates were examined by Western blotting for Mirk and cyclin D1. The abundance of a cross-reactive protein was similar in both lanes and served as an internal control (not shown). The ratio of Mirk protein and cyclin D1 protein in control and Mirk-directed RNAi-treated cultures is given to the right of the appropriate lanes. C, C2C12 cells were transfected for 24 h with either pSilencer plasmid encoding si1 to Mirk or control sequences and then switched to differentiation medium for 5 h containing [32P]orthophosphate before cell lysis.

Chu C. Kohtz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although no cyclin D1 could be detected in the nuclei of fused myotubes or single myoblasts maintained in mitogen-free differentiation medium, the induction of the mutant form of cyclin D1-T286A, which is resistant to GSK3β phosphorylation, led to the accumulation of cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes within the nucleus (17Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the decline in cyclin D1 levels during myogenesis is caused by phosphorylation by GSK3β and transport to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. We questioned whether Mirk played any role in the modulation of cyclin D1 levels in differentiating myoblasts. During the initial 6 h in differentiation medium, there was no change in the total amount of GSK3β (Fig. 4A) but there was a small increase in the fraction of GSK3β, which was phosphorylated at serine 9, a residue phosphorylated when GSK3β is inactivated by Akt (18Cross D. Alessi D. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4327) Google Scholar). During myoblast differentiation, Akt is activated and mediates cell survival (19Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8983-8995Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting that Akt may continue to inhibit GSK3β during myoblast differentiation and that the increasing levels of Mirk in differentiating myoblasts may play a role in regulating cyclin D1 levels.We showed previously that depletion of Mirk in differentiating myoblasts by RNA interference prevented the induction of the muscle regulatory factor myogenin and the consequent differentiation program including fusion into myotubes (10Deng X.

https://openalex.org/W1971942469,"Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG-1) is a key regulator in the processing of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). We demonstrated that Insig-1 is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) providing a link between insulin sensitization/glucose homeostasis and lipid homeostasis. Insig-1 was identified as a PPARgamma target gene using microarray analysis of mRNA from the white adipose tissue of diabetic (db/db) animals treated with PPARgamma agonists. Insig-1 was induced in subcutaneous (9-fold) and epididymal (4-fold) fat pads from db/db mice treated for 8 days with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (30 mg/kg/day). This in vivo response was confirmed in differentiated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes treated with rosiglitazone. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating INSIG-1 expression, we cloned and characterized the human INSIG-1 promoter. Co-expression of PPARgamma and RXRalpha transactivated the INSIG-1 promoter in the presence of PPARgamma agonists. This induction was attenuated when a dominant negative PPARgamma construct was transfected into cells. Furthermore, a PPARgamma antagonist repressed the transactivation of the INSIG-1 promoter-reporter construct. Truncations of the promoter resulted in the identification of a PPAR response element that mediated the regulation of the promoter. We demonstrated with recombinant proteins that the PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer binds directly to this PPAR response element. In addition to regulation by PPARgamma/RXRalpha, we demonstrated that the INSIG-1 promoter is regulated by transcriptionally active SREBP. The sterol response element was identified 380 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. These findings suggest that the regulation of Insig-1 by PPARgamma agonists could in turn regulate SREBP processing and thus couple insulin sensitizers with the regulation of lipid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1977000651,"We previously reported that suppression of the MEK/ERK pathway increases drug resistance of SiHa cells. In this study, we further characterized the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. Pretreatment of SiHa cells with MEK/ERK inhibitor enhanced cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation. However, results of immunoblotting analysis showed that neither cisplatin nor MEK/ERK inhibitors induced marked IκBα degradation, suggesting that suppression of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway may enhance cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation via mechanisms other than the conventional pathway. Previous findings that protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), a nuclear serine/threonine phosphatase, directly interacts with and activates NF-κB led us to examine the phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65. Coincident with activation of NF-κB, cisplatin induced Ser phosphorylation but decreased Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Suppression of the MEK/ERK pathway further enhanced cisplatin-induced Thr dephosphorylation but did not affect cisplatin-induced Ser phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Further, in parallel with Thr dephosphorylation, the protein level of nuclear PP4 was increased in cisplatin-treated cells and was further increased by suppression of the MEK/ERK pathway. SiHa cells were then transfected by a sense or an antisense PP4 gene. PP4-overexpressing cells showed a decrease in Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 to nearly undetectable levels, and both basal and cisplatin-induced NF-κB activities were higher than those in parental cells. By contrast, cisplatin, either alone or with MEK/ERK inhibitors, induced little NF-κB activation in antisense PP4-transfected cells. Coprecipitated complex kinase assay revealed a fragment of NF-κB p65 (amino acids 279–444) to contain potential phosphorylation sites that directly interact with PP4.

Nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear transcription factor κB; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP4, phosphatase 4; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; IKK, IκB kinase. is widely involved in various cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. The activation of NF-κB is associated with tumorigenesis and inducible drug resistance in tumor cells (1Gilmore T. Koedood M. Piffat K. White D.

Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is normally restricted to the cytoplasm by binding to an inhibitory factor, IκBα. Following stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded. Unbound NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus and transactivates various downstream genes (reviewed in Refs. 6Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4630) Google Scholar and 7Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In addition to this classical activation pathway, recent data suggest that the phosphorylation status of the NF-κB p65 subunit is also involved in NF-κB activation. For example, protein kinase A phosphorylates p65 on Ser276 (8Zong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), IKK complex phosphorylates p65 on Ser536 (9Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of subunit p65 affects neither IκBα degradation nor NFκB nuclear translocation but is required for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, partly via increasing the interaction of NFκB with other transcriptional cofactors (11Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A.

Cell. 1999; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been found to directly interact with and dephosphorylate p65 in melanocytes, leading to a decrease of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (13Yang J. Fan G.H. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47828-47833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4; also known as protein phosphatase X) is a novel Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that shares 65% amino acid identity with PP2A (14Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.P. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). PP4 is induced and activated by TNFα (15Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Van Hooser A. Hu M.C.-T. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a strong NF-κB inducer. Overexpression of PP4 has been shown to activate NF-κB by direct interaction with and dephosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (16Hu M.C.T. Tang-Oxley Q. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.-P. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. Afshar R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33561-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism responsible for the different effects of PP2A and PP4 on NF-κB activation remains unknown, and whether PP4 is also involved in NF-κB activation induced by anticancer drugs has not been explored. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) is an important signal transduction molecule involved in the cellular response to various stresses (17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar, 18Hill C. Treisma R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Depending on the individual cellular context and levels of stress, ERK may increase or decrease the chemosensitivity of tumors (19Dent P. Jarvis W.D. Birrer M.J. Fisher P.B. Schmidt-Ullrich R.K.

Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In previous study, we showed that suppression of ERK2 increases the resistance of cervical carcinoma cells to cisplatin, mainly because of enhancement of cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism by which ERK2 suppression activates NF-κB is not fully understood. This study explored the possible pathway that links ERK2 suppression with NF-κB activation. The results showed that suppression of ERK2 increased the protein level of PP4 and thereby enhanced cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation via decrease of the Thr phosphorylation status of the NF-κB p65 subunit. Cell Culture and Chemicals—Human cervical carcinoma SiHa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MEK/ERK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, were purchased from Calbiochem, and other chemicals were obtained from Calbiochem or Sigma. Immunoblotting, Reprobing, and Immunoprecipitation—The cells after various treatments were subjected to cell fractionation as previously described (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and nuclear lysates were prepared, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad determination kit. Aliquots (15 μg) of lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. For reprobing, the membrane was washed with a stripping buffer (2% SDS, 7 μl of β-mercaptoethanol in 100 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to another immunoblotting. Antibodies, including anti-Thr(P), anti-phospho-ERK2, anti-ERK2, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-IκBα, anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and anti-PP4, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Ser(P) was obtained from Sigma. The phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 was examined by immunoblotting of the p65 immunoprecipitated complex with anti-Thr(P)- or anti-Ser(P)-specific antibody as previously described (24Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The activation of NF-κB was determined by EMSA as previously described (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probe, 5′-GGATTGGGACTTTCCCCTCC, was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract at room temperature for 30 min, and the electromobility of the probe was analyzed in 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The NF-κB-DNA complex was visualized by autoradiography. The supershift experiment was performed by adding 1 μg of anti-p65 antibody. Plasmid Construction, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Gene Transfection—The full-length of PP4 gene was a gift from Dr. M. C. T. Hu (Baylor College of Medicine). The HindIII/BamHI-digested PP4 fragment was subcloned into the pBKCMV (sense) or pCDNA3 (antisense) HindIII/BamHI site. Purified plasmid was transfected into SiHa cells with Lipofectant 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were selected by 500 μg/ml G418 for 20 days. The surviving colonies were pooled and cultured in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. To identify the possible phosphorylation sites of NF-κB p65, the full-length p65 gene was cloned from SiHa cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR. A SacI/PstI fragment of p65 (921–1411 fragment encoding amino acids 279–444; p65S/P) was in-frame cloned into pRSET vector (His6 tag Escherichia coli expression vector; Invitrogen). Substitution of Thr435 to Ala of p65S/P by site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-round PCR method as previously described (24Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Coprecipitated Complex Kinase Assay—E. coli expressed p65S/P wild type or mutant proteins were adsorbed to nickel-agarose (Clontech) in native binding buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nickel-agarose-p65S/P complexes were mixed with nuclear lysates prepared from cells with various treatments as shown in the figures at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitated complex was washed twice with binding buffer and once with kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2). The complex was incubated with kinase assay buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The images were visualized by exposure to x-ray film. Inhibition of MEK/ERK Enhances Cisplatin-induced NF-κB Activation—To elucidate the relationship between ERK2 and NF-κB in the cellular response to cisplatin, SiHa cells were treated with 20 μm cisplatin (IC50) for 1–5 h with or without a 1-h pretreatment with 10 μm U0126. As shown in Fig. 1A, ERK2 was activated by cisplatin, and U0126 suppressed this cisplatin-induced ERK2 activation. Under the same treatment, the NF-κB activation was determined by EMSA. NF-κB was activated by cisplatin, and pretreatment with U0126 further enhanced this activation. Similar results were obtained by pretreatment with PD98059 (data not shown). The NF-κB-DNA complex was confirmed by supershift experiment, which showed that the band was specifically shifted by adding anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 1B). The activation of NF-κB was further determined by NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter assay. NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene stably transfected SiHa cells have been described (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB was induced 1.5-fold by 20 μm cisplatin, 1.3-fold by 10 μm U0126, and 2-fold by the combined treatment of U0126 and cisplatin, consistent with the results of EMSA and our previous studies (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PD98059 was shown to exert an effect similar to U0126. Neither Cisplatin nor MEK/ERK Inhibitors Induce IκBα Degradation or NF-κB Nuclear Translocation—To characterize the pathways that lead to NF-κB activation, the protein levels of cytosolic IκBα and nuclear NF-κB after various treatments were determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, cisplatin with or without U0126 did not induce remarkable IκBα degradation or NF-κB nuclear translocation. These results suggest that suppression of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway might regulate NF-κB activity through an alternative pathway. PD98059 was shown to exert an effect similar to U0126 (data not shown). PD98059 Decreases the Level of Thr but Not Ser Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65—Because suppression of MEK/ERK by either PD98059 or U0126 showed similar effects in SiHa cells, only PD98059 was used in the subsequent experiments. Cisplatin is a DNA alkylating agent that acts primarily in the nucleus. Whether cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation is subjected to further regulation in the nucleus by inhibition of ERK2 was examined by Western blotting of immunoprecipitated nuclear NF-κB p65 with anti-Thr(P) or anti-Ser(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, cisplatin increased the Ser phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in a time-dependent manner. On the contrary, cisplatin decreased the Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Although PD98059 alone had little effect on the phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65, cotreatment of PD98059 with cisplatin markedly decreased the level of Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. By contrast, this cotreatment slightly increased the Ser phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. These results suggest that suppression of ERK2 enhanced cisplatin-induced NF-κB activity mainly via Thr dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65. PP4 Is Involved in the Regulation of NF-κB p65 Thr Phosphorylation—Because PP4 is a nuclear Ser/Thr protein phosphatase and directly associates with and activates NF-κB (16Hu M.C.T. Tang-Oxley Q. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.-P. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. Afshar R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33561-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), its possible involvement in mediating the downstream signal of ERK2 suppression to NF-κB activation was explored. As shown in Fig. 4, cisplatin slightly increased the protein level of PP4 in a time-dependent manner, and PD98059, either alone or in combination with cisplatin, resulted in a marked increase of PP4 protein. The role of PP4 in NF-κB activation was further characterized by transfection of PP4 (either sense or antisense; SiHa/PP4 or SiHa/AS-PP4) into SiHa cells. PP4 was constitutively expressed in SiHA/PP4 cells and was barely detectable in SiHa/AS-PP4 cells (data not shown). The Thr phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 in these transfected cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 5A, the Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 was undetectable in SiHa/PP4 cells. By contrast, NF-κB p65 was generally Thr-phosphorylated in SiHa/AS-PP4 cells, and cisplatin with or without PD98059 could not decrease the level of Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of PP4 Increases Basal and Cisplatin-induced NF-κB DNA Binding Activity—Cisplatin-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in PP4 (sense or antisense) transfectants was examined by EMSA. As expected, SiHa/PP4 cells had higher levels of basal and cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation. By contrast, in SiHa/AS-PP4 cells, cisplatin with or without PD98059 barely activated NF-κB (Fig. 6A). For a direct comparison, the drug-induced NF-κB activation in SiHa, SiHa/PP4, and SiHa/AS-PP4 cells was examined in parallel. As shown in Fig. 6B, SiHa/PP4 cells had the highest basal and drug-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity. PP4 Does Not Change Cisplatin-induced ERK2 Activation— ERK2 is regulated by kinases and phosphatases (25Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Whether PP4 has an effect on the activity of ERK2 was examined. As shown in Fig. 7, the activation of ERK2 by cisplatin was not affected, and PD98059 retained the ability to inhibit cisplatin-induced ERK2 activation in both SiHa/PP4 and SiHa/AS-PP4 cells. In addition, IκBα degradation or NF-κB nuclear translocation was not induced by cisplatin with or without PD98059 in both SiHa/PP4 and SiHa/AS-PP4 cells (data not shown). PP4 Targets NF-κB p65 on Thr435—To identify the Thr residue of NF-κB p65 for PP4 targeting, the possible Thr phosphorylation sites of p65 protein were derived by an internet available program (NetPhos 2.0, developed by Technical University of Denmark; www.cbs.dtu.dk). Thr435 was predicted to be the most probable residue for phosphorylation. A SacI/PstI restriction fragment (p65S/P, 921–1411 fragment encoding amino acids 279–444) containing Thr435 was thus in-frame cloned into a His6 tag expression vector (pREST; Invitrogen). In addition, Thr435 substituted with Ala mutant was also constructed in pRSET vector. E. coli-expressed p65S/P wild type or mutant proteins were adsorbed by nickel-agarose and then used as bait to pull down the associated nuclear proteins. The pull-down complex was then subjected to kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 8A, p65S/P wild type protein was phosphorylated by associated nuclear proteins from untreated SiHa cells. The level of p65S/P phosphorylation decreased in nuclear lysates obtained from cisplatin- or PD98059/cisplatin-treated cells. The p65S/P T435A mutant protein was not phosphorylated under the identical experimental conditions. The nuclear lysates prepared from similarly treated SiHa/PP4 or SiHa/AS-PP4 cells were also examined. As expected, p65S/P proteins were not phosphorylated by the nuclear lysates from SiHa/PP4 cells but were constitutively phosphorylated by the nuclear lysates from SiHa/AS-PP4 cells (Fig. 8B). P65S/P Protein Interacts with PP4 —The interaction between PP4 and NF-κB p65 was examined by Western blotting of p65 immunoprecipitated complex with anti-PP4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 9A, NF-κB p65 was found to physically interact with PP4. To test whether p65S/P is the region response for PP4 interaction, p65S/P wild type or T435A mutant protein coprecipitated complexes were Western blotted with anti-PP4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 9B, p65S/P interacted with PP4, and mutation of T435 did not alter this interaction. We have previously reported that suppression of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by PD98059 results in cisplatin resistance of the cervical carcinoma cell line, SiHa (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that inhibition of MEK/ERK enhances cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation via a pathway different from conventional IKK/IκBα/NF-κB signaling. We demonstrated that suppression of ERK2 increases the level of a nuclear protein phosphatase, PP4, which decreases the Thr phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65. Specifically, we identified that amino acids 281–444 of NF-κB p65 are responsible for the interaction with PP4 and that Thr435 is a PP4 targeting residue, which may play a critical role in NF-κB activity.

On the other hand, two phosphatases, PP2A and PP4, have been found to dephosphorylate NF-κB p65 (13Yang J. Fan G.H. Wadzinski B.E. Sakurai H. Richmond A. J. Biol.

These results indicate that the activity of NF-κB is under the control of multiple phosphorylations on different sites of the NF-κB p65 subunit; whereas phosphorylation on some sites activates NF-κB, phosphorylation on other sites attenuates its function. Although several phosphorylation sites of NF-κB p65, including Ser276 (8Zong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), Ser529 (10Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), have been identified, whether these sites are affected by PP2A and PP4 has not been characterized. In this study, although the precise Ser phosphorylation sites have not been determined, our results clearly demonstrated that cisplatin induced Ser phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, which was not affected by suppression of MEK/ERK. By contrast, the level of Thr phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 decreased to nearly undetectable levels in SiHa/PP4 cells but remained unchanged in SiHa/AS-PP4 cells, suggesting that PP4 was the main phosphatase involved in dephosphorylation of threonine residues of NF-κB p65. Further, based on prediction using Netphos 2.0 software, p65 Thr435 was identified as a phosphorylation site by coprecipitated complex kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis. Although it cannot be excluded that other Thr residues are also involved in the regulation of NF-κB activity, Thr435 seems to be a major site, because peptide (amino acids 279–444 of p65) containing Thr435 was found to directly interact with PP4. The mechanism by which NF-κB activity is regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation remains to be established. It is possible that Ser phosphorylation and Thr dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65 increase the binding affinity of NF-κB with DNA and/or other transcriptional factors. It is of particular importance to note that ionizing radiation and anticancer drugs, which primarily target DNA, may activate NF-κB via mechanisms different from the conventional IKK/IκBα/NFκB pathway. Several nuclear kinases, such as DNA-PK and ATM, have been reported to activate NF-κB in response to DNA-damaging agents (29Basu S. Rosenzweig K.R. Youmell M. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Piret B. Schoonbroodt S. Piette J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2261-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our results also showed that cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation was accompanied by the increase of Ser phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. However, the inhibitory effect of kinases on NF-κB activity has not been observed, and the kinase responsible for p65Thr435 phosphorylation remains to be identified. It is possible that DNA-damaging agents directly activate pre-existing nuclear NF-κB via nuclear kinases and/or phosphatases. These observations may be important for the understanding of NF-κB-relevant responses of some tumor cells with an intrinsically high level of nuclear expression of NF-κB (31Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E.

Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of the conventional IKK/IκBα/NF-κB pathway might have less effect on these tumor cells in response to DNA-damaging agents. In this study, U0126 did not induce observable NF-κB DNA binding activity; however, there was a slight increase of NF-κB transcriptional activity observed in reporter assay (Fig. 1, B and C). The reason for this discrepancy may be due to differences in the assay methods. EMSA assay detects DNA binding activity at a definite time point; by contrast, the results of reporter gene assay actually represent the accumulation of reporter gene expression for a period of time. In this study, suppression of ERK2 by either PD98059 or U0126 increased the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 1C). Although this increase of NF-κB transcriptional activity seems small, our previous study showed that suppression of ERK2 may increase drug resistance toward cisplatin (23Yeh P.Y. Chuang S.E. Yeh K.H. Song Y.C. Ea C.K. Cheng A.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that cisplatin activates both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals (7Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 34Kaltschmidt B. Kaltschmidt C. Hofmann T.G. Hehner S.P. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Eur. J.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and the overall cytotoxicity of cisplatin is determined by the balance of these two opposite pathways. It is possible that even a small change of the balance of these two forces will alter the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin. Although PD98059 increased the protein level of PP4 (Fig. 4), it alone did not induce NF-κB p65 Thr dephosphorylation (Fig. 3). Several possible mechanisms may be responsible for this phenomenon. First, the level of PP4 protein may be insufficient for dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65 threonine residues to occur. Second, cisplatin may change the nuclear environment and increase molecular interaction between PP4 and NF-κB. Finally, cisplatin may induce conformational change of NF-κB and thereby facilitate PP4 targeting. The latter speculation is partly supported by a recent report suggesting that p65 is a target of Pin 1 (36Ryo A. Suizu F. Yoshida Y. Perrem K. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Rottapel R. Yamaoka S. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1413-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Additionally, the results of coprecipitated complex kinase assay suggest that p65S/P also interacts with an unknown kinase. The observation of constitutive phosphorylation of p65S/P in SiHa/AS-PP4 cells indicates this kinase was not affected by PD98059 or cisplatin treatment. The molecular interactions among NF-κB and possible kinases and phosphatases remain to be elucidated. The molecular mechanisms by which suppression of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway leads to enhanced expression of PP4 protein remain to be elucidated. However, the biological significance of this unconventional pathway of NF-κB activation appears to be important in that it might function as an alternative mechanism of stepwise regulation of NF-κB activity that can integrate signals from different stresses.

Within the complex, 14-3-3 simultaneously binds to tau and GSK3β (Agarwal-Mawal, A., Qureshi, H. Y., Cafferty, P. W., Yuan, Z., Han, D., Lin, R., and Paudel, H. K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12722–12728). The molecular mechanism by which 14-3-3 connects GSK3β to tau within the complex is not clear. In this study, we find that GSK3β within the tau phosphorylation complex is phosphorylated on Ser9. From extracts of rat brain and rat primary cultured neurons, Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β precipitates with glutathione-agarose beads coated with glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3. Similarly, from rat brain extract, Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β co-immunoprecipitates with tau. In vitro, 14-3-3 binds to GSK3β only when the kinase is phosphorylated on Ser9. In transfected HEK-293 cells, 14-3-3 binds to Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β and does not bind to GSK3β (S9A). Tau, on the other hand, binds to both GSK3β (WT) and GSK3β (S9A). Moreover, 14-3-3 enhances the binding of tau with Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β by ∼3-fold but not with GSK3β (S9A). Similarly, 14-3-3 stimulates phosphorylation of tau by Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β but not by GSK3β (S9A). In transfected HEK-293 cells, Ser9 phosphorylation suppresses GSK3β-catalyzed tau phosphorylation in the absence of 14-3-3. In the presence of 14-3-3, however, Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β remains active and phosphorylates tau. Our data indicate that within the tau phosphorylation complex, 14-3-3 connects Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β to tau and Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β phosphorylates tau.

Tau is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein. It is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, and neuronal morphology. In the brain, tau binds to microtubules, promotes microtubule assembly, and stabilizes microtubule structure (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin.

In AD, abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (phosphorylated on more sites than normal tau) aggregates and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) (5Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M.

Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). PHFs are the main structural component of neurofibrillary tangles, which are one of the characteristic neuropathological lesions found in the brains of patients suffering from AD (2Lee V.M.-Y.

Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Since abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, which does not bind to microtubules, regains its biological activity upon dephosphorylation, abnormal hyperphosphorylation has been suggested as being one of the central events in the development of neurofibrillary pathology (2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 24: 1121-1159Crossref Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 3Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C.

Abnormal tau phosphorylation causes loss of tau function, microtubule instability, and neurodegeneration in AD brain. Preventing or reducing excessive tau phosphorylation has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy in AD research (2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 24: 1121-1159Crossref Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). A loss in the regulatory mechanism that controls tau phosphorylation in normal brain was suggested to cause abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD brain (2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu.

The mechanism by which tau is phosphorylated in the brain is not clear.Tau is phosphorylated by many kinases in vitro.

Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Neufield K.D. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11933-11940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported 14-3-3 as the third component of the complex (9Agarwal-Mawal A. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Yuan Z. Han D. Loin R. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12722-12728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Within the complex, 14-3-3 binds to GSK3β, connects it to tau, and stimulates GSK3β-catalyzed tau phosphorylation (9Agarwal-Mawal A. Qureshi H.Y. Cafferty P.W. Yuan Z. Han D. Loin R. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12722-12728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism by which 14-3-3 interacts with GSK3β is not known. A characteristic feature of 14-3-3 is that it binds to a phosphorylated serine within its target protein (27Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Studies based on synthetic peptides derived from Raf suggest that the 14-3-3-binding region consists of a short stretch of amino acid residues containing a phosphoserine (27Fu H. Subramanian R.R.

Within this sequence, an Arg residue at position –3 relative to the phosphoserine was suggested to be critical for 14-3-3 binding (30Musilin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.W. Shaw A.S.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Many 14-3-3-binding proteins contain a Ser or a Thr at position –1 and/or –2 with respect to phosphoserine involved in 14-3-3 binding (see Ref. 27Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev.

Herein, we report that 14-3-3 binds to phosphorylated Ser9 of GSK3β in the brain. We also show that 14-3-3 connects Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β to tau and facilitates tau phosphorylation by Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3β. Our results suggest a novel mechanism that explains how GSK3β, upon phosphorylation of Ser9, in response to various growth factors, may phosphorylate tau in the brain (24Lesort M. Johnson G.V.W.

After adding 3 ml of trypsin (2.5%), the tube was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with occasional mixing by tube inversion. To the incubated mixture, 3 ml of fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) followed by 4 ml of DNase I (1 mg/ml) were added. The tube was subjected to five or six inversions followed by gentle trituration using a 25-ml glass pipette until the mixture became homogeneous. The mixture was filtered twice through a nylon membrane. The neurons in the filtrate were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 °C. The pellet was washed twice with PBS and then dispersed in 45 ml of culture medium (minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 30 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum). Neurons in the dispersed solution were plated at 3 × 106 cells/mm in 35-mm poly-d-lysine-coated dishes and placed in aCO2 incubator maintained at 37 °C. The culture medium was replaced with fresh culture medium supplemented with 1 mm fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma) on the second and the third days. On the fourth day, the culture medium was again replaced with fresh culture medium without fluorodeoxyuridine. On the seventh day, neurons were scraped and suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 nm okadaic acid, 4 nm cypermethrin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). The suspension was incubated on ice with occasional shaking for 30 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for a GST pull-down assay.HEK-293 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on 10-cm dishes. Once ∼80% confluent, cells were transfected with 0.2–10 μg of cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA used for each transfection in various experiments was as follows: 1 μg of tau, 1 μg of HA-GSK3β (WT), 3 μg of HA-GSK3β (S9A), 6 μg of HA-AKT, and 0.2 μg of Myc-14-3-3. For each transfection, the amount of total DNA never exceeded 10 μg. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and used for GST pull-down assays, immunoblottings, and immunoprecipitations.Proteins and Antibodies—Recombinant GST-GSK3β and GST-14-3-3 were purified from bacterial lysates overexpressing respective proteins by glutathione-agarose chromatography (8Sun W.

Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to monitor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GSK3β. AKT incorporated ∼0.3 mol of phosphate/mol of GSK3β, whereas protein phosphatase 1 almost completely dephosphorylated AKT-phosphorylated GSK3β.Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for GSK3β phosphorylated on Ser9 and GSK3α phosphorylated on Ser21 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and MBA International Corp.

Upon deletion of the last 37 amino acids, the resulting GAT1-Δ37 remained trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of 10 additional residues (GAT1-Δ27) sufficed to support the interaction with the coat protein complex II component Sec24D; surface expression of GAT1-Δ27 reached 50% of the wild type level.

Neurotransmission at synaptic junctions in the central nervous system is terminated by reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic ends (1Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This is achieved by neurotransmitter transporters.

There are three GABA transporters, referred to as GAT1, GAT2, and GAT3, which all belong to the Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. Members of this family share several features including a characteristic topology, i.e. intracellular amino and the carboxyl termini and a hydrophobic core composed of 12 transmembrane-spanning segments that are presumed to be predominantly α-helical. In the brain, GAT1 is the most widely distributed isoform. The transporter is of obvious therapeutic relevance: increases in synaptic GABA reduces excitability and prevents excessive neuronal firing. This action provides a rationale for the use of tiagabine in the treatment of epilepsy (2Iversen L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In neurons, transporters must reach the presynaptic specialization. Thus, their biosynthetic pathway must also comprise mechanisms that afford the sorting and targeting to the axonal compartment and/or specific retention at perisynaptic sites (3Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Schroeter S. Qian Y. Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Biol. Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, they undergo quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (4Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and posttranslational modification in the Golgi stacks. We recently demonstrated that neurotransmitter transporters such as GAT1 and the serotonin transporter form constitutive oligomers (5Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). If oligomerization of GAT1 is disrupted, the transporter is no longer expressed at the cell surface but is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, while exit from the endoplasmic reticulum is contingent on the association of transporter homo-oligomers, oligomerization does not suffice, and additional sequence elements in the intracellular segments are required. In fact, if the entire carboxyl terminus is truncated, GAT1 is also retained (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Perego et al. (7Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol.

The authors concluded that the major part of the GAT1 carboxyl terminus was dispensable for sorting the protein into the correct compartment. Thus, based on these results, we initially focused on the part of GAT1 adjacent to the last transmembrane segment to identify sequence elements that specify targeting to the plasma membrane. In the present work, we show that GAT1 mutants, which lack up to 29 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus, are retained within the cell. We uncovered two discontinuous signals, which act in a hierarchical manner. The proximal one (569VMI571) is responsible for sorting the protein into the correct compartment. The distal signal is comprised of the last three amino acids, which apparently fulfill the criteria of a type II PDZ interaction domain, and functions to accelerate membrane insertion.

Carboxyl-terminal deletions were created by inserting a stop codon with an ApaI restriction site at the proper position. In the case of point mutations, the codon of the targeted amino acid was replaced by the appropriate triplet to generate the intended amino acid substitution. The codon was again inserted with an ApaI restriction site. The integrity of all constructs was verified be sequencing the entire reading frame. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics. PC12 cells were cultured in Optimem-1 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Media were changed every other day. For experiments with HEK293 and MDCK cells, 0.3 × 106 cell (unless indicated otherwise) were plated into 6-well plates. For microscopy, cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips at the same cell density. The CaPO4 precipitation method was used to transiently transfect HEK293 and MDCK cells. The transfection efficiencies were 50–70 and 5–10% in HEK293 and MDCK cells, respectively. If not otherwise indicated, transfections were done 24 h after cell seeding. PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 0.15 × 106 cells on glass coverslips coated with collagen. If differentiation was to be induced, the medium was changed on the next day to Optimem-1 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor to induce differentiation. After 48 h, PC12 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen). The transfection efficiency was 5–10%. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out 48 h later. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from neonatal rats as in Ref. 8Boehm S. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4066-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Glial cells were depleted by a 16-h incubation in the presence of 1 μm cytarabine (AraC). Neurons were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) in 6-well dishes containing 3 × 105 dissociated cells. The expression of YFP-tagged GAT1 and the appropriately mutated forms was visualized by fluorescence microscopy 24–48 h after transfection. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Microscopy—Three methods were used to detect FRET: (i) donor photobleaching, (ii) donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP), and (iii) the three-filter method to calculate net FRET. The setup has been described in detail elsewhere (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Donor photobleaching FRET was done by continuous illumination for 60 s using a mercury arc lamp (Zeiss HBO 100-watt intensity) with the CFP filter settings (excitation = 440 nm, dichroic mirror = 455 nm, emission = 480 nm). An image was captured every 3 s. This procedure bleached the donor (CFP) to less than 20%. Regions of interest were selected, and the time-dependent decrease in fluorescence emission intensity was quantified. The resulting decay curves were fitted to the equation of a single exponential decay approaching a constant value (=A0·e-kt). A0 is the initial intensity, and k is the decay constant. The photobleaching lifetime (τ) was calculated from τ = 1/k. To measure DRAP we acquired a CFP image before (Ib) and after (Ia) photobleaching using the YFP setting for 90 s (excitation = 500 nm, dichroic mirror = 525 nm, emission = 535 nm). DRAP was quantified by FRET efficiency (E) as described by Miyawaki et al. (9Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) according to the equation E = (Ia - Ib)/Ia. The three-filter method was done according to Youvan et al. (10Youvan D.C. Coleman W.J. Silva C.M. Petersen J. Bylina J. Yang M.M. Biotechnol. et alia. 1997; 1: 1-16Google Scholar). In brief, images were taken using the FRET filter (IFRET; excitation = 440 nm, dichroic mirror = 455 nm, emission = 535 nm), CFP filter (ICFP), and YFP filter settings (IYFP). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images; net FRET (nF) was calculated using the equation: nF = IFRET - (α × IYFP) - (β × ICFP) where α and β represent the bleed-through values for YFP (4%) and for CFP (34%). Surface Biotinylation—HEK293 cells were transfected with YFP-tagged versions of GAT1-wt and GAT1-Δ27. 24 h later, transfection efficiencies were monitored with the fluorescence microscope. Subsequently cells were incubated with 2 mg/ml membrane impermeable sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin for 20 min. Incubation was done at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm glycine for 40 min at 4 °C. Cells were collected and lysed in buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g (4 °C for 30 min) to remove insoluble material. The lysates were incubated overnight with an anti-GFP serum (full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody, Clontech) at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added for an additional 3 h. Protein was eluted from beads by treatment with SDS sample buffer for 30 min at 45 °C. Proteins were resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. YFP-GAT1 versions were detected with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech). After stripping, biotinylation was detected with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (2 μg/μl). GABA Uptake—3 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated into 6-well plates. On the next day, cells were transfected; 24 h later, they were transferred to 48-well plates. GABA uptake was determined as outlined in detail elsewhere (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in a final volume containing the concentrations of [łH]GABA (specific activity ranging from 72 to 0.07 Ci/mmol) indicated in the figures and legends. The incubation lasted for 3 min. The blank was determined in the presence of 100 μm tiagabine. Uptake was quenched by adding 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs-HEPES buffer. Cells were lysed in 1% SDS. Membrane Targeting of GAT1 Is Disrupted by Deletion of 37 Amino Acids of the Carboxyl Terminus—To monitor the cellular localization of our various GAT1 constructs, we generated fusion proteins in which the GFP variants (YFP or CFP) were fused to the amino terminus of GAT1. Our previous experiments showed that the addition of a fluorescent protein to the transporter did not interfere with membrane targeting or affect the functional properties (that is the affinity for substrates and inhibitors as well as the velocity of substrate translocation) or the endocytosis and recycling of GAT1 in response to protein kinase C activation (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Under the transfection conditions used, wild type YFP-rGAT was almost exclusively visualized at the cell surface in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, if the carboxyl-terminal 37 amino acids were removed, the resulting truncated transporter CFP-rGAT-Δ37 was not found at the plasma membrane but was completely retained within the cell (Fig. 1B). We stained transiently transfected cells with the selective dye ER Tracker Blue-White DPX (Fig. 1F, green pseudocolor) and also recorded the fluorescence emitted by YFP-rGAT-Δ37 (Fig. 1E, red pseudocolor). The overlay of both images resulted in uniform yellow coloring of those cells that expressed the transporter (Fig. 1G). This colocalization confirmed that the intracellular compartment in which rGAT-Δ37 resided was the endoplasmic reticulum. The Carboxyl-terminally Truncated Mutant Interacts with Wild Type GAT1—We have reported previously that GAT1 assembles into constitutive oligomers, which are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (5Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This has also been proposed for other neurotransmitter transporters (11Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Oligomer formation can thus be viewed as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanism. This is underscored by the observation that membrane targeting of GAT1 is absent when oligomerization is disrupted (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the observed intracellular retention of CFP-GAT1-Δ37 is due to defective oligomerization. We co-transfected HEK293 cells with CFP-GAT1-Δ37 (donor) and YFP-rGAT-wt (acceptor). To measure FRET we used donor photobleaching to calculate the decay time of fluorescence intensity as well as DRAP to calculate the FRET efficiency. In the first approach, energy transfer protects the donor against bleaching because energy is absorbed by the acceptor. Conversely DRAP relies on the fact that photodestruction of the acceptor results in enhanced fluorescence of the donor due to interruption of energy transfer. Both methods allow for quantification and thus for a statistical comparison. Fig. 2A shows a representative set of bleaching curves from one experimental day; the concomitant expression of YFP-tagged wild type GAT1 (Fig. 2A, open symbols) caused a delay in photobleaching when compared with cells that only expressed the CFP-tagged truncated GAT1-Δ37 (Fig. 2A, open symbols). As can be seen from Fig. 2B, there was a statistically significant difference in the average photobleaching lifetimes (τ) determined in the absence and presence of acceptor (that is wild type GAT1). Similarly we also detected a robust FRET by DRAP (Fig. 2C). In the absence of FRET (i.e. in the absence of an acceptor), there was also a modest decrease in fluorescence intensity of the donor; this is due to the fact that bleaching with the YFP settings results in slight but appreciable cross-bleaching of CFP. Detection of FRET using the three-filter method offers the advantage that it visualizes the cellular compartment in which the proposed protein-protein interaction takes place. Fig. 3 shows that CFP-GAT1-Δ37 and YFP-rGAT-wt indeed interact intracellularly. The results of our FRET experiments clearly rule out the possibility that retention is due to defective oligomerization. Instead the observations indicate that the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant is able to directly interact with the wild type transporter. Thus, due to its defective surface expression, the truncated GAT1-Δ37 apparently also traps the wild type protein within the cell. This interpretation was verified by exploiting the fact that YFP and CFP can be visualized separately within the same cell by the appropriate filter sets. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding wild type YFP-GAT1 and CFP-GAT1-Δ37. This resulted in intracellular retention of the wild type transporter (Fig. 1D) in cells that also expressed the truncated transporter (Fig. 1C). In contrast, in those cells that did not express the deletion mutant, wild type YFP-GAT1 was found at the membrane (Fig. 1D, exemplified by the upper cell). Transporters that are retained within the cell are irrelevant to the uptake of [3H]GABA. Thus, coexpression of the carboxyl-terminally truncated mutant ought to abrogate transport mediated by the wild type transporter. This was the case. HEK293 cells expressing only YFP-rGAT-wt displayed a robust uptake of [3H]GABA (Fig. 1H, left-hand bar), while cells coexpressing CFP-rGAT-Δ37 did not show any significant uptake of radioactive substrate (Fig. 1H, right-hand bar). As predicted from the absence of surface-associated fluorescence (Fig. 1B), cells that only expressed CFP-rGAT-Δ37 did not accumulate [3H]GABA (Fig. 1E, middle bar). To rule out that defective membrane targeting was due to misfolding of the protein, we performed GABA uptake experiments in membrane vesicles prepared from appropriately transfected cells (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, CFP-GAT1-Δ37 and wild type CFP-GAT1 translocated the substrate [3H]GABA with similar affinity (Km = 7.6 ± 4.8) and comparable velocity (data not shown). CFP-GAT1-Δ36 Is Not Inserted into the Plasma Membrane—It has been reported previously that deletion of 36 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of GAT1 did not interfere with membrane targeting of the transporter (7Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GAT1-Δ37 and GAT1-Δ36 differ by a leucine residue at position 563. We aligned the carboxyl termini of several Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters (Fig. 4A) and noted that Leu563 was conserved among many family members and was replaced by phenylalanine in serotonin transporter and isoleucine in dopamine transporter, which are nevertheless hydrophobic amino acids. Because of the conserved nature of this amino acid, we surmised that Leu563 played an essential role in the targeting process. We therefore generated CFP-GAT1-Δ36 and expressed this mutant in HEK293 cells. The representative example shown in Fig. 4B illustrates that the protein was only found in intracellular compartments. Expression of CFP-GAT1-Δ36 also failed to confer [3H]GABA uptake to cells (not shown). Because Perego et al. (7Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) had expressed their construct in the polarized epithelial cell line MDCK, we also used this cell line. In MDCK cells wild type GAT1 was efficiently targeted to the cell surface (Fig. 4C). In contrast, CFP-GAT1-Δ36 only accumulated within the cell (Fig 4D). MDCK cells and other polarized epithelial cells are used as a surrogate for neuronal cells. Because neurotransmitter transporters are expressed predominantly in neurons, we also investigated the fate of CFP-GAT1-Δ36 in differentiated PC12 cells. In these cells, YFP-GAT1-wt was present exclusively in the plasma membrane and was highly enriched at the sites of sprouting neurites extensions (Fig. 4E). This is to be expected because GAT1 is enriched in the axonal compartment (12Radian R. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Castel M. Kanner B.I. J. Neurosci. 1990; 4: 1319-1330Crossref Google Scholar). On the other hand, as in the other cell lines, CFP-GAT1-Δ36 was only found within the differentiated PC12 cell (Fig. 4F). Finally we performed the same experiments in hippocampal neurons because these are among the neurons that express GAT1 endogenously (13Chiu C.S. Jensen K. Sokolova I. Wang D. Li M. Deshpande P. Davidson N. Mody I. Quick M.W. Quake S.R. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10251-10266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, the wild type GAT1 was found on the somatic cell surface (Fig. 4G, left) and in neurite extensions (Fig. 4G, right). Somatic expression is most likely due to overexpression of the transporter. More importantly, CFP-GAT1-Δ36 was not visualized at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4H). Based on these observations, we conclude that, despite its high degree of conservation, Leu563 is not essential for targeting the transporter to the plasma membrane. Plasma Membrane Targeting Relies on Two Different Regions in GAT1 Carboxyl Terminus—It is evident that the amino acids that are important for targeting must lie in more distal portions of the carboxyl terminus. Thus, we elongated GAT1-Δ37 stepwise by 10 amino acids. CFP-GAT1-Δ27 was inserted into the cell membrane as was CFP-rGAT-Δ17 and -Δ7 (Fig. 5A, B, and C, respectively). Interestingly much of the protein was nevertheless located intracellularly. We verified that all these proteins were functional by performing saturation experiments on transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Fig. 5F shows a set of representative saturation curves that were obtained in parallel. The calculated Km values for the mutants did not differ significantly from that of the wild type (wild type = 8.7 ± 2.6, GAT1-Δ27 = 9.3 ± 3.1, GAT1-Δ17 = 6.7 ± 2.3, GAT1-Δ7 = 9.9 ± 3.7). To further prove that membrane expression of CFP-rGAT-Δ27 is indeed lower than that of the wild type protein, we transfected HEK293 cells with increasing amounts of plasmid DNA. Uptake of [3H]GABA was determined at a GABA concentration (10 μm) that was within the Km concentration range. This resulted in a robust signal-to-noise ratio without requiring the use of excessive amounts of radioactive tracer. Because the Km values of the various mutated versions of GAT1 were virtually identical (see Fig. 5F), the transport velocity determined at this concentration only reflects the level of transporter at the cell surface. As can be seen from Fig. 5G, there was a hyperbolic relation between the amount of plasmid DNA and transport velocity for both wild type YFP-GAT1 (open diamonds) and CFP-rGAT1-Δ27 (closed triangles), and the amount of DNA required to support half-maximum expression of the two transporters did not differ appreciably. However, transport velocity was significantly lower in cells expressing CFP-rGAT1-Δ27 than in those expressing YFP-rGAT-wt, and this was not overcome by the addition of excess plasmid (Fig. 5G). This indicated that plasma membrane expression of the mutant was lower than that of the wild type transporter. On average the surface expression of CFP-rGAT1-Δ27 was 50% of that of the corresponding wild type transporter. To confirm the results of this experiment we measured the amount of GAT1 at the cell surface by biotinylation with the membrane-impermeable reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid driving either the expression of YFP-GAT1-wt (7.5 μg/10-cm dish) or the YFP-GAT1-Δ27 (15 μg/10-cm dish). The levels of immunoprecipitated YFP-tagged transporter were estimated by immunoblotting; the amount of YFP-GAT1-Δ27 was ∼2-fold higher than that of YFP-GAT1-wt (Fig. 5H, upper panel). However, the levels of biotinylated transporter were comparable (Fig. 5H, lower panel). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the findings in the uptake experiments and indicate that the uptake velocity of GAT1-Δ27 (and by inference of the other truncated mutants) is reduced because of the decreased cell surface expression rather than because the carboxyl terminus affects the transport rates. Based on these findings we concluded that the 10 additional amino acids by which GAT1-Δ27 differed from GAT1-Δ37 must contain a signal that supports trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane albeit to a limited extent. Upon further inspection of the amino acid sequence between Leu563 and Gln572 we found a moderately conserved QRL motif. Adding back these amino acids results in CFP-rGAT-Δ32. This construct, however, was not targeted to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cell (Fig. 5D) and did not support cellular uptake of [3H]GABA (data not shown). Thus the residues QVMIQ represent the crucial portion, while the adjacent preceding residues are irrelevant to the process of ER export. In this context, it is worth mentioning that extending the carboxyl terminus up to position Δ7 (or rather Δ3, see below) did not enhance surface expression as assessed by cellular [3H]GABA uptake (Fig. 5G). A substantial amount of rGAT-Δ27 was located intracellularly. Fluorescence emitted by CFP-rGAT-Δ27 (Fig. 6A) and the ER Tracker dye (Fig. 6B) colocalized when overlaid (Fig. 6C). Thus, the intracellular compartment in which rGAT-Δ27 accumulated was the endoplasmic reticulum. Dihydrophobic motifs are well known ER export motifs (14Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We surmised that such a motif was located within the sequence essential for export of rGAT1 (QVMIQ). To address this conjecture we created additional deletion mutants. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with CFP-rGAT-Δ31, CFP-rGAT-Δ30, CFP-rGAT-Δ29, and CFP-rGAT-"

Two major theories on the role of HDL in the development of atherosclerosis are as follows: (i) reverse cholesterol transport (HDL transfers cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion) (5Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) the lipid oxidation theory (it has been shown that HDL traps oxidized lipids that are responsible for the production of cytokines) (7Navab M. Hama S.Y. Anantharamaiah G.M. Hassan K. Hough G.P. Watson A.D. Reddy S.T. Sevanian A. Fonarow G.C. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1495-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several enzymes (notably platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and paraoxonase) that are present on the surface of HDL are responsible for destroying the biological activity of oxidized lipids (6Navab M.

Furthermore, investigations using apoA-I peptides support the concept that their ability to inhibit atherosclerosis is related to their ability to remove “seeding molecules” (reactive lipid hydroperoxides formed by the oxidation of phospholipids containing arachidonic acid) from the low density lipoprotein (LDL) surface, thereby inhibiting free radical oxidation chain reactions and the subsequent propagation and release of cytokines (14Van Lenten B.J. Wagner A.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Fishbein M.C. Adhikari L. Nayak D.P. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggest that oral administration of D-4F to LDL receptor null and apoE null mice causes the rapid formation and clearance of small HDL-like particles containing peptide, cholesterol, and apoA-I and paraoxonase, capable of converting proinflammatory HDL into anti-inflammatory HDL (15Navab M. Hama S. Hough G. Reddy S. Frank J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: IV-232Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results, coupled with the previous observations that class A amphipathic helical peptide associates with HDL (16Garber D. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Gupta K.B. Ibdah J. Phillips M.C. Hazelrig J.B. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 886-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the peptide is active in a lipid-associated form. However, not all class A amphipathic helical peptides are anti-inflammatory to the same extent (17Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F.

Current Sci. 2001; 81: 53-65Google Scholar). Using a series of peptides in which the hydrophobicity of the nonpolar face was increased by substituting Ala, Leu, or Val residues with Phe residues, we have shown that greater hydrophobicity per se is not sufficient to increase the anti-inflammatory properties of a class A amphipathic helical peptide (17Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of one more Phe to the nonpolar face of Ac-18A-NH2 (2F) either at position 3 (3F3)orat14(3F14) (Fig. 1) resulted in peptides that were no longer able to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity (17Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a peptide analog containing four Phe residues on the nonpolar face (4F) was the most active in this series in inhibiting LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity, whereas the extensively studied 2F analog was not as effective. Furthermore, 2F did not inhibit atherosclerosis in a diet-induced mouse model of atherosclerosis (19Garber D.W. Handattu S. Aslan I. Datta G. Chaddha M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 168: 229-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas 4F was highly effective (18Anantharamaiah G.M. Datta G. Garber D.W. Current Sci. 2001; 81: 53-65Google Scholar). The further addition of Phe residues (5F, 6F, and 7F) did not enhance this property. We therefore hypothesized that a particular arrangement of aromatic residues on the nonpolar face is more important in producing a peptide with maximum anti-inflammatory properties than is the overall hydrophobicity of the peptide. To investigate this, we have synthesized two additional analogs of 3F. In one analog, with the amino acid sequence Ac-DKLKAFYDKVFEWAKEAF-NH2 (referred to as 3F-1), the aliphatic residues are at the center of the nonpolar face, and aromatic residues are near the interfacial Lys residues, whereas in another 3F analog with the amino acid sequence Ac-DKWKAVYDKFAEAFKEFL-NH2 (referred to as 3F-2), the π-electron-containing aromatic residues are at the center of the nonpolar face (see Fig. 1A). The primary sequence and wheel projection of these peptides along with those of 2F, 3F3, 3F14, and 4F for comparison are shown in Fig. 1A. The space-filling models of these peptides with the Lys residues snorkeled (20Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L. Brouillette C.G. Schmidt B-H.C. Hughes T.A. Bhown A.S. Segrest J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10248-10255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Epand R.M. Shai Y. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1B. We have studied the physical-chemical and anti-inflammatory properties of these two peptides and 4F in comparison with 3F3 and 3F14. The results show that although all of the peptides have similar abilities to form an amphipathic helix, the two peptides 3F-1 and 3F-2 are biologically active, similar to 4F. This effect appears to be related to the position of aromatic residues with respect to the surface of lipoprotein particles, which affect molecular arrangements near the interface and alter the lateral interactions within the particle. Changes in these interactions could promote the transfer of oxidized lipids (found on the surface of LDL particles) to HDL-like particles, thus making LDL less effective in inducing monocyte chemotaxis, an important step in the initiation of atherogenesis. Materials—Tissue culture materials and other reagents were obtained from sources previously described (6Navab M. Hama S.Y. Coke J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chaddha M. Jin L. Subbanagounder G. Faull K.F.

Lipids used in these investigations were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) except for the fluorescent phospholipid 2-(3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPH-PC) that was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, chloroform, methanol, ammonium formate, formic acid, and acetic acid, were all obtained from Fisher, and acetic anhydride diisopropylethylamine and pipyridine were from Sigma. Amino acids and condensing reagent O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and rink amide resin were purchased from Advanced Chem Tech (Louisville, KY) and Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Hemolysis Assay—The hemolysis assay was carried out as described by Tytler et al. (22Tytler E.M. Segrest J.P. Epand R.M. Nie S.-Q Epand R.F. Mishra V.K. Venkatachalapati Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22112-22118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, red blood cells (RBCs) were collected from EDTA-treated human blood by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove plasma and the buffy coat. A suspension of 1% erythrocytes in phosphate-buffered saline with or without peptide was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Hemolysis was measured as hemoglobin content (absorbance at 540 nm) of the supernatant. Base-line hemolysis was the hemolysis of RBCs incubated with phosphate-buffered saline. Hemoglobin released by 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken to be 100% lysis. Inhibition of lysis by peptides was measured by incubating RBCs with a 10 μm concentration of peptides and adding 2 μm 18L to the cell suspension. Hemolysis was expressed as a percentage of the Triton X-100 lysis. Monocyte Chemotaxis Assay—The procedure detailed by Navab et al. (6Navab M. Hama S.Y. Coke J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chaddha M. Jin L. Subbanagounder G. Faull K.F. Reddy S.T. Miller N.E. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1481-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was followed. Briefly, human aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were isolated. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were grown in microtiter well plates until confluence, and the human aortic endothelial cells were added. Cocultures were treated with 20 μg of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) and 1 μg/ml of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPODE) in the absence or presence of HDL (50 μg of cholesterol) or peptides (66 μm) for 8 h. The supernatants were collected and assayed for chemotactic activity. Determination of Lipid Hydroperoxide Content—Lipid hydroperoxides were measured colorimetrically by the FOX2 assay (23Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The ability of the peptides to remove lipid hydroperoxides from lipoproteins was assessed by incubating each of them with plasma from Watanabe rabbits. Plasma from these rabbits is known to possess lipid hydroperoxides (24Holvoet P. Collen D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2376-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Yamaguchi Y. Kagota S. Kunitomo M. Haginaka J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 1 ml of plasma was incubated with peptide at a final concentration of 44 μm for 1 h at 37 °C. The lipoproteins were then separated on two Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) columns in tandem using the Bio-Rad BioLogic Duoflow system. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. The peaks were analyzed for hydroperoxide content. Briefly, 900 μl of the FOX reagent containing 300 μm FeSO4 7H2O, 120 μm xylenol orange, 25 mm H2SO4, and 4.4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene in methanol was added to 100 μl of the sample and incubated in the dark for 30 min, and absorbance was measured at 560 nm. The values were compared with a standard of cumene hydroperoxide to quantitate the hydroperoxide content. Lipoproteins—Low density lipoprotein (d = 1.019 g/ml) and high density lipoproteins (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) were isolated using the procedure by Havel et al. (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6479) Google Scholar) from normal volunteers under the protocol approved by Human Research Subject Protection committees of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and UCLA. In some cases, butylated hydroxytoluene (20 mm in ethanol) was added to freshly isolated plasma at a concentration of 20 μm, and the lipoprotein was separated by fast protein liquid chromatography using the methods previously described (27Neuzil J.J. Upsaton M. Witting P.K. Alleva R. Stocker R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9203-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LDL, HDL, and lipoprotein-deficient serum had endotoxin levels below 20 pg/ml, which is well below the threshold needed for induction of monocyte adhesion or chemotactic activity. The concentrations of lipoproteins reported in this study are based on protein content. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method with a Protein Technologies PS-3 automatic peptide synthesizer using the procedures described previously (12Garber D.W. Datta G. Chaddha M. Palgunachari M.N. Hama S.Y. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were purified using a preparative HPLC system (Beckman Gold), and the purity of the peptides was determined by mass spectral analysis and analytical HPLC. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 215 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cell with a 0.1-cm path length at 25 °C. Peptide solutions in phosphate-buffered saline were used at concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 μm. The effect of lipid binding on the secondary structure of the peptide was studied using peptide-lipid complexes (1:10 mol/mol) with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Since the results were similar, we have reported results with POPC in order to be able to compare with the other studies. These complexes were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of peptide solution to POPC multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). The MLVs were prepared by dissolving a known amount of lipid in chloroform and slowly removing the solvent by evaporation under a thin stream of nitrogen. Residual solvent was removed by storing the lipid film under vacuum overnight. An appropriate volume of buffer was added to hydrate the thin lipid film, which was then vortexed. The lipid-peptide complexes were prepared by adding the required volume of peptide solutions to give the desired lipid to peptide molar ratio. CD measurements were also done in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. The program CD Spectra Deconvolution (CDNN), version 2.1, was used to calculate the secondary structure content (28Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Right Angle Light Scattering Measurements—Association of these peptides with POPC was determined by following the dissolution of POPC MLVs by right angle light scattering using an SLM 8000C photon counting spectrofluorometer as described (29Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Datta G. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Adeyeye S.O. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10313-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). POPC MLVs were prepared by evaporating a solution of POPC (Avanti Polar) under nitrogen and hydrating the lipid film with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The sample containing 105 μm POPC and an equimolar amount of peptide was maintained at 25 °C and continuously stirred. Turbidity clarification was monitored at 400 nm for 30 min. Complete dissolution of POPC vesicles was achieved by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1 mm. Surface Pressure Measurements—Monolayer exclusion pressure measurements give the affinity of the peptides for a lipid-water interface. The procedure of Phillips and Krebs (30Phillips M.C. Krebs K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Ibdah J.A. Krebs K.E. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was followed using egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) as per their procedure. An insoluble monolayer of EPC was spread at the air-water interface in a Teflon dish at room temperature to give an initial surface pressure (πi) in the range of 5–45 micronewtons/m. A solution of peptides in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 m guanidinium chloride was carefully injected in to the subphase to give a final concentration of 50 μg/dl. The guanidinium chloride was diluted in the subphase to a final concentration of ≤1 mm to allow the peptides to renature. The subphase was stirred continuously, and the increase in EPC monolayer surface pressure (Δπ) was recorded until a steady state value was obtained. The value of the initial surface pressure (πi) at which the peptides no longer penetrate the EPC monolayer (i.e. the exclusion pressure (πe)) was calculated by extrapolating the πi versus Δπ linear regression fit to Δπ = 0 micronewtons/m. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence spectra of both peptide and peptide-lipid complexes were recorded at room temperature with excitation at 295 nm using a SPF-500 spectrofluorometer. These studies were done using DMPC as the lipid of choice in order to compare them with earlier published results of other peptides (17Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative fluorescence intensity was measured in ratio mode that corrects for time dependent fluctuations in lamp intensity. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by potassium iodide and acrylamide was determined by adding aliquots of stock solutions of potassium iodide (4 m) and acrylamide (4 m) to a 2.7-ml solution of either peptide or peptide-lipid complexes (32Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7185-7191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of potassium iodide contained 1 mm sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) to prevent the formation of I3−. Inner filter corrections were applied for acrylamide quenching (32Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7185-7191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Emission spectra were taken after each addition, and emission intensity at λmax was determined. Peak emission intensity was used for all calculations. The quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation, F0/F=1+Ksv[Q] Eq. 1 where F0 and F represent the fluorescence in the absence and presence of the quencher, and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant. Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—Lipid films were made by dissolving appropriate amounts of lipid in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1 (v/v)) and dried in a test tube under nitrogen to deposit the lipid as a thin film on the wall of the tube. Final traces of solvent were removed in a vacuum chamber attached to a liquid nitrogen trap for 2–3 h. Dried films were kept under argon gas at -30 °C if not used immediately. Films were hydrated with buffer, vortexed extensively at room temperature, and then subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing. The homogeneous lipid suspensions were then further processed by 10 passes through two stacked 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore Filtration Products, Pleasanton, CA) in a barrel extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC) at room temperature. LUVs were kept on ice and used within a few hours of preparation. Lipid phosphorus was determined by the method of Ames (33Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy Studies with DPH-PC—Peptide solutions were prepared in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm against buffer as reference. Films containing POPC/DPH-PC (400:1) were prepared from a solution in chloroform/methanol (2:1). The film was hydrated in buffer. 100-nm diameter LUVs were then made by extrusion as described previously. Fluorescence was measured in quartz cuvettes at 37 °C, in an SLM Aminco Bowman Series II spectrofluorometer, with an excitation of 355 nm and slits set to 4-nm bandwidth in both excitation and emission. The fluorescence emission of 2 ml of 50 μm LUVs in the same buffer was recorded. Then small aliquots of a peptide solution, also in the corresponding buffer, were added successively, and the fluorescence emission was recorded after each addition. The emission maximum was found at 431 nm. Red Edge Excitation Shift (REES)—The emission spectra of tryptophan were measured at 25 °C in an SLM Aminco Bowman Series II luminescence spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was varied every 5 nm between 280 and 310 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded over 310–350 nm three times and averaged. Measurements were done in quartz cuvettes containing 2 ml of buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.14 m NaF, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Aliquots of solutions of peptides in buffer were added to the cuvette to a final concentration of 10 μm. Measurements were repeated with the addition of 100 μm EPC LUVs. To reduce scattered light intensity, excitation polarization was set to 90° and emission to 0°, with 4-nm bandwidth. Spectra were corrected for instrumental factors, and controls were subtracted. Peak emission wavelengths were recorded. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed as previously described (18Anantharamaiah G.M. Datta G. Garber D.W. Current Sci. 2001; 81: 53-65Google Scholar) using one-way analysis of variance, and significance was defined as p < 0.05. Post hoc Tukey tests were performed. Peptides were compared with base line and with each other. Removal of Hydroperoxides from LDL and Inhibition of PAPC + HPODE-induced Monocyte Chemotaxis—We previously reported that the anti-inflammatory properties of these peptides correlate well with their ability to scavenge seeding molecules from the LDL surface, inhibiting LDL-induced monocyte chemotaxis (6Navab M.

https://openalex.org/W1978103068,"Deregulation of c-myc expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neoplasias. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) can increase the rate of c-myc transcription through the recruitment of a variety of cofactors to the promoter, yet the precise roles of these cofactors in transcription and tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We show here that a putative tumor suppressor TIP30, also called CC3 or Htatip2, interacts with an ERα-interacting coactivator CIA. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that TIP30 and CIA are distinct cofactors that are dynamically associated with the promoter and downstream regions of the c-myc gene in response to estrogen. Both TIP30 and CIA are recruited to the c-myc gene promoter by liganded ERα in the second transcription cycle. TIP30 overexpression represses ERα-mediated c-myc transcription, whereas TIP30 deficiency enhances c-myc transcription in both the absence and presence of estrogen. Ectopic CIA cooperates with TIP30 to repress ERα-mediated c-myc transcription. Moreover, virgin TIP30 knockout mice exhibit increased c-myc expression in mammary glands. Together, these results reveal an important role for TIP30 in the regulation of ERα-mediated c-myc transcription and suggest a mechanism for tumorigenesis promoted by TIP30 deficiency.

ERα, like many other nuclear receptors, contains two intrinsic transcriptional activation domains, designated AF-1 and AF-2 (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blum-berg B.

The function of AF-1 is estrogen-independent, whereas the activity of AF-2 is estrogen-dependent. AF-1 and AF-2 activities show promoter context and cell type specificity and can act synergistically to activate transcription (5Nilsson S. Makela S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E. Pettersson K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1535-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which ERα regulates gene expression are still not clearly defined, there is solid evidence suggesting that ERα executes its effects by directing cyclical and combinatorial recruitment of cofactors on promoters (13Burakov D.

Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Most ERα-interacting coactivators identified thus far are also able to interact with many other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and have generalized functions, hence affecting transcriptional activation mediated by a wide spectrum of nuclear receptors (17Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 18Freedman L.P. Trends Endocrinol.

Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) identified a novel nuclear receptor coactivator, called CIA (coactivator independent of AF-2 function). CIA was shown to interact with ERα and ERβ in a ligand-dependent manner but not with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Consistent with its binding specificity, CIA was found to potentiate transcriptional activation by the ER but not by other nuclear receptors (22Sauve F. McBroom L.D. Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which CIA enhances transcription remains unknown. CIA may represent a novel class of ligand-dependent ER coactivators that are independent of AF-2 function. We previously purified a protein, TIP30 (Tat-interacting protein 30) that interacts specifically with the activation domain of Tat (23Xiao H. Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TIP30 is identical to CC3, which is absent in highly metastatic human small cell lung carcinoma (24Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TIP30/CC3 has been proposed to function as a metastasis suppressor via its ability to promote apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis (24Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25NicAmhlaoibh R. Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Whitman S. Wang X.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic expression of TIP30 was found to elevate the expression of a subset of proapoptotic genes (27Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and angiogenic inhibitors and to down-regulate the expression of certain angiogenic stimulators (25NicAmhlaoibh R. Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of one or both alleles of Tip30 results in spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinomas and other tumors in mice at a relatively long latency (28Ito M. Jiang C. Krumm K. Zhang X. Pecha J. Zhao J. Guo Y. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8763-8767PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced expression of TIP30 is observed in 33% of human hepatocellular carcinomas, and mutations in the Tip30 gene that caused the instability or abnormal cellular distributions of the TIP30 protein were identified in some of the human hepatocellular carcinoma specimens (28Ito M. Jiang C. Krumm K. Zhang X. Pecha J. Zhao J. Guo Y. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8763-8767PubMed Google Scholar). These data further suggest that TIP30 is a tumor suppressor. In this study, we describe the cloning and characterization of a TIP30-interacting protein identical to CIA and provide evidence that TIP30 is an important regulator of ERα-mediated c-myc transcription. This study defines a new pathway for regulating expression of the c-myc gene and possibly other ERα target genes that are involved in tumoriogenesis. Protein Purification and Chromatography—The HeLa cell line (HeLa-fTIP30) stably expressing FLAG-tagged TIP30 was obtained by the introduction of pCIN4-FLAG-tagged TIP30 into HeLa S3 and selection in a G418-containing medium (27Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. During purification procedures, HEPES-HCl, pH 7.9, was used in buffers instead of Tris-HCl. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in a low salt buffer containing sulfosuccinimidylpropionate (Pierce), transferred to a homogenizer, and mixed with six strokes of a loose pestle. The suspensions were then transferred to glass beakers and dispersed with a stirring bar. The high salt buffer was slowly added into the mixtures. The cross-linking reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and then stopped by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 20 mm. The extracts were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 min and stored at -80 °C. For coimmunoprecipitation, 100 ml of nuclear extract prepared from the HeLa-f:TIP30 cells was mixed with 200 μl of anti-FLAG epitope immunoaffinity matrix M2 (Sigma) in BC450 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.45 m KCl. The matrix was washed extensively with BC500 plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 m KCl and eluted with 1 ml of BC1000 containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide and 1 m KCl. The eluted proteins were concentrated and resolved on SDS-PAGE and stained with silver or Coomassie Blue. The indicated bands were excised from the gel and digested with endoproteinase C. The resulting peptides were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and subjected to microsequencing analysis (Core Facility, Rockefeller University). Affinity chromatography was carried out as described previously (23Xiao H. Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cloning of the CIA Gene—An expressed sequence tag clone (DKFZp434J208) was initially identified by data base search using two peptides (NMPQADAMVLVAR and DLRDFR) from amino acid sequencing and peptide mass data from mass spectrophotometer analysis of a TIP30-interacting protein (65 kDa). The expressed sequence tag clones (IMAGE: 1185534 and 1335209), containing similar cDNA sequences, were identified and purchased from ATCC and sequenced. Primers were designed for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCRs according to the sequence of the insert cDNA. The HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) was used as a template for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE. The experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction (Clontech). The resulting DNA fragments were subcloned into a pCR2.1 vector by PCR kits (Invitrogen). Several cDNA fragments were amplified and sequenced by the core facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the resulting sequences were used for searching the expressed sequence tag clones and known genes in GenBank™. The 856-bp cDNA containing the translational start codon was amplified using PCR primers (primary primer, 5′-ATCTCTACTATGTGTGTGGTCCCG; nest primer, 5′-CAAGTCTCGGGGGTCTCGAATGTC). The pCR2.1-CIA containing full-length CIA cDNA was constructed by sub-cloning a PCR-amplified cDNA from the HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) using specific primers (forward, 5′-GGAAGATCTATGAATACGGCTCCATCAAGACCCAGC; reverse, 5′-GGAAGATCTCAGTAATGCCTCTGGTAAGATCCCAT). Plasmids and Antibodies—The pcDNA3.1-CIA plasmid was generated by inserting the CIA cDNA, excised from pCR2.1-CIA with BglII, into pcDNA3.1 at the BamHI site. For antibody production, the bacterial expression plasmid pREST-his-CIA was generated by inserting a BglII-DNA fragment released from pCR2.1-CIA into pRSET-B (Invitrogen). The recombinant His tag CIA protein was expressed in bacteria, purified as described previously, and used to generate rabbit anti-CIA antibodies (Covance Inc., Denver, PA). The pGL3-hu-Myc plasmid containing the human c-myc promoter was constructed by subcloning a 2540-bp HindIII-DNA fragment excised from pSV40CAT-hu-Myc plasmid (a gift from David Bentley, University of Colorado Health Science Center) into pGL3-basic vector (Promega) at the HindIII site. This DNA fragment extends 2.3 kb 5′ of the P1 start site to a Nae1 site at +50 relative to the P2 start site. Antigen-purified anti-TIP30 (23Xiao H. Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and anti-CIA antibodies were purified as described previously (30Xiao H. Tao Y. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3937-3940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Anti-ERα (HC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CBP (A22, Santa Cruz Bio-technology), and anti-RNA polymerase II (8WG16) antibodies were used for ChIP assays. Mice and MEFs—Generation of TIP30 null mice and MEFs was described previously (28Ito M. Jiang C. Krumm K. Zhang X. Pecha J. Zhao J. Guo Y. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8763-8767PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic backgrounds of Tip30+/+ and Tip30-/- mice were regarded to be identical because they were back-crossed 10 times with C57BL6J mice. MEF clones of each genotype were prepared from sibling embryos obtained by a heterozygous crossing. All animal experimentation was performed according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays were performed as described previously (22Sauve F. McBroom L.D. Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled CIA and Bax proteins were generated by in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Fusion proteins were induced in DH5α Escherichia coli with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were sonicated 10 times using 30-s pulses in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cleared lysates were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein-saturated beads were washed three times in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 1 m NaCl and stored in BC100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). 20 μl of GST or GST-TIP30 beads were incubated with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in 10 μl of BC135 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 135 mm KCl) for 2 h at 4 °C. The binding reaction mixture was washed three times in BC135 buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of fixed and dried gels. ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (15Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were treated with or without 10-8m E2 for 45 min and with formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to DNA. Soluble chromatin was prepared and immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose and then immunoprecipitated with anti-CIA, anti-TIP30 serum, or control anti-ERα, anti-CBP, and anti-RNA polymerase II antibodies. The final DNA preparations were amplified using a pair of primers and analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel following ethidium bromide stain. Transient Transfection—Transfection assays were performed as described previously (26Whitman S. Wang X. Shalaby R. Shtivelman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells in 24-well dishes or MEFs in 6-well dishes were transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). In all experiments, a plasmid pRL-CMV for expressing Renilla luciferase was used as a control for transfection efficiency, and activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured with Promega's dual luciferase reporter assay system, normalized, and expressed as relative luciferase light units. The vector pCMV-ERα for expressing human ERα and vector pNT7-TRα for human thyroid receptor α (TRα) were described previously (31Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). TRE-luciferase reporter was described previously (31Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Gal-RXR expressing vector and Gal-luciferase reporter were described previously (19Ito M. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3464-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Mammary gland 4 was removed and fixed with 10% buffered-formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxilin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry staining, unstained sections were rehydrated and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and staining was developed using VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then counter-stained with hematoxilin and eosin. The number of Myc nuclear positive epithelial cells was divided by the total number of epithelial cells counted. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—The abundance of c-myc mRNA in the tissue was studied by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using β-actin mRNA as control. Total RNA was isolated from mammary glands of 8-week-old virgin mice using Trizol reagent. 2 μg of DNA-free total RNA was reverse transcripted into cDNA using oligo(dT)12-18 and Super-Script II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The same amounts of resulting cDNA were used for PCR amplification. The primers used for PCR and their sequences are as follows: c-myc: sense, 5′-ATTGAGCCAAATCTTAAGTTGTGA, and antisense, 5′-TTTGGAGTGAGCAGGGGACTGGCA; β-actin: sense, 5′-CACCCTGTGCTGCTCACCGAGGCC, and antisense, 5′-CCACACAGAGTACTTGCGCTCAGG; and cyclin B1: sense, 5′-ACCTACAGGGTCGTGAAGTGACTGGAAAC, and antisense, 5′-TGAGAATCTTCATCTCCATCTGTCTG. The PCR product was analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel following ethidium bromide stain. Identification of a TIP30-interacting Protein and Cloning Its Full-length Cognate cDNA—The discovery of roles of TIP30 in the control of expression of genes involved in apoptosis and angiogenesis indicates that TIP30 may interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. To identify and affinity purify cellular proteins that interact with TIP30, we first established HeLa cell lines that stably expressed FLAG-tagged wild type TIP30. After preparation of nuclei from these cells, nuclear proteins were cross-linked by mixing the nuclei with the water-soluble cross-linker sulfosuccinimidylpropionate. Sulfosuccinimidylpropionate-treated nuclear extracts were made and subjected to affinity purification with anti-FLAG M2 beads. The bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after cleaving the cross-linker. As shown in Fig. 1A, three proteins were coimmunopurified with TIP30 and designated TIP30-interacting proteins. These three proteins were not immunoprecipitated with control anti-hemagglutinin beads. Amino acid sequencing of one of these interacting proteins (65 kDa), designated TIP30-interacting protein 1 (TIPIF-1), yielded two peptide sequences (NMPQADAMVLVAR and DLRDFR). A HeLa cell-derived 2.2-kb cDNA encoding TIPIF-1 was cloned and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AF470686). Sequence analysis revealed that it encodes a 587-amino acid protein with a tract of Arg-Asp residues in the amino-terminal region. The repeat Arg-Asp residues were previously identified in the splicing factor U1 70K and the RD protein, a component of the negative elongation factor NELF (32Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). TIPIF-1 also contains a receptor-binding motif known as the LXXLL motif (33Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 34Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and seven repeats of a short sequence motif (RDLRD(H/F)R) that is present in subunit 10 of mouse translation initiation factor 3. Following cloning of the TIPIF-1 cDNA, a data base search revealed identity with the estrogen receptor coactivator CIA (22Sauve F. McBroom L.D. Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reported CIA cDNA, which was isolated from a human fetal kidney cDNA library, contains a 620-residue open reading frame lacking a translational stop codon at the 5′ end. In contrast, the open reading frame in our TIFIF-1 cDNA starts at a methionine residue located immediately after two in-frame stop codons, indicating that it encodes a full-length CIA. The sequence discrepancy in the 5′-untranslated region between TIPIF-1 and CIA may be due to alternative splicing products in HeLa and kidney cells, because the cDNA encoding CIA was cloned from the human fetal kidney cDNA library (22Sauve F. McBroom L.D. Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We now refer to TIPIF-1 as CIA. To ascertain whether CIA interacts with TIP30, we tested the binding of TIP30 from nuclear extracts to a GST-CIA fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, TIP30 was detected in the eluate from the GST-CIA affinity column but not in the eluate from the control GST column. In addition, we also tested the binding of in vitro translated CIA to GST-TIP30 using a pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, CIA bound GST-TIP30 but not GST control protein. By contrast, BAX protein, a pro-apoptotic protein used as a negative control was not bound by GST-TIP30. Collectively, these results indicate that CIA interacts with TIP30. Estrogen Regulates TIP30 and CIA Occupancy of the c-myc Gene in Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells—Transcription of the c-myc gene is controlled by transcription factors that interact with numerous positive and negative regulatory elements in the c-myc promoter regions (35Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 12-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ERα can stimulate c-myc transcription by interacting with an estrogen-responsive element of the c-myc promoter (8Dubik D. Shiu R.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1587-1594PubMed Google Scholar). Using ChIP assays, a previous study has established that a number of ERα-interacting coactivators are recruited to the promoters of endogenous estrogen-responsive target genes, including c-myc, following estrogen treatment (15Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). If CIA and TIP30 are specific cofactors for ERα, they might also be associated with ERα on endogenous estrogen-responsive target genes. To test this possibility, we used the same ChIP assay (15Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) to determine whether CIA and/or TIP30 is recruited to the promoter of the c-myc gene in the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Fig. 2B shows that, as previously reported, the anti-ERα antibody precipitated a c-myc promoter fragment containing P1 and P2 promoters in the presence (lane 6) but not in the absence (lane 5) of E2. In contrast, the c-myc promoter was precipitated by anti-TIP30 antibody (lane 3) but much less so by anti-CIA antibody (lane 1) in the absence of E2. E2 increased the association of CIA (lane 2) but diminished the association of TIP30 (lane 4) with the same DNA region. Because previous studies demonstrated that ERα and coactivators (AIB1, p300, CBP, pCAF, and TRAP220) are assembled on the promoter during preinitiation but subsequently released during elongation (15Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), we next determined whether CIA and TIP30 occupy the c-myc gene during elongation. Four pairs of primers covering a region (+2196 to +2628) in exon 2 and a region (+4330 to +4685) in exon 3 were used for PCR amplification of the final DNA preparations. Binding of both TIP30 and CIA to these regions was observed in the absence of E2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3). E2 induction resulted in increased CIA binding (lanes 1 versus 2) but decreased TIP30 binding (lanes 3 versus 4) to these regions. As a positive control, binding of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II to the regions upstream and downstream of the initiation site was also observed in both the absence and presence of E2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 9 and 10). These results suggest that estrogen increases association of CIA with the coding regions of c-myc. To assess the specificity of association of TIP30 and CIA with the c-myc gene, we examined whether TIP30 and CIA were assembled on the promoter of the cyclin B1 gene that is not directly regulated by ERα (21Freedman L.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 70: 475-501Google Scholar). As expected, RNA polymerase II is associated with the promoter (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10), but ERα is not (Lanes 7 and 8). However, ERα, TIP30, and CIA were not associated with the promoter in either the presence or the absence of E2 (Lanes 3-6). In addition, nonspecific antibodies from a preimmune rabbit serum did not precipitate the DNA elements of the c-myc gene (Fig. 2D). The protein levels of TIP30 and CIA in"
https://openalex.org/W1969703616,"A critical role for the conserved α-integrin cytoplasmic motif, KVGFFKR, is recognized in the regulation of activation of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. To understand the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, we sought to determine the nature of the protein interactions with this cytoplasmic motif. We used a tagged synthetic peptide, biotin-KVGFFKR, to probe a high density protein expression array (37,200 recombinant human proteins) for high affinity interactions. A number of potential integrin-binding proteins were identified. One such protein, a chloride channel regulatory protein, ICln, was characterized further because its affinity for the integrin peptide was highest as was its expression in platelets. We verified the presence of ICln in human platelets by PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry, and its co-association with αIIbβ3 by surface plasmon resonance. The affinity of this interaction was 82.2 ± 24.4 nm in a cell free assay. ICln co-immunoprecipitates with αIIbβ3 in platelet lysates demonstrating that this interaction is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, immobilized KVGFFKR peptides, but not control KAAAAAR peptides, specifically extract ICln from platelet lysates. Acyclovir (100 μm to 5 mm), a pharmacological inhibitor of the ICln chloride channel, specifically inhibits integrin activation (PAC-1 expression) and platelet aggregation without affecting CD62 P expression confirming a specific role for ICln in integrin activation. In parallel, a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the potential integrin-recognition domain on ICln (AKFEEE, 10–100 μm) also inhibits platelet function. Thus, we have identified, verified, and characterized a novel functional interaction between the platelet integrin and ICln, in the platelet membrane.

We verified the presence of ICln in human platelets by PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry, and its co-association with αIIbβ3 by surface plasmon resonance. The affinity of this interaction was 82.2 ± 24.4 nm in a cell free assay. ICln co-immunoprecipitates with αIIbβ3 in platelet lysates demonstrating that this interaction is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, immobilized KVGFFKR peptides, but not control KAAAAAR peptides, specifically extract ICln from platelet lysates. Acyclovir (100 μm to 5 mm), a pharmacological inhibitor of the ICln chloride channel, specifically inhibits integrin activation (PAC-1 expression) and platelet aggregation without affecting CD62 P expression confirming a specific role for ICln in integrin activation. In parallel, a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the potential integrin-recognition domain on ICln (AKFEEE, 10–100 μm) also inhibits platelet function. Thus, we have identified, verified, and characterized a novel functional interaction between the platelet integrin and ICln, in the platelet membrane. Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules composed of α- and β-subunits that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and coordinate bi-directional signaling events across a cell membrane. The platelet-specific integrin αIIbβ3 is the most studied of all integrins and serves as a model for exploring integrin activation and ligand interactions. Integrin ligands bind preferentially to the activated integrin conformation. However, an understanding of integrin activation mechanisms has only recently been elaborated. Activation of αIIbβ3 in response to cellular stimulation involves a conformational change in the large extracellular components of the integrin, possibly coordinated by the endogenous thiol-isomerase activity of the β-subunit (1O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36984-36990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the role of the short integrin cytoplasmic domains has been the focus of much research into the molecular mechanisms of this integrin activation. Deletion or mutation of the highly conserved, membrane-adjacent KXGFFKR motif in α-integrins results in constitutive integrin activation (2Peter K. Bode C. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 27: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others have shown that addition of exogenous cell-permeable peptides corresponding to this sequence, KVGFFKR or KLGFFKR, directly activates integrins αIIbβ3 or α2β1, respectively (4Stephens G. O'Luanaigh N. Reilly D. Harriott P. Walker B. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20317-20322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z. Leisner T.M. Parise L.V. Blood. 2003; 102: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus this sequence plays a critical role in regulation of the activation state of the integrin. Similarly, removal or mutation of the corresponding sequence on the integrin β-cytoplasmic tail can modulate integrin activation state (6Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H.

Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the membrane-adjacent cytoplasmic regions of the integrin α- and β-subunits form a salt bridge that facilitates their interaction in resting integrins (8Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Cellular activation alters the dynamics of this interaction and results in a dissociation of the two tails. This is probably mediated by a talin wedge that physically separates the two tails (9Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the cytosolic stimulus that initiates integrin activation following cellular activation is not understood. Because the integrin tails have no intrinsic enzymatic activity, they are believed to dynamically recruit signaling molecules to regulate their activation state. Many integrin-binding cytosolic proteins have been identified and can be broadly divided into structural, cytoskeletal proteins such as talin (10Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) or α-actinin (11Cattelino A. Albertinazzi C. Bossi M. Critchley D.R. de Curtis I. Mol. Biol.

Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and CD153 (15Fitter S. Sincock P.M. Jolliffe C.N. Ashman L.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). New integrin-binding proteins are continuously being identified (16Kato A. Kawamata N. Tamayose K. Egashira M. Miura R. Fujimura T. Murayama K. K. O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28934-28941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the precise molecular mechanisms by which they regulate integrin activation remain unknown. Although not generally associated with the regulation of ion channels, integrins have recently been identified as playing a role in osmoregulation and regulation of ion movement across cell membranes. A number of groups have demonstrated that integrins regulate potassium, calcium, or chloride fluxes either indirectly (17Haussinger D. Kurz A. Wettstein M. Graf D. Vom Dahl S. Schliess F.

Vitronectin, but not fibrinonectin or laminin, selectively affects potassium currents in an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence-dependent manner in developing mouse hippocampal neurons (29Vasilyev D. Barish M. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, ligand binding to integrins or integrin clustering modulates potassium currents, leading to hyperpolarization of monocytes and enhanced Ca2+ influx (30Colden-Stanfield M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C990-C1000Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Integrin co-localization with ion channels has been observed in LOX tumor cells where β1-integrins associate laterally with potassium channels during adhesion contributing to the regulation of integrin function in these cells (31Artym V. Petty H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Co-localization of β1-integrins with the α-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, the epithelial sodium channel, and the voltage-activated calcium channel has also been shown (23Shakibaei M. Mobasheri A. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). However, indirect evidence for integrin modulation of specific chloride ion currents comes from studies that demonstrate that conformational change of β2-integrins in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is inhibited by hypertonic saline (32Thiel M. Buessecker F. Eberhardt K. Chouker A. Setzer F. Kreimeier U. Arfors K. Peter K. Messmer K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 261-273PubMed Google Scholar) and is dependent on altered chloride fluxes in these cells (33Menegazzi R. Busetto S. Cramer R. Dri P. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, CLCA (chloride channel, calcium activatable) protein has been identified as ligands for β4-integrins facilitating tumor metastasis. This interaction involves transcellular contacts of extracellular sites on both proteins, and it is not clear if binding activates the channel function (34Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Elble R.C. Lin H. DiBiasio J. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49406-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus a substantial amount of recent evidence supports an active role for integrins in the regulation of numerous ion channel proteins in active cells. ICln is a 42-kDa multifunctional protein that is essential for cell volume regulation. 1BD Transduction Laboratories, pICln data sheet, available at www.bdbioscience.com (2001).1BD Transduction Laboratories, pICln data sheet, available at www.bdbioscience.com (2001). It is believed to form a homodimeric chloride channel (36Furst J. Jakab M. Konig M. Ritter M. Gschwentner M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Mayer M. Burtscher C.M. Schirmer J. Maier B. Nairz M. Chwatal S. Paulmichl M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, hydrophobicity analysis indicates that ICln lacks the transmembrane helices necessary for channel-pore formation by most vertebrates. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it mediates a nucleotide-sensitive outwardly rectifying chloride channel closely resembling the biophysical properties of swelling-dependent chloride channels involved in regulation of cell volume decrease after cell swelling (36Furst J. Jakab M. Konig M. Ritter M. Gschwentner M. Rudzki J. Danzl J. Mayer M. Burtscher C.M. Schirmer J. Maier B. Nairz M. Chwatal S. Paulmichl M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is found in the cytosol in cells-at-rest but is associated with the cell membrane following a hypotonic challenge. Thus, physiological cell swelling stimulates cytosol to membrane transposition of ICln (21Browe D.M. Baumgarten C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, controversy arises over this hypothesis (38Emma F. Breton S. Morrison R. Wright S. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1545-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconstitution of recombinant ICln into lipid bilayers yields a cationic permeability (39Furst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Botta G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus its exact role as a chloride channel is somewhat controversial (40d'Anglemont de Tassigny A. Souktani R. Ghaleh B. Henry P. Berdeaux A. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2003; 17: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It may, however, act as a channel facilitator or regulator (41Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study, we have searched for novel integrin cytoplasmic binding partners by screening a large human recombinant expression library for specific interactions with a tagged synthetic peptide, biotin-KVGFFKR, corresponding to an integrin motif known to critically regulate the integrin conformational state (42Moran N. Reilly D. Harriott P. Deering A. J. Thrombosis Hemostasis. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Our results highlighted an interaction with the chloride channel protein ICln. We confirm the presence of ICln in human platelets and verify an association between ICln and αIIbβ3. Pharmacological modulators of ICln function specifically to modify integrin-mediated platelet responses, verifying a physiological role for ICln in platelet activation events. Because ICln is thought to have many functional roles, we propose that one such role is in the regulation of the specific platelet integrin αIIbβ3 through the KVGFFKR motif. In addition, a novel synthetic peptide, identified as a potential integrin-recognition domain on ICln, specifically inhibits platelet function. Thus we have identified and verified a novel platelet integrin-binding protein that plays a role in the regulation of integrin activation and platelet function. High Density Arrays of Escherichia coli-expressed Proteins—Protein arrays were generated from the hEx1 library, a redundant human fetal brain protein expression cDNA library subcloned into pQE-30NST (accession no. AF074376) in E. coli strain SCS-1, which permits IPTG 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MGC, a hypothetical protein; ICln, Homo sapiens nucleotide-sensitive chloride channel (CLNS1a, P54105); CIB, calcium integrin-binding protein; CD62P, P-selectin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; RT, reverse transcription;-inducible expression of His6-tagged fusion proteins directly on a membrane (43Lueking A.

Lehrach H. Walter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5007-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The arrays consist of 2 PVDF membranes (22.2 × 22.2 cm, Millipore) containing a total of 37,200 clones arrayed in duplicate in a 5 × 5 pattern. The membranes are incubated overnight on 2YT agar (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, and 2% glucose), and recombinant protein expression is induced on 2YT agar containing 1 mm IPTG for 3–4 h. Next, the membranes are transferred onto pre-soaked blotting paper (Whatman 3MM) with denaturing solution (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl) for 10 min to lyse the bacterial cells, followed by 5-min incubation in neutralizing solution (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl) and 15 min in 2× SSC. The filters are air-dried and stored at room temperature. Peptide Screening of Protein Arrays—Prior to screening, the dried colonies are removed from the membranes with tissue paper and TB-STT (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% Triton X-100). The protein array filters were incubated with 100 μm biotin-labeled KVGFFKR or KAAAAAR peptide in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) for 3 h, followed by three 5-min washes in TBST at 4 °C. Bound peptide was detected using a Cy3-labeled anti-biotin antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized on a Typhoon 9600 imager. Clones bound by the peptide were identified using VisualGrid software (GPC Biotech) and sequenced to confirm their identity. Protein Expression and Purification—The E. coli clones expressing the recombinant His-tagged proteins were grown in liquid cultures in the presence of 1 mm IPTG. Bacteria were lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle and incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mg/ml lysozyme 0.6 mg/ml RNase, and 0.6 mg/ml DNase) per gram of wet weight, overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were then purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (100 μl/ml lysate). The purification of the proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE. Dot Blot Verification of Protein-Peptide Interactions—The 19 proteins were dot-blotted in four serial dilutions corresponding to 0.1–5 pmol per spot. Specific binding of Biotin-KVGFFKR, and a control peptide Biotin-KAAAAAR, was determined as above with an α-biotin secondary antibody (1:25,000). CIB (gift of Dr. Nelly Kieffer, Luxembourg) was used as a positive control, to ascertain the efficiency of the peptide interactions. Antibody detection was analyzed with SuperSignal according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). RNA Isolation and Purification from Platelets—1 ml of Tri reagent was added to 108 platelets from a highly purified platelet preparation (45McRedmond J.P. Park S.D. Reilly D.F. Coppinger J.A. Maguire P.B. Shields D.C. Fitzgerald D.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and allowed to lyse on ice for 15 min to 1 h. 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane (Sigma) was then added (0.1 ml/ml Tri reagent), and samples were shaken vigorously for 15 s then allowed to stand for 15 min. Platelets were then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was removed, avoiding the middle phase containing any genomic or mitochondrial DNA. 0.5 ml of isopropanol was added per milliliter of Tri reagent, and samples were mixed and allowed to stand for 15 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol per milliliter of Tri reagent. RNA was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was allowed to air dry then was resuspended in PCR-grade water (Sigma), and concentration and quality were assessed using a spectrophotometer where the 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratio was 1.9:2.0. ICln RT-PCR from Platelet RNA—The purification of the platelet RNA was verified as previously described (45McRedmond J.P. Park S.D. Reilly D.F. Coppinger J.A. Maguire P.B. Shields D.C. Fitzgerald D.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Platelet RNA (1 μg) was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min and incubated at 37 °C overnight in the presence of 1× reverse transcription buffer, 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 25 μm deoxycholate triphosphates (dNTPs), and 1 μl of random hexamers in a final volume of 8 μl. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. A final assay volume of 50 μl containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm dNTPs, 10 pmol/μl of each sense ICln (5′-GAAGACAGTGATGATGATGTTGAACC-3′) and antisense primer ICln (5′-TTCCACATCATATTCTTCTCCATCGTA-3′), 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), and 4 μl of cDNA. The reaction cycles were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Real-time binding and kinetic analyses were performed at the University of Reading on a BIAcore 3000 biosensor system (Amersham Biosciences Biosensor AB) using surface plasmon resonance measurements. Purified αIIbβ3 (1 μm, Calbiochem) was immobilized on carboxymethylated sensor chips (type CM5) in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.0 as described by the supplier. Control flow cells were activated and blocked in the absence of integrin. Binding was evaluated over a range of recombinant ICln concentrations (0.625 μm to 10 μm) in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.05% Surfactant p20, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin under a continuous flow of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. 30 μl of ICln-containing solutions were flowed over the surface of the chip for 2 min. Binding of ICln to αIIbβ3-immobilized flow cells was corrected for binding to control flow cells. Flow cells were regenerated with running buffer, following removal of ICln from αIIbβ3 using glycine pH 1.5. Binding data were fitted using BIAevaluation version 3.1 software (BIAcore). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems automated peptide synthesizer (model 432A, Norwalk, CT) using a standard solid-phase Fmoc (n-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedure, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and masses were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Bruker Reflex III). Biotinylated KVGFFKR peptide and control biotin-KAAAAAR peptides were synthesized with two biotin moieties attached to each motif separated by a hexanoic acid spacer. Cell-permeable palmitoylated peptides (-AKFEEE, -LEFEEE, -ELFNDG, and -KVGFFKR) were synthesized in an identical manner, except no spacer was used. Platelet Function—Gel-filtered platelets were prepared as previously described (1O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol.

Platelet aggregation assays were performed as described using 0.1 unit/ml thrombin or 10 μm U46619, a thromboxane mimetic. Immunoprecipitations and KVGFFKR Pull-down—Platelet lysates were prepared as described previously (1O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol.

Aliquots of platelet lysates were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to ICln (1 μg, Clone 32, BD Transduction laboratories) or a control IgG overnight, then immunoprecipitated with blocked protein-G-Sepharose beads for 3 h, washed extensively in ice-cold buffers. Proteins binding to the beads were removed by boiling in 1× (2% SDS, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.0004% bromphenol blue) sample buffer, and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE before being transferred to PVDF membranes and Western-blotted with SZ22, an antibody detecting αIIb. Peptide pull-down assays were performed in an identical manner using a biotinylated KVGFFKR peptide (350 μm), a control biotinylated KAAAAAR peptide (350 μm), and 40 μl of NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce). All steps and buffers were carried out at 4 °C. Flow Cytometry of PAC-1 and CD62P—Gel-filtered platelet aliquots of 50 × 103/μl were pre-treated with acyclovir (up to 5 mm) or Me2SO vehicle control (up to 0.5%) for 1 min before activation with 1 unit/ml thrombin, or 10 μm U46619 for 3 min at 37 °C. Platelets were then incubated for 10 min in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-PAC-1 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-CD62P (10 μl, Molecular Probes) and fixed in 0.1% formaldehyde. A methanol vehicle control was used for the AKFEEE and ELFNDG peptides. Platelet-associated fluorescence was estimated on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Immunohistochemistry—Gel-filtered platelets (50 × 103/μl) were adhered to fibrinogen (20 μg/ml)-coated slides at 37 °C for the indicated times. Slides were fixed and permeabilized in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Using the Zenon Technology kit (Molecular Probes) for monoclonal antibodies, the ICln (BD Transduction Laboratories) and the SZ22 (Immunotech) antibodies were directly labeled prior to use. The platelets were probed simultaneously for ICln and αIIbβ3 or stained for polymerized actin using Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in the platelet time course.

KVGFFKR-specific Binding Proteins Identified from High Density Protein Arrays of Human Recombinant Proteins—We have previously established that the conserved amino acid sequence KVGFFKR, immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the platelet αIIb integrin subunit, plays a critical role in the regulation of integrin activation (4Stephens G.

Harriott P. Deering A. J. Thrombosis Hemostasis. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). To identify the protein-protein interactions responsible for this regulation, we synthesized a biotin-tagged peptide corresponding to this sequence and used it as a probe to identify high affinity protein interactions dependent on this motif. From a high content, high density protein array derived from a redundant human brain cDNA expression library (37,200 clones) (43Lueking A. Horn M. Eickhoff H. Bussow K. Lehrach H. Walter G. Anal.

Nineteen clones, corresponding to thirteen different proteins, bound significantly and specifically to the biotin-tagged KVGFFKR peptide on the array, but not to a control peptide, biotin KAAAAAR. All clones that reacted with biotin KVGFFKR were sequenced and identified (Fig. 1C). His-tag purified proteins from these clones were dot-blotted onto a PVDF membrane and re-probed to quantitate the interactions. On this dot blot, many of the originally identif"
https://openalex.org/W2103156685,"We have developed a chemical ionization mass spectrometry technique for precise in situ measurements of hydrochloric acid (HCl) from a high-altitude aircraft. In measurements at subtropical latitudes, minimum HCl values found in the upper troposphere (UT) were often near or below the detection limit of the measurements (0.005 parts per billion by volume), indicating that background HCl values are much lower than a global mean estimate. However, significant abundances of HCl were observed in many UT air parcels, as a result of stratosphere-to-troposphere transport events. We developed a method for diagnosing the amount of stratospheric ozone in these UT parcels using the compact linear correlation of HCl with ozone found throughout the lower stratosphere (LS). Expanded use of this method will lead to improved quantification of cross-tropopause transport events and validation of global chemical transport models."
https://openalex.org/W2001291724,"Trypanothione is a thiol unique to the Kinetoplastida and has been shown to be a vital component of their antioxidant defenses. However, little is known as to the role of trypanothione in xenobiotic metabolism. A trypanothione S-transferase activity was detected in extracts of Leishmania major, L. infantum, L. tarentolae, Trypanosoma brucei, and Crithidia fasciculata, but not Trypanosoma cruzi. No glutathione S-transferase activity was detected in any of these parasites. Trypanothione S-transferase was purified from C. fasciculata and shown to be a hexadecameric complex of three subunits with a relative molecular weight of 650,000. This enzyme complex was specific for the thiols trypanothione and glutathionylspermidine and only used 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene from a range of glutathione S-transferase substrates. Peptide sequencing revealed that the three components were the α, β, and γ subunits of ribosomal eukaryotic elongation factor 1B (eEF1B). Partial dissociation of the complex suggested that the S-transferase activity was associated with the gamma subunit. Moreover, Cibacron blue was found to be a tight binding inhibitor and reactive blue 4 an irreversible time-dependent inhibitor that covalently modified only the γ subunit. The rate of inactivation by reactive blue 4 was increased more than 600-fold in the presence of trypanothione, and Cibacron blue protected the enzyme from inactivation by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, confirming that these dyes interact with the active site region. Two eEF1Bγ genes were cloned from C. fasciculata, but recombinant C. fasciculata eEF1Bγ had no S-transferase activity, suggesting that eEF1Bγ is unstable in the absence of the other subunits.

Infections with parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida are a common cause of serious illness and death in the tropics. Trypanosoma brucei sp. cause sleeping sickness in Africa, Trypanosoma cruzi is the cause of Chagas' disease in South America, and infections with Leishmania sp. produce a variety of pathologies termed the leishmaniases in Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe. In general, the chemotherapy of these diseases is poor, with the available drugs suffering various drawbacks such as toxicity, limited efficacy, and drug resistance (1Fairlamb A.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 488-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). For instance, the majority of cases of visceral leishmaniasis in India do not respond to antimonials, which are the first-line drugs (3Zilberstein D. Ephros M. Black S.J. Seed J.R. World Class Parasites (Vol. 4): Leishmania. Kluwer Academic Press, London2002: 115-136Google Scholar). A promising target for the design of new drugs to treat these illnesses involves thiol metabolism. In these parasites, this depends upon trypanothione (T[SH]2 1The abbreviations used are: T[SH]2 and T[S]2, trypanothione and trypanothione disulfide, respectively; GSH and GSSG, glutathione and glutathione disulfide, respectively; GspdSH, glutathionylspermidine; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; T[SDNB]2, trypanothione bis-dinitrobenzene; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TST, trypanothione S-transferase; eEF1A, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (formerly eEF-1α); eEF1B, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1B complex (formerly eEF-1βγδ) (eEF1Bα was formerly eEF-1β, eEF1Bβ was formerly eEF-1δ, and eEF1Bγ was formerly eEF-1γ); ARS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; RT, reverse transcription; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight; ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase. or N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) (4Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), in contrast to most other organisms (including their mammalian hosts), which use glutathione as the unmodified tripeptide (Fig. 1) (5Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The main function of trypanothione is the maintenance of cellular redox state, and consequently, studies have concentrated on its role as an antioxidant (6Flohé L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Another major function for cellular thiols is the detoxification of xenobiotics, i.e. chemicals that are foreign to a particular organism. These include naturally occurring compounds, industrial chemicals, drugs, herbicides, and pesticides. Hydrophobic xenobiotics can readily diffuse into cells and are usually eliminated by Phase I and Phase II biotransformation reactions. These produce generally less reactive and more polar compounds, which can be actively extruded from the cytosol. An important group of Phase II reactions are catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and involve conjugation with glutathione (7Sies H. Ketterer B. Glutathione Conjugation: Mechanisms and Biological Significance. Academic Press, London1988Google Scholar). GSTs have been purified from a wide range of organisms and are almost invariably dimers of subunits with masses of ∼25 kDa. In any one organism, many different GST isozymes are usually expressed simultaneously, with these isozymes having wide and overlapping substrate specificities. Such a broad specificity system assists an organism in the metabolism of the multitude of different reactive xenobiotics to which it may be exposed. In addition, GSTs are also important in the detoxification of endogenous reactive chemical species produced during oxidative stress, such as lipid hydroperoxides (8Hurst R. Bao Y.P. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or reactive aldehydes (9Berhane K. Widersten M. Engstrom A. Kozarich J.W. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The GSTs therefore have a central role in detoxification metabolism, and the overexpression of these enzymes is a common mechanism of drug resistance (10Hayes J.D. Wolf C.R. Sies H. Ketterer B. Glutathione Conjugation: Mechanisms and Biological Significance. Academic Press Limited, London1988: 316-355Google Scholar). Although the classical GSTs have been well characterized, the GST fold is also found in functionally unrelated proteins such as plant stress-induced proteins (11Czarnecka E. Nagao R.T. Key J.L. Gurley W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), β-etherases (12Masai E. Katayama Y. Kubota S. Kawai S. Yamasaki M. Morohoshi N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), ion channels (13Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1Bγ (eEF1Bγ) (14Jeppesen M.G. Ortiz P. Shepard W. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Andersen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47190-47198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The functions of the GST domain in these proteins remain poorly understood, although the eEF1Bγ from rice has recently been shown to possess a GST activity (16Kobayashi S. Kidou S. Ejiri S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result was surprising, because eEF1B was previously thought only to be involved in protein synthesis, and no enzymatic activity had been proposed for the eEF1Bγ subunit. Previously, the other two subunits (eEF1Bα and β) of eEF1B were shown to function to recycle elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) complexed with GDP back to the active eEF1A·GTP form (17van Damme H.T. Amons R. Karssies R. Timmers C.J. Janssen G.M. Moller W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This eEF1A·GTP complex is then able bind to an aminoacyl tRNA, forming a ternary complex that is able to enter the A-site of the ribosome, with the hydrolysis of GTP. In contrast to the wealth of information on GSTs and related proteins in other organisms, little is known about thiol-xenobiotic conjugation in trypanosomes. Although there has been one report of low levels of GST activity in T. cruzi (19Yawetz A. Agosin M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68B: 237-243Google Scholar), this has been disputed (20Moutiez M. Meziani-Cherif D. Aumercier M. Sergheraert C. Tartar A. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1994; 42: 2641-2644Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, no GST activities have been reported in the related Leishmania sp. or T. brucei. However, because the major low molecular mass thiol in these organisms is trypanothione, it has been proposed that these trypanosomatids instead possess a trypanothione S-transferase or TST (5Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This activity may also be involved in the resistance of Leishmania sp. to the metalloid antimony (21Legare D. Richard D. Mukhopadhyay R. Stierhof Y.D. Rosen B.P. Haimeur A. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26301-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which is currently the front-line drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis. It has been found that the acquisition of high level antimony resistance in L. tarentolae requires the overproduction of trypanothione, the overexpression of metal-thiol conjugate transporters and a third unidentified trypanothione-dependent factor (22Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This factor was postulated to be a TST activity involved in the formation of an antimony-trypanothione conjugate. Indeed, in an analogous system, the mechanism of resistance of mammalian cells to arsenite involves the efflux of the metalloid, which is thought to be facilitated by the overexpression of a GST-pi (23Liu J. Chen H. Miller D.S. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. Johnson D.R. Klaassen C.D. Waalkes M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Wang H.F. Lee T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we report the detection of TST activities in trypanosomatids and the purification and characterization of the Crithidia fasciculata TST. This is identified as the ribosomal elongation factor eEF1B complex and the subunit containing the TST active site defined as eEF1Bγ. Materials—All reagents were standard commercial products and of the highest available purity. Trypanothione and glutathionylspermidine were obtained from Bachem. Glutathione affinity agaroses were obtained from Sigma, all other chromatographic resins and columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Rat liver GST was purchased as a mixture of isoforms from Sigma. Cell Culture—C. fasciculata choanomastigotes; T. cruzi epimastigotes; T. brucei bloodstream form; and L. major, L. infantum, and L. tarentolae promastigotes were grown as described previously (25Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Haimeur A. Brochu C. Genest P.A. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—GST was assayed at 25 °C in 100 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 6.5, with 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1 mm GSH as substrates. The rate of formation of the glutathione S-dinitrobenzene conjugate was followed at 340 nm, using the published extinction coefficient of 9.6 mm cm-1 (27Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). TST activity was measured under identical conditions with T[SH]2 and CDNB being added to 400 μm. Assay reactions were initiated with thiol, which was produced immediately before addition to assays by mixing trypanothione disulfide (T[S]2) with a 2-fold excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and a 5-fold excess of NaOH. The absorbance coefficient for the T[SDNB]2 conjugate was measured by allowing assays to proceed to completion and found to be 9.2 mm-1 cm-1 per millimolar of sulfhydryl group. One unit of TST activity corresponds to 1 μmol of sulfhydryl group conjugated per minute. Where necessary, in TST assays with alternative electrophilic substrates, the pH and substrate concentrations given for the corresponding GST assay (27Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) were altered to minimize the rate of the spontaneous reaction. The activities with these substrates were calculated using the absorbance coefficients for the corresponding GSH conjugates. In the case of the peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase and thioltransferase assays, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was omitted and T[S]2 was reduced by 10 μg ml-1 trypanothione reductase and 540 μm NADPH, before addition of the second substrate. For enzyme purification, aliquots of fractions were screened for TST activity using a Molecular Devices Thermomax plate reader. In this assay, samples were diluted in the plate with water to give a final volume of 50 μl, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μl of a mixture containing buffer, dithiothreitol (DTT), and substrates. The final assay mixture contained 800 μm CDNB, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm T[S]2, and 100 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 6.5. The average rate of two blank assays was subtracted from these rates. Protein concentrations were measured using the procedure of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar), using BSA as the analytical standard. All trypanosomatid extracts were produced as described below for C. fasciculata, and mouse liver was extracted by disruption in a Dounce homogenizer and then processed as for C. fasciculata cells. Purification of the C. fasciculata TST—Unless otherwise stated, all the steps in the following purification were performed at 4 °C. Frozen C. fasciculata cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer, giving in the final mixture 75 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenanthroline, 3 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 250 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl-)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A. The cells were lysed by sonication (4 × 30 s pulses at 20-μm amplitude from a 19-mm enddiameter probe) in a Sanyo Soniprep 150 sonicator with cooling to <4 °C in an ice-salt bath between pulses. After centrifugation for 80 min at 40,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was brought to a final concentration of 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) over 5 min, by the dropwise addition of PEG from a 50% (w/v) stock, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was adjusted to 9% (w/v) PEG and centrifuged as before. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A (25 mm (Na+) Bis-tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5) and then centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The clarified supernatant was applied at 2 ml min-1 to a 100-ml (19 × 2.6 cm) Amersham Biosciences Q-Sepharose anion exchange column equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with 2 column volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted at 1 ml min-1 with a linear gradient of 200–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer, and active fractions were pooled. Following overnight dialysis against 2 liters of 550 mm (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B (25 mm (Na+) HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7), the sample was applied at 2 ml min-1 to an 85-ml (16 × 2.6 cm) Amersham Biosciences phenyl-Sepharose (low substitution) column equilibrated with 550 mm (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer, and TST activity eluted with 250 ml of buffer B. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml by vacuum ultrafiltration in a Sartorius collodion bag. The concentrated TST was applied to a 319-ml (2.6 × 60 cm) Superdex 200 26/60 size-exclusion column equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm (Na+) HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, pH 7.5) and eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml min-1. Fractions with TST activity were pooled and concentrated as before. Analytical Chromatography—Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was carried out using a 24-ml (1 × 30 cm) Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size-exclusion column equilibrated with buffer C, with separations performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. This procedure was also used to calculate the relative molecular weight (Mr) of proteins, using carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) as analytical standards. Analytical anion-exchange chromatography was carried out using a 6-ml (1.6 × 3 cm) Amersham Biosciences Resource Q column under the same buffer conditions as the Q-Sepharose step in the TST purification scheme. The sample was applied at 1 ml min-1, and the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer. The bound proteins were then eluted with a complex gradient that went from 0–200 mm NaCl in 6 ml, 200–500 mm NaCl in 60 ml, and then 500–1000 mm NaCl in 6 ml, all in buffer A. Analysis of Products of TST Reaction—Assays for mass spectrometric analysis were performed in 200 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, with the other conditions as before. The reactions were followed at 340 nm and after 30 min 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide was added to 10 mm, oxidizing the T[SH]2 by disulfide exchange and thus quenching the trypanothione reaction. The products were then lyophilized in glass vials, re-dissolved in water and diluted 1:500 with 1:1 acetonitrile and water. Samples were analyzed on a Micromass Ultima electrospray mass spectrometer in positive mode. Several scans were combined, background-subtracted, and smoothed to produce the final spectra. Cross-linking Analysis—All samples and controls were dialyzed overnight against 55 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 7.5, reaction buffer, protein samples were then diluted to 1 mg ml-1 in reaction buffer. The amine-reactive homobifunctional reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was added, from a freshly prepared 10 mm stock in 5 mm sodium succinate, pH 5, to the required final concentration. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 40 min and then quenched by the addition of ethanolamine to a final concentration of 5 mm. Aldolase was used as a positive control and BSA and carbonic anhydrase as negative controls. Samples from the reactions were then analyzed by using either 10% SDS-PAGE gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), to examine complexes less than 150 kDa or 6% Weber SDS-PAGE (30Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) to examine complexes greater than 150 kDa. Dissociation of Complex—For thiocyanate disassociation, samples of TST in buffer C were incubated on ice with 2 mm DTT for 3 h in the presence or absence of 1.5 m NaSCN. The proteins were then applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with either buffer C or this buffer plus 500 mm NaSCN, and eluted at 0.5 ml min-1. Because NaSCN inhibits the TST assay, 200-μl samples from each column fraction were dialyzed against TST assay buffer (100 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 6.5) before analysis by enzyme assay and SDS-PAGE. Inhibition and Chemical Modification of TST—Modification with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was carried out in an 80-μl volume at room temperature in buffer C. Samples of TST (16 μg and 61 milliunits) were incubated with 100 μm DTT for 5 min, and then NEM was added to a final concentration of 400 μm. After a 15-min incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of DTT to 625 μm. Inhibition of TST by Cibacron blue F3G-A was determined under standard assay conditions, in the presence or absence of 0.5% (w/v) BSA. Routinely, TST was preincubated with the inhibitor, but no decrease in inhibition was observed when assays were initiated with enzyme. Dye concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using the absorbance coefficients of ϵm = 11.6 (622 nm) for Cibacron blue (31Ashton A.R. Gideon G.M. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and ϵm = 4.2 (610 nm) for reactive blue 4 (32Small D.A.P. Lowe C.R. Atkinson T. Bruton C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate of time-dependent inhibition of TST by chlorotriazine dyes was measured in reaction mixtures of 100 μl containing 70 milliunits (18 μg) samples of TST and varying concentrations of dye in 20 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 7.5. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature, with 5-μl samples being removed at intervals to determine residual TST activity. These samples were assayed by 100-fold dilution into assay mixtures containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA, to prevent inhibition by any unreacted dye. Incubations with CDNB were performed under identical conditions, and samples were assayed in standard assay conditions. T[SH]2 and GSH were generated in incubations by the addition of 600 μm NADPH, 1 milliunit of trypanothione reductase or glutathione reductase, and 500 μm T[S]2 or GSSG. The resulting data were fitted by non-linear regression analysis to the single exponential decay function and expressed as a percentage of the activity at zero time. Samples of proteins for mass spectrometry were desalted by dialysis against one liter of water for 3 h at 4 °C, before analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer. Cloning of eEF1BG1 and eEF1BG2 from C. fasciculata—A partial clone of the C. fasciculata eEF1BG1 was obtained by RT-PCR from cDNA prepared using the Cells-to-cDNA kit (Ambion). The sense primer (5′-CGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTA-3′) contained 25 nucleotides of the mini-exon sequence that is trans-spliced onto the 5′-end of all trypanosomatid mRNA transcripts (33Perry K.L.

PCR was performed in 50-μl volume reactions containing template cDNA, 20 ng ml-1 sense and antisense primers, 250 μm dNTPs, 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), and Taq buffer plus 1.5 mm MgCl2. The reactions were placed in a thermocycler that had been preheated to 95 °C and subjected to the following: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, then 72 °C for 2 min, and finally the reactions were heated to 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were then cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Southern blotting was carried out by the standard capillary transfer method (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1989Google Scholar), using the RT-PCR clone of eEF1BG1 as a probe. The probe was labeled using the Gene Images labeling kit and hybridization detected with the Gene Images dioxetane detection module (Amersham Biosciences). PCR amplification of C. fasciculata eEF1BG intergenic regions was carried out using sense (5′-GGAGCTGTTTGACTGGGAGGAGAT-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GAAGTCCGCCGTCTCGTTGTC-3′) as described above, with the substitution of Pfu polymerase and Pfu buffer (Promega) for Taq polymerase. Four intergenic regions were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Multiple primers were then designed to their 5′ and 3′ regions. One pair of these primers (sense 5′-GCACCGGCGTACCTGATGACTT-3′ and antisense 5′-TTAGTGGCCACTGATGCGACAGC-3′) produced a product that was cloned, sequenced, and identified as an eEF1Bγ gene (eEF1BG2). This gene was then cloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), and recombinant protein was expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nomenclature—The terminology of eukaryotic elongation factors is somewhat confusing. In this report we have used the IUBMB nomenclature recommendations (available www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/misc/trans.html), with the elongation factor 1B complex, previously named eEF-1βγδ being referred to as eEF1B. The complex's subunits are, in order of increasing size, elongation factor 1B α (previously eEF-1β), now referred to as eEF1Bα; elongation factor 1B β (previously eEF-1δ) referred to as eEF1Bβ and elongation factor 1B γ (previously eEF-1γ) referred to as eEF1Bγ. The SWISS-PROT identifier is used when referring to previously characterized elongation factors. Detection and Initial Characterization of Trypanothione S-Transferase Activities in Trypanosomatids—Clarified extracts of various organisms and cell types were assayed for S-transferase activities (Table I). L. tarentolae (a lizard parasite) was included, because this organism has been frequently used in studies on Leishmania antimony resistance. Mouse liver extract was assayed as a positive control for the GST assay and trypanothione reductase activity was used to confirm adequate extraction of the parasites. No GST activity was detected in the trypanosomatids. Instead a trypanothione S-transferase (TST) activity was detected in C. fasciculata, all the Leishmania sp. and T. brucei. The TST activity in mouse liver extracts is probably due to the ability of GSTs to use T[SH]2 as an alternative substrate, although with a specific activity 100-fold less than that given with GSH. Because TST activity was highest in C. fasciculata and L. major, these activities were further characterized. Activity in these extracts was proportional to the amount of protein added, heat labile, and, when analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography the activity eluted close to the void volume of the column, showing Mr values greater than 400,000 (data not shown). This is in contrast to the GST activity in the mouse liver extract, which eluted with an Mr of 45,000 (this value being identical to the reported Mr of the three major mouse glutathione S-transferases) (36Warholm M.

https://openalex.org/W2010704017,"Thrombin is the ultimate protease of the blood clotting cascade and plays a major role in its own regulation. The ability of thrombin to exhibit both pro- and anti-coagulant properties has spawned efforts to turn thrombin into an anticoagulant for therapeutic purposes. This quest culminated in the identification of the E217K variant through scanning and saturation mutagenesis. The antithrombotic properties of E217K thrombin are derived from its inability to convert fibrinogen to a fibrin clot while maintaining its thrombomodulin-dependent ability to activate the anticoagulant protein C pathway. Here we describe the 2.5-Å crystal structure of human E217K thrombin, which displays a dramatic restructuring of the geometry of the active site. Of particular interest is the repositioning of Glu-192, which hydrogen bonds to the catalytic Ser-195 and which results in the complete occlusion of the active site and the destruction of the oxyanion hole. Substrate binding pockets are further blocked by residues previously implicated in thrombin allostery. We have concluded that the E217K mutation causes the allosteric inactivation of thrombin by destabilizing the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site and that the structure thus may represent the Na<sup>+</sup>-free, catalytically inert ""slow"" form."
https://openalex.org/W2013622558,"The physiological role of the skeletal muscle-specific calpain 3, p94, is presently unknown, but defects in its gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. This calcium-dependent cysteine protease resembles the large subunit of m-calpain but with three unique additional sequences: an N-terminal region (NS), and two insertions (IS1 and IS2). The latter two insertions have been linked to the chronic instability of the whole enzyme both in vivo and in vitro. We have shown previously that the core of p94 comprising NS, domains I and II, and IS1 is stable as a recombinant protein in the absence of Ca2+ and undergoes autolysis in its presence. Here we show that p94I-II cannot hydrolyze an exogenous substrate before autolysis but is increasingly able to do so when autolysis proceeds for several hours. This gain in activity is caused by cleavage of IS1 during autolysis because a deletion mutant lacking the NS region (p94I-II ΔNS) shows the same activation profile. Similarly, the calpain inhibitors E-64 and leupeptin have almost no inhibitory effect on substrate hydrolysis by p94I-II soon after calcium addition but cause complete inhibition when autolysis progresses for several hours. As autolysis proceeds, there is release of the internal IS1 peptide, but the two portions of the core remain tightly associated. Modeling of p94I-II suggests that IS1 contains an amphipathic α-helix flanked by extended loops. The latter are the targets of autolysis and limited digestion by exogenous proteases. The presence and location of the α-helix in recombinant IS1 were confirmed by circular dichroism and by the introduction of a L286P helix-disrupting mutation. Within p94I-II, L286P caused premature autoproteolysis of the enzyme. IS1 is an elaboration of a loop in domain II near the active site, and it acts as an internal autoinhibitory propeptide, blocking the active site of p94 from substrates and inhibitors.

IS1 is an elaboration of a loop in domain II near the active site, and it acts as an internal autoinhibitory propeptide, blocking the active site of p94 from substrates and inhibitors. Calpains comprise a large family of cytosolic Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinases with homologues present in mammals, insects, nematodes, and yeast (1Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Two well-studied members of this family are the mammalian heterodimeric μ- and m-calpains, which are composed of a large catalytic subunit (80 kDa) and a small regulatory subunit (28 kDa). The domain structure of the large subunit was redefined by x-ray crystallography (3Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 4Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Following the classification of Hosfield et al. (3Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), the large subunit has four structural domains (I-IV). The first two (I and II) make up the papain-like catalytic core common to all calpains (1Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas domains III and IV are the C2-like and penta-EF-hand domains, respectively. The small subunit contains two domains, V and VI, of which the latter is also a penta-EF-hand domain that forms extensive interactions with the homologous penta-EF-hand domain IV in the large subunit. Several more of the ∼14 human calpain isoforms are composed of two subunits and share the same domain structure as μ- and m-calpain. Other calpain homologues do not seem to form heterodimers, and some also contain different domains such as SOH (small optic lobe homologous), PBH (PalB homologous), and T (tra-3 specific) as additions or substitutions. Some members of the calpain family appear to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas others are only found in specific tissues. However, these distinctions may not be as clear-cut as once thought (5Farkas A. Tompa P. Friedrich P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Before the discovery of many new calpain genes by way of the Human Genome Project and other sequencing projects, molecular cloning experiments had identified a third member of the calpain superfamily, calpain 3 (p94), whose mRNA was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle (6Sorimachi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology to μ- and m-calpain (54% and 51% identity, respectively), p94 has a domain organization similar to that of their large subunits (6Sorimachi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Ohno S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p94 contains three unique sequences: an N-terminal extension (NS) of 47 amino acids located where the anchor peptide would be in m-calpain, and two insertion sequences. The first insertion sequence (IS1) is 48 amino acids long and interrupts domain II after Asp267. This insertion is encoded by a single exon (exon 6). The second insertion of 77 residues is encoded by two exons (exons 15 and 16) and located between domains III and IV (IS2). Although p94 has been modeled to contain all four domains of the large subunit (7Jia Z. Petrounevitch V. Wong A. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Beckmann J.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2590-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it does not seem to form a heterodimer (8Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with this theory, protein-protein interaction analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system did not show an interaction between p94 and the 28-kDa small subunit (9Sorimachi H. Kinbara K. Kimura S. Takahashi M. Ishiura S. Sasagawa N. Sorimachi N. Shimada H. Tagawa K. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31158-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The importance of p94 in muscle physiology was confirmed by the discovery that mutations in the calpain 3 gene (capn3) lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (10Richard I. Broux O. Allamand V. Fougerousse F. Chiannilkulchai N. Bourg N. Brenguier L. Devaud C. Pasturaud P. Roudaut C. Hillaire D. Passes Bueno M.R. Zatz M. Tischfield J.A. Fardeau M. Jackson C.E. Cohen D. Beckmann J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 27-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Numerous efforts have been made to isolate p94 from muscle or to produce a recombinant form of the enzyme in Escherichia coli (11Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19476-19482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Federici C. Eshdat Y. Richard I. Bertin B. Guillaume J.L. Hattab M. Beckmann J.S. Strosberg A.D. Camoin L. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These attempts failed to produce large amounts of p94 due to its rapid autolytic degradation, which has hindered a thorough biochemical characterization of the enzyme. As a result, the roles of the three p94-specific sequences and their contribution to the unique properties and physiological function of calpain 3 have remained speculative. IS1 and IS2 are each thought to contribute to the lack of stability of p94. Splicing variants of p94 lacking these novel insertions have been found in different eye tissues such as lens (Lp82) (14Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 454-461PubMed Google Scholar), retina (Rt88) (15Azuma M. Fukiage C. Higashine M. Nakajima T. Ma H. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 21: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and cornea (Cn94) (16Nakajima T. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Ma H. Shearer T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); in skeletal muscle (17Herasse M. Ono Y. Fougerousse F. Kimura E. Stockholm D. Beley C. Montarras D. Pinset C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Beckmann J.S. Richard I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4047-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (18De Tullio R. Stifanese R. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to p94, Lp82, the lens-specific calpain isoform that lacks NS, IS1, and IS2, has been detected as a full-length 82-kDa protein band in young rodent lenses, and the corresponding enzymatic activity band has been detected on casein zymograms (19Ma H. Shih M. Hata I. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recombinant construct of Lp82 was stably produced in insect cells, purified, and characterized (20Fukiage C. Nakajima E. Ma H. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Very recently, an alternatively spliced variant of mouse skeletal muscle p94 that lacks IS1 and IS2 (p94:exon 6-15-16-, p94Δ) has been successfully expressed in mammalian cells and shown to be proteolytically active (21Ono Y. Kakinuma K. Torii F. Irie A. Nakagawa K. Labeit S. Abe K. Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2761-2771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Introduction of IS1 into Lp82 destabilized the protein and caused a loss of enzymatic activity, whereas substitution of the shorter N-terminal sequence (AX1) present in Lp82 by NS or introduction of IS2 did not affect stability (22Ma H. Shih M. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Duncan M.K. Reed N.A. Richard I. Beckmann J.S. Shearer T.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4232-4239PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the stability and abundance of enzymatically active Lp82 in rodent lens are due to the lack of IS1 and may explain why IS1-containing isoforms of calpains such as p94 and Rt88 (15Azuma M. Fukiage C. Higashine M. Nakajima T. Ma H. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 2000; 21: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are unstable (23Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid autolysis of p94 during purification from rabbit muscle fractions was not prevented by the calpain inhibitors E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane) and leupeptin (8Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas autolysis of purified recombinant Lp82 was totally inhibited by E-64 or EGTA (20Fukiage C. Nakajima E. Ma H. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recently reported p94 isoform present in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that lacks IS1 and the lysine-rich IS2 sequence was also inhibited by leupeptin and calpain inhibitors I and II (18De Tullio R. Stifanese R. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to μ- and m-calpain, p94 and its splice variants have been shown to be insensitive to inhibition by calpastatin (8Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18De Tullio R. Stifanese R. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20678-20685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The basis for this insensitivity is not known, but it could be due in part to the absence of the small subunit, which is one of the defined calpastatin binding sites present in m-calpain (24Todd B. Moore D. Deivanayagam C.C. Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Narayana S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Unlike whole p94, the proteolytic core of p94 containing NS and IS1 can be produced in relatively large amounts in E. coli, and the recombinant protein is fairly stable during purification (25Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using this truncated form of the enzyme, we have previously shown that the core of p94 is stable in EDTA but undergoes autolysis in the presence of Ca2+. NS and IS1 are rapidly cleaved during this process at specific N-terminal sites by a strictly intramolecular reaction (Fig. 1). Here we have studied the effect of NS and IS1 on p94 enzymatic properties. Our results show that IS1 acts as an internal propeptide. Autoproteolysis serves to remove IS1 (and NS), making the active site available for hydrolysis of exogenous substrates and accessible to inhibitors. Cloning, Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The protease core of human p94 (p94I-II) and its active site knockout mutant, p94I-II C129S, were prepared as described previously (25Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These constructs contain NS and IS1 and are effectively a C-terminal truncation of p94 after Asp419 (Fig. 1). The subsequent deletion of the NS region was achieved by PCR using expand high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with the p94I-II DNA construct as a template. A new 5′ primer (5′-GATATACATATGATCATCAGCCGCAATTTTCCTAT-3′) deleted the first 45 amino acids, i.e. 1 residue C-terminal to the second (2a) autolysis site in NS, and inserted an initiating methionine (Fig. 1). The amplified product was ligated into the pET24a vector between the NdeI and XhoI sites to encode p94I-II ΔNS with a C-terminal His6 tag (MI46ISRN—CNLTAD419LEH6). The DNA sequences of positive clones were verified. p94I-II ΔNS was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) under kanamycin selection. This deletion construct was purified according to the protocol described previously for p94I-II (25Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but with size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 included before the final Q-Sepharose fast protein liquid chromatography. The 48-amino acid IS1 sequence was amplified by PCR and ligated into the pET28a(+) vector between the NdeI and XhoI sites. The recombinant IS1 was expressed as a 68-residue His-tagged polypeptide in E. coli BL21(DE3) at room temperature under kanamycin selection. It was purified from the supernatant fraction by metal affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SLY, succinyl-leucine-tyrosine; MCA, aminomethyl coumarin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TFE, trifluoroethanol.-agarose column followed by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 semi-preparative column. The L286P helix-breaking mutation was introduced into p94I-II, its active site knockout mutant (p94I-II C129S), and IS1 by site-directed mutagenesis using the single-stranded DNA method of Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The mutants were expressed and purified using the same procedure as the wild-type proteins. Enzyme Assays—Autoproteolytic activity was measured by incubating either p94I-II or its deletion construct p94I-II ΔNS in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm Ca2+ at room temperature in a final volume of 200-500 μl at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Aliquots were removed at different times, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer, 187.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.03% bromphenol blue. The progress of autolysis was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The control assay was done with 10 mm EDTA in place of Ca2+. The activity of p94I-II and p94I-II ΔNS against a 0.5 mm solution of the fluorogenic peptide substrate succinyl-Leu-Tyr (SLY)-aminomethyl coumarin (MCA) was assayed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Ca2+ at room temperature. MCA release was monitored over time (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm). To examine the effect of autolysis on the rate of SLY-MCA hydrolysis, 5 μm p94I-II or p94I-II ΔNS was incubated in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Ca2+. Aliquots were removed at different autolysis times and assayed for hydrolysis of SLY-MCA (0.5 mm). The initial rate of MCA release was calculated for each autolysis time point, and the degree of autolysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The effect of two calpain inhibitors, leupeptin and E-64, on the hydrolysis of SLY-MCA by p94I-II and p94I-II ΔNS was tested at different autolysis times. MCA release was monitored for 20-30 min before the addition of a 40-fold molar excess of inhibitor. Binding of p94I-II Autolytic Fragments to a Nickel Chelation Matrix—Autolysis fragments produced after 24 h of incubation of p94I-II in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Ca2+ at room temperature were loaded on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 2% glycerol (N-buffer). Unbound material was collected in the flow-through fractions, and two wash steps with N-buffer were performed before bound material was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in N-buffer (pH 8.5). Fractions from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Modeling of p94I-II ΔNS—Secondary structure predictions were performed with the web-based servers for PredictProtein (27Rost B. Proteins. 1997; : 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Rost B. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3300-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), nnpredict (29Kneller D.G.

Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The propensity for globularity and disorder was also predicted using the GlobPlot server. The sequence of p94I-II was modeled onto the structure of the rat μI-II protease core (31Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) using the Sybyl software program (Tripos, Inc.). Homologous regions were restrained to the rat μI-II structure. The structure of IS1 was manually built into place and subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on an Olis RSM 1000 CD spectrophotometer using a 1-mm path length quartz cell. Data collection (260-180 nm) was done at 4 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), with and without 10% and 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). The protein concentration of HPLC-pure IS1 polypeptide and its L286P mutant was 0.25 mg/ml. CD spectra were averages of at least 10 scans corrected for buffer background signal. Deconvolution of the spectra was done using the CDNN software (32Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity [Θ] (degrees cm2 dmol-1). Limited Proteolysis—A time course of limited proteolytic digestion of the inactive mutant of p94I-II by trypsin or chymotrypsin was performed at room temperature in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm Ca2+. The inactive mutant was used as substrate to avoid the complication of autolytic processing. The final concentration of p94I-II C129S was 1 mg/ml, whereas the concentrations of trypsin and chymotrypsin were 1 and 100 μg/ml, respectively. Aliquots were removed at different time points, and the proteolytic fragments were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein fragments were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with an anti-IS1 antibody (RP2-CP3; Triple Point Biologics, Portland, OR) to identify the IS1-linked fragments. N-terminal Sequencing and Mass Analysis—The protein fragments generated by tryptic and chymotryptic proteolysis were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using 10 mm CAPS-NaOH (pH 11.0), 10% methanol as transfer buffer and visualized using Coomassie Blue R-250 (0.1% dye in 50% methanol). After destaining, the membrane was washed several times with distilled water. Bands corresponding to the main proteolytically resistant products were cut out for N-terminal sequencing (Alberta Peptide Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry spectra of p94I-II fragments after 24 h of autolysis were acquired at the Protein Function Discovery Facility, Queen's University. p94I-II Gains Activity during Autolysis—Previously, this laboratory showed that the protease core of p94 (p94I-II) can autolyze in the presence of Ca2+ and that the first cuts made (near the N-terminal ends of NS and IS1) were strictly intramolecular (25Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was not possible to say whether the subsequent cuts, made near the C-terminal ends of NS and IS1, were intra- or intermolecular. We noted, however, that the combination of early and late cuts had the potential to remove NS and IS1, and speculated that either or both of these sequences might block access to the active site of p94 and prevent it from cleaving exogenous substrates. To test this hypothesis, we incubated p94I-II with the small synthetic calpain substrate SLY-MCA. At the point when Ca2+ was added, there was no hydrolysis of SLY-MCA by p94I-II (Fig. 2A). Cleavage was detected soon after, however, and gradually increased in rate over 25 min. All activity was then abruptly stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. Mg2+ did not substitute for Ca2+ in priming the reaction, nor did it interfere with the priming when Ca2+ was subsequently added. The initial rate of SLY-MCA hydrolysis catalyzed by p94I-II was very weak in comparison with that of the proteolytic core of the μ-calpain standard (μI-II), even when assayed at a 10- or 20-fold higher concentration (Fig. 2B). However, the enzymatic activity of p94I-II improved considerably when it was allowed to autoproteolyze before the addition of exogenous substrate (Fig. 3A, inset). The plot of initial reaction rates versus autolysis times showed that the beneficial effect of autolytic preincubation on enzymatic activity was maximal between 10 and 24 h of autolysis (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE showed a correlation between the gain in SLY-MCA hydrolyzing activity and the extent of p94I-II autoproteolysis. The generation of fragments of ∼30 and 17 kDa accompanied the early, rapid increase in enzymatic activity in the first hours of autolysis (Fig. 3B). The 30-kDa fragment is bounded by cleavages at 1a and 1b near the N termini of NS and IS1, respectively (Fig. 1A), and the 17-kDa fragment is the C-terminal portion of p94I-II from 1b onward (25Rey M.A. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further increase in enzymatic activity coincided with the generation of two new cleavage products at ∼26 and 13 kDa, which correspond to protein fragments generated after autolytic cleavage at or near the C termini of NS and IS1 (2a and 2b), respectively. Cleavages at positions 1a and 2a and at positions 1b and 2b have the potential to release polypeptides corresponding to major portions of NS and IS1, respectively (Fig. 1A). The generation of these fragments was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the 24 h autolysis sample showed prominent peaks of masses 4500.96 and 2829.28 Da consistent with the theoretical masses of the IS1 peptide from 1b to 2b (4502.97 Da) and the NS peptide from 1a to one amino acid before 2a (2830.07 Da) (data not shown). Autolysis at the two internal sites (1b and 2b) that release the IS1 peptide did not, however, result in dissociation of the 26- and 13-kDa fragments of the enzyme. This was demonstrated by chromatography of the 24 h autolysis products on a Ni-NTA resin. The material that bound to the column and was eluted by imidazole was indistinguishable from the 24 h autolysis products in the number and stoichiometry of fragments detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). In particular, the 26-kDa fragment corresponding to the region between NS and IS1 lacks a His tag and could only be retained on the column if this fragment remained tightly bound to the His-tagged C-terminal fragment (13 kDa). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the μ-calpain protease core (31Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) shows that the equivalent regions of μI-II (shown in red and yellow in Fig. 4B) lie on either side of the loop formed by residues Asn253 to Arg267 (shown in green in Fig. 4B) and display extensive interactions within the overall protein fold. These interactions are composed of a large interdomain surface and the insertion of β-strand 14 between β-strands 7 and 8 to form a β-sheet (Fig. 4B). According to model building, these interactions are largely conserved in p94I-II (7Jia Z. Petrounevitch V. Wong A. Moldoveanu T. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Beckmann J.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2590-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). p94I-II Active Site Becomes More Accessible to Inhibitors after Extensive Autolysis—Another demonstration of the increasing accessibility of the active site during autolysis was provided by inhibitor studies. A 40-fold molar excess of the calpain active site inhibitors, E-64 and leupeptin, had relatively little inhibitory effect on SLY-MCA hydrolysis by p94I-II during the early stages of Ca2+ addition (Fig. 5, A and B, traces 0.5), whereas hydrolysis of this substrate was completely (E-64) or largely (leupeptin) inhibited when the same concentration of inhibitors was added to a p94I-II sample that had been in the presence of Ca2+ for 24 h (Fig. 5, A and B, traces 24). An intermediate degree of inhibition was observed after the enzyme was incubated with Ca2+ for 2, 4, and 10 h (Fig. 5, A and B, traces 2, 4, and 10), suggesting that the active site of p94I-II becomes increasingly available to small inhibitors as autolysis progresses. Fig. 5C shows the plots of activation (circles) and inhibition by leupeptin (triangles) and E-64 (squares) as a function of time of autolysis. There is a consistent reciprocal trend between p94 activation and inhibition. SDS-PAGE analysis of autolysis of p94I-II in the"

Like all Dbl family proteins, Ect2 contains a tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain structure. Previous studies demonstrated that N-terminal deletion of sequences upstream of the DH domain created a constitutively activated, transforming variant of Ect2 (designated ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH/C), indicating that the N terminus served as a negative regulator of DH domain function in vivo. The role of sequences C-terminal to the DH domain has not been established. Therefore, we assessed the consequences of mutation of C-terminal sequences on Ect2-transforming activity. Surprisingly, in contrast to observations with other Dbl family proteins, we found that mutation of the invariant tryptophan residue in the PH domain did not impair ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH/C transforming activity. Furthermore, although the sequences C-terminal to the PH domain lack any known functional domains or motifs, deletion of these sequences (ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH) resulted in a dramatic reduction in transforming activity. Whereas ΔN-Ect2 caused formation of lamellipodia, ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH enhanced actin stress fiber formation, suggesting that C-terminal sequences influenced Ect2 Rho GTPase specificity. Consistent with this possibility, we determined that ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH activated RhoA, but not Rac1 or Cdc42, whereas ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH/C activated all three Rho GTPases in vivo. Taken together, these observations suggest that regions of Ect2 C-terminal to the DH domain alter the profile of Rho GTPases activated in vivo and consequently may contribute to the enhanced transforming activity of ΔN-Ect2 DH/PH/C.

https://openalex.org/W2146885773,"We describe here the structure of the hemocyanin from the Chilean gastropod Concholepas concholepas (CCH), emphasizing some attributes that make it interesting among molluscan hemocyanins. CCH exhibits a predominant didecameric structure as revealed by electron microscopy and a size of 8 MDa by gel filtration, and, in contrast with other mollusc hemocyanins, its stabilization does not require additional Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ in the medium. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies, analyses by a MonoQ FPLC column, and Western blots with specific monoclonal antibodies showed that CCH is made by two subunits noncovalently linked, named CCH-A and CCH-B, with molecular masses of 405 and 350 kDa, respectively. Interestingly, one of the subunits undergoes changes within the macromolecule; we demonstrated that CCH-A has an autocleavage site that under reducing conditions is cleaved to yield two polypeptides, CCH-A1 (300 kDa) and CCH-A2 (108 kDa), whereas CCH-B remains unchanged. The CCH-A nick occurs at 4 °C, increases at 37 °C, and is not inhibited by the addition of protease inhibitors and/or divalent cations. Since the CCH structure is a heterodimer, we investigated whether subunits would be either intermingled, forming heterodecamers, or assembled as two homogeneous decamers. Light scattering and electron microscope studies of the in vitro reassociation of purified CCH subunits demonstrated that the sole addition of Mg2+ is needed for its reassembly into the native decameric molecule; no homodecamer reorganization was found with either CCH-A or CCH-B subunits alone.

Our evidence showed that C. concholepas hemocyanin is an unusual example of heterodecameric organization. Hemocyanins, the oxygen carrier glycoproteins found in the hemolymph of many species of arthropods and molluscs, are model proteins due to their complex systems of self-assembly and their sophisticated quaternary structure. Hemocyanins of these two classes of organisms differ considerably in primary sequence, size, and subunit organization, suggesting a divergent evolution that maintains certain superficial similarities in their general structural design and function (1Van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Decker H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15563-15566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Molluscan hemocyanins assemble into hollow cylindrical layered molecules formed by 10 subunits. Each subunit, ranging from 350 to 450 kDa, includes seven or eight globular folded domains known as functional units (FUs), 1The abbreviations used are: FU, functional unit; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; CCH, C. concholepas hemocyanin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FPLC, fast pressure liquid chromatography; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; IEF, isoelectric focusing; RtH, R. thomasiana hemocyanin.1The abbreviations used are: FU, functional unit; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; CCH, C. concholepas hemocyanin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FPLC, fast pressure liquid chromatography; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; IEF, isoelectric focusing; RtH, R. thomasiana hemocyanin. which are arranged into pearl-like chains and covalently bound by a short flexible linker region of 10–15 amino acid residues. FUs vary in size from 45 to 55 kDa, and each of them is capable of reversibly binding one oxygen molecule through a pair of copper atoms. Decamers reach molecular masses of 3.5–4.5 MDa, and in bivalves and gastropods, they can self-associate as stable dimers. This association occurs due to an asymmetrical face-to-face interaction between decamers, resulting in huge structures, which range from 8 to 9 MDa (3Mellema J.E. Klug A.

In turn, the uses of immunochemical methods combined with partial proteolytic digestion of the subunits, supported by sequence studies, have allowed researchers to establish structural relationships among different FUs and their location in the polypeptide chain (17Swerdlow R.D.

Interestingly, didecameric association occurs exclusively among equivalent decamers, generating two homogeneous hemocyanin isoforms, and hybrid molecules have not been described. Although Murex fulvescens hemocyanin has two different subunits, like the hemocyanin from the gastropod species mentioned above, its functional protein is a heterogeneous didecamer, as evidenced by oxygen consumption kinetics data (28Brouwer M.

It was found that it has two subunits (named CCH-A and CCH-B) that display common and specific epitopes (40Oliva H. Moltedo B. De Ioannes P. Faunes F. De Ioannes A.E. Becker M.I.

We found that, during the purification process, the CCH stabilization does not require additional divalent cations and that during aging of the molecule, the CCH-A subunit undergoes a splitting process into two polypeptides. Furthermore, we analyzed whether the splitting was a result of a proteolytic cleavage or an autocleavage phenomenon. We demonstrated that the autocleavage of CCH-A subunit generates CCH-A1 and CCH-A2 fragments and occurs independently of the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, or protease inhibitors. Finally, since CCH contains two subunits, we analyzed whether they were intermingled or assembled as two homogeneous decamers in a manner similar to others hemocyanins. The results presented here led us to conclude that CCH has an unusual heterodecameric organization.

All chemicals were analytical grade reagents, and the solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water. Hemocyanin Sources—Live specimens of C. concholepas (Loco) were harvested from the Pacific Ocean, Bay of Quintay (33° 8′ south 71° 48′ west) V Region of Chile. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was purchased from Pierce, and C. concholepas hemocyanin was from BIOSONDA (Blue Carrier). Hemocyanin Purification—The general procedure described by Hercowitz et al. (41Herskowitz H.B. Harold W.W. Stavitsky A.B. Immunology. 1972; 22: 51-61PubMed Google Scholar) was employed with modifications. Live C. concholepas specimens were transported to the laboratory in seawater. The hemolymph was collected by bleeding at 4 °C through several diagonal slits made on the mantle and foot of the mollusc and filtered through a glass mesh. Hemocytes and other cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,400 × g over 20 min at 4 °C, and 0.1% sodium azide was added. The material was precipitated for 12 h at 4 °C at 33% saturation with crystalline ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 16,300 × g in a Sorvall centrifuge; the clear supernatant was discarded. Precipitation and concentration procedures were repeated twice, and then the CCH pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% sodium azide). This material was dialyzed at 4 °C against PBS to remove ammonium sulfate. The CCH solution was clarified by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm, prefiltered in a Seitz unit, and sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter unit, and then stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Blue kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. This hemocyanin preparation was shown to be highly pure by gel chromatography and SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, purification was performed in the presence of 0.8 μm aprotinin, 100 μm iodoacetamide, 22 μm leupeptin, 15 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA with or without 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm MgCl2. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration was performed at 4 °C on a Sepharose 4B column, 53 cm in height and 1 cm in diameter (bed volume 41.6 cm3). The column was pre-equilibrated in 150 mm PBS (pH 7.2) and then standardized with 3 mg of the following proteins: KLH, thyroglobulin, and BSA. To determine the exclusion volume of the column, blue dextran 2000 was used. Finally, 10 mg of the CCH was loaded in 5.3 ml of PBS at 4.62 ml/h. Chromatography was monitored at 280 nm. Experiments were also done with a CCH sample stored in a 50 mm PBS (pH 7.2) and chromatographed on MonoQ FPLC. The column was previously equilibrated with the same 50 mm PBS buffer. Elutions were performed with buffer during 5 min, followed by a linear gradient from 40 to 100% 1 m NaCl for 30 min at 1 ml/min. MonoQ chromatography was monitored at 280 nm. Copper Content—Copper was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in GBC equipment (model 902) with a hollow copper cathode lamp of 324.8 nm (Photon). The analysis was performed at the Centro de Servicios Externos of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Briefly, purified CCH and KLH samples were hydrolyzed with HNO3, evaporated, and dissolved in diluted HCl prior to analysis. Fixanal Ridel-Haën copper reference standard of 1.0 g of copper/liter was used. Electron Microscopy—The general procedure described by Fernández-Morán et al. (42Fernández-Morán H. Van Bruggen E F.J. Ohtsuki M. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used with modifications (43Garrido J. De Ioannes A.E. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1981; 5: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Twenty-μl aliquots of CCH samples (0.5–1 mg/ml) were applied during 1 min to Formvar- or Parlodion-coated copper grids, previously stabilized by vacuum evaporation on a carbon coat. They were stained for periods of 1–5 min with 20 μl of 1–2% aqueous uranyl acetate solution, previously filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The grids were air-dried at room temperature and observed under a Phillips Tecnai 12 electron microscope at the Servicio de Microscopía Electrónica, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. SDS-PAGE—The technique was performed as described by Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) in a 3–12% gradient separating and 3% stacking gel. Protein samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Gels were run at 70 V during 12 h at room temperature. Molecular masses were estimated from band mobility with a calibration curve obtained from KLH-1 and KLH-2 polypeptides and prestained markers. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or with AgNO3 (45Morrisey J.H. J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Native Gel Electrophoresis—The procedure described by Swerdlow et al. (17Swerdlow R.D. Ebert R.F. Bonaventura C. Miller K.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1996; 113: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to characterize different subunits of KLH was applied. This system requires high pH buffer and EDTA to create alkaline dissociating conditions. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were dissociated by incubation in the sample buffer at 4 °C (140 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA at pH 8.6). Separation was performed at room temperature during 24 h at 80 V. Finally, the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue. Identification of Subunits with Monoclonal Antibodies—To identify CCH subunits in native gels, the bands were developed in situ using the Unblot in-gel chemiluminescent detection kit. Briefly, the gels were fixed, washed, and incubated overnight at room temperature, either with hybridoma supernatant of monoclonal antibodies specific to CCH-A subunit 2B. Moltedo, D. Leiva, A. E. De Ioannes, and M. I. Becker, manuscript in preparation. or CCH-B subunit (40Oliva H. Moltedo B. De Ioannes P. Faunes F. De Ioannes A.E. Becker M.I. Hybridoma Hybridomics. 2002; 21: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), diluted 1:1 with the buffer included in the kit. Then gels were washed in PBS-Tween solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted 1:1000 in the same buffer. Finally, proteins were visualized with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit. Both sides of the gel were covered with cellophane sheets and exposed to CL-XPosure film. In other experiments, CCH native electrophoresis gels were transferred to 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose membranes (46Towbin H.E. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with SuperBlock or 1% PBS-BSA and then incubated for 3 h with anti-CCH mAbs diluted 1:1 in SuperBlock. After washing with PBS-Tween 0.02%, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate-diluted 1:12,000. The membranes were developed using NBT and BCIP. To stop the reaction, the membranes were washed with water. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE—The method was performed as described by Coligan et al. (47Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. 2nd Ed. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and Walker (48Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 127-132Crossref Google Scholar). The first dimension was run on a 3% SDS-PAGE tube gel; the sample buffer had no reducing agents (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and bromphenol blue). The second dimension was run on a 3–20% polyacrylamide gradient system. The strip containing the first dimension was incubated with a denaturing buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, before application on the second dimension. Gels were run at 1,050 V/h, at room temperature, in both the first and second dimension. Two-dimensional gels were silver-stained for protein visualization. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)—A Mini IEF Cell Model 111 (Bio-Rad) system was used. The preparation of the IEF gel was done according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 4% acrylamide and 2% ampholytes. Mixtures of proteins with known pI (range 4.5–9.6) were used as standards. Gels were run and stained with 0.05% Crocein Scarlet, according to the supplier's instructions. Isolation of CCH Subunits—The general procedure described by Swerdlow et al. (17Swerdlow R.D. Ebert R.F. Bonaventura C. Miller K.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1996; 113: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was employed. Purified CCH was dissociated into individuals subunits by dialysis against 5 volumes of 130 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.6, 10 mm EDTA (buffer A) overnight at 4 °C. Dissociated CCH was loaded on a MonoQ 5/5 FPLC column that had been equilibrated previously with buffer A at 1.0 ml/min. The elution was performed as follows: buffer A for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–70% buffer A containing 1 m NaCl for 30 min at 1 ml/min, and the final wash performed at 70% buffer A containing 1 m NaCl for 5 min. MonoQ chromatography was monitored at 280 nm. Light Scattering Studies—The experiments were done according to van Holde et al. (11Van Holde K.E. Miller K. Schabtach E. Libertini L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. CCH subunits purified by Mono-Q chromatography were used in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 model spectrofluorometer. Scattered light was measured at 90° to the incident beam, with both entrance and exit monochromators set to 384 nm. The reassociation experiments were done at 20 °C, and buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm MgCl2 10 mm CaCl2 was added. Samples for electron microscopy analyses were taken and processed as described above. Amino Acid Composition—The amino acid analysis was done at the Protein/DNA Technology Center (Rockefeller University). Samples were hydrolyzed for 22 h at 110 °C in 6 n HCl containing 1% phenol. Waters PICO TAG equipment was employed, using Waters Millennium software, a pump model 510, and model 490 detectors. A Waters Novapak C18, 30-cm column was used. Mol % values were obtained from 9.18 μg and 12.53 μg of hydrolyzed protein from isolated subunits CCH-A and CCH-B, respectively. Amino-terminal Sequence—Soluble samples of CCH Mono-Q isolated subunits were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (49Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 261: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). They were sequenced by Edman degradation at the Protein/DNA Technology Center (Rockefeller University). Purification and Stability—Purification of CCH from hemolymph yielded a highly pure protein preparation, as assessed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column. Hemocyanin eluted as a single and symmetrical peak (Kav = 3.8), indicating that the protein was homogeneous in size (Fig. 1A). The molecular mass was about 8 MDa by extrapolation in a semilog plot of molecular mass versus Kav (Fig. 1B), a value similar to that of other well documented gastropod hemocyanins (1Van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of CCH was similar to other hemocyanins and showed three peaks, at 268, 344, and 550 nm, that corresponded to aromatic residues, Cu2+-O2+, and Cu2+-histidine coordination centers, respectively (Fig. 1C). A remarkable feature of CCH is that the presence of divalent cations is not needed in the buffers used for purification and storage. In contrast, the gastropod hemocyanins described previously require from 1 to 10 mm Ca2+ or Mg2+ to stabilize their huge structures (1Van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCH samples, stored in PBS at 4 °C for at least 3 years, maintained intact their quaternary structure, as verified by electron microscopy (data not shown). Structure—Fig. 2A shows an electron microscope preparation of purified CCH molecules negatively stained with uranyl. Circles of about 325 Å in diameter and rectangular specimens of about 392 Å in height were observed. At high magnification, the top views of the molecules (Fig. 2B), showed a dense core of about 153 Å in diameter (arrow 1), surrounded by a semiopaque ring of about 13 Å in width (arrow 2), with a fine dense ring boundary, surrounded by a clear annular zone of about 24 Å in width (arrow 3). Fig. 2C shows a side view of the molecule, displaying typical subunit structures arranged in layers of six parallel rows as indicated by the arrows. Didecamers were the most frequent forms observed, whereas decameric or multidecameric structures were scarce (Fig. 2D). Copper Content—CCH contains about 0.23% copper by weight, which corresponds to a molar ratio of 300 copper mol/mol of intact protein, like other mollusc hemocyanins (1Van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polypeptide Chains—The nonreducing SDS-PAGE and native gels analysis of the CCH indicated that the protein is composed of two different subunits (Fig. 3, A and C, respectively). Amino Acid Content—Table I presents the amino acid analyses of both CCH subunits and shows that both proteins exhibited homology for 14 of 16 amino acids; significant differences were found in asparagine (CCH-A > CCH-B) and lysine (CCH-B > CCH-A).Table IAmino acid composition in mol % of CCH-A and CCH-BAmino acidCCH-ACCH-BAla7.88.1Arg5.05,9Asn7.35.7CysNDaND, not determined.NDGlu11.110.2Gly3.13.3His4.54.6Ile4.54.7Leu13.214.0Lys1.01.5Met2.62.3Phe11.110.5Pro9.99.4Ser1.61.5Thr4.34.7TrpNDNDTyr5.95.9Val6.97.7a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab N-terminal Sequence Analysis—The CCH-A subunit was sequenced up to residue 11 (LMRKDVDTLTD) and CCH-B subunit, up to residue 7 (LXRKNVD); the hemocyanin motif is underlined (26Lieb B. Altenhein B. Markl J. Vincent A. van Olden E.V. van Holde K.E. Miller K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4546-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The sequence motifs between both subunits differ at least in one of five residues; CCH-A has an aspartic residue in the fourth position within the motif, whereas CCH-B has an asparagine residue. Isoelectric Point—The intact CCH molecule exhibited an isoelectric point near pH 6.0 in two separate experiments (data not shown). Description of the CCH Structure and Aging—As stated above, when analyzing recently purified CCH under nonreducing SDS-PAGE conditions, th"
https://openalex.org/W2145314868,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic growth factor known to be up-regulated in ischemic heart and hypoxic endothelial cells. However, the transcriptional regulation of VEGF in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is not fully understood. Transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) is a transcriptional factor family that can regulate many genes expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells by binding to myocyte-specific chloramphenicol acetyltransferase heptamer elements in the promoters of these genes. In this study, we demonstrated that related TEF-1 (RTEF-1), a member of the TEF-1 family, is up-regulated in hypoxic endothelial cells. Overexpression of RTEF-1 increases VEGF promoter activity and VEGF expression. Sequential deletion and site-directed mutation analyses of the VEGF promoter demonstrated that a GC-rich region containing four Sp1 response elements, located between –114 and –50, was essential for RTEF-1 function. This region is beyond the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α binding site and does not consist of M-CAT-related elements. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, RTEF-1 was found to interact with the first Sp1 residue (–97 to –87) of the four consecutive Sp1 elements. Binding activity of RTEF-1 to VEGF promoter is also confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In addition, induction of VEGF promoter activity by RTEF-1 results in an increase of angiogenic processes including endothelial cells proliferation and vascular structure formation. These results indicate that RTEF-1 acts as a transcriptional stimulator of VEGF by regulating VEGF promoter activity through binding to Sp1 site. In addition, RTEF-1-induced VEGF promoter activity was enhanced in a hypoxic condition, indicating that RTEF-1 may play an important role in the regulation of VEGF under hypoxia.

Elimination of the TEF-1 expression in the mouse causes cardiac defects and embryonic lethality (33Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Stewart et al. (34Stewart A.F. Richard III, C.W. Suzow J. Stephan D. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Adra C.N. Genomics. 1996; 37: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) cloned a TEF-1-related cDNA, encoding RTEF-1, from the human heart library. Although TEF-1 is responsible for more than 85% of M-CAT binding activity in rat cardiac myocytes, it has been reported that only RTEF-1 has the potential to mediate the reactivation of α1-adrenergic response to induce hypertrophy and reactivate cardiac and skeletal genes, such as β-myosin heavy chain and skeletal α-actin, through the M-CAT element in cardiac myocytes (35Stewart A.F. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, whether this transcription factor family is involved in regulation of other genes beyond muscle cells has not been fully studied. In the present study, we have determined that the expression of RTEF-1 was increased in endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions. We demonstrated that hypoxia-induced RTEF-1 expression in endothelial cells is linked to VEGF expression regulated by hypoxia. Interestingly, RTEF-1 is able to bind to the Sp1 site located in the GC-rich region of the VEGF promoter but not to M-CAT elements, although there are many M-CAT-like sequences existing in the VEGF promoter. Moreover, the location of the RTEF-1 binding to VEGF promoter is independent of the HIF-1α-binding site. We report here, for the first time, that RTEF-1 is a novel transcriptional factor targeting VEGF promoter and stimulating VEGF expression in endothelial cells, which contributes to the induction of VEGF expression in hypoxia. Cell Cultures and Transfection—The bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were transfected with DNA (1 μg/105 cells) using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and as described previously (36Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell R.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RTEF-1 stably expressed BAEC were selected with zeocin (300 μg/ml). VEGF promoter luciferase constructs (0.5 μg) and control vector pcDNA3.1/GS (1.0 μg) or equal amount of RTEF-1 cDNA were transfected. pcDNA/lacZ (0.01 μg) was cotransfected to determine the transfection efficiency of approximately 70–80%. After transfection, the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h before analysis. Hypoxic Incubation—Hypoxia was induced using a Modular Incubator Chamber (Billumps-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA). The hypoxia chamber was filled with artificial atmosphere, and the concentration of oxygen (<1%) was determined before and after incubation by using an Oxygen Analyzer (Vascular Technology, Bradford, MA). The hypoxia chamber containing cell culture dishes was transferred to a culture incubator according to the time schedule of the studies. Construction of the RTEF-1 Expression Vector and VEGF Promoter-Luciferase Plasmids—The full-length of RTEF-1 cDNA was obtained from Invitrogen and subcloned into a pcDNA3.1/GS expression vector in frame. The VEGF reporter constructs, containing sequences derived from the human VEGF promoter-driven expression of the firefly luciferase gene, were kindly provided by Dr. Debabrata Mukhopadhyay (37Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Briefly, the sequences were inserted into pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) and named according to the length of the fragment from the transcription start site in the 5′ and 3′ directions: VEGF 2.6 (–2361/+298), VEGF 1.5 (–1226/+298), VEGF 0.35 (–194/+157), VEGF 0.2 (–50/+15), and VEGF 0.07 (–50/+18). The encompassing sequence for the VEGF 0.22 (–71/+157) construct has been amplified by a PCR technique with flanking 5′-XhoI and 3′-HindIII enzyme restriction sites to facilitate directional cloning into the pGL2-Basic vector. The Sp1-I, and III mutant constructs, derived from the 0.35-kb VEGF promoter fragment using polymerase chain reaction, were inserted into pGL-2 basic luciferase expression vector (Promega) as described (38Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6161-6165PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs carrying two-nucleotide mutations (CC to tt) within the core Sp1 consensus sites (–104 to –50) were generated identically. Sp1-II and IV mutant constructs in pT81 vector, kindly gifted from Dr. Michael Höcker (13Schafer G. Cramer T. Suske G. Kemmner W. Wiedenmann B. Hocker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8190-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Berlin, Germany), were resubcloned into pGL-2 basic luciferase expression vector. All of the constructs were sequenced from the 5′- and 3′-ends to confirm orientation and sequence correctness. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—For [3H]thymidine incorporation, BAEC and BAEC stably overexpressing RTEF-1 DNA were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 4 h before harvesting. After washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized with 1 n NaOH, and neutralized with HCl. Aliquots equal to 0.1 volume of the solubilized material were counted in triplicate by liquid scintillation. Dishes that contained no cells were labeled and counted to provide background counts. Northern Blot Hybridization Analysis—Total RNA from BAEC was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol and was electrophoresed on a 1.3% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel. Hybridization was analyzed under stringent conditions with human RTEF-1 cDNAs radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP, using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and random oligonucleotides as primers (Promega). The blots were washed, and autoradiograms were developed after exposure to x-ray film at –70 °C, using a Cronex intensifying screen (DuPont, NY). Western Blot Analysis—BAEC were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in cold RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts Inc.) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and cocktailed protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Standard Assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and subsequently blocked in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 containing 7.5% nonfat milk. The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody, Santa Cruz; polyclonal anti-RTEF-1 antibody, Genemed Synthesis, Inc.), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The blots were developed using the ECL detection system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Matrigel Analysis—BD Matrigel™ Matrix Growth Factor Reduced (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) was diluted (1:1) with cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (total concentration, 100 μl/well) and coated on prechilled 24 well culture dish on ice. After Matrigel solidification for 30 min in an incubator, 5 × 104 BAEC with pcDNA 3.1/GS or RTEF-1 transfection was cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium onto Matrigel-coated wells. 24–48 h later, the extent of network formation was observed and photographed. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—The full length of human RTEF-1 cDNA encoding the entire open reading frames were inserted downstream of the T7 promoter into the pcDNA3.1/GS vector. Coupled in vitro transcription-in vitro translation reactions were performed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using the TnT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) and T7 RNA polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer. The plasmid vector pcDNA3.1/GS without an insert was used as a control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSAs were performed to identify the protein binding to the regulatory elements on the VEGF promoter. In vitro translated RTEF-1 products or cell extracts were prepared as described above. Double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to the sequence of regulatory elements, were synthesized by Invitrogen. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (500 ng) were radiolabeled by the 5′-end-labeled reaction in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptolethanol, 100 mm [γ-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 30 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). EMSA was carried out by incubating 5 μlof in vitro translated products or nuclear extracts with 25,000 cpm of γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide-bisacrylamide, 29:1), 0.25× Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 25mA for 4 h. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Marsh Bio Product, Rochester, NY) at –70 °C for 18 h. For competition experiments, the in vitro translated RTEF-1 products or nuclear extract were preincubated with excess unlabeled wild type or mutated double-stranded oligonucleotides before the addition of the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. Also, a supershift assay was performed by the incubation of RTEF-1 protein/nuclear extracts and oligonucleotide mixture with RTEF-1 antiserum (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at room temperature for 30 min before electrophoresis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the protocol from Dr. Farnham's laboratory (39Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, immunoprecipitation (IP) of transfected and formaldehyde-cross-linked BAEC were performed overnight at 4 °C using certain amount of RTEF-1 antiserum. 50% of the supernatant from the RTEF-1 antiserum-free IP was saved as “total input” chromatin and processed with the eluted IPs beginning with the reverse of formaldehyde cross-linking. After final ethanol precipitation, the TE (10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA) resuspended IP products were used as templates for PCR using two primers (5′-GCTGAGGCTCGCCTGTCCCCGCCCC-3′ and 5′-CAAATTCCAGCACCGAGCGCCCTGG-3′). These two primers were designed according to the sequences 5′ and 3′, respectively, to the putative Sp1-binding domain on the proximal portion of the VEGF promoter. 1× dilution buffer was used as a negative control (mock) for PCR. Statistics—The results are expressed based on triplet experiments as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RTEF-1 Is Inducible in Response to Hypoxia—From the results of a DNA microarray experiment on normoxic and hypoxic endothelial cells, we found that there is a 3-fold increase of RTEF-1 expression in endothelial cells under hypoxia compared with that in normoxia (data not shown). To confirm this observation, we performed a Northern blot analysis of RTEF-1 using total RNA derived from BAEC stimulated by a series of time points in hypoxia (<1% O2). RTEF-1 is induced by hypoxia, and its expression peaks at approximately 6 h in hypoxic endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). The effect of hypoxia on cellular RTEF-1 protein levels was also observed in a time-dependent manner. As Fig. 1B shows, changes in RTEF-1 protein expression by hypoxia demonstrate an early increase of expression at 6 h and remains significantly elevated above base-line values up to 24 h. RTEF-1 Induces VEGF Expression in Hypoxic Endothelial Cells—To further understand function of RTEF-1 in hypoxia and to determine the target genes of RTEF-1 in endothelial cells, overexpression of RTEF-1 in BAEC was generated by transfection of RTEF-1 cDNA. Among hypoxia-induced factors, we have found that the expression of the VEGF protein level was increased in RTEF-1 overexpressed cells as shown in Fig. 2A. The increase of VEGF expression was significantly enhanced additionally by RTEF-1 in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that induction of RTEF-1 in hypoxia plays an important role in increasing the expression of VEGF. As a transcriptional factor, we hypothesize that RTEF-1 may have some ability in regulating VEGF promoter. VEGF Is a Potential Target Gene for RTEF-1—To determine that RTEF-1 stimulates VEGF on its transcriptional level, the activities of a luciferase construct under the control of a VEGF promoter were measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, exposure of BAECs cotransfected with this construct with RTEF-1 cDNA led to a 2.2 ± 0.3-fold increase in luciferase activity, and also RTEF-1 transactived VEGF promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, compared with normoxia, exposure of BAECs cotransfected with VEGF promoter construct and RTEF-1 cDNA to hypoxia revealed a 2.7 ± 0.2-fold increase (Fig. 3B). These results imply that RTEF-1 regulates VEGF expression and that the increased VEGF promoter activity is enhanced under hypoxic conditions. Localization of Sequences Required for RTEF-1 on VEGF Promoter—It has been shown previously that the RTEF-1 regulating target gene is through the M-CAT element with the sequence CATN(T/C)(T/C) (18Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By searching the transcriptional factor-binding elements on the VEGF promoter region, it was found that many M-CAT-like elements exist, indicating that M-CAT elements on the VEGF promoter may be a binding site interacting with RTEF-1. To investigate this hypothesis, the region of the VEGF promoter required for RTEF-1 regulation was determined in BAEC by using a series of truncated VEGF promoter constructs. Overexpression of RTEF-1 in BAEC resulted in over 2-fold activation of the VEGF promoter activities in three different length of sequences: 2.6 kb (–2361/ +298), 1.5 kb (–1226/+298), and 0.35 kb (–194/+157) (Fig. 4A). Deletion of the VEGF promoter sequence from 2.6 to 0.35 kb did not affect the stimulation effect of RTEF-1. In contrast, deletion of the region between VEGF 0.35 kb (–194/+157) and VEGF 0.22 kb (–66/+157) abolished the RTEF-1-mediated effect (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that the possible generegulatory elements on VEGF promoter necessary for RTEF-1 induction are located between –194 and –66 of VEGF promoter sequence. Interestingly, none of the M-CAT elements in the VEGF promoter is found in this region. Moreover, this region is far beyond the HIF-1α-binding site on VEGF promoter (12Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). However, there are three consensus Sp1 (stimulating protein 1) elements, one transcription factor Egr-1 (early growth-response 1 gene product) elements, and two AP2 (activator protein 2) elements found in the VEGF promoter sequence of –194 to –66 (Fig. 4B). Sp1-I Is the Key Element to Induce VEGF Promoter Activity by RTEF-1—To demonstrate RTEF-1-binding sites on GC-rich area of the VEGF promoter, the potential impact on transcriptional activation of mutant-luciferase constructs were created and transfected into BAEC. The constructs comprised VEGF 0.35 mutant (Sp1-I, –97 to –90), VEGF0.35 mutant (Sp1-II, –86 to –79), and VEGF 0.35 mutant (Sp1-III, –75 to –68), in which critical two-nucleotide mutations were incorporated within the core Sp1 sites, and the shorter luciferase construct VEGF 0.22, which contains Sp1-IV and Egr1-II sites. As shown in Fig. 5A, analyses of the VEGF 0.35 mutant constructs VEGF 0.22 and VEGF 0.2 indicated that only VEGF 0.35 mutant (Sp1-I) could not retain the activity when stimulated by RTEF-1. These data suggest that VEGF transactivated by RTEF-1 is Sp1-dependent, and the Sp1-I-binding domain (–97 to –87) of the VEGF promoter is required for the stimulation of RTEF-1. To identify the specific regulatory element on the VEGF promoter binding by RTEF-1, two procedures were carried out. First, in vitro transcription/translation labeled with [35S]methionine to express RTEF-1 product from RTEF-1 cloned construct was performed. As shown in Fig. 5B, RTEF-1 cDNA translated to a 54-kDa protein, which is the same expected size of RTEF-1. Second, a series of double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the VEGF promoter Sp1 sequences were created and performed in EMSAs. The Sp1-I, -II, and -III oligonucleotides in the VEGF promoter were used to generate radiolabeled probes. In addition, two mutated double-stranded oligonucleotides, in which the Sp1-I consensus whole sequence was substituted with ttttttttttt (Mut I, –97 to –87) or CC of the core Sp1 sequence was substituted with tt (Mut II, –92 to –91), were used to determine the specificity of RTEF-1-Sp1-I binding. As shown in Fig. 5C, RTEF-1 was found to bind to the Sp1-I motif on the VEGF promoter by EMSA (specified by anti-RTEF-1 antiserum; band SS); there was no band at same position found in Sp1-II, Sp1-III, AP2, and Egr1-I-labeled complex. This complex from Sp1-I-labeled was specific because it was repressed by excessive (100×) unlabeled Sp1-I oligonucleotide. The DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5C, band C) was not eliminated by mutant Sp1-I consensus oligonucleotide (Mut I). However, the mutated core Sp1 oligonucleotide (Mut II) has an ability to compete with radiolabeled Sp1-I oligonucleotide to bind to RTEF-1 product, which competed away some of the DNA-protein complex. No DNA-protein complex was identified when mutated Sp1-I consensus oligonucleotide (Mut I) was used as a probe (data not shown). Supershifts were conducted with antiserum to RTEF-1. The addition of the RTEF-1-specific antiserum supe"

Ebp1, a protein isolated by its binding to ErbB3, inhibits cell growth and represses transcription of E2F-regulated cell cycle genes. Since Ebp1 shares 38% identity with a Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA-binding protein, we postulated that Ebp1 could bind E2F consensus elements in an HRG-inducible manner, leading to transcriptional repression. We show here that GST-Ebp1 bound to the DNA sequence bound by the S. pombe protein.

Endogenous Ebp1 was recruited to the E2F1 promoter in vivo as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Ebp1 bound E2F consensus oligonucleotides in association with E2F1, retinoblastoma protein, and HDAC2. HRG regulated the association of Ebp1 with E2F promoter sequences and enhanced the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription.

However, the mechanism by which HRG affects cell proliferation is still incompletely understood. Ebp1, a member of the PA2G4 gene family, was isolated as an ErbB3-binding protein in our laboratory (7Yoo J.Y. Wang X.W. Rishi A.K. Lessor T. Xia X.M. Gustafson T.A. Hamburger A.W. Br. J.

The ectopic expression of Ebp1 inhibits the growth of human breast and prostate cancer cells in vitro and induces cellular differentiation (9Lessor T.J. Yoo J.Y. Xia X. Woodford N. Hamburger A.W. J.

The ability of Ebp1 to repress E2F-regulated transcription has been linked to its ability to inhibit cell proliferation. However, neither the mechanism of Ebp1 transcriptional repression nor its possible regulation by HRG has been explored. Ebp1 is a member of the SF00553 protein superfamily, the prototype of which is a 42-kDa DNA-binding protein isolated from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (13Yamada H. Mori H. Momoi H. Nakagawa Y. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Blast analysis reveals that Ebp1 and the 42-kDa protein have 38% amino acid identity and 56% similarity. Of interest, the S. pombe protein preferentially binds to a synthetic curved DNA sequence. In addition, the murine homologue p38–2G4 was isolated as a DNA-binding protein from Ehrlich ascites cells (14Radomski N. Jost E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). P38–2G4 was also copurified with a DNA repair factor for acid-depurinated DNA (15Nakagawa Y. Watanabe S. Akiyama K. Sarker A.H. Tsutsui K. Inoue H. Seki S. Acta Med. Okayama. 1997; 51: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in determining whether Ebp1 could bind DNA either by itself or as part of a multiprotein complex, providing a possible mechanism for the ability of Ebp1 to repress E2F-regulated promoters. The E2F family of transcription factors are important in the control of cell cycle progression (16Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). E2F binding sites are found in the promoters of a number of genes involved in cell cycle progression such as cyclin D, cyclin E, c-myb, c-myc, and cdc2. Binding of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, and its family members p107 and p130 (17Rayman J.B. Takahashi Y. Indjeian V.B. Dannenberg J.H. Catchpole S. Watson R.J. te Riele H. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), to E2F on E2F-regulated promoters inhibits expression of many E2F-regulated genes, resulting in withdrawal from the cell cycle (18Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as BRG-1 and prohibitin through their binding with Rb (19Wang S. Zhang B. Faller D.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3019-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to repress transcription of E2F1-regulated genes via binding to E2F1 at its target promoters. C/EBPα can inhibit cell growth via direct repression of E2F-DP-mediated transcription. Whereas C/EBPα alone cannot bind E2F consensus sequences, C/EBPα is detected in a protein complex that binds to the E2F binding sites found in the E2F1 and dihydrofolate reductase promoters (20Slomiany B.A. D'Arico K.L. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that Ebp1, a repressor of E2F1 transcription with homology to DNA-binding proteins, might bind to E2F-regulated promoter sequences. In addition, we were interested in determining whether HRG could affect the ability of Ebp1 to interact with E2F-regulated promoters, thus providing one possible link between HRG-regulated ErbB signaling and cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that recombinant Ebp1 binds to the curved DNA sequence that is bound by the S. pombe protein (13Yamada H. Mori H. Momoi H. Nakagawa Y. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, Ebp1, as part of a protein complex containing E2F1, was associated with E2F promoter elements as demonstrated by EMSA, DNA affinity precipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Finally, HRG enhanced the ability of Ebp1 to bind to E2F consensus elements and to repress transcription. Cell Culture—All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids—The plasmids S10-15 and S15-12 were a kind gift of Dr. T. Mizuno (13Yamada H. Mori H. Momoi H. Nakagawa Y. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). S10-15 (200 bp) contains a tandem repeat of (GGCAAAAACG)15 flanked by the EcoRI-HindIII polylinker sequences of pUC19. S15-12 (233 bp) contains tandem repeats of the 15-mer (CCGGCAAAAACGGGC)12. The E2F1 reporter plasmid contains a 728-bp fragment of the E2F1 promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The GST-E2F1 and GST-DP1 plasmids have been previously described (21Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA-binding Activity by DNA-Cellulose Column Chromatography—A modification of the method of Radomski and Jost (14Radomski N. Jost E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was used. Bacterially synthesized Ebp1 (amino acids 1–372) was expressed in BL21 cells, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and eluted in the presence of reduced glutathione (11Xia X. Cheng A. Lessor T. Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GST-Ebp1 (5 μg) was suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a 0.5-ml column of native calf thymus DNA-cellulose (Sigma) equilibrated with binding buffer. Ebp1 was incubated for 90 min with rotation at room temperature. The column was then washed with 10 bed volumes of equilibration buffer to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of 0.05–1.0 m NaCl in binding buffer (100 μl/fraction). Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad kit. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with an antibody raised against His-tagged Ebp1 (11Xia X. Cheng A. Lessor T. Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of endogenous Ebp1 to bind DNA, MCF-7 cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The proteins were spun through an Amicon 30,000 filter and resuspended in binding buffer as above so that the final salt concentration was 30 mm. One ml (1 mg of protein) was added to the DNA-cellulose column, and proteins were incubated and eluted as described above. EMSA—To determine the ability of Ebp1 to bind to synthetic DNA, we used the DNA inserts cloned between the EcoRI-HindIII sites of either pUC19 S10-15 and S15-12. The DNA inserts were released by restriction enzyme digestion and gel-purified. The DNA was labeled using a 5′-end labeling kit (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD) and incubated with purified GST-Ebp1 as described below. In experiments determining the ability of Ebp1 to bind to an E2F oligonucleotide, an E2F consensus element derived from the human E2F-1 promoter (–35 to +1) (GGCTCTTTCGCGGCAAAAAGGATTTGGCGCGTAAAA) and containing two overlapping E2F consensus sites (indicated in boldface type) (21Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and the reverse complement were synthesized in the University of Maryland Core Biopolymer laboratory. Complementary strands were mixed in equimolar ratios in 5 mm MES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, for a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Strands were annealed by incubating the mixture at 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooling over a few hours to 20 °C. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled using a 5′-end labeling kit. Where indicated, we also used a 325-bp E2F1 promoter fragment (–324 to +1) (22Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) containing overlapping E2F1 site binding. DNA binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl, containing DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 5 μg of nuclear extract or GST-Ebp1, and 1 ng of [32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (∼20,000 cpm) labeled probes for 15 min on ice. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of either cold wild type or mutant oligonucleotides was used. The sequence (upper strand) of the mutant oligonucleotide was GGCTCTTTCATGGCAAAAAGGATTTGATGCGTAAA, with mutated bases indicated in boldface type. For Ebp1 supershift experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged ebp1 expression construct (11Xia X. Cheng A. Lessor T. Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), using the Fugene-6 reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (23Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with FLAG antibodies (M-2; Sigma), for 30 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions in 5% TBE-polyacrylamide gels at 120 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography film at –80 °C. DNA Affinity Precipitation—The method of Alliston et al. (24Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) was used as described. Briefly, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were lysed in HKMG buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Wild type and double mutant (M2) oligonucleotides of the same sequences as used for the EMSA assays were modified by the addition of biotin to the 5′-end of the coding strand. Single site mutants (M1) contained only one GC → AT substitution (see Fig. 3). All oligonucleotides were annealed with nonbiotinylated complementary oligonucleotides. For each biotinylated oligonucleotide reaction, 1 μg of annealed oligonucleotide was coupled to 50 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads (Promega), washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m NaCl. After coupling the oligonucleotides for 10 min at room temperature, the oligonucleotide-coupled beads were washed repeatedly in the same solution using a magnetic stand (Promega) to precipitate the beads between each wash. Washed beads were added to 200 μg of cell lysates and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) with a final concentration of 4 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 170 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubating overnight at 4 °C, beads were washed repeatedly in 16 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 MM EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% glycerol. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as previously described (25Xia X. Lessor T.J. Zhang Y. Woodford N. Hamburger A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antibodies to HDAC2 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (S. San Francisco, CA), and those to E2F1 and Rb (C-15) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were carried out using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) essentially as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). DNA was sheared on ice to the appropriate lengths (∼500 base pairs) with three sets of 10-s pulses at 20% maximal output followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were mixed, aliquoted, and diluted in NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture) for a final volume of 1.5 ml. A portion of the diluted cell supernatant (1%) was kept to have cross-links reversed and quantitate the amount of DNA present in samples for the PCR protocol. After preclearing with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C, immunoprecipitation was performed overnight on a rotary shaker at 4 °C with specific antibodies or nonspecific IgG as a control. The samples were then mixed with sonicated salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) and Protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) for another 6-h incubation. Agarose beads were washed sequentially in low salt, high salt, LiCl, and TE buffer provided with the kit and extracted two times with freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate, 20 μg of tRNA in 2 volumes of ethanol at –20 °C overnight. The DNA pellets were dissolved in 50 μlof water. Nested PCR amplification of a 203-bp E2F1 promoter fragment (–65 to +137) was carried out using a 5′ primer (5′-AGCCAATTGTGGCGGCGCT-3′) and a 3′ primer (5′-CCAAGGCCATGACGCTCAC-3′). The PCR products were resolved on 2.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Luciferase Assays—MCF-7 cells were plated in 12-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described (11Xia X. Cheng A. Lessor T. Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with the E2F1 luciferase reporter construct (0.5 μg), a Renilla thymidine kinase control luciferase plasmid (Promega), and the ebp1 expression plasmid at the concentrations indicated as previously described (12Zhang Y.X. Woodford N. Xia X.M. Hamburger A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2168-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were switched to phenol-red free RPMI 1640 medium with 1% charcoal-stripped serum containing either 0, 10, or 100 ng/ml HRG β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells lysates were collected 24 h later, and luciferase activity was assessed using a Promega dual luciferase assay kit (Madison, WI). Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test. Significance was established at p < 0.05. DNA Binding Properties of Ebp1—Ebp1 is a member of the SF00553 superfamily of proteins, the prototype of which is the yeast 42-kDa DNA-binding protein. However, the ability of Ebp1 to bind DNA has not been directly tested. Therefore, we first determined the ability of recombinant GST-Ebp1 to bind to native calf thymus DNA-cellulose under conditions described for the isolation of p38–2G4 (14Radomski N. Jost E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A portion of the bacterially synthesized GST-Ebp1 was retained on a column of native calf thymus DNA and eluted at 0.2 m salt. When nuclear extracts prepared from MCF 7 cells were applied to this column, a portion of the input Ebp1 protein was retained and eluted at 0.2–0.5 M NaCl (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the murine homologue p38–2G4 was initially detected in nuclear extracts by its ability to elute from DNA affinity columns between 0.1 and 0.4 m NaCl (14Radomski N. Jost E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As we determined that Ebp1 bound DNA-cellulose, we tested the ability of Ebp1 to associate with the DNA sequence bound by the yeast prototype protein. The S10-15 DNA has previously been demonstrated to have an overall and strong curvature (13Yamada H. Mori H. Momoi H. Nakagawa Y. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, S15-12 has nearly the same base composition, but shows no detectable signs of overall DNA curvature. Recombinant GST-Ebp1 was incubated with either the 200-bp S10-15 or the 233-bp S15-12 insert, and binding ability was assessed using EMSA analysis. Fig. 1B shows that GST-Ebp1, but not GST, bound the S10-15 DNA. The binding was specifically competed by cold S10-15 DNA. Ebp1, similar to the yeast 42-kDa protein, failed to bind to the linear S15-12 sequence. The E2F consensus element derived from the E2F1 promoter (GGCTCTTTTCGCGGCAAAAAGGATTGGCGCGTAAAA) has homology to the repeat element of the S10-15 plasmid (i.e.CGGCAAAAAGG). Therefore, we tested whether E2F1 could also bind to the S10-15 element. GST-Ebp1 and GST-E2F1 were incubated with the 200-bp S10-15 insert, and their binding ability was assessed using EMSA analysis. Ebp1 bound the S10-15 element as expected. E2F1 also bound the S10-15 probe, and this binding was specifically competed by cold S10-15 (Fig. 1C). Purified Recombinant Ebp1 Fails to Bind E2F Promoters— Since Ebp1 has been shown to affect E2F-mediated transcription, we examined whether Ebp1 might directly bind to either the E2F1 consensus element or the 325 bp (–324 to +1) wild type functional promoter (22Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed GST-Ebp1 was used in an EMSA with the E2F1 consensus oligonucleotide. GST-Ebp1, at concentrations similar to and higher than those used in the assay with S10-15 DNA, failed to bind to the E2F consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A). As the ability of Ebp1 to bind to S10-15 was dependent on the curvature of the DNA, we also used the 325-bp E2F1 promoter, which has been shown to have a strong curvature (21Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as a probe in EMSAs. Results indicated that recombinant GST-Ebp1 alone also failed to bind to this DNA sequence (Fig. 2B). To determine whether recombinant E2F1 could induce the binding of Ebp1 to the E2F1 consensus oligonucleotide, we added increasing amounts of Ebp1, E2F1, and DP-1 to the oligonucleotide probe. E2F1 alone did not bind to the oligonucleotide as previously reported (26Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The addition of recombinant GST-E2F1 to Epb1 even in the presence of DP-1 did not induce the binding of Ebp1 to the consensus element. Under these circumstances, nuclear extracts of HeLa cells bound the oligonucleotide as expected (Fig. 2C). Ebp1 Is Found in E2F Binding Complexes in HeLa Cells— Since Ebp1 contained in nuclear extracts bound DNA-cellulose with greater affinity than GST-Ebp1, we determined whether Ebp1 contained in nuclear extracts could bind to the E2F consensus oligonucleotide. Since we did not have an Ebp1 antibody that could supershift, we transiently transfected log phase HeLa cells with a FLAG-tagged Ebp1 expression vector (25Xia X. Lessor T.J. Zhang Y. Woodford N. Hamburger A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FLAG protein of the appropriate molecular weight was expressed as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). EMSAs using the consensus E2F1 oligonucleotide revealed the presence of several complexes (arrows) in keeping with previous data (27DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 28Degregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5846-5847Crossref Google Scholar, 29Farhana L. Dawson M. Rishi A.K. Zhang Y. Van Buren E. Trivedi C. Reichert U. Fang G. Kirschner M.W. Fontana J.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3842-3849PubMed Google Scholar). The formation was specific as a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type (lanes 3 and 9) but not mutant (lane 10), DNA competed for binding (Fig. 3A). Antibody to E2F1 supershifted the lower two bands (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The FLAG antibody disrupted the lowest specific band in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Nonspecific IgG had no effect (Fig. 3A, lanes 11 and 12). These data indicate that Ebp1 derived from HeLa cell nuclear extracts binds to DNA as a complex with E2F1. The presence of cyclin A on E2F promoters was similarly demonstrated by the disruption of a specific complex in EMSAs (30Hara E. Okamoto S. Nakada S. Taya Y. Sekiya S. Oda K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1023-1032PubMed Google Scholar). We next used a ChIP assay to elucidate whether Ebp1 and E2F1 could associate in vivo on the chromatin of the endogenous E2F1 promoter. Both endogenous Ebp1 and E2F1 were found to associate with a segment of genomic DNA that could be PCR-amplified using primers spanning E2F1 elements present in the E2F1 promoter (–65 to +137) (22Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). These data further suggest that Ebp1 interacts with E2F1 on E2F1-responsive promoters in vivo. Recruitment of Ebp1 to the E2F1 Response Element—The foregoing data suggested that Ebp1 might bind to E2F1 response elements via its association with other nuclear proteins. We therefore used DNA affinity precipitation assays to identify proteins that associate with Ebp1 at E2F1 consensus elements. Endogenous Ebp1 from HeLa cell lysates specifically bound to a biotinylated wild type E2F consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, A and B). Ebp1 failed to bind to a mutant oligonucleotide (M2) (Fig. 4A) with two GC → AT substitutions in the E2F binding site, suggesting that E2F elements are necessary for Ebp1 binding. E2F1 was detected in the complex as expected. Rb protein was also found in this complex, in keeping with our previous data that indicated that Ebp1 binds E2F1 indirectly through Rb (11Xia X. Cheng A. Lessor T. Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Ebp1 binds to HDAC2 (12Zhang Y.X. Woodford N. Xia X.M. Hamburger A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2168-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that the ability of Ebp1 to recruit HDAC2 is related to its ability to repress transcription. In the present study, HDAC2 was observed in the same DNA-protein complex as Ebp1, Rb, and E2F (Fig. 4B). HRG Induces Ebp1 Association with the E2F Consensus Sequence and Enhances Ebp1 Transcriptional Repression—Both the phosphorylation of Ebp1 (8Lessor T.J. Hamburger A.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and its ability to associate with ErbB3 are regulated by HRG (7Yoo J.Y. Wang X.W. Rishi A.K. Lessor T. Xia X.M. Gustafson T.A. Hamburger A.W. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in determining whether HRG could affect the ability of Ebp1 to bind to E2F consensus elements. We incubated HeLa cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h prior to the addition of HRG (20 ng/ml) and then evaluated the ability of Ebp1 derived from nuclear lysates to bind the E2F oligonucleotide using DNA affinity precipitation. HRG induced a marked increase in Ebp1 binding at 5 and 15 min after HRG addition. Binding was decreased at 30 min but increased again 60 min after HRG treatment. There was no change in Ebp1 total protein levels at any of these time points. E2F1 protein associated with DNA was approximately equal at all time points (Fig. 5). HDAC2 was associated with the DNA at all time points tested (Fig. 5). Finally, we reasoned that if HRG could change the affinity of Ebp1 for the E2F consensus sequence, it could affect Ebp1-induced repression of the E2F1-regulated E2F1 promoter. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with an E2F1 luciferase reporter plasmid and limiting amounts of an ebp1 expression construct. As expected, ebp1 at low concentrations (0.1 μg) reduced E2F1 luciferase activity 35%. Maximal inhibition of 80% was observed at 0.5 μg of ebp1 plasmid. Low concentrations of HRG (10 ng/ml), previously demonstrated to induce cell proliferation (31Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. Oren M. Chin D.M. Lyass L. Zelnick C.R. Kazarov A. Toyofuku W. Gray-Bablin J"
https://openalex.org/W1979524222,"Epithelium-specific ETS (ESE)-1 is a prototypic member of a novel subset of the ETS transcription factor family that is predominantly expressed in cells of epithelial origin but can also be induced in other cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. To further define the molecular mechanisms by which the transcriptional activity of ESE-1 is regulated, we have focused our attention on identifying proteins that interact with ESE-1. We have determined that Ku70, Ku86, p300, and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are ESE-1 interacting proteins. The Ku proteins have previously been shown to bind to breaks in DNA where they function to recruit additional proteins that promote DNA repair. Interestingly, Ku70 and Ku 86 negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of ESE-1. Using a series of deletion constructs, we have determined that the Ku proteins bind to the DNA-binding domain of ESE-1. The Ku proteins inhibit the ability of ESE-1 to bind to oligonucleotide probes in gel mobility shift assays. The finding that Ku proteins can interact with other transcription factors and block their function has not been previously demonstrated. In contrast, co-transfection of p300 and CBP with ESE-1 enhances the transcriptional activity of ESE-1. Moreover, the induction of ESE-1 in response to inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 is associated with a parallel increase of the expression of p300 in vascular endothelial cells, suggesting that in the setting of inflammation, the transcriptional activity of ESE-1 is positively modulated by interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300. In summary, our results demonstrated that the activity of ESE-1 is positively and negatively modulated by other interacting proteins including Ku70, Ku86, p300, and CBP.

https://openalex.org/W1988534457,"Transcription factors that regulate gene expression during adipogenesis also control the expression of genes of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, in particular, the mitochondrial uncoupling protein gene (Ucp1). There is evidence that a plasticity exists among adipocytes in which activation of the Ucp1 gene together with mitochondrial biogenesis can increase the brown adipocyte character of white fat. To understand this process, we have characterized the changes in transcription that occur in interscapular brown adipocytes during development. We have found dramatic reductions in both DNA-binding activity to probes and immunoreactive protein for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, retinoid X receptor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, and cAMP-response element-binding protein regulatory motifs in nuclear extracts when mice reach adulthood. Exposure of adult mice to the cold, which reactivates Ucp1 expression, leads to a re-accumulation of factors in the nucleus. We propose that transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm as mice age under conditions of reduced thermogenesis. Changes in isoform sub-types for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and cAMP-response element-binding proteins indicate an additional level of control on gene expression during thermogenesis. The increased movement of the RIIβ protein kinase A regulatory subunit into the nucleus with age suggests a mechanism for regulating the phosphorylation of transcription factors in the nucleus in response to the thermogenic requirements of the animal. Nuclear factor-κB has been used as a model to demonstrate that the nuclear localization of transcription factors in brown fat are reduced during post-natal development. Furthermore, it was found by immunofluorescence that adrenergic stimulation of primary adipocyte cultures causes an increase of both the protein kinase A catalytic α-subunit and nuclear factor-κB into the nucleus.

Here, we show that a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle is also important for RNA polymerase I-dependent synthesis of rRNA precursors. A key component of the Pol II transcription system is Fcp1p, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest Pol II subunit. Fcp1p stimulates transcription elongation and is required for Pol II recycling after transcription termination. We found that Fcp1p is also part of the RNA Pol I transcription apparatus. Fcp1p is required for efficient rDNA transcription in vivo, and also, recombinant Fcp1p stimulates rRNA synthesis both in promoter-dependent and in nonspecific transcription assays in vitro. We demonstrate that Fcp1 activity is not involved in the formation of the initiation-active form of Pol I (the Pol I-Rrn3p complex) and propose that dephosphorylation of Pol I by Fcp1p facilitates chain elongation during rRNA synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2049816025,"In the absence of other proteins, the DNA polymerase (Pol-8) of Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus incorporates only several nucleotides from a primer template. However, association with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus processivity factor (PF-8) enables Pol-8 to incorporate thousands of nucleotides. Unlike the well described sliding clamp processivity factors, eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen and <i>Escherichia coli</i> β-subunit, PF-8 and other herpesvirus processivity factors do not require a clamp loader or ATP to bind to template DNA. To begin to understand the mechanism used by PF-8 to achieve processivity, we have now purified PF-8 and demonstrated that it is a dimer both in solution and on the DNA. Mutational analysis of the PF-8 protein (396R) indicates that residues between 277 and 304 as well as the N-terminal 21 amino acids are required for dimerization. The results further correlate PF-8 dimerization with binding to Pol-8 and stabilizing Pol-8 on primer template. Notably, although removal of only 26 residues from the C terminus of PF-8 does not affect its ability to form dimers on DNA or to bind Pol-8, only short DNA chains (<100 nucleotides) are synthesized. This indicates that full-length PF-8 is necessary to enable Pol-8 to incorporate thousands of nucleotides. Interestingly, cross-linking of the processivity factor UL44 of cytomegalovirus reveals that it is a dimer in solution also."
https://openalex.org/W2046518261,"Mediator complexes are large multiprotein assemblies that function in the regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. In yeast, certain mediator subunits appear to comprise a subcomplex that acts in the regulation of a specific subset of genes. We investigated in a metazoan, Caenorhabditis elegans, the roles and interactions of two of those subunits, CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22. We found that CeTRAP240/let-19 contains four domains that are conserved in the human TRAP240 protein and that one of those domains displays intrinsic transcriptional repression activity. Using RNA interference, we found that reduced expression of CeTRAP240/let-19 displayed a high penetrance of embryonic lethality in F1 progeny; animals that escaped embryonic arrest showed mutant phenotypes such as burst vulva and molting defects. CeTRAP240/let-19 appeared to affect specific genes, as CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) led to selectively reduced expression of a subset of reporter genes examined. Genetic experiments supported the view that CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22, like their Drosophila and yeast counterparts, can operate on common pathways. Thus, a male tail phenotype caused by the pal-1(e2091) mutation was suppressed not only by CeTRAP230/dpy-22 mutants, as reported previously, but also by reduced expression of CeTRAP240/let-19. Additionally, CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) in a CeTRAP230/dpy-22 mutant background produced a strong synthetic lethal phenotype. Overall, our results establish specific roles of CeTRAP240/let-19 in C. elegans embryonic development and a functional interaction between CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22. Interestingly, whereas this interaction has been conserved from yeast to mammals, the subcomplex modulates metazoan-specific genetic pathways, likely in addition to those also controlled in yeast.

The Mediator complex serves as a vehicle for physical and functional communication between DNA-bound regulatory factors and the transcription initiation apparatus; this communication can include enzymatic modifications as well as simple contacts (5Carlson M.

Biochemical approaches have yielded numerous distinguishable mammalian Mediator-related complexes. For example, CRSP was isolated by conventional chromatography based on its ability to potentiate activation by Sp1 (14Naar A.M. Ryu S. Tjian R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Cell. 1998; 2: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); ARC has been fractionated into two complexes, one of which, ARC-L, lacks apparent activation activity in vitro (24Taatjes D.J. Naar A.M. Andel I.F. Nogales E. Tjian R. Science. 2002; 295: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Whether the compositional or functional differences among mammalian Mediator-related complexes observed in vitro reflect the existence of multiple complexes in vivo remains to be determined. However, in yeast, biochemical evidence for certain subcomplexes of Mediator components is underpinned by genetic data, and it appears that some of those subcomplexes mediate the transcriptional regulation of distinct subsets of genes (8Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 9Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the twenty identified mammalian Mediator subunits are conserved across the eukaryotes (25Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and certain inferred mammalian Mediator subcomplexes parallel those previously validated in yeast. For example, TRAP230 (also called ARC240/DRIP240), TRAP240 (also called ARC250/DRIP250), cyclin-dependent kinase 8, and cyclin C are found in ARC-L, but are absent from the smaller CRSP complex (24Taatjes D.J. Naar A.M. Andel I.F. Nogales E. Tjian R. Science. 2002; 295: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the subcomplex comprised of their respective yeast orthologs, Srb8, Srb9, Srb10, Srb11 (26Borggrefe T.

Similarly, a Mediator complex purified from murine cells lacking TRAP100 is also devoid of TRAP95 and SUR2 (27Ito M. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3464-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that these three subunits may form a subcomplex; consistent with this view, the Mediator isolated from murine cells lacking SUR2 correspondingly lacks TRAP95 and TRAP100 (28Stevens J.L. Cantin G.T. Wang G. Shevchenko A. Berk A.J. Science. 2002; 296: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, although TRAP95 and SUR2 are conserved from yeast to mammals, TRAP100 appears to be a metazoan-specific Mediator subunit (25Boube M. Joulia L. Cribbs D.L. Bourbon H.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate that Mediator complexes of differing composition may have acquired new roles during evolution, acting in concert on subsets of genes that accommodate the specialized needs of metazoans while maintaining many of the functions evolved earlier. To examine this possibility, we have undertaken an analysis of Mediator complexes, subcomplexes, and component subunits in Caenorhabditis elegans, with its genetic manipulability, defined cellular lineage, and limited tissue complexity. In this report, we focused on the C. elegans ortholog of TRAP240 and Srb9, CeTRAP240/let-19. 1During the course of this work H. Sawa (RIKEN, Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe, Japan) showed that CeTRAP240 is identical to the let-19 gene and CeTRAP2308 and sop-1 are identical to the previously identified dpy-22 gene.1During the course of this work H. Sawa (RIKEN, Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe, Japan) showed that CeTRAP240 is identical to the let-19 gene and CeTRAP2308 and sop-1 are identical to the previously identified dpy-22 gene. We set out to isolate the full-length CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA and to characterize its expression pattern. We also sought to assess the in vivo functions and potential genetic interactions of CeTRAP240 with C. elegans TRAP230 and Srb8 ortholog, CeTRAP230/dpy-22.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Isolation of CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA—The full-length CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using mix-staged N2 total RNA. RT-PCR was performed according to the manual of the SuperScript one-step RT-PCR for long template kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocol. The CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA was isolated as three fragments. (i) The 5′ end was isolated by RT-PCR using an SL1 primer (GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG) and a primer that encompasses a KpnI site in CeTRAP240 (AAGGTACCAAATGTTCGATGC); this RT-PCR product was amplified again by primers GGGGTACCATGTCCTCCGCCAAGGATAG and AAGGTACCAAATGTTCGATGC. (ii) The middle region was amplified by RT-PCR using primers TTGGTACCTTGGCTCAGAAAG and TTCTGCAGCAAATGTTCGATGCGGCGCC. (iii) The 3′ end was amplified by RT-PCR using primers ACCTGCAGAAACTCCATTTGA and AACTGCAGCTAGGCAAGTAGACGAGCC. The three fragments were digested by KpnI, KpnI/PstI, and PstI, respectively, and then sub-cloned into pBluescript KS (+) plasmid (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. Identification of CeTRAP240/let-19 Expression Pattern—The CeTRAP240/let-19 promoter to first exon was amplified by PCR of cosmid K08F8 (provided by the Sanger Center) using primers AATCTAGAATTACGTTGGTTAAAAG and CGCGGATCCGCCAAAATGTATTTGGAGAATTATATT. This genomic fragment was digested by XbaI and BamHI and subcloned in-frame into the pPD95.75 plasmid. This construct (50 ng/μl) was then injected into N2 hermaphrodites along with pRF4 (rol-6, 50 ng/μl) as a marker. Multiple extrachromosomal transgenic arrays were generated; multiple animals were examined in each transgenic strain, and all displayed similar GFP expression patterns. RNA Interference—For CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi), sequences corresponding to nucleotides 4105–5386 of CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript KS (+). This plasmid was digested by PvuII, and single strand RNAs were synthesized using the Ambion MEGA-script T3 and T7 in vitro transcription kit. To make dsRNA, equal amounts of sense and antisense strand RNA were mixed well and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 65 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 5 min, 37 °C for 5 min, and 25 °C for 5 min. The dsRNA was then injected into N2 hermaphrodites. The injected worms were placed on plates to recover for 18–24 h. After the recovery period the worms were moved to fresh plates for embryo collection. Worms were allowed to lay eggs for 8–12-h intervals and then transferred to a new plate. Embryonic arrest was measured 18–24 h after the end of the egg-laying interval. Larval growth was monitored daily, and larvae that did not progress to the adult stage by day 4 post-hatch were scored as larval arrest. To confirm our CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) results, an additional dsRNA that corresponds to the C terminus of CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA (yk398g7) was also used for RNA interference (RNAi) experiments. Although of lower potency, the latter dsRNA produced results consistent with those reported here. For CeTRAP230/dpy-22(RNAi), the EST clone yk222f3 was digested with either PvuI or PvuII, and single-stranded RNAs were synthesized using the Ambion MEGA-script T3 and T7 in vitro transcription kit. Production of dsRNA and RNAi experiments were performed as described above. To confirm the results from CeTRAP230/dpy-22(RNAi), dsRNA synthesized from the PvuII fragment of another EST clone, yk294f12, was used and yielded results similar to those using yk222f3 dsRNA. For bacterial feeding RNAi experiments, cDNA corresponding to the nucleotide sequence 3541–5386 of CeTRAP240 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the KpnI and PstI sites of plasmid pAD12 (provided by Andy Dillon, University of California, San Francisco), which contains two T7 promoters in inverted orientation. This construct was then transformed into an IPTG-inducible Escherichia coli strain, HT115, which lacks double-strand-specific RNase III. Single colonies of HT115 containing pAD12 were picked and grown in culture for 18–24 h with 120 μg/ml carbenicillin and tetracycline and seeded on NGM-lite plates containing 1 mm IPTG and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. L1 hermaphrodites were placed on these plates for 2 days; L4 or young adults were then transferred to new plates seeded with the same bacteria. The worms were allowed to lay eggs for 24 h. Embryonic arrest was assessed 24 h later, and larval growth was monitored daily. Immunostaining—Immunostaining of C. elegans embryos using antibody against Ser(P)-2 (H5) of polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) was as previously described (38Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Blackwell T.K.

Transient Transfection, Luciferase Assay, and Cell Culture—To construct an expression plasmid that encodes the C terminus of CeTRAP240/LET-19, the nucleotide sequences of CeTRAP240/LET-19 corresponding to amino acids 2229–2863 were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs CGGGATCCGTTGGAAACAGCGCGACACTC and ACTCTAGACTAGGCAAGTAGACGAGCC. This PCR fragment was then digested by BamHI and XbaI and subcloned into pSG424 plasmid (39Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).

A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells employed LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the technical manual; cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. CeTRAP240 cDNA and Expression Pattern—A Blast search identified a single C. elegans ortholog of hTRAP240 protein (C. elegans clone K08F8.6). We amplified the full-length CeTRAP240 cDNA by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from mixed-stage animals. To confirm our results, we sequenced an EST clone (yk288e10) encoding the 3′ end of CeTRAP240/let-19. Amino acid sequence alignment of CeTRAP240 and hTRAP240 revealed four homologous domains, as shown in Fig. 1, A–E. Interestingly, our RT-PCR also identified a shorter CeTRAP240/let-19 cDNA that lacks the fourth and most C-terminal homologous domain. These results suggest that the CeTRAP240 transcription unit may be subject to alternative splicing in a manner that yields two protein isoforms.Fig. 1A, comparison of CeTRAP240/LET-19 and hTRAP240 proteins. Four regions (I, II, III, and IV) of strong similarity are indicated together with the primary amino acid sequences. The identity/similarity/gap between these two proteins are: region I, 29/46/12; region II, 35/54/23; region III, 27/48/2; region IV, 29/45/20.

E, the sequence comparison between CeTRAP240/LET-19 and hTRAP240 region IV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To visualize the expression pattern of CeTRAP240/let-19, a DNA fragment extending 2.0 kilobases upstream of the translation start site was cloned in-frame into a GFP-encoding plasmid, pPD95.75. This construct was microinjected into N2 worms along with the pRF4 (rol-6) plasmid as a transformation marker. Ubiquitous GFP expression was observed in the embryo (Fig. 2A, panel a). In larvae and adults, GFP expression was observed in most tissues, including vulva (Fig. 2A, panel b), tail neurons (Fig. 2A, panel c), skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A, panel c, arrow), hypodermal cells (Fig. 2A, panel c, yellow arrow), the H-shaped excretory canal (Fig. 2A, panel d) and pharynx (data not shown). CeTRAP240/let-19 RNAi Phenotypes—We used RNAi to compare the developmental consequences of down-regulating CeTRAP240/let-19; phenotypes were scored in F1 animals. Injection of a CeTRAP240 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, 2 μg/μl) that corresponds to the middle region of the CeTRAP240/let-19-coding region resulted in a >90% embryonic lethality. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed that accumulation of CeTRAP240/let-19 transcripts was selectively affected, because levels of CeRgr1 mRNA, for example, were unchanged (data not shown). Most embryos were arrested at the 200–300 cell stage, and thus, lacked differentiated cells (Fig. 2B, panel a); a small proportion of the embryos were arrested at later stages, such as the comma, 2- or 3-fold stages. As a control, injection of full-length rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) dsRNA did not produce significant mutant phenotypes. When we reduced the concentration of injected CeTRAP240/let-19 dsRNA 10-fold (0.2 μg/μl), a greater proportion of animals escaped arrest and displayed a range of mutant adult phenotypes, including abnormal body morphology (Fig. 2B, panel b and c), withered tail (Fig. 1C, panel d), defective cuticle shedding (Fig. 2B, panel d), multivulva (Fig. 2B, panel e), and dumpy and burst vulva (data not shown). All of these mutant phenotypes are characteristic of defects in hypodermal development. Importantly, CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) caused a more severe phenotype (embryonic versus larval lethality) than the let-19 homozygous allele, which also showed molting defects and multivulva phenotypes (data not shown). 3H. Sawa, personal communication. Thus, these results suggest that the CeTRAP240/let-19 homozygous allele is not a null mutant. The CeTRAP240/let-19 mutant lacks the conserved hTRAP240 C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, A and E). We fused the C-terminal domain to the GAL4 DNA binding domain to test whether this domain contains intrinsic transcriptional regulatory activity. Interestingly, this GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein (GAL4-LET-19/C) inhibited transcription from a (GAL4)5E1BLuc reporter in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 2C); the repression activity of GAL4-LET-19/C was as potent as a fusion of GAL4 to TLE1, a human ortholog of the Drosophila Groucho corepressor (Fig. 2C). How the repression activity of the CeTRAP240/LET-19 C-terminal domain relates to the phenotypes of CeTRAP240/let-19 has not yet been explored. Effects of Mediator Components on Expression from Reporter Gene Promoters—To investigate whether the requirement of CeTRAP240/let-19 in embryogenesis reflects a role in general embryonic gene transcription, we first analyzed phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) large subunit CTD, which consists of heptapeptide repeats, YSPTSPS; full polymerase activity requires phosphorylation of Ser-2 and Ser-5 within these repeats. As shown in Fig. 2A, depletion of the pol II large subunit (AMA-1) by RNAi leads to a dramatic reduction in detection of transcriptionally active pol II by an antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser-2 (38Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30413-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, although CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) caused an embryonic lethal phenotype, like ama-1(RNAi), reduced expression of CeTRAP240/let-19 did not influence the phosphorylation status of CTD Ser-2 in embryos (Fig. 3A); similarly, CeTRAP230/dpy-22(RNAi), which resulted in a 20–30% of embryonic lethal phenotype in F1 progeny, did not influence CTD Ser-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22 act selectively in gene expression rather than being required for general transcription. To examine whether CeTRAP240/let-19 is only required for the expression of specific genes, we injected CeTRAP240/let-19 dsRNA into C. elegans strains bearing a series of integrated reporter::GFP fusion genes. We first tested the requirement of CeTRAP240/let-19 on pes-10::GFP, which is expressed at the onset of embryonic transcription (Fig. 3B, panel 1) and ubiquitously expressed sur-5::GFP (Fig. 3B, panel 2). Interestingly, reduction of CeTRAP240/let-19 activity by RNAi did not influence the expression of these two reporters. We next tested the effect of CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) on reporter constructs containing the promoters from genes that are expressed in certain cell types or developmental stages. Reduction of CeTRAP240/let-19 diminished hlh-1::GFP (a muscle cell marker, Fig. 3B, panel 3), end-1::GFP (an endodermal marker, Fig. 3B, panel 4), and elt-5::GFP expression (an epidermis/seam cell marker, Fig. 3B, panel 5) but not nhr-2::GFP (an early developmental maker that begins to express at 16-cell stage but disappears during the initial stages of morphogenesis; Fig. 3B, panel 6), pha-4::GFP (a digestive tract maker, Fig. 3B, panel 7), and med-1::GFP (a mesendodermal marker; Fig. 3B, panel 8). Although we have not determined if these genes are direct targets of CeTRAP240/let-19 activity, our results suggest that CeTRAP240/let-19 is responsible for the expression of a specific subset of genes rather than for general embryonic gene expression. Together, our results suggest that CeTRAP240/let-19 is selectively involved in multiple developmental pathways. Suppression of the pal-1(2091) Phenotype by Inhibition of Mediator Expression—CeTRAP240/let-19 is the C. elegans ortholog of Srb9, which in yeast forms a subcomplex with Srb8, -10, and -11 (26Borggrefe T. Davis R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44202-44207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether CeTRAP240/let-19 interacts during C. elegans development with other components of its orthologous subcomplex. Previous work had been done on the C. elegans ortholog of Srb8, CeTRAP230/dpy-22; several mutant alleles of that gene, such as sop-1, suppress a mutant male tail phenotype of pal-1(e2091) (37Zhang H. Emmons S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Animals carrying the pal-1(e2091) mutation fail to develop V6 rays in the adult male tail (Ref. 37Zhang H. Emmons S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Fig. 4A). We first confirmed that CeTRAP230/dpy-22(RNAi) in the pal-1(e2091) strain results in 80–90% rescue of the male tail phenotype (Ref. 37Zhang H. Emmons S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2161-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Fig. 4D). We then tested the effect of CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) on the mutant male tail phenotype of pal-1(e2091). Indeed, CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) yielded 57% of F1 male pal-1(e2091) worms with fully (Fig. 4B) or partially (Fig. 4C) recovered tails (Fig. 4D). As a control, GR dsRNA injected into pal-1(e2091) produced little or no suppression of the male tail phenotype, similar to that seen in uninjected pal-1(e2091) mutants (Fig. 4D). Thus, both CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22 are likely involved in pal-1 gene expression. Notably, sop-1 mutant"

Here, we found evidence for an active mechanism that prohibited back-fusion of de novo-generated vesicles with their donor compartment. Tip20p is a peripheral membrane protein implicated in consumption of COPI vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum. However, a specific mutant of TIP20 did not interfere with COPII vesicle generation but allowed these vesicles to fuse back to the endoplasmic reticulum, a process that does not occur normally in the cell."

(2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10494–10499). To further test and refine this model, the relative orientation and proximity of transmembrane helices 4 and 8 were analyzed by chemical crosslinking of di-cysteine mutants created in a reporter GLUT1 construct. All six native cysteine residues of GLUT1 were changed to either glycine or serine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in a functional Glut1 construct with Cys mutated to Gly/Ser (C-less). The GLUT1 reporter molecule was engineered from C-less GLUT1 by creating a unique cleavage site for factor Xa protease within the central cytoplasmic loop and by eliminating the site of N-linked glycosylation. Fourteen functional di-cysteine mutants were then created from the C-less reporter construct, each mutant containing a single cysteine residue in helix 4 and one cysteine residue in helix 8. These mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the sensitivity of each mutant to intramolecular crosslinking by two homo-bifunctional, thiol-specific crosslinking reagents, bismaleimidehexane and 1,4-phenylenedimaleimide, was ascertained by protease cleavage followed by immunoblot analysis. Four pairs of cysteine residues, Cys148/Cys328, Cys145/Cys328, Cys148/Cys325, and Cys145/Cys325, were observed to be in close enough proximity to be susceptible to crosslinking by one or both reagents. All five of the cysteine residues susceptible to crosslinking are predicted to lie on the same face of helix 4 or 8 and to reside close to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. These data indicate that the cytoplasmic ends of helices 4 and 8 lie within 6–16 Å of one another and that the two helices twist or tilt such that they are further than 16 Å apart toward the center and the exoplasmic side of the membrane. An updated model for the clustering of the transmembrane helices of GLUT1 is presented based on these data. A structure has been proposed for glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) based upon homology modeling that is consistent with the results of numerous mutagenesis studies (Mueckler, M., and Makepeace, C.

GLUT1, the prototype member of the GLUT family and the first eucaryotic member of the major facilitator superfamily to be identified and cloned (5Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M.

Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), a characteristic that it seems to share with most if not all major facilitator superfamily proteins (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prediction was confirmed by glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis experiments (13Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other biochemical analyses (reviewed in Ref. 14Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 12 transmembrane helix model for GLUT1 is also consistent with the deduced structures of the lac permease (12Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (11Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Several of the 12 proposed transmembrane segments were predicted to form amphipathic α-helices, an observation which led to the hypothesis that these helices form the walls of a water-filled cavity involved in the binding and transfer of glucose across the membrane (5Mueckler M.

It was also suggested that hydroxyl- and amide-containing amino acid side chains within the transmembrane helices form the sugar-binding site of GLUT1 by hydrogen bonding with glucose hydroxyl groups.

Val165, which is positioned one helical turn distant from Glu161, is accessible to aqueous sulfhydryl reagents and, based upon mutagenesis and inhibitor studies (22Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol.

An aromatic side-chain at position 412 within helix 11 seems to be essential for transport activity (23Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, hydrogen exchange studies demonstrate that 30% of peptide hydrogen atoms are exposed to water in purified, reconstituted GLUT1, which is consistent with the formation of an aqueous cleft in the membrane (24Jung E.K. Chin J.J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9155-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized chemical crosslinking of di-cysteine (di-C) GLUT1 mutants constructed in a reporter molecule to determine the relative orientation and proximity of transmembrane helices 4 and 8, both of which are predicted to comprise a part of the inner helical bundle that forms the aqueous translocation pathway. The results are consistent with this prediction and permit modeling of the orientation of both helices in the membrane.

Construction of di-Cysteine GLUT1 Mutants—C-less GLUT1 cDNA subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pSP64T was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to produce aglyco-C-less GLUT1 containing the amino acid motif for factor Xa protease sensitivity (IEGR). The following changes were introduced into C-less GLUT1 cDNA: Asn45 → Thr, Glu246 → Ile, and Ser248 → Gly. This construct (aglyco-C-less Xa) was then used as a template to individually change each amino acid residue to a Cys from 141–150 in TMS4 and 321–329 in TMS8. To produce the di-C constructs (one Cys in TMS4 and the other Cys in TMS8), restriction fragments produced by Blp I and StuI digests of the single-C mutant cDNAs were ligated together. Treatment with Homo-bifunctional Maleimide Crosslinking Reagents—Stage 5 Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng of each mutant GLUT1 mRNA. Two days after injection, groups of 15–20 oocytes were incubated for 2 h with 0.15 mm BMH, 0.15 mmo-PDM, or 0.15 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in 1 ml of Barth's saline at 22 °C. Fifteen millimolar stock solutions of the maleimide reagents were prepared in 100% Me2SO. After incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 2 mm cysteine, incubated for 10 min, and then the oocytes were washed twice with 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture. In other experiments, 3.0 μg of freshly isolated total membranes from injected oocytes were incubated with 0.1 mmo-PDM or BMH, or 0.2 mm NEM in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.8, for 20 min at 22 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 mm cysteine followed by incubation for 10 min. Total membranes from either treatment protocol were adjusted to 1% decylmaltoside, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and then digested overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of factor Xa protease (New England Biolabs). The digested membranes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 residues of human GLUT1. In some experiments, whole oocytes were treated with crosslinking reagents for 1 h as described above, and then [3H]-2-DOG uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C) was measured after quenching the reactions with cysteine. Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed for statistical significance using the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. A reporter GLUT1 molecule (aglyco-C-less Xa) was engineered to facilitate a determination of the relative proximity and orientation of pairs of transmembrane helices using chemical crosslinking of di-cysteine (di-C) mutants, an experimental approach that has been used successfully to analyze the structure of the Escherichia coli lac permease (28Kaback H.R. Voss J. Wu J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A factor Xa protease recognition site was introduced into the large, central cytoplasmic loop of C-less GLUT1 (GLUT1 lacking its six native cysteine residues), permitting the analysis of pairs of cysteine residues residing in opposite halves of the molecule after chemical crosslinking. The site of N-linked glycosylation was also eliminated in the reporter GLUT1 construct by site-directed mutagenesis to simplify the analysis by preventing the appearance of multiple GLUT1 bands on SDS gels. We have demonstrated previously that C-less GLUT1 exhibits close to wild-type transport activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (22Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that C-less GLUT1 containing the factor Xa site (C-less Xa) and the aglyco reporter construct (aglyco-C-less Xa) both exhibit robust transport activity in Xenopus oocytes, although aglyco-C-less Xa activity was reduced ∼30% relative to that of the parental C-less molecule. Fig. 1C shows that this reduced activity was due to a lower level of expression of the reporter construct in oocyte membranes relative to C-less GLUT1. These data indicate that the reporter construct retains functional activity, eliminating the possibility that the mutations introduced into the molecule may have significantly altered its structure. According to homology modeling of the GLUT1 structure using the lac permease as a template, helices 4 and 8 of GLUT1 are a part of the inner helix bundle that forms the aqueous substrate-binding cavity and may lie in close proximity to one another. However, homology modeling in this instance might be very imprecise because of the extremely weak sequence similarity between the lac permease and GLUT1 (∼10%). Therefore, to test the model, we constructed di-C mutants in aglyco-C-less Xa in which a single residue in helix 4 and one residue in helix 8 were both changed to cysteines. Fourteen di-C mutant cDNAs were then constructed from the single-cysteine mutants by restriction enzyme digestion and ligation of the appropriate fragments (see Table I).Table IConstruction of di-cysteine mutants in a C-less GLUT1 reporter molecule cDNA encoding C-less human GLUT1 was subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis, changing Asn45 to Thr, Glu246 to Ile, and Ser248 to Gly, to produce aglyco C-less containing the factor Xa protease recognition motif (aglyco-C-less Xa). This construct was then used as the template to individually change amino acid residues in TMS4 or TMS8 to a cysteine. Di-C mutants were then constructed from the single-C mutants by ligation of restriction fragments.Aglyco C-less GLUT1 XaResidue numberAmino acid changeCodon change45Asn/ThrAAC/ACA246Glu/IleGAA/ATA248Ser/GlyAGT/GGTDouble Cys mutantsTMS4/TMS8TMS4TMS8TMS4TMS8141/321Pro/CysThr/CysCCC/TGCACT/TGT141/324Pro/CysSer/CysCCC/TGCTCG/TGT145/321Gly/CysThr/CysGGT/TGTACT/TGT145/325Gly/CysLeu/CysGGT/TGTCTG/TGT145/326Gly/CysPhe/CysGGT/TGTTTT/TGT145/327Gly/CysVal/CysGGT/TGTGTG/TGT145/328Gly/CysVal/CysGGT/TGTGTG/TGT146/328Glu/CysVal/CysGAA/TGTGTG/TGT148/325Ser/CysLeu/CysTCA/TGTCTG/TGT148/326Ser/CysPhe/CysTCA/TGTTTT/TGT148/327Ser/CysVal/CysTCA/TGTGTG/TGT148/328Ser/CysVal/CysTCA/TGTGTG/TGT149/328Pro/CysGlu/CysCCC/TGCGAG/TGT150/328Thr/CysVal/CysACA/TGTGTG/TGT Open table in a new tab Fig. 1B shows that all 14 di-C mutants exhibited significant transport activity above background levels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, suggesting that the mutations did not produce major structural changes in the transporter. As we have observed for single-cysteine GLUT1 mutants (16Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Hruz P.W.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), most of the variability in transport activity among the different di-C mutants could be attributed to differences in the level of protein expression (data not shown). Total membranes were isolated from oocytes expressing each of the 14 di-C mutants. The membranes were incubated for 20 min in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm of each of two different homo-bifunctional, sulfhydryl-specific, crosslinking agents: BMH, a flexible molecule ∼16 Å in length, and o-PDM, a rigid molecule ∼6 Å in length. Control reactions were conducted in the presence of NEM to replicate the sulfhydryl reaction in the absence of crosslinking. The reactions were quenched by the addition of cysteine, the membranes were solubilized in 1% decylmaltoside, digested for 16 h with factor Xa protease, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Analyses of aglyco-C-less Xa and 7 of the 14 di-C mutants are shown in Fig. 2A. Protease cleavage should result in the production of an ∼20-kDa C-terminal fragment of aglyco-C-less Xa that can be detected with a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 16 residues of GLUT1. If the two cysteine residues in a di-C mutant are in the proper orientation and close enough to one another in proximity, the mutant transporter should show pseudo-protease resistance proportional to the efficiency of the crosslinking reaction. Fig. 2A shows that, as expected, aglyco-C-less Xa was equally susceptible to protease cleavage in the presence of NEM, BMH, and o-PDM, indicating that the parental reporter molecule was not subject to crosslinking. Four di-C mutants, Cys141/Cys321, Cys145/Cys325, Cys146/Cys328, and Cys148/Cys326, were also not subject to crosslinking by either BMH or o-PDM. However, mutants Cys145/Cys328, Cys148/Cys325, and Cys148/Cys328 were clearly susceptible to crosslinking by both BMH and o-PDM. None of the other seven di-C mutants listed in Table I exhibited detectable crosslinking (data not shown). Because o-PDM and BMH are permeable to membranes, we next examined whether crosslinking could be achieved in intact oocytes using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2B shows that aglyco-C-less Xa and three di-C mutants, Cys141/Cys321, Cys146/Cys328, and Cys148/Cys326, were not subject to crosslinking by either o-PDM or BMH, but that Cys145/Cys325, Cys145/Cys328, Cys148/Cys325, and Cys148/Cys328 were all susceptible to crosslinking in intact oocytes by BMH only. None of the other di-C mutants listed in Table I were subject to crosslinking by either reagent in intact oocytes (data not shown). Given that crosslinking seemed to occur in intact oocytes, we tested the ability of NEM and the two crosslinking reagents to inhibit activity of the four mutants that were subject to crosslinking, along with four representative di-C mutants that were not susceptible to crosslinking either in vitro or in vivo. Fig. 3 shows that 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity of the parental aglyco-C-less Xa transporter was not affected by any of the three reagents. However, transport activity of all eight di-C mutants was affected to some degree by all three sulfhydryl-specific reagents, although the affect of NEM on Cys145/Cys325 and o-PDM on Cys145/Cys326 did not reach statistical significance. These data indicate that at least one of the two cysteine residues in all eight of the di-C mutants was accessible to at least two of the three reagents tested, suggesting that the lack of crosslinking in the majority of the 14 di-C mutants was most likely not because of inaccessibility of the cysteine residues to the reagents, but rather, it reflects the relative proximity and orientation of the two residues. The data presented in this study indicate that 4 of 14 di-C mutant GLUT1 transporters were susceptible to intramolecular chemical crosslinking by homo-bifunctional, thiol-specific crosslinking reagents (see Fig. 4). The crosslinking data are consistent with our model for the structure of GLUT1 based on studies employing the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (15Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and homology modeling (see Fig. 5). Our data indicate that Gly145 and Ser148 in helix 4 lie within ∼6–16 Å of Leu325 and Val328 in helix 8. These data are consistent with Leu325 and Val328 being positioned along the side of helix 8 that faces the aqueous cavity in one or both orientations of the unloaded transporter, in agreement with the results of SCAM analyses (29Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10494-10499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Helix 4, which has not yet been analyzed by SCAM, can be roughly oriented in the membrane based upon the crosslinking data, with Gly145 and Ser148 facing the aqueous cavity in direct apposition to Leu325 and Val328 (see Figs. 4 and 5). Consistent with this model, crosslinking was not observed for several pairs of residues (Cys145/Cys326, Cys145/Cys327, Cys148/Cys326, Cys148/Cys327, and Cys146/Cys328) that are predicted to be positioned on anti-apposing faces of helices 4 and 8 (see Fig. 4). Additionally, none of the pairs of residues (Cys141/Cys321, Cys141/Cys324, and Cys145/Cys321) predicted to lie near the center or exoplasmic end of the helices, despite apparently lying on directly apposed faces of their respective helices, were subject to crosslinking, suggesting that helices 4 and 8 are further apart at their exoplasmic ends because of tilting or twisting.Fig. 5Cross-sectional model of GLUT1 in the membrane as viewed from the cytoplasmic face. Amino acids are represented by the single letter code. Lines between residues Gly145-Leu325, Gly145-Val328, Ser148-Leu325, and Ser148-Val328 represent observed crosslinking with a homo-bifunctional maleimide reagent in the corresponding di-C mutants. *, residues that are accessible to p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate in SCAM studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, the Cys145/Cys328, Cys148/Cys325, and Cys148/Cys328 mutants were differentially susceptible to the two reagents when the reactions were conducted in isolated membranes versus intact oocytes. In isolated membranes, BMH and o-PDM were capable of crosslinking all three pairs of cysteine residues with about equal efficiency, whereas in intact oocytes, only the longer molecule, BMH, produced detectable crosslinking of the three pairs of cysteine residues. The former result might reflect differential permeability of the intact oocyte membrane to the two reagents, or it could reflect differential steady-state structures of the mutants in intact oocytes versus isolated membranes. The latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of transport activity was observed for seven of the eight di-C mutants tested with both BMH and o-PDM (see Fig. 3). In the absence of substrate, the transporter will exist primarily in two distinct conformations, its cytoplasmic and exoplasmic substrate-binding forms. One of these forms may be favored in isolated membranes. If so, our data suggest that the interface between helices 4 and 8 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane is closer together in the favored conformation, because under these conditions, the two cysteine residues were subject to crosslinking by the ∼6-Å reagent, o-PDM, as well as by BMH. The hypothesis that the transporter exists in different steady-state conformational distributions in isolated membranes versus intact oocytes is also supported by the observation that Cys145/Cys325 was only susceptible to crosslinking in intact oocytes (see Fig. 2). Additional SCAM analyses and crosslinking studies should-permit further testing and refinement of the structural model shown in Fig. 5. Ultimately, definitive structural information is dependent upon the successful crystallization of GLUT1, a feat that has not yet been achieved for any eukaryotic membrane transporter.
