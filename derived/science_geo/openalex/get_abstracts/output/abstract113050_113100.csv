https://openalex.org/W2050046962,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, type 2 diabetes) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis characterized by hyperglycaemia, peripheral insulin resistance, impaired hepatic glucose metabolism, and diminished glucose-dependent secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells. Glucagon-like-peptide-1(7-37) (GLP-1) is an intestinally derived hormone that may be useful for the treatment of NIDDM because it acts in vivo to increase the level of circulating insulin, and thus lower the concentration of blood glucose. This therapeutic effect may result from the ability of GLP-1 to compensate for a defect in the glucose signalling pathway that regulates insulin secretion from beta-cells. In support of this concept we report here that GLP-1 confers glucose sensitivity to glucose-resistant beta-cells, a phenomenon we term glucose competence. Induction of glucose competence by GLP-1 results from its synergistic interaction with glucose to inhibit metabolically regulated potassium channels that are also targeted for inhibition by sulphonylurea drugs commonly used in the treatment of NIDDM. Glucose competence allows membrane depolarization, the generation of action potentials, and Ca2+ influx, events that are known to trigger insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2085189710,"We recently proposed that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) shares two receptor components with a generally acting cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but that CNTF also requires a third receptor component (CNTFR alpha) that is mostly restricted to the nervous system in its expression. Here we demonstrate that a transfected CNTFR alpha gene is sufficient to confer CNTF responsiveness upon hemopoietic cells normally responsive only to LIF, providing evidence that CNTFR alpha is a required receptor component that uniquely characterizes CNTF-responding cells. Consistent with this notion, CNTFR alpha expression could be localized to neurons within all known peripheral targets of CNTF. CNTFR alpha was also widely expressed within neurons of the CNS, suggesting that CNTF has broader CNS actions than previously appreciated. However, in vivo localization of CNTFR alpha, as well as of CNTF itself, is consistent with a particularly important role for CNTF in motor function as well as during neuropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966823049,"The use of oral contraceptives in the United States during the past three decades has led to a dramatic decline in the incidence of cancers of the ovary and endometrium. The magnitude of these declines was predictable both from epidemiologic data and from the biologic effects of oral contraceptives on these tissues. Although the incidence of breast cancer has not been substantially affected by current oral contraceptives, it may be possible to develop alternative forms of contraception that provide protection against all three cancers. The major goal of hormonal chemoprevention of cancer is to reduce cell proliferation in the relevant epithelial tissue. New chemopreventive agents such as tamoxifen exemplify the application of this principle."
https://openalex.org/W1949243835,"Functional cDNA clones for two isoforms of the mouse prostaglandin E receptor EP3 subtype derived from alternative RNA splicing were obtained. The two isoforms are only different in the sequence of the putative cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail and their hydrophobicity; one isoform, named EP3 alpha, has a hydrophilic tail, and the other, named EP3 beta, has a hydrophobic tail. When expressed, the two receptors displayed identical ligand binding properties but different responses to guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). Without a change in the Bmax value, GTP gamma S increased Kd for prostaglandin E2 of EP3 beta and decreased that of EP3 alpha. These effects were abolished by the treatment of membranes with pertussis toxin and restored by the addition of Gi2. Although both isoforms exerted inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, three orders lower concentrations of agonists were required for EP3 alpha than EP3 beta for 50% inhibition of cAMP formation. A similar difference in agonist potency was observed also for agonist-induced stimulation of GTPase activity in membranes. Thus, the two receptors with different carboxyl-terminal tails show different coupling to the Gi protein, leading to the opposite responses to GTP in the ligand binding affinity and to different affinities of the agonist-occupied receptors to the G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1563531877,"Receptor-specific or homologous desensitization of beta 2-adrenergic receptors is thought to be effected via phosphorylation of the receptor by the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), followed by binding of beta-arrestin. We have generated stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines overexpressing either of the two regulatory proteins and also expressing low or high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors (approximately 80 and approximately 600 fmol/mg of membrane protein). In these cells, we studied the process of desensitization induced by the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. In cells expressing high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, desensitization to high concentrations of isoproterenol (previously shown to be mediated by both beta ARK and protein kinase A) amounted to approximately 50% in control cells, approximately 80% in beta ARK-overexpressing cells, and approximately 90% in beta-arrestin-overexpressing cells. In cells expressing low levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, these values were approximately 50, approximately 60, and approximately 60%, respectively. Desensitization to low concentrations of isoproterenol (previously shown to be essentially protein kinase A-mediated and not receptor-specific, i.e. heterologous) was not affected by overexpression of either beta ARK or beta-arrestin. These data suggest that in cells expressing high levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, beta-arrestin and beta ARK become limiting for homologous receptor desensitization. They provide further support for the involvement of these two proteins in the regulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2040452518,"beta-Adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and beta-arrestin function in the homologous or agonist-activated desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. The isoforms beta ARK-2 and beta-arrestin-2 are highly enriched in and localized to the dendritic knobs and cilia of the olfactory receptor neurons where the initial events of olfactory signal transduction occur. Odorants induce a rapid and transient elevation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), which activates a nonspecific cation channel and produces membrane depolarization. Preincubation of rat olfactory cilia with antibodies raised against beta ARK-2 and beta-arrestin-2 increased the odorant-induced elevation of cAMP and attenuated desensitization. These results suggest that beta ARK-2 and beta-arrestin-2 mediate agonist-dependent desensitization in olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W1600300278,"In order to determine which portion of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC)-β1 is required for activation by Gαq, a series of specific deletions and truncations of PLC-β1 cDNA were prepared. After transfection of COS-7 cells with these cDNA clones, the activity and localization of the expressed proteins were determined. Specific deletions in the C-terminal end of the protein did not lead to loss of intrinsic enzymatic activity but did result in loss of the ability to be activated by Gαq. The region required for activation was localized to the amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 903-1142 of PLC-β1. This region was further subdivided into two sequences; one extending from residues Thr-903 to Gln-1030 that was required for particulate fraction association as well as for activation by Gαq and the other extending from residues Gln-1030 to Leu-1142 that was required for interaction with G α subunits. These results were confirmed by the observation that the C-terminal portion of PLC-β1, when co-expressed with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor type 1 or the α1C-adrenergic receptor in COS-7 cells, markedly inhibited ligand-induced release of inositol phosphates. In an in vitro system, two peptides derived from the G-protein interaction region at the C terminus were found to inhibit the guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-dependent activation of PLC-β1 by Gαq. This further localized the sites on PLC-β1 which are involved in interaction with G-protein α subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1496726033,"Phosphorylation of cardiac myofibrillar proteins by protein kinase C (PKC) in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes has been compared with that mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA activation by beta-adrenoreceptor (isoproterenol) stimulation results in stoichiometric phosphorylation of troponin I (TnI) and C-protein. PKC activation by either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or by alpha-adrenoreceptor (phenylephrine plus propranolol) stimulation results in phosphorylation of the same two proteins to similar extents. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping shows that the same sites in TnI are modified by PKC in vitro and in TPA- or alpha-agonist-stimulated cells. These sites are distinct from those phosphorylated in isoproterenol-stimulated cells or by PKA in vitro. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of C-protein shows that PKC and PKA phosphorylate identical residues in this protein in vitro and in situ. TPA-stimulated phosphorylation in myocytes is associated with a reduction in maximal activity of myofibrillar Ca(2+)-dependent actomyosin MgATPase. Isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation has no effect on maximal activity but reduces the Ca2+ sensitivity of the MgATPase. These data demonstrate that TnI and C-protein are phosphorylated in myocardial cells by both PKA and PKC, resulting in different functional consequences in each case."
https://openalex.org/W1531431198,"To investigate the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein to its basolateral expression in polarized epithelial cells, chimeric proteins containing the external and transmembrane domains of an apically targeted protein, the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and either the G cytoplasmic domain or an unrelated cytoplasmic sequence, were introduced into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Addition of the cytoplasmic tail of G to a truncated HA resulted in delivery of greater than 95% of the chimeric protein to the basolateral cell surface, indicating that the G cytoplasmic domain contains a dominant basolateral sorting signal. A similar chimera, containing the cytoplasmic tail of herpes simplex I glycoprotein gC, was not sorted basolaterally. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail from G protein itself decreased the fidelity of sorting to the basolateral surface, but not the extent to which the protein reached the plasma membrane. Mutation of cytoplasmic tyrosine 501 of G caused an identical loss of basolateral targeting, suggesting that the tyrosine, or the sequence surrounding it, is required for efficient basolateral transport of G. Mutation of tyrosine 501 had no effect on internalization of G, which was much slower than that of endocytic receptors. Thus, VSV G protein contains an efficient cytoplasmic basolateral targeting signal that is not an efficient internalization signal."
https://openalex.org/W1512594812,"Previous studies indicated that rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells contained the Ca(2+)-dependent alpha and beta and the Ca(2+)-independent delta, epsilon, and zeta isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC); of these, PKC beta and delta were the most potent transducers of signals for exocytosis in antigen-stimulated permeabilized cells. Exocytosis, nevertheless, was still dependent on an elevated free Ca2+. (Ozawa, K., Szallasi, Z., Kazanietz, M. G., Blumberg, P. M., Mischak, H., Mushinski, J. F., and Beaven, M. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1749-1756). We now demonstrate that PKC alpha and epsilon, exclusively, inhibit antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids in the same permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells. Unlike secretion, the inhibitory actions occurred at a basal concentration (0.1 microM) of free Ca2+. The inhibitory actions of the two isozymes were potentiated by 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. As indicated by the effects of the phorbol ester, the probable mechanism was reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1. The negative regulation of phospholipase C was apparent in intact cells, because the PKC inhibitor Ro31-7549 or down-regulation of PKC with phorbol ester enhanced antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids. The concentrations of the various isozymes of PKC in RBL-2H3 cells, as estimated by immunoblotting studies, were sufficient for promotion of exocytosis (i.e. beta and delta) and inhibition of phospholipid hydrolysis (i.e. alpha and epsilon)."
https://openalex.org/W1552443753,"Anaerobically grown Escherichia coli contain an oxygen-sensitive ribonucleotide reductase. The enzyme requires anaerobic activation by two E. coli fractions with S-adenosylmethionine, NADPH, dithiothreitol, and KCl. We now find that photochemically reduced deazaflavin can substitute for these two fractions and NADPH. The reductase contained roughly equimolar amounts of iron and sulfide, suggesting the presence of an Fe-S complex. The cluster is characterized by a charge transfer band at 420 nm and a low temperature EPR signal centered at g = 2.01 that is difficult to saturate at 14 K, suggested to be a (3Fe-4S)+ cluster. In five different preparations of essentially protein-pure reductase containing widely different amounts of iron, the catalytic activity correlated well with the iron content. The iron signal disappeared during reductive anaerobic activation, with the appearance of a new EPR signal at g = 2.0033 showing a temperature behavior and microwave power saturability consistent with an organic free radical. The signal disappeared after exposure of the activated enzyme to air. We suggest that activation involves generation of a specific amino acid free radical that is dependent on the reduced Fe-S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine. From other work it appears likely that the free radical is localized on glycine 681 of the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1569754812,"This paper presents the first complete purification of the branched chain aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.42) from rat brain cytosol (BCATc). On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the enzyme appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 47 kDa; however, gel exclusion chromatography suggested that BCATc is a dimer. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of BCATc and the mitochondrial form of the enzyme (BCATm) indicated that they are different proteins. Experiments with protein labeling reagents, in particular sulfhydryl reagents, also suggested that there may be some distinct structural differences in BCATc and BCATm. Nevertheless, BCATc and BCATm showed similar specificities for amino acid and alpha-keto acid substrates. Both enzymes transaminated branched chain amino acids, their straight chain analogs, L-alloisoleucine and glutamate. A broader range of alpha-keto acids than amino acids was accepted as substrate including alpha-ketobutyrate and the alpha-keto acid of methionine. Both enzymes exhibited ping-pong kinetics with apparent Km values for leucine and isoleucine of about 1 and 5 mM for valine, respectively. Km values for alpha-ketoglutarate ranged from about 0.6 to 3 mM depending on the amino acid substrate. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified BCATc. BCATc antiserum neutralized branched chain aminotransferase activity in rat brain cytosol but did not affect the activity in a heart mitochondrial extract. However, immunoblotting showed that BCATc and BCATm do share common epitopes since BCATm antiserum recognized BCATc on the immunoblots. The tissue distribution of BCATc was examined using BCATc and BCATm antisera. These data showed that BCATc was found in adult and fetal rat brain, cultured cells from fetal rat brain cortex, ovary, and placenta. Brain had the highest activity followed by ovary, fetal brain, and placenta. BCATc was not found in fetal liver, adult rat liver, or a rat hepatoma cell line. These data provide clear evidence that BCATc, unlike BCATm, is restricted to several highly specialized tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1548575930,"The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-TRH receptor (TRHR) complex undergoes rapid transformation in cells to an acid-resistant form which appears to represent internalized agonist-receptor complex. Since residues in the carboxyl terminus of other G protein-coupled receptors appear to be involved in internalization, we studied the role of this domain in the TRHR. A mutant TRHR, C335Stop, missing the last 59 residues including 2 cysteine residues, undergoes minimal transformation to an acid-resistant form even though it binds agonist with equal affinity and activates inositol phosphate second messenger formation as effectively as wild type TRHR. Two distinct domains within the carboxyl terminus between residues 335 and 368 were shown to affect transformation equally. First, a domain between residues 360 and 367 was identified because a TRHR with codon 360 mutated to a stop codon attained a steady-state level of internalized receptor that was approximately 50% of wild type TRHR, whereas a mutant with codon 368 changed to a stop was internalized to the same extent as wild type TRHR. Second, the need for a proximal Cys residue(s), Cys-335 or Cys-337, was shown by mutating these residues to Ser or Gly. We conclude that rapid internalization of the TRHR is dependent on two dissimilar domains within the receptor carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2019953791,"Many excitable cells express a class of neurotransmitter receptors functionally defined by their ability to increase potassium conductance through G proteins of the Gi/Go class that directly activate the potassium channels. Biochemical studies have shown that these same receptors can also inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, although the functional significance of this effect remains unclear. In this study electrophysiological techniques were used to examine how activation of serotonin and γ-aminobutyric acid receptors belongingtothis class affect β-adrenergic responses signaled through adenylyl cyclase. Surprisingly, activation of these receptors not only failed to inhibit but actually enhanced β-adrenergic responses. These observations are consistent with evidence indicating that Gi-linked receptors can enhance the ability of Gs to stimulate certain adenylyl cyclases."
https://openalex.org/W1581952739,"Xenopus 45-kDa mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MAPKK) is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase, which activates MAP kinase (MAPK) by phosphorylating its threonine and tyrosine residues. MAPKK is active only when its threonine and/or serine residues are phosphorylated. We have identified from Xenopus eggs two protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of MAPKK. The two kinases are separated by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography. The higher molecular weight kinase phosphorylates MAPKK previously dephosphorylated and inactivated by phosphatase 2A treatment on mainly serine and slightly threonine residues, and reactivates the MAPKK, and is thus assumed to work as MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) in vivo. The lower molecular weight kinase, identified as MAPK, phosphorylates the dephosphorylated MAPKK on mainly threonine and faintly serine residues, but does not reactivate the MAPKK activity. As Xenopus MAPKK contains a single phosphorylation consensus sequence (PXT388P) for MAPK in the C-terminal region, this T388 residue may be a major phosphorylation site catalyzed by MAPK. Thus, Xenopus MAPKK is phosphorylated in mature oocytes by not only an upstream kinase, MAPKKK, but also a downstream kinase, MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W1491229682,"The ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors have previously been found to be intracellular Ca2+ release channels characterized by their large size and 4-fold symmetry. In this study, cardiomyocytes are found to have a different intracellular localization for the two receptors. At the level of light microscopy, the IP3 receptor is immunolocalized in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes at the region of the intercalated discs. By contrast, immunoreactivity of the ryanodine receptor is observed as transverse bands throughout the length of the cardiomyocyte, coincident with the triad junction at the I-bands. At the level of electron microscopy, immunogold particles directed to the IP3 receptor specifically decorate the intercalated discs of rat ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes, preferentially at the fascia adherens. Binding of [3H] IP3 and [3H]ryanodine were measured in cardiac subcellular fractions. IP3 binding is enriched in a fraction containing intercalated discs. Little or no IP3 binding was detected in longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), junctional SR, sarcolemma, mitochondria, and submitochondrial vesicles. Ryanodine binding is the highest in junctional SR. We conclude that the IP3 receptor is present in ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes and localized at the region of the intercalated discs. These results suggest a possible role of the IP3 receptor in Ca2+ entry through intercalated discs and/or intercellular signaling between cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1563692922,"RPE.40 is a strain of mutated CHO-K1 cells with elevated resistance to Pseudomonas exotoxin A, Sindbis virus, and Newcastle disease virus. Virus resistance is due to an inability to cleave precursor viral membrane glycoproteins and produce infectious virions. Transfection of RPE.40 cells with cDNA for mouse furin causes them to lose all resistance and become as sensitive as wild-type cells to the toxin and viruses. Transfection of RPE.40 cells with cDNA for the related yeast protease Kex2 reduces their resistance to the toxin and viruses, but does not completely eliminate it."
https://openalex.org/W1569980220,"In this study, we examined the influence of high levels of cytosolic calcium on phosphorylation status and function of GLUT-4 in isolated rat adipocytes. Intracellular calcium was elevated by exposing adipocytes to either extracellular ATP (1.6 mM) or thapsigargin (100 nM). Both agents increased cytosolic calcium 2-3 fold. While basal glucose uptake was unaffected, both ATP and thapsigargin reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport by 40-70% (p < 0.05). Neither ATP nor thapsigargin affected GLUT-4 content or its translocation from the low density microsomes to the plasma membrane (PM). In contrast, GLUT-4 immunoprecipitated from the PM of adipocytes exposed to either ATP or thapsigargin was phosphorylated to a greater extent than the GLUT-4 isolated from control cells. ATP and thapsigargin also abolished insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of GLUT-4. At the same time, GLUT-4 intrinsic activity was significantly reduced in adipocytes with high levels of cytosolic calcium (p < 0.05). Preincubation of adipocytes with cAMP antagonist, RpcAMP (10(-4) M), and calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine (30 microM), improved the ability of insulin to dephosphorylate GLUT-4 and restored insulin-stimulated GLUT-4 intrinsic activity. We conclude that elevated levels of cytosolic calcium interfere with insulin's ability to dephosphorylate GLUT-4, thus reducing its intrinsic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1632652087,"The expression and cytokine-mediated regulation of the two different receptors for tumor necrosis factor, TNF-R-75 and TNF-R-55, was investigated in human malignant epithelial cell lines. Here we show that cells treated with TNF-alpha up-regulate the TNF-R-75 mRNA and protein levels. No changes were seen regarding the level of TNF-R-55 transcripts. Phospholipase and protein kinase C inhibitors abrogated the signal transduction pathway of TNF-mediated TNF-R-75 mRNA up-regulation which proceeded in the absence of transcriptional activation. This process was also elicited by an agonistic antibody binding specifically to TNF-R-55. Ligand binding assays using specific inhibitory antibodies showed a marked shift in active binding sites from p55 to p75 without significant changes in the total binding for TNF-alpha after up-regulation of p75 TNF-R. This ligand-induced regulation of one of the corresponding receptors has so far only been detected in malignant epithelial cells and not in hematopoietic cell lines. In our search for a specific function we were able to show that p75 is the specific receptor for TNF-mediated up-regulation of transforming growth factor alpha mRNA, whereas p55 is the signal transducer for TNF-induced up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA. This is the first demonstration of an exclusive function of TNF-R-75 in cells of epithelial origin."
https://openalex.org/W1538835725,"Macrophage scavenger receptors, which have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and other macrophage-mediated events, are trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins whose extracellular domains have been predicted to include alpha-helical coiled-coil, collagenous and globular structures. To elucidate further the structural and functional properties of these receptors, we generated transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells which express secreted extracellular domains of the type I and type II bovine scavenger receptors and developed a solid-phase bead-binding assay to assess their ligand-binding properties. The secreted receptors exhibited the distinctive high-affinity, broad polyanionic ligand-binding specificity and the pH dependence of binding which characterize the membrane-anchored cell-surface forms of the receptors. Both the type I and type II secreted receptors were trimeric glycoproteins comprising disulfide-linked dimers and noncovalently associated monomers. Gel filtration and glycerol-gradient centrifugation established that the type II trimers were highly elongated and did not associate into higher order oligomers at the low concentrations used in these experiments. Crocilodite asbestos, which is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and can cause asbestosis and mesothelioma, bound efficiently to secreted type I receptors and less well to the type II receptors. This binding was specific in that it was competed by a variety of well established scavenger receptor ligands but not by negative controls. These studies have identified a new type of insoluble scavenger receptor ligand, and have raised the possibility that scavenger receptors may play a role in mediating the physiological and pathological interactions of inspired particles with alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1565086756,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is an endothelial cell surface-bound cofactor in thrombin-dependent formation of activated protein C, a potent anticoagulant. Cofactor activity has been localized to the carboxyl-terminal half of the six epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains of TM (TME). To identify residues in TME that are critical for activity, 77 alanine point mutants were made between Cys-333 and Cys-462 by site-directed mutagenesis (all residues except Ala, Cys, Gly, and Pro). Mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and cofactor activity measured directly in periplasmic extracts obtained by osmotic shock. Critical residues were defined as those which when mutated had less than 25% cofactor activity of a reference TME. Western blots of non-reduced samples confirmed that alanine substitutions did not significantly decrease expression levels or result in the formation of multimers. In EGF4, which is essential for protein C activation by the thrombin-TM complex, critical residues were: Asp-349, Glu-357, Tyr-358, and Phe-376. In EGF5-EGF6, critical residues within a proposed acidic thrombin-binding region were: Glu-408, Tyr-413, Ile-414, Leu-415, Asp-416, Asp-417, Asp-423, Ile-424, Asp-425, and Glu-426. A potential Ca(2+)-binding site, which is comprised of residues Asp-423, Asp-425, Glu-426, Asn-439, Leu-440, and Phe-444, was also identified and overlaps the thrombin-binding region. Asp-461, in the C-loop of EGF6 previously shown to be critical for thrombin binding, was also critical. Asp-398, Asp-400, Asn-402, and Asn-429 in EGF5 were also critical. Thus, rapid alanine-scanning mutagenesis of TME has identified 22 critical residues in the region comprising EGF4-6, which is essential for thrombin binding and protein C activation by the thrombin-TM complex."
https://openalex.org/W1519293659,"The point-mutated active form of ras p21 is known to activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in intact mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes, although the direct target molecule of ras p21 remains to be identified. To elucidate the role of the post-translational processing of ras p21 for the MAP kinase activation, we established the cell-free system in which ras p21 activated MAP kinase. The guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) bound form of post-translationally processed Ki-ras 4B p21 activated MAP kinase in the cytosol fraction of Xenopus oocytes, but the GTP gamma S bound form of post-translationally unprocessed Ki-ras 4B p21 or the GDP bound form of processed or unprocessed Ki-ras 4B p21 was far less effective. The GTP gamma S bound form of processed Ki-ras 4B p21 activated recombinant ERK2 in the presence of the cytosol fraction of Xenopus oocytes, but the unprocessed protein was far less effective. These results provide a complete biochemical assay for ras p21 to activate MAP kinase in a cell-free system and indicate that all the elements downstream of ras p21 necessary for the MAP kinase activation are cytosolic and that the post-translational processing of ras p21 is important for the MAP kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1528268403,"The alpha subunit complements of natural gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subpopulations were investigated by their purification from mammalian cerebral cortex and cerebellum by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies raised against peptide sequences unique to the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 6 subunits. Receptors purified from cerebral cortex by anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424 and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibody affinity columns in series had immunoreactivity with alpha 2 and alpha 3 but not alpha 1 subunit-specific antibodies. Receptors purified from cerebellum by a new affinity column matrix, anti-alpha 6 1-16 Cys whole antibody, or the Fab fragment thereof, enriched for alpha 6 subunit immunoreactivity. A further series of experiments demonstrated the partial coexistence of this alpha 6 subunit immunoreactivity with that for the alpha 1 but not the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits. These results provide additional evidence for the existence of GABAA receptor subpopulations with heterogeneous alpha subunit complements yielding increased structural diversity of natural GABAA receptors. Furthermore, they substantiate previous findings implicating the presence of two alpha subunits per receptor oligomer."
https://openalex.org/W1496079625,"Investigation on the biochemical isomerization of ibuprofen led us to the successful purification of 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase from rat liver cytosol and mitochondria. The purified enzymes from both subcellular fractions exhibit similar physical and catalytic properties and are distinctly different from rat liver methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Both are monomeric proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa and show similar contents of most amino acids. Their UV spectra gave no indication of any bound cofactors, and their enzyme activities were not affected by exposure to EDTA or metal ions (except Cu2+). These results suggest that the cytosolic and mitochondrial epimerases may be structurally related. The purified enzymes catalyze the epimerization of various 2-arylpropionyl-CoAs with some degree of stereochemical differentiation. For 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionyl-CoA, the equilibrium constant was estimated to be 1.5 in favor of the R-isomer. Evidence indicated that the proton exchange may be mediated by a 2-base mechanism and that a carboxylic residue in the active site may serve as a general base for proton abstraction."
https://openalex.org/W1566287851,"Abstract The principal objective of this work has been to determine whether Asn831 of the alpha chain of Na/K-ATPase is located at the cytoplasmic or extracellular surface. Asn831 is the N-terminal residue of a C-terminal tryptic fragment which, together with smaller (8-11 kDa) membrane-embedded fragments of the alpha chain and a largely intact beta chain, is produced by extensive tryptic digestion of renal Na,K-ATPase in the presence of Rb+ and absence of Ca2+ ions. In these so-called 19-kDa membranes, Rb+ and Na+ occlusion capacities are normal, but ATP-dependent activities are lost. Transmembrane segments in the and other fragments are thought to contribute ligating residues to a cation occlusion cage. However, the arrangement of transmembrane segments of the alpha chain is uncertain, particularly in the critical C-terminal domain. Different topological models predict that the N-terminal Asn831 of the fragment lies at opposite surfaces, respectively. The location of Asn831 has been studied by tryptic digestion of either tight right side-out-oriented membrane vesicles isolated from renal medulla or phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with renal Na/K-ATPase, containing pumps in both right side-out and inside-out orientations. Digestion is performed in the presence of Rb+ and absence of Ca2+ ions. In native renal membrane vesicles the alpha chain is not split by trypsin. By contrast, the beta chain is partially split to a fragment of 16 kDa, beginning at the N-terminal Ala. This fragment is 4 residues longer than a 16-kDa fragment produced by digestion of purified Na/K-ATPase, a finding which shows that trypsin has full access to the extracellular surface, but not to the interior of the vesicles. In the presence of deoxycholate, which destroys the membrane permeability barrier, trypsin digests the alpha chain and the fragment (N-terminal Asn831) is produced. Extensive tryptic digestion of phospholipid vesicles reconstituted with the Na/K-ATPase leads to digestion of the alpha chain and appearance of intermediate fragments and then the fragment. About 25% of the alpha chains in the preparation are resistant to digestion. Functional studies show that the trypsin-resistant pumps are in the right side-out orientation. Observed tryptic fragments were sequenced and the following N termini were detected: Glu31, 33 kDa; Ser221, 78 kDa; Ile470, 56 kDa; Ala590, 39 kDa; and Asn831, 19 kDa. Observation of these N termini is consistent with digestion of the alpha chain of inside-out-oriented pumps at cytoplasmic sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1533919226,"The sugar nucleotide, cytidine 5'-(3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic phosphate) (CMP-KDN) is expected to serve as a donor of KDN residues in the synthesis of KDN-containing glycoconjugates. We report here the identification and characterization of CMP-KDN synthetase, a novel enzyme responsible for synthesis of CMP-KDN from KDN and CTP. The enzyme was partially purified from the testis of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), where KDN gangliosides were first discovered (Yu, S., Kitajima, K., Inoue, S., and Inoue, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21929-21935), and used to synthesize CMP-[14C]KDN, which was characterized by 1H NMR. Vmax/Km studies showed that KDN was a preferred nonulosonic acid substrate compared to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (4.4 x 10(-3) min-1 for KDN versus 2.3 and 1.8 x 10(-3) min-1 for Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, respectively). CMP-KDN synthetase activity was maximal at pH 9-10 and at 25 degrees C. The presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ was essential for CMP-KDN synthetase activity. 25 mM Mg2+ stimulated formation of CMP-KDN more than 10-fold, yet only stimulated formation of CMP-Neu5Ac and CMP-Neu5Gc 4-fold, relative to 1 mM Mg2+. A kinetic study using mixed substrates showed that both CMP-KDN and CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase activities in the partially purified enzyme were due to the same active site of a single enzyme. In contrast, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were the preferred nonulosonic acid substrates for the calf brain CMP-sialic acid synthetase. Thus, mammalian CMP-sialic acid synthetases recognizes similar, yet distinctively different, substrate specificity determinants. Thus, the trout testis enzyme was considered to synthesize activated sugar nucleotides required for synthesis of both (KDN)GM3 and (Neu5Ac)GM3. The expression of CMP-KDN synthetase was shown to be temporally correlated with development and to parallel the developmental expression of (KDN)GM3 in sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1526407922,"The role of the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin (TM) in the binding of thrombin to TM has been examined using fluorescent derivatives of thrombin. An anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS) dye was attached covalently to the active site histidine of thrombin via a D-Phe-Pro-Arg (FPR) linkage to form ANS-FPR-thrombin. When ANS-FPR-thrombin was titrated with TM lacking the chondroitin sulfate moiety (csf-TM), a monotonic and saturable increase in ANS emission intensity was observed that was consistent with the formation of a high affinity 1:1 thrombin-csf-TM complex. In contrast, titration of ANS-FPR-thrombin with intact TM containing the chondroitin sulfate resulted in a biphasic change in ANS-FPR-thrombin emission intensity that was consistent with each molecule of TM binding at least two molecules of ANS-FPR-thrombin with different affinities. This suggested that the second thrombin binds to TM via the chondroitin sulfate moiety. A direct interaction between thrombin and chondroitin sulfate was demonstrated by showing that chondroitin sulfate, cleaved and purified from TM, caused a saturable increase in ANS emission intensity upon addition to an ANS-FPR-thrombin sample. This spectral change was reversed by adding an excess of unmodified thrombin. The minimum Kd for the ANS-FPR-thrombin-chondroitin sulfate complex was approximately 20 nM, consistent with chondroitin sulfate being the lower affinity binding site on TM for thrombin. The titration of chondroitin sulfate into ANS-FPR-thrombin samples in the absence and presence of a TM fragment containing the fifth and sixth growth factor-like domains (GF5-6) showed that GF5-6 did not block chondroitin sulfate binding and that a GF5-6-thrombin-chondroitin sulfate ternary complex was formed. Thus, the chondroitin sulfate binds to thrombin somewhere other than anion-binding exosite I, and in doing so, alters the structure and/or environment of the active site more than 15A from the active site serine without detectably changing the conformation near Ser-195. Since excess TM and excess csf-TM increased the ANS emission intensity of ANS-FPR-thrombin to different extents (approximately 15 and approximately 80%, respectively), the chondroitin sulfate also influences the environment of the active site probe even when thrombin is bound to the higher affinity site on TM (GF5-6)."
https://openalex.org/W1678360741,"With magnesium present, fluoride and aluminum ions activate heterotrimeric G-proteins by forming AlFx complexes that mimic the gamma phosphate of a GTP. We report compelling evidence for a newly proposed process of G-protein activation by fluoride and magnesium, without Al3+. With millimolar Mg2+ and F-, Gs and Gt activate adenylylcyclase and cGMP-phosphodiesterase, respectively. In 31P NMR, addition of magnesium to Gi1 alpha GDP or Gt alpha GDP solutions containing fluoride, but no Al3+, modifies the chemical shift of the GDP beta phosphorus, suggesting that magnesium interacts with the beta phosphate. Titration of this effect indicates that two Mg2+ are bound per G alpha. Biphasic activation kinetics, monitored by G alpha tryptophan fluorescence, suggests the rapid binding of one Mg2+ to G alpha GDP and the slow association of another Mg2+, in correlation with fluoride binding and G alpha activation. The deactivation rate upon fluoride dilution shows a second order dependence with respect to the residual F- concentration, suggesting the sequential release of at least three F-/G alpha. Thus, in millimolar Mg2+ and F-, and without Al3+, two Mg2+ and three F- bind sequentially to G alpha GDP and induce the switch to an active G alpha (GDP-MgF3)Mg state, which is structurally analogous to G alpha (GDP-AlFx)Mg and to G alpha (GTP)Mg."
https://openalex.org/W1508736526,"Embryonic-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) gene expression is regulated by muscle activity. The mechanism by which this activity is transduced to the genome is not known. We have addressed this issue by using a rat primary muscle cell culture system that mimics the in vivo effects of muscle activity on nAChR expression. We report here that the suppression of nAChR gene expression by muscle activity can be reversed by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. This effect is specific to the embryonic-type receptor genes. Electrically insensitive genes such as those encoding the adult-type nAChR epsilon-subunit and creatine kinase are not up-regulated by cAMP. In addition, muscle inactivity caused either by tetrodotoxin or denervation increases cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity, consistent with their proposed role in mediating nAChR gene expression. Finally, we report that this same mechanism appears to regulate other genes, such as those encoding the tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel, MyoD, and myogenin which, like the nAChR, are regulated by muscle electrical activity. Based on these results it is proposed that muscle electrical activity is coupled to gene expression via a cAMP-dependent second messenger system."

https://openalex.org/W1505643021,"A detailed analysis of the promoter sequence requirements for the cAMP induction of transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) was undertaken. It was determined that the cAMP-responsive unit of this promoter consisted of two independently weak or inactive components; the typical cAMP response element (CRE) sequence located at position -85 and a region of the promoter extending from -300 to -230 which contained multiple binding sites for liver-enriched nuclear proteins. A previous study had indicated that multiple binding sites are critical for the activity of this latter region (Liu, J., Park, E. A., Gurney, A. L., Roesler, W. J., and Hanson, R. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19095-19102). In the present study, we extend this observation by demonstrating that the activity of this region can be effectively substituted for by three copies of just one subsite present in that region. This would suggest that the binding of three molecules of a single liver-enriched factor is what forms this component of the cAMP response unit. The other component of the cAMP response unit, the CRE, has been shown previously to be bound by these same liver-enriched factors as well as by cAMP response element binding protein, leading to some debate as to the identity of the protein mediating the cAMP response through this element. By two different experimental approaches, we show that neither CCAAT/enhancer binding protein nor D-site binding protein is the likely mediator of the cAMP response through the CRE, while cAMP response element binding protein is a possible candidate."
https://openalex.org/W1509967485,"A novel carbohydrate-rich sialoglycopolyprotein of apparent molecular mass approximately 7000 Da was isolated from the fertilized eggs of the Medaka fish species, Oryzias melastigma. The glycoprotein was identified as a member of the L-hyosophorin family because it exhibited the following several distinctive features of L-hyosophorin molecules: (a) it contains a high proportion of carbohydrate (90% by weight), and (b) the amino acid sequence of the apopeptide was identical with that of the Oryzias latipes L-hyosophorin which has previously been demonstrated to be derived from a high molecular weight form of hyosophorin, i.e. H-hyosophorin, present in the cortical vesicles of unfertilized eggs. The apoprotein of H-hyosophorin is composed of tandem repeats of the L-hyosophorin apopeptide, i.e. it is a polyprotein. The structure of the carbohydrate portion of purified L-hyosophorin of O. melastigma was studied by composition and methylation analysis, selective chemical (periodate-Smith degradation; hydrazinolysis-nitrous acid deamination), and enzymatic (endo-beta-galactosidase; peptide:N-glycanase) degradation, together with instrumental methods (fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and 1H NMR). O. melastigma L-hyosophorin was found to contain two types of large, branched tetraantennary glycan units capped with sialic acids. The two glycans differ with respect to the branching pattern of the trimannosyl core (x = 4 or 6 in Eq. A). [formula: see text] The possible physiological significance of the hyosophorin family is discussed in the light of their unique structural features."
https://openalex.org/W1586155899,"The growth factor-activated Na+/H+ exchanger is regulated by numerous stimuli, including polypeptide hormones, phorbol esters, cell acidity, and cell shrinkage. To determine whether this regulation occurs at a common site on the cytoplasmic domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger, we microinjected polyclonal antibodies (RP1-c28) to the C-terminal 157 amino acids of the molecule and measured cell pH changes after application of a variety of stimuli known to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger. Microinjection of approximately 10 fg of RP1-c28 antibody, but not control IgG, into single cultured fibroblasts blocked subsequent activation of the exchanger by both endothelin and alpha-thrombin. In contrast, microinjected RP1-c28 did not prevent activation of Na+/H+ exchange by phorbol esters, consistent with the observation that both endothelin-1 and alpha-thrombin retained the ability to activate exchange activity in protein kinase C-depleted cells. Finally, activation of Na+/H+ exchange by both cell acidity and osmotic shrinkage was also unaffected by microinjected RP1-c28 antibody. These data indicate that activation of Na+/H+ exchange by endothelin-1 and alpha-thrombin is mechanistically distinct both from activation by protein kinase C and activation by physical factors and probably occurs at a separate site on the exchanger molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1508845545,"The FLP protein of the 2-microns plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a conservative site-specific recombinase that is involved in the amplification of the plasmid. This recombination reaction proceeds via the covalent attachment of the protein to the 3'-phosphoryl group at the site of the breaks through a phosphotyrosine linkage. We have recently developed an assay that measures FLP-mediated strand ligation independent of FLP-mediated cleavage and covalent attachment to the DNA. The substrate for ligation was produced by FLP-induced cleavage of the FLP recognition site followed by digestion with Pronase and was shown to contain (at least) a tyrosine residue at the 3'-PO4 terminus adjacent to the FLP cleavage sites. We have now synthesized artificial substrates that bear a tyrosine residue on the 3'-PO4 of an appropriate oligonucleotide and find that this substrate is ligated as efficiently as the previous ligation substrates that were isolated after FLP cleavage of the substrate. Analogous substrates for other members of the integrase family of recombinases (lambda integrase protein, P1-Cre protein) as well as for mammalian topoisomerase I are also active as ligation substrates with their cognate protein. This class of activated substrates should be useful in the study of breakage and reunion reactions involving DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1530509622,"Protein kinase C (PKC) regulates many cellular functions; we have examined the role of PKC in the regulation of the alpha 1B adrenergic receptor gene. Exposure of DDT1 MF-2 cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 nM) increased values of alpha 1B receptor mRNA with peak changes found at 4 h (3.2-fold increase). Increased values of alpha 1B receptor mRNA occurred at PMA concentrations as low as 10 pM with a maximal response at 100 nM. Also, PMA induced a time-dependent increase in the number of alpha 1B receptors. Stimulation of cells with phenylephrine led to an increase in IP3 production after 3, 6, and 12 h of treatment with PMA. Induction of the alpha 1B receptor mRNA was suppressed by the PKC inhibitors H7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulsulfonyl)2-methylpiperazine) and saurosporine; the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate and calcium ionophores A23187 and Bay K8644 did not increase alpha 1B receptor mRNA. The half-life of the alpha 1B receptor mRNA was unchanged by PMA. Nuclear runoff assays demonstrated that PMA produced a marked increase in the transcription rate of alpha 1B adrenergic receptor expression is mediated by a PKC-dependent mechanism that occurs at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1532616494,"Abstract The pre-steady state time course of amiloride-sensitive Na+o uptake by the Na(+)-H+ exchanger in renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) exhibits a burst phase at 0 degrees C which corresponds to the initial turnover of the exchanger (Otsu, K., Kinsella, J. L., Sacktor, B. S., and Froehlich, J. P. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 4818-4822). Investigation of the Na+o dependence of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger between 1 and 10 mM Na+ revealed that activation of the burst phase involves at least two Na+ transport sites interacting with positive cooperativity. In this study, characterization of the Na+ transport sites contributing to the burst phase was extended to include Na+ concentrations below 1 mM. Between 0.1 and 1 mM Na+ the amplitude of the burst phase in acid-loaded BBMV (pHi 5.7; pHo 7.7) exhibited a sigmoidal dependence on [Na+]o, consistent with the presence of a second class of high affinity Na+ transport sites with cooperative binding characteristics. In contrast, steady state Na+ uptake obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, similar to the behavior observed previously at higher (1-10 mM) Na+o concentrations. Treatment of the vesicles with carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, which induced the formation of an inside-negative membrane potential, increased the burst amplitude but had no effect on the steady state uptake velocity. Experiments performed with alkaline-loaded BBMV (pHi 7.7; pHo 7.7), which permit only a single turnover of the exchanger, gave a simple hyperbolic dependence of the burst amplitude on [Na+]o (0.5-5 mM). We propose that the change in multiplicity of Na+ transport sites and membrane potential sensitivity that occurs in the transition between the pre-steady state and the steady state of Na+ uptake in acid-loaded vesicles reflects the presence of an oligomer which operates according to a flip-flop mechanism. The minimum subunit composition inferred from the biphasic [Na+]o dependence of the burst amplitude is a dimer at low (< 1 mM) Na+o levels and a tetramer at high [Na+]o. Communication between the subunits producing the complex [Na+]o dependence is controlled by the intravesicular (cytoplasmic) H+ modifier site. Under alkaline conditions (pH 7.7), where this site is unoccupied, the subunits behave as independent units and cease operation after the first turnover. Occupation of the H+ modifier site activates a conformational interaction between the subunits that leads to cooperative Na+o binding, alternation of the transport sites, and repetitive cycling of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger."

https://openalex.org/W1582695838,"Abstract The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor from the human melanoma cell line IGR39 has been shown to be a 60-kDa glycoprotein. Using serial lectin affinity chromatography, as well as specific glycosidases, we demonstrate that VIP receptor-linked carbohydrates are predominantly tri- or tetraantennary sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides, 27% of which are fucosylated, and some may have terminal galactose residues. Treatment of 125I-VIP receptor complexes with peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase revealed the presence of at least three N-linked carbohydrate chains/receptor polypeptide. To investigate the functional role of the carbohydrate moiety, 125I-VIP binding to IGR39 cell membranes was tested in the presence of soluble lectins. Among the lectins tested, only wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was found to markedly inhibit VIP binding in a dose-dependent manner. Binding data indicated that the presence of the lectin led to a 3-fold increase in Kd value, from 0.15 to 0.44 nM, without any change in the number of available binding sites. The potent inhibitor of WGA binding, N,N',N-triacetylchitotriose, completely reversed the effect of the lectin. On the other hand, VIP binding inhibition persisted even after neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that sialic acids were not directly involved. Furthermore, WGA inhibition was not abolished although most, if not all, VIP receptor oligosaccharides were converted to high mannose type structures by treating IGR39 cells with deoxymannojirimycin. Finally, whereas the pharmacological profile of VIP receptor was virtually identical, the presence of WGA greatly reduced the VIP-stimulated cAMP in IGR39 cells, indicating that the lectin alters the ability of the receptor to interact with the adenylate cyclase system."

Antisera detected a M(r) 112,000 protein on Western blots of liver cytosol. This protein was not detected in purified CT and was not detected by preimmune serum. The 112-kDa antibodies, isolated by affinity chromatography, did not immunoprecipitate CT activity. Antiserum raised against an N-terminal sequence of CT and antibodies raised against an internal sequence of CT immunoprecipitated CT activity but did not detect the 112-kDa protein. These results showed that the 112-kDa protein was not a form of CT. We concluded that the antiserum probably contained anti-idiotypic antibodies that recognized CT binding sites on the 112-kDa protein. Purified CT that was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase bound to crude 112-kDa protein immobilized on nitrocellulose. The binding was competitively reduced by purified CT and by affinity-purified antibodies to the 112-kDa protein. CT and 112-kDa protein coeluted from DEAE-Sepharose. When the putative 112-kDa protein-CT complex was chromatographed on a second DEAE-Sepharose column or on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column, CT activity and 112-kDa protein were eluted together. Chromatography of the complex on hydroxylapatite dissociated most of the complex, producing CT free of the 112-kDa protein. We conclude that the 112-kDa protein is a CT-binding protein. The formation and/or dissociation of this complex may be important in the regulation of CT."

https://openalex.org/W1558657269,"To address the role of protein phosphatases in regulating hormonal responses in mammalian cells, we investigated the effects of okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, on epinephrine and prostaglandin E1 stimulation of cAMP accumulation and adenylyl cyclase in S49 WT and kin- lymphoma cells. Depending on the dose and time of okadaic acid pretreatment of both cell lines, there were two distinguishable effects on cAMP accumulation, an augmentation and an inhibition. The augmentation occurred rapidly (t1/2 < 1 min), was maximal with 3 microM okadaic acid, and was observed with concentrations of okadaic acid as low as 0.3 microM. Prolonged (t1/2 of 5-15 min) pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid caused an inhibition of epinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation, which was characterized by a 2-3-fold increase in the EC50 for the response to epinephrine. The EC50 for the okadaic acid-mediated inhibition was similar to that for the augmentation. In assays of adenylyl cyclase in membrane fractions prepared from okadaic acid-pretreated cells the inhibitory, but not the stimulatory, effects of okadaic acid pretreatment were observed. The data demonstrate that protein phosphatases play an important role in regulating adenylyl cyclase and suggest that cAMP-dependent protein kinase is not involved in either of its actions."
https://openalex.org/W1568828128,"Resonance energy transfer was used to monitor the interactions of the gamma subunit of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (gamma PDE) with the alpha and beta subunits, which together comprise the catalytic core of the enzyme (alpha beta PDE). An iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF)-labeled alpha beta PDE (IAF-PDEt) served as the acceptor species in these experiments while a coumarin maleimide-modified gamma PDE (CPM-gamma PDE) served as the fluorescent donor. Trypsin treatment of an IAF-labeled, intact phosphodiesterase (PDE) complex resulted in the selective proteolysis of the gamma PDE and full activation of enzyme activity. The binding of IAF-PDEt to the CPM-gamma PDE was monitored directly by measuring the quenching (25-35%) of the CPM fluorescence emission or by measuring the changes in the rate cGMP hydrolysis by IAF-PDEt using the pH electrode method. Both methods yielded titration curves which were well fitted using a single affinity constant (Kd approximately 1-2 nM). Under conditions where added CPM-gamma PDE resulted in complete inhibition of the IAF-PDEt activity and, conversely, a maximal quenching of the CPM-gamma PDE fluorescence by added IAF-PDEt, the subsequent addition of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) bound form of the alpha subunit of transducin (alpha TGTP gamma S) restored approximately 50% of the enzyme activity while restoring < 30% of the CPM-gamma PDE fluorescence emission. Based on these results, we suggest that a portion of the observed PDE activation by alpha TGTP gamma S occurs via an associated complex of alpha TGTP gamma S and the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1567016612,"We have utilized a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) glycoprotein gene containing a mutation in the endoproteolytic cleavage site to investigate the biological significance of processing, the structural requirements for and the events involved in the proteolytic maturation of MMTV. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, the endoproteolytic cleavage site within the MMTV glycoprotein was mutated from Arg-Ala-Lys-Arg to Arg-Ala-Asn-Gln and both the wild-type and mutated genes were transfected and expressed in HTC rat hepatoma cells. Indirect immunofluorescence, steady state radiolabeling and pulse-chase kinetic experiments demonstrated that this mutated glycoprotein was transported to the cell surface with the same efficiency as the wild-type maturation products; however, proteolytic cleavage and fusogenic activity were almost completely abolished. Consistent with the lack of cleavage, the endoglycosidase H-resistant precursor, gp78, accumulated on the cell surface and in the extracellular environment. When HTC cells expressing the wild-type MMTV glycoprotein were treated with the Golgi mannosidase I and II inhibitors, deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine respectively, the resulting endogycosidase H-sensitive glycoproteins were processed efficiently. Taken together, these results suggest that proteolytic processing of the MMTV glycoprotein most likely occurs in the trans Golgi or at a later step in the exocytic pathway and occurs after the formation of an endoglycosidase H-resistant, terminally sialylated intermediate. Moreover, the acquisition of endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides is not a prerequisite for recognition by the cellular proteases to generate the viral maturation products. Our evidence also suggests that the processing of the MMTV envelope glycoprotein is required for the functional exposure of the fusion domain which is involved in viral infectivity."
