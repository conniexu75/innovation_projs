https://openalex.org/W1975958074,"Effective navigation requires planning extended routes to remembered goal locations. Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as 'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W1973938885,"Since the publication of the human reference genome, the identities of specific genes associated with human diseases are being discovered at a rapid rate. A central problem is that the biological activity of these genes is often unclear. Detailed investigations in model vertebrate organisms, typically mice, have been essential for understanding the activities of many orthologues of these disease-associated genes. Although gene-targeting approaches and phenotype analysis have led to a detailed understanding of nearly 6,000 protein-coding genes, this number falls considerably short of the more than 22,000 mouse protein-coding genes. Similarly, in zebrafish genetics, one-by-one gene studies using positional cloning, insertional mutagenesis, antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, targeted re-sequencing, and zinc finger and TAL endonucleases have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the biological activity of vertebrate genes, but again the number of genes studied falls well short of the more than 26,000 zebrafish protein-coding genes. Importantly, for both mice and zebrafish, none of these strategies are particularly suited to the rapid generation of knockouts in thousands of genes and the assessment of their biological activity. Here we describe an active project that aims to identify and phenotype the disruptive mutations in every zebrafish protein-coding gene, using a well-annotated zebrafish reference genome sequence, high-throughput sequencing and efficient chemical mutagenesis. So far we have identified potentially disruptive mutations in more than 38% of all known zebrafish protein-coding genes. We have developed a multi-allelic phenotyping scheme to efficiently assess the effects of each allele during embryogenesis and have analysed the phenotypic consequences of over 1,000 alleles. All mutant alleles and data are available to the community and our phenotyping scheme is adaptable to phenotypic analysis beyond embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1969210272,"The neonatal heart has a high regenerative capacity that is lost in adult life; the transcription factor Meis1 has been identified as a relevant proliferative switch for this transition, providing a potential therapeutic target for adult heart regeneration. Adult mammalian hearts cannot regenerate after injury, but neonatal mouse hearts can regenerate through cardiomyocyte proliferation until postnatal day 7, when the cells exit the cell cycle. Hesham Sadek and colleagues now provide insight into the mechanisms behind this transition. They show that the transcription factor Meis1 regulates the cardiomyocyte cell cycle, and that deletion of the Meis1 gene in cardiomyocytes extends their postnatal proliferative window beyond 7 days. Conversely, overexpression of Meis1 inhibits neonatal mouse heart regeneration. These results demonstrate that the early postnatal cardiac regenerative window may hold the key to the potential of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate, and that Meis1 is a potential therapeutic target. The neonatal mammalian heart is capable of substantial regeneration following injury through cardiomyocyte proliferation1,2. However, this regenerative capacity is lost by postnatal day 7 and the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest remain unclear. The homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 is required for normal cardiac development but its role in cardiomyocytes is unknown3,4. Here we identify Meis1 as a critical regulator of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Meis1 deletion in mouse cardiomyocytes was sufficient for extension of the postnatal proliferative window of cardiomyocytes, and for re-activation of cardiomyocyte mitosis in the adult heart with no deleterious effect on cardiac function. In contrast, overexpression of Meis1 in cardiomyocytes decreased neonatal myocyte proliferation and inhibited neonatal heart regeneration. Finally, we show that Meis1 is required for transcriptional activation of the synergistic CDK inhibitors p15, p16 and p21. These results identify Meis1 as a critical transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and a potential therapeutic target for heart regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1990997025,"The geometric aspects of quantum mechanics are underlined most prominently by the concept of geometric phases, which are acquired whenever a quantum system evolves along a closed path in Hilbert space. The geometric phase is determined only by the shape of this path and is -- in its simplest form -- a real number. However, if the system contains degenerate energy levels, matrix-valued geometric phases, termed non-abelian holonomies, can emerge. They play an important role for the creation of synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases and the description of non-abelian anyon statistics. Moreover, it has been proposed to exploit non-abelian holonomic gates for robust quantum computation. In contrast to abelian geometric phases, non-abelian ones have been observed only in nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins and without fully characterizing the geometric process and its non-commutative nature. Here, we realize non-abelian holonomic quantum operations on a single superconducting artificial three-level atom by applying a well controlled two-tone microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine fidelities of the resulting non-commuting gates exceeding 95 %. We show that a sequence of two paths in Hilbert space traversed in different order yields inequivalent transformations, which is an evidence for the non-abelian character of the implemented holonomic quantum gates. In combination with two-qubit operations, they form a universal set of gates for holonomic quantum computation."

https://openalex.org/W2163636666,"The pluripotency factor Lin28 blocks the expression of let-7 microRNAs in undifferentiated cells during development, and functions as an oncogene in a subset of cancers. Lin28 binds to let-7 precursor (pre-let-7) RNAs and recruits 3' terminal uridylyl transferases to selectively inhibit let-7 biogenesis. Uridylated pre-let-7 is refractory to processing by Dicer, and is rapidly degraded by an unknown RNase. Here we identify Dis3l2 as the 3'-5' exonuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated pre-let-7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical reconstitution assays show that 3' oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2 activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to the stabilization of pre-let-7. Our study establishes 3' oligouridylation as an RNA decay signal for Dis3l2, and identifies the first physiological RNA substrate of this new exonuclease, which is mutated in the Perlman syndrome of fetal overgrowth and causes a predisposition to Wilms' tumour development."
https://openalex.org/W2045046980,"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and presents a complex phenotype that arises from abnormal dosage of genes on this chromosome. However, the individual dosage-sensitive genes underlying each phenotype remain largely unknown. To help dissect genotype – phenotype correlations in this complex syndrome, the first fully transchromosomic mouse model, the Tc1 mouse, which carries a copy of human chromosome 21 was produced in 2005. The Tc1 strain is trisomic for the majority of genes that cause phenotypes associated with DS, and this freely available mouse strain has become used widely to study DS, the effects of gene dosage abnormalities, and the effect on the basic biology of cells when a mouse carries a freely segregating human chromosome. Tc1 mice were created by a process that included irradiation microcell-mediated chromosome transfer of Hsa21 into recipient mouse embryonic stem cells. Here, the combination of next generation sequencing, array-CGH and fluorescence in situ hybridization technologies has enabled us to identify unsuspected rearrangements of Hsa21 in this mouse model; revealing one deletion, six duplications and more than 25 de novo structural rearrangements. Our study is not only essential for informing functional studies of the Tc1 mouse but also (1) presents for the first time a detailed sequence analysis of the effects of gamma radiation on an entire human chromosome, which gives some mechanistic insight into the effects of radiation damage on DNA, and (2) overcomes specific technical difficulties of assaying a human chromosome on a mouse background where highly conserved sequences may confound the analysis. Sequence data generated in this study is deposited in the ENA database, Study Accession number: ERP000439."
https://openalex.org/W2028380074,"The neurodegenerative processes that underlie Alzheimer's disease are mediated, in part, by soluble oligomeric amyloid β, a neurotoxic protein that inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation, disrupts synaptic plasticity, and induces the production of reactive oxygen species. Here we show that the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) agonist fingolimod phosphate (FTY720-P)-a new oral drug for multiple sclerosis-protects neurons against oligomeric amyloid β-induced neurotoxicity. We confirmed that primary mouse cortical neurons express all of the S1P receptor subtypes and FTY720-P directly affects the neurons. Treatment with FTY720-P enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurons. Moreover, blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling with a BDNF scavenger, TrkB inhibitor, or ERK1/2 inhibitor almost completely ablated these neuroprotective effects. These results suggested that the neuroprotective effects of FTY720-P are mediated by upregulated neuronal BDNF levels. Therefore, FTY720-P may be a promising therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2168203535,"Catastrophic and sudden collapses of ecosystems are sometimes preceded by early warning signals that potentially could be used to predict and prevent a forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2068603783,"Heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction exacts a major economic, morbidity and mortality burden in the United States. Therapeutic agents to improve diastolic dysfunction are limited. It was recently found that Dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) mediates mitochondrial fission during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, whereas inhibition of Drp1 decreases myocardial infarct size. We hypothesized that Dynasore, a small noncompetitive dynamin GTPase inhibitor, could have beneficial effects on cardiac physiology during I/R injury.In Langendorff perfused mouse hearts subjected to I/R (30 minutes of global ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion), pretreatment with 1 µM Dynasore prevented I/R induced elevation of left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), indicating a significant and specific lusitropic effect. Dynasore also decreased cardiac troponin I efflux during reperfusion and reduced infarct size. In cultured adult mouse cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress, Dynasore increased cardiomyocyte survival and viability identified by trypan blue exclusion assay and reduced cellular Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) depletion. Moreover, in cultured cells, Dynasore pretreatment protected mitochondrial fragmentation induced by oxidative stress.Dynasore protects cardiac lusitropy and limits cell damage through a mechanism that maintains mitochondrial morphology and intracellular ATP in stressed cells. Mitochondrial protection through an agent such as Dynasore can have clinical benefit by positively influencing the energetics of diastolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1965645114,"This study examined the prevalence of addictive Internet use and analyzed the role of parental relationship in affecting this behavior among a random sample of adolescents in Wuhan, China.Students (n = 1,101) were randomly selected from four schools, including 638 boys and 463 girls with a mean age of 13.8 (standard deviation = 1.2) years. Addictive Internet use, parental relationship, hyperactivity-impulsivity were measured by validated instruments. Prevalence rate, ANOVA and multiple linear regression method were used to analyze the level of Internet addiction and its association with parental relationship, hyperactivity-impulsivity, as well as the interaction of parental relationship with chronological age and hyperactivity-impulsivity.The prevalence rate of Internet addiction was 13.5% (16.5% for boys and 9.5% for girls, p<0.01). Compared to non-addictive users, addictive Internet users were scored significantly lower on parental relationships and significantly higher on hyperactivity-impulsivity. Interaction analysis indicated that better parental relationship was associated with more reductions in risk of addictive Internet use for younger students than for older students, and with more risk of Internet addiction among higher than among lower hyperactivity-impulsivity students.Findings of this study indicate that adolescent addictive Internet use is a significant public health threat in China. Prevention interventions targeting parental relationship must consider adolescent's age and hyperactivity-impulsivity tendency."
https://openalex.org/W1970205093,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) develops as a result of complex epigenetic, genetic and environmental interactions. Epigenetic changes like, promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes are frequent events in cancer, and certain habit-related carcinogens are thought to be capable of inducing aberrant methylation. However, the effects of environmental carcinogens depend upon the level of metabolism by carcinogen metabolizing enzymes. As such key interactions between habits related factors and carcinogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms towards modulating promoter methylation of genes are likely. However, this remains largely unexplored in ESCC. Here, we studied the interaction of various habits related factors and polymorphism of GSTM1/GSTT1 genes towards inducing promoter hypermethylation of multiple tumour suppressor genes.The study included 112 ESCC cases and 130 age and gender matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to explore high order interactions. Tobacco chewing and smoking were the major individual risk factors of ESCC after adjusting for all potential confounding factors. With regards to methylation status, significantly higher methylation frequencies were observed in tobacco chewers than non chewers for all the four genes under study (p<0.01). In logistic regression analysis, betel quid chewing, alcohol consumption and null GSTT1 genotypes imparted maximum risk for ESCC without promoter hypermethylation. Whereas, tobacco chewing, smoking and GSTT1 null variants were the most important risk factors for ESCC with promoter hypermethylation. MDR analysis revealed two predictor models for ESCC with promoter hypermethylation (Tobacco chewing/Smoking/Betel quid chewing/GSTT1 null) and ESCC without promoter hypermethylation (Betel quid chewing/Alcohol/GSTT1) with TBA of 0.69 and 0.75 respectively and CVC of 10/10 in both models.Our study identified a possible interaction between tobacco consumption and carcinogen metabolizing gene polymorphisms towards modulating promoter methylation of tumour suppressor genes in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2064901336,"We investigated GH action on macrophage (MΦ) by creating a MΦ-specific GH receptor-null mouse model (MacGHR KO). On a normal diet (10% fat), MacGHR KO and littermate controls exhibited similar growth profiles and glucose excursions on intraperitoneal glucose (ipGTT) and insulin tolerance (ITT) tests. However, when challenged with high fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 18 weeks, MacGHR KO mice exhibited impaired ipGTT and ITT compared with controls. In MacGHR KO, adipose-tissue (AT) MΦ abundance was increased with skewing toward M1 polarization.

https://openalex.org/W2039799423,"Nanomedicine has the potential to transform clinical care in the 21st century. However, a precise understanding of how nanomaterial design parameters such as size, shape and composition affect the mammalian immune system is a prerequisite for the realization of nanomedicine's translational promise. Herein, we make use of the recently developed Particle Replication in Non-wetting Template (PRINT) fabrication process to precisely fabricate particles across and the nano- and micro-scale with defined shapes and compositions to address the role of particle design parameters on the murine innate immune response in both in vitro and in vivo settings. We find that particles composed of either the biodegradable polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or the biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) do not cause release of pro-inflammatory cytokines nor inflammasome activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages. When instilled into the lungs of mice, particle composition and size can augment the number and type of innate immune cells recruited to the lungs without triggering inflammatory responses as assayed by cytokine release and histopathology. Smaller particles (80×320 nm) are more readily taken up in vivo by monocytes and macrophages than larger particles (6 µm diameter), yet particles of all tested sizes remained in the lungs for up to 7 days without clearance or triggering of host immunity. These results suggest rational design of nanoparticle physical parameters can be used for sustained and localized delivery of therapeutics to the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2029622458,"Shewanella oneidensis exhibits a remarkable versatility in respiration, which largely relies on its various respiratory pathways. Most of these pathways are composed of secretory terminal reductases and multiple associated electron transport proteins that contain cofactors such as Fe-S, molybdopterin, and NiFe. The majority of these cofactors are inserted enzymatically in the cytoplasm, and thus are substrates of the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) protein export system, which transports fully folded proteins. Using genomic array footprinting, we discovered that loss of TatA or TatC caused a reduction in the growth rate of S. oneidensis under aerobic conditions. Mutational analysis of the predicted Tat substrates revealed that PetA, the Rieske Fe-S subunit of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, predominantly dictates the aerobic growth defect of tat mutants in S. oneidensis. In addition, evidence is presented that the signal sequence in PetA appears to be resistant to cleavage after the protein is inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2050701913,"The giant virus Mimiviridae family includes 3 groups of viruses: group A (includes Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus), group B (includes Moumouvirus) and group C (includes Megavirus chilensis). Virophages have been isolated with both group A Mimiviridae (the Mamavirus strain) and the related Cafeteria roenbergensis virus, and they have also been described by bioinformatic analysis of the Phycodnavirus. Here, we found that the first two strains of virophages isolated with group A Mimiviridae can multiply easily in groups B and C and play a role in gene transfer among these virus subgroups. To isolate new virophages and their Mimiviridae host in the environment, we used PCR to identify a sample with a virophage and a group C Mimiviridae that failed to grow on amoeba. Moreover, we showed that virophages reduce the pathogenic effect of Mimivirus (plaque formation), establishing its parasitic role on Mimivirus. We therefore developed a co-culture procedure using Acanthamoeba polyphaga and Mimivirus to recover the detected virophage and then sequenced the virophage's genome. We present this technique as a novel approach to isolating virophages. We demonstrated that the newly identified virophages replicate in the viral factories of all three groups of Mimiviridae, suggesting that the spectrum of virophages is not limited to their initial host."
https://openalex.org/W1985573501,"Ocean acidification, characterized by elevated pCO₂ and the associated decreases in seawater pH and calcium carbonate saturation state (Ω), has a variable impact on the growth and survival of marine invertebrates. Larval stages are thought to be particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors, and negative impacts of ocean acidification have been seen on fertilization as well as on embryonic, larval, and juvenile development and growth of bivalve molluscs. We investigated the effects of high CO₂ exposure (resulting in pH = 7.39, Ω(ar) = 0.74) on the larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians from 12 h to 7 d old, including a switch from high CO₂ to ambient CO₂ conditions (pH = 7.93, Ω(ar) = 2.26) after 3 d, to assess the possibility of persistent effects of early exposure. The survival of larvae in the high CO₂ treatment was consistently lower than the survival of larvae in ambient conditions, and was already significantly lower at 1 d. Likewise, the shell length of larvae in the high CO₂ treatment was significantly smaller than larvae in the ambient conditions throughout the experiment and by 7 d, was reduced by 11.5%. This study also demonstrates that the size effects of short-term exposure to high CO₂ are still detectable after 7 d of larval development; the shells of larvae exposed to high CO₂ for the first 3 d of development and subsequently exposed to ambientCO₂ were not significantly different in size at 3 and 7 d than the shells of larvae exposed to high CO₂ throughout the experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2056463455,"Kinetic analysis of the DNA unwinding and translocation activities of helicases is necessary for characterization of the biochemical mechanism(s) for this class of enzymes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase was characterized using presteady state kinetics to determine rates of DNA unwinding, displacement of streptavidin from biotinylated DNA, translocation on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and ATP hydrolysis activities. Unwinding of substrates containing varying duplex lengths was fit globally to a model for stepwise unwinding and resulted in an unwinding rate of ∼75 bp/s and a kinetic step size of 1 base pair. Pif1 is capable of displacing streptavidin from biotinylated oligonucleotides with a linear increase in the rates as the length of the oligonucleotides increased. The rate of translocation on ssDNA was determined by measuring dissociation from varying lengths of ssDNA and is essentially the same as the rate of unwinding of dsDNA, making Pif1 an active helicase. The ATPase activity of Pif1 on ssDNA was determined using fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein to measure the rate of phosphate release. The quantity of phosphate released corresponds to a chemical efficiency of 0.84 ATP/nucleotides translocated. Hence, when all of the kinetic data are considered, Pif1 appears to move along DNA in single nucleotide or base pair steps, powered by hydrolysis of 1 molecule of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2027605269,"Transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi is mediated by the coat protein complex COPII. The inner coat of COPII is assembled from heterodimers of SEC23 and SEC24. Though mice with mutations in one of the four Sec24 paralogs, Sec24b, exhibit a neural tube closure defect, deficiency in humans or mice has not yet been described for any of the other Sec24 paralogs. We now report characterization of mice with targeted disruption of Sec24d. Early embryonic lethality is observed in mice completely deficient in SEC24D, while a hypomorphic Sec24d allele permits survival to mid-embryogenesis. Mice haploinsufficient for Sec24d exhibit no phenotypic abnormality. A BAC transgene containing Sec24d rescues the embryonic lethality observed in Sec24d-null mice. These results demonstrate an absolute requirement for SEC24D expression in early mammalian development that is not compensated by the other three Sec24 paralogs. The early embryonic lethality resulting from loss of SEC24D in mice contrasts with the previously reported mild skeletal phenotype of SEC24D deficiency in zebrafish and restricted neural tube phenotype of SEC24B deficiency in mice. Taken together, these observations suggest that the multiple Sec24 paralogs have developed distinct functions over the course of vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2042373035,"Introduction Though inconsistent, a number of studies have shown an association between vitamin D (25(OH)D) status, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the metabolic syndrome (Met S). These have largely been carried out in Caucasians or black subjects living in high income countries. There no data on the relationship of 25(OH)D and PTH status with Met S in populations resident in Africa. The aims of this study were to evaluate if there was an association of 25(OH)D or PTH with Met S in non-Caucasian populations in South Africa, and whether these molecules explained ethnic differences in the prevalence of Met S and its individual components. Methods We measured anthropometry, serum 25(OH)D and PTH levels and the components of Met S, plus related metabolic variables, in 374 African and 350 Asian Indian healthy adults from the greater Johannesburg metropolitan area. Results Met S was diagnosed in 29% of the African and 46% of the Asian Indian subjects (p<0.0001). Subjects with Met S had higher PTH than those without Met S, (p<0.0001), whilst 25(OH)D levels were not significantly different (p = 0.50). In multivariate analysis, 25(OH)D was not associated with any components of the Met S however PTH was shown to be positively associated with systolic (p = 0.018) and diastolic (p = 0.005) blood pressures and waist circumference (p<0.0001) and negatively associated with HOMA (p = 0.0008) levels. Logistic regression analysis showed that Asian Indian ethnicity (OR 2.24; 95% CIs 1.57, 3.18; p<0.0001) and raised PTH (OR 2.48; 95% CIs 1.01, 6.08; p = 0.04; adjusted for 25(OH)D) produced an increased risk of Met S but 25(OH)D did not (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.67, 2.24; p = 0.48). Conclusions Plasma PTH but not 25(OH)D is an independent predictor of the Met S in African and Asian Indians in South Africa."

Here we show that the knockdown of macro histone variants impaired the in vitro and in vivo differentiation of human pluripotent cells, likely through defects in the silencing of pluripotency-related genes. ChIP experiments showed that during differentiation macro histone variants are recruited to the regulatory regions of pluripotency and developmental genes marked with H3K27me3 contributing to the silencing of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W1968104657,"While the extraordinary life span of queens and division of labor in eusocial societies have been well studied, it is less clear which selective forces act on the short life span of workers. The disparity of life span between the queen and the workers is linked to a basic issue in sociobiology: How are the resources in a colony allocated between colony maintenance and reproduction? Resources for somatic maintenance of the colony can either be invested into quality or quantity of workers. Here, we present a theoretical optimization model that uses a hierarchical trade-off within insect colonies and extrinsic mortality to explain how different aging phenotypes could have evolved to keep resources secure in the colony. The model points to the significance of two factors. First, any investment that would generate a longer intrinsic life span for workers is lost if the individual dies from external causes while foraging. As a consequence, risky environments favor the evolution of workers with a shorter life span. Second, shorter-lived workers require less investment than long-lived ones, allowing the colony to allocate these resources to sexual reproduction or colony growth."
https://openalex.org/W1995182600,"The protein kindlin 3 is mutated in the leukocyte adhesion deficiency III (LAD-III) disorder, leading to widespread infection due to the failure of leukocytes to migrate into infected tissue sites. To gain understanding of how kindlin 3 controls leukocyte function, we have focused on its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and find that deletion of this domain eliminates the ability of kindlin 3 to participate in adhesion and migration of B cells mediated by the leukocyte integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). PH domains are often involved in membrane localization of proteins through binding to phosphoinositides. We show that the kindlin 3 PH domain has binding affinity for phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 over PI(4,5)P2. It has a major role in membrane association of kindlin 3 that is enhanced by the binding of LFA-1 to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). A splice variant, kindlin 3-IPRR, has a four-residue insert in the PH domain at a critical site that influences phosphoinositide binding by enhancing binding to PI(4,5)P2 as well as by binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. However kindlin 3-IPRR is unable to restore the ability of LAD-III B cells to adhere to and migrate on LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1, potentially by altering the dynamics or PI specificity of binding to the membrane. Thus, the correct functioning of the kindlin 3 PH domain is central to the role that kindlin 3 performs in guiding lymphocyte adhesion and motility behavior, which in turn is required for a successful immune response.Background: Kindlin 3 is mutated in LAD-III causing widespread infection, but its role in leukocyte function is incompletely understood.Results: Deletion of the PH domain removes kindlin 3 from lymphocyte cell membrane and eliminates adhesion and migration.Conclusion: The PH domain is intrinsic to kindlin 3 regulation of integrin LFA-1-mediated lymphocyte function.Significance: A successful immune response depends on kindlin 3, and its PH subdomain is crucial.

However kindlin 3-IPRR is unable to restore the ability of LAD-III B cells to adhere to and migrate on LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1, potentially by altering the dynamics or PI specificity of binding to the membrane. Thus, the correct functioning of the kindlin 3 PH domain is central to the role that kindlin 3 performs in guiding lymphocyte adhesion and motility behavior, which in turn is required for a successful immune response. Background: Kindlin 3 is mutated in LAD-III causing widespread infection, but its role in leukocyte function is incompletely understood. Results: Deletion of the PH domain removes kindlin 3 from lymphocyte cell membrane and eliminates adhesion and migration. Conclusion: The PH domain is intrinsic to kindlin 3 regulation of integrin LFA-1-mediated lymphocyte function. Significance: A successful immune response depends on kindlin 3, and its PH subdomain is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2018851980,"Background The temperature in arid Eastern Central Asia is projected to increase in the future, accompanied by increased variability of precipitation. To investigate the impacts of climate change on plant species in this area, we selected two widespread species as candidates, Clematis sibirica and C. songorica, from montane coniferous forest and arid steppe habitats respectively. Methodology/Principal Findings We employed a combined approach of molecular phylogeography and species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict the future responses of these two species to climate change, utilizing evidence of responses from the past. Genetic data for C. sibirica shows a significant phylogeographical signal (NST > FST, P<0.05) and demographic contraction during the glacial-interglacial cycles in the Pleistocene. This forest species would likely experience range reduction, though without genetic loss, in the face of future climate change. In contrast, SDMs predict that C. songorica, a steppe species, should maintain a consistently stable potential distribution under the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the future climatic conditions referring to its existing potential distribution. Molecular results indicate that the presence of significant phylogeographical signal in this steppe species is rejected and this species contains a high level of genetic differentiation among populations in cpDNA, likely benefiting from stable habitats over a lengthy time period. Conclusions/Significance Evidence from the molecular phylogeography of these two species, the forest species is more sensitive to past climate changes than the steppe species. SDMs predict that the forest species will face the challenge of potential range contraction in the future more than the steppe species. This provides a perspective on ecological management in arid Eastern Central Asia, indicating that increased attention should be paid to montane forest species, due to their high sensitivity to disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2032489903,"The microtubule cytoskeleton network orchestrates cellular dynamics and chromosome stability in mitosis. Although tubulin acetylation is essential for cellular plasticity, it has remained elusive how kinetochore microtubule plus-end dynamics are regulated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetylation in mitosis. Here, we demonstrate that the plus-end tracking protein, TIP150, regulates dynamic kinetochore-microtubule attachments by promoting the stability of spindle microtubule plus-ends. Suppression of TIP150 by siRNA results in metaphase alignment delays and perturbations in chromosome biorientation. TIP150 is a tetramer that binds an end-binding protein (EB1) dimer through the C-terminal domains, and overexpression of the C-terminal TIP150 or disruption of the TIP150-EB1 interface by a membrane-permeable peptide perturbs chromosome segregation. Acetylation of EB1-PCAF regulates the TIP150 interaction, and persistent acetylation perturbs EB1-TIP150 interaction and accurate metaphase alignment, resulting in spindle checkpoint activation. Suppression of the mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine protein kinase, BubR1, overrides mitotic arrest induced by impaired EB1-TIP150 interaction, but cells exhibit whole chromosome aneuploidy. Thus, the results identify a mechanism by which the TIP150-EB1 interaction governs kinetochore microtubule plus-end plasticity and establish that the temporal control of the TIP150-EB1 interaction by PCAF acetylation ensures chromosome stability in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1981304288,"The MecA-ClpC complex is a bacterial type II AAA(+) molecular machine responsible for regulated unfolding of substrates, such as transcription factors ComK and ComS, and targeting them to ClpP for degradation. The six subunits of the MecA-ClpC complex form a closed barrel-like structure, featured with three stacked rings and a hollow passage, where substrates are threaded and translocated through successive pores. Although the general concepts of how polypeptides are unfolded and translocated by internal pore loops of AAA(+) proteins have long been conceived, the detailed mechanistic model remains elusive. With cryoelectron microscopy, we captured four different structures of the MecA-ClpC complexes. These complexes differ in the nucleotide binding states of the two AAA(+) rings and therefore might presumably reflect distinctive, representative snapshots from a dynamic unfolding cycle of this hexameric complex. Structural analysis reveals that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis modulate the hexameric complex in a number of ways, including the opening of the N-terminal ring, the axial and radial positions of pore loops, the compactness of the C-terminal ring, as well as the relative rotation between the two nucleotide-binding domain rings. More importantly, our structural and biochemical data indicate there is an active allosteric communication between the two AAA(+) rings and suggest that concerted actions of the two AAA(+) rings are required for the efficiency of the substrate unfolding and translocation. These findings provide important mechanistic insights into the dynamic cycle of the MecA-ClpC unfoldase and especially lay a foundation toward the complete understanding of the structural dynamics of the general type II AAA(+) hexamers."
https://openalex.org/W2024057381,"Inflammatory mechanisms involving complement activation has been shown to take part in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, but the initiating mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that the main initiator molecules of the lectin complement pathway mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 were related to disease severity and outcome in chronic heart failure.MBL, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 plasma concentrations were determined in two consecutive cohorts comprising 190 patients from Hungary and 183 patients from Norway as well as controls. Disease severity and clinical parameters were determined at baseline, and all-cause mortality was registered after 5-years follow-up. In univariate analysis a low level of ficolin-3, but not that of MBL or ficolin-2, was significantly associated with advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV, p<0.001 for both cohorts) and showed inverse correlation with B- type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (r = -0.609, p<0.001 and r = -0.467, p<0.001, respectively). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender and BNP, decreased plasma ficolin-3 was a significant predictor of mortality (HR 1.368, 95% CI 1.052-6.210; and HR 1.426, 95% CI 1.013-2.008, respectively). Low ficolin-3 levels were associated with increased complement activation product C3a and correspondingly decreased concentrations of complement factor C3.This study provides evidence for an association of low ficolin-3 levels with advanced heart failure. Concordant results from two cohorts show that low levels of ficolin-3 are associated with advanced heart failure and outcome. The decrease of ficolin-3 was associated with increased complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2069694792,"One goal of diabetic regenerative medicine is to instructively convert mature pancreatic exocrine cells into insulin-producing cells. We recently reported that ligand-bound thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) plays a critical role in expansion of the β-cell mass during postnatal development. Here, we used an adenovirus vector that expresses TRα driven by the amylase 2 promoter (AdAmy2TRα) to induce the reprogramming of pancreatic acinar cells into insulin-producing cells. Treatment with l-3,5,3-triiodothyronine increases the association of TRα with the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt and the expression of Pdx1, Ngn3, and MafA in purified acinar cells. Analyses performed with the lectin-associated cell lineage tracing system and the Cre/loxP-based direct cell lineage tracing system indicate that newly synthesized insulin-producing cells originate from elastase-expressing pancreatic acinar cells. Insulin-containing secretory granules were identified in these cells by electron microscopy. The inhibition of p85α expression by siRNA or the inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 prevents the expression of Pdx1, Ngn3, and MafA and the reprogramming to insulin-producing cells. In immunodeficient mice with streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia, treatment with AdAmy2TRα leads to the reprogramming of pancreatic acinar cells to insulin-producing cells in vivo.

The formation of the pancreas and its subsequent differentiation into various types of exocrine and endocrine cells during development are controlled by the activation or repression of a large number of genes (1Edlund H. Transcribing pancreas.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The expression of these genes is regulated by a well organized cascade of transcription factors. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), basic helix-loop-helix factor neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), and MafA are transcription factors that are essential for the transdifferentiation of endocrine cells (1Edlund H. Transcribing pancreas.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 2Schwitzgebel V.M. Scheel D.W. Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Expression of neurogenin3 reveals an islet cell precursor population in the pancreas.Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pdx1 controls the growth and development of the pancreatic bud; Ngn3 is required for formation of endocrine progenitors; and MafA and Pdx1 are required for the maturation of β-cells (3Murtaugh L.C. Melton D.A. Genes, signals, and lineages in pancreas development.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell differentiation type can be reprogrammed by overexpression of selected transcription factors, usually a subset of the transcription factors required for formation of the relevant cell type during normal development. Zhou et al. reported a reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells to β-like cells in vivo by introduction of genes for the three transcription factors, Pdx1, Ngn3, and MafA (4Zhou Q. Brown J. Kanarek A. Rajagopal J. Melton D.A. In vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta-cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Other studies have revealed that mature cells have high plasticity in their differentiation capacity. Pancreatic acinar cells can transdifferentiate into endocrine cells. Indeed, under appropriate culture conditions, dedifferentiated acinar cells can be induced to become insulin-expressing cells via Ngn3 expression (5Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Lineage tracing and characterization of insulin-secreting cells generated from adult pancreatic acinar cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15116-15121Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cell lineage studies have also indicated that pancreatic acinar cells possess sufficient plasticity to transdifferentiate into endocrine cells. Thyroid hormone influences various physiological processes, including cell cycle progression and cell differentiation/development in the vertebrate nervous system. The actions of triiodothyronine (T3) 2The abbreviations used are: T3, triiodothyronine; AdAmy2Cre, Cre-recombinase-expressing adenovirus under control of the amylase2 promoter; AdAmy2TRα, amylase2 promoter-driven adenovirus vector; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; STZ, streptozotocin; TR, thyroid hormone nuclear receptor; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. are mediated through specific thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TR)s that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors that increase or decrease the expression of target genes (6Lazar M.A. Thyroid hormone receptors: multiple forms, multiple possibilities.Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 7Chin W.W. Molecular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action.Thyroid. 1994; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two TR genes located on different chromosomes encode four TR isoforms, designated as α1, β1, β2, and β3, which all bind to T3. These TRs regulate target gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences (thyroid hormone response elements on promoters. TR-mediated transcription is regulated at multiple levels. In addition to these genomic or thyroid hormone response element-mediated effects of T3, nonnuclear or thyroid hormone response element-independent actions of ligand-bound TR have recently been described (8Sakaguchi Y.

These results indicate that T3 rapidly modulates membrane potential, cellular depolarization, and contractile activity by regulating ion flux across plasma membrane ion channels. Regarding the mechanism of transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells, PI3K, Notch, and/or leukocyte inhibitory factor/signal transducers and activators of transcription (LIF/STAT) signals are thought to be involved in the process, based mainly on studies with signaling inhibitor compounds (5Minami K.

Members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, such as estrogen, vitamin D, and TRs, cross-couple to the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the downstream activation of the PI3K signaling (14Hafezi-Moghadam A.

Acute cardiovascular protective effects of corticosteroids are mediated by nontranscriptional activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Indeed, thyroid hormone modulates the interaction of TR with the p85α subunit of PI3K, leading to the activation of Akt and endothelial NOS in vascular endothelial cells (11Hiroi Y. Kim H.H. Ying H. Furuya F. Huang Z. Simoncini T. Noma K. Ueki K. Nguyen N.H. Scanlan T.S. Moskowitz M.A. Cheng S.Y. Liao J.K. Rapid nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These results suggest that ligand-bound TRα plays a critical role in β-cell replication and expansion of the β-cell mass during postnatal development. In the present study, we investigated the physiological importance of the activation of PI3K by TRα and the influence of TRα on the reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells to insulin-producing cells. Immunodeficient, 4-week-old nude mice (BALB/cAJc1-nu/nu) that were treated with 200 mg/kg STZ (Sigma) were sacrificed, and their pancreases were removed and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma). By Ficoll gradient centrifugation, the exocrine fraction was prepared as a pellet (5Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S.

The PCR primers were: kozak-SalI 5′ (GGGGTCGACCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG) and SpeI 3′ (GGGCATCTCAGGATGTTAGACTTCCTGATCCTCAAAGAC). Then, amylase2 promoter-driven adenovirus vector (AdAmy2TRα) was constructed by using the pAd/PL-DEST Gateway vector kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cre-recombinase-expressing adenovirus under control of the amylase2 promoter (AdAmy2Cre) was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR products. The fragments were cloned into attL1 and attL2 sites by using the pAd/PL-DEST Gateway vector kit. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a lectin that binds to N-acetylglucosamine (19Maylié-Pfenninger M.F.

For the specific labeling of acinar cells, freshly isolated exocrine cells were incubated with 4 nm Qdot-conjugated WGA (Invitrogen) in RPMI 1640 Gluta MAX-I medium (Invitrogen) without serum for 10 min and washed three times. To analyze the reprogramming of exocrine cells, culture medium was supplemented with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 30 and 100 nm T3 with or without 10 μm LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology), a PI3K signal-specific inhibitor. The culture medium was not changed throughout the experiment. For lineage tracing with the Cre/loxP-based system, ROSA26-lacZ mice (B6.129S4-Gt (ROSA) 26Sortm1Sor) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Purified pancreatic acinar cells from ROSA26-lacZ mice were coinfected with 30 m.o.i. of AdAmy2TRα and AdAmy2Cre with T3 treatment. After 24, 48, or 72 h of incubation, cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Then, 3-μm sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with 10% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20.

Western blot analysis was performed with anti-TRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against an N-terminal TRα peptide. The association of p85α and TRα in purified acinar cells was determined by coimmunoprecipitation.

For immunoelectron microscopy, samples were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Afterward, these were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in acrylate resin (LR-White). The polymerization was performed using an ultraviolet lamp equipped machine at −20 °C. Ultrathin sections (100–120 nm) were cut using a Ultracut-UCT (Leica) and pre-treated with 2% BSA.

Depletion of β-cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of the pancreas as well as by detection of severe hyperglycemia. After 7 days, mice that showed hyperglycemia (almost 70% of STZ-injected mice) were randomly divided into experimental groups (n = 6) that received 6 × 1010 plaque-forming units/mouse of AdAmy2TRα or AdAmy2LacZ, which are both controlled by the amylase2 promoter. Mice were anesthetized, and adenovirus was injected through the ampulla of Vater, also known as the hepatopancreatic ampulla, into the pancreatic duct. The abdomen was closed by using 2 layers of 4-0 vicryl sutures. T3 (0.25 μg/g body weight) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 3 days. At day 4 following pancreatic duct injection, blood glucose levels or plasma insulin concentrations were analyzed as described (15Furuya F. Shimura H. Yamashita S. Endo T. Kobayashi T.

We first analyzed the expression of endogenous TRα in the pancreatic acinar or β-cells by coimmunoprecipitation of the whole cell lysate with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the TR C-terminal region or with control mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitation was followed by Western blot analysis with antibody against an N-terminal TRα peptide. As shown in Fig. 1a, TRα protein expression was clearly observed in islets, but the TRα protein level was diminished in acinar cells. There was no signal for TRα in mouse IgG-precipitated samples of liver cells. These findings indicate that the expression levels of TRα are different between pancreatic acinar cells and β-cells and that large amounts of TRα are present in insulin-producing cells. In contrast, little TRα was expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. To explore the effects of TRα on the reprogramming of pancreatic acinar cells, we constructed adenovirus vector that expresses AdAmy2TRα. Ficoll-purified acinar cells or β-cells were infected with AdAmy2TRα at an m.o.i. of 30. After 48 h of incubation, the specific expression of FLAG-tagged TRα in purified acinar cells but not in AdAmy2TRα-infected β-cells was shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1b). Several reports suggested that activation of EGF signaling induces transdifferentiation of pancreatic exocrine cells into endocrine cells (5Minami K. Okuno M. Miyawaki K. Okumachi A. Ishizaki K. Oyama K. Kawaguchi M. Ishizuka N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Lineage tracing and characterization of insulin-secreting cells generated from adult pancreatic acinar cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To understand the functional consequences of ligand-bound TRα with downstream signaling molecules of the EGF receptor, we focused on PI3K. Previous reports indicated that TRα binds to the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85α, and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway in vascular endothelial cells (11Hiroi Y. Kim H.H. Ying H. Furuya F. Huang Z. Simoncini T. Noma K. Ueki K. Nguyen N.H. Scanlan T.S. Moskowitz M.A. Cheng S.Y. Liao J.K. Rapid nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14104-14109Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To determine whether ligand-bound TRα can interact with p85α in pancreatic exocrine cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies with anti-FLAG and anti-p85α antibodies (Fig. 1c). The expression levels of endogenous p85α are no different in the lysates of purified acinar cells infected with AdAmy2TRα with or without 100 nm T3 treatment. By using the coimmunoprecipitation assay, we found that TRα and endogenous p85α are associated in a T3-dependent manner in pancreatic acinar cells. To identify the role of TRα in the reprogramming of pancreatic β-cells, purified pancreatic acinar cells were infected with Ad Amy2TRα and treated with or without T3. The expression of transcription factors that are involved in the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells was then analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Infection with Ad Amy2TRα and incubation with T3 for 72 h significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of insulin1, insulin2, and glucokinase and induced the expression of transcription factors expressed at high levels in the early developing pancreas, such as Hnf6, Foxa2, Nkx2.2, NeuroD1, Pdx1, Ngn3, and MafA. In contrast, the expression level of amylase2 was decreased in the AdAmy2TRα-infected exocrine cells treated with T3. These results indicate that ligand-bound TRα specifically induced the genes characteristic of pancreatic"

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the culture system of mice preantral follicles on the follicular development in vitro. The results showed that the 96-well plate system was the most effective method for mice follicle development in vitro (volume change: 51.71%; survival rate: 89%, at day 4). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Thyroid hormone (TH) are important for normal follicular development and dysregulation of hormones are related with impaired follicular development. To determine the effect of hormone on preantral follicular development, we cultured follicle with hormones in the 96-well plate culture system and found that FSH significantly increased preantral follicular growth on day 4. The FSH-induced growth action was markedly enhanced by T3 although T3 was ineffective alone. We also demonstrated by QRT-PCR that T3 significantly enhanced FSH-induced up-regulation of Xiap mRNA level. Meanwhile, Bad, cell death inducer, was markedly down-regulated by the combination of hormones. Moreover, QRT-PCR results were also consistent with protein regulation which detected by Western Blotting analysis. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate that 96-well plate system is an effective method for preantral follicle development in vitro. Moreover, these results provide insights on the role of thyroid hormone in increasing FSH-induced preantral follicular development, which mediated by up-regulating Xiap and down-regulating Bad."

The purified enzyme was stable even in extremely alkaline buffer (pH 11) and reached its highest activity at a low temperature (15°C), which was different from other MBLs. The 50% inhibition concentration of EDTA against NDM-1 was 412 nM, which showed that NDM-1 was more susceptible to EDTA than other MBLs. The effects of zinc on NDM-1 differed between cephem and carbapenem complexes, but inhibition at high Zn(2+) concentration was observed for all of tested β-lactam compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1980514201,"Excessive complement activation contributes to joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis during which cartilage proteins are fragmented and released into the synovial fluid. Some of these proteins and fragments activate complement, which may sustain inflammation. The G3 domain of large cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan interacts with other extracellular matrix proteins, fibulins and tenascins, via its C-type lectin domain (CLD) and has important functions in matrix organization. Fragments containing G3 domain are released during normal aggrecan turnover, but increasingly so in disease. We now show that the aggrecan CLD part of the G3 domain activates the classical and to a lesser extent the alternative pathway of complement, via binding of C1q and C3, respectively. The complement control protein (CCP) domain adjacent to the CLD showed no effect on complement initiation. The binding of C1q to G3 depended on ionic interactions and was decreased in D2267N mutant G3. However, the observed complement activation was attenuated due to binding of complement inhibitor factor H to CLD and CCP domains. This was most apparent at the level of deposition of terminal complement components. Taken together our observations indicate aggrecan CLD as one factor involved in the sustained inflammation of the joint."
https://openalex.org/W2036419841,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) cells are highly invasive, infiltrating into the surrounding normal brain tissue, making it impossible to completely eradicate GBM tumors by surgery or radiation. Increasing evidence also shows that these migratory cells are highly resistant to cytotoxic reagents, but decreasing their migratory capability can re-sensitize them to chemotherapy. These evidences suggest that the migratory cell population may serve as a better therapeutic target for more effective treatment of GBM. In order to understand the regulatory mechanism underlying the motile phenotype, we carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes inhibiting the migration of GBM cells. The screening identified a total of twenty-five primary hits; seven of them were confirmed by secondary screening. Further study showed that three of the genes, FLNA, KHSRP and HCFC1, also functioned in vivo, and knocking them down caused multifocal tumor in a mouse model. Interestingly, two genes, KHSRP and HCFC1, were also found to be correlated with the clinical outcome of GBM patients. These two genes have not been previously associated with cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2061466845,"Pseudomonas fluorescens strain X, a bacterial isolate from the rhizosphere of bean seedlings, has the ability to suppress damping-off caused by the oomycete Pythium ultimum. To determine the genes controlling the biocontrol activity of strain X, transposon mutagenesis, sequencing and complementation was performed. Results indicate that, biocontrol ability of this isolate is attributed to gcd gene encoding glucose dehydrogenase, genes encoding its co-enzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), and two genes (sup5 and sup6) which seem to be organized in a putative operon. This operon (named supX) consists of five genes, one of which encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthase. A unique binding site for a GntR-type transcriptional factor is localized upstream of the supX putative operon. Synteny comparison of the genes in supX revealed that they are common in the genus Pseudomonas, but with a low degree of similarity. supX shows high similarity only to the mangotoxin operon of Ps. syringae pv. syringae UMAF0158. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that transcription of supX is strongly reduced in the gcd and PQQ-minus mutants of Ps. fluorescens strain X. On the contrary, transcription of supX in the wild type is enhanced by glucose and transcription levels that appear to be higher during the stationary phase. Gcd, which uses PQQ as a cofactor, catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid, which controls the activity of the GntR family of transcriptional factors. The genes in the supX putative operon have not been implicated before in the biocontrol of plant pathogens by pseudomonads. They are involved in the biosynthesis of an antimicrobial compound by Ps. fluorescens strain X and their transcription is controlled by glucose, possibly through the activity of a GntR-type transcriptional factor binding upstream of this putative operon."
https://openalex.org/W2090100381,"cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) regulates transcription of gluconeogenic genes by specifying targets for the transcription factor CREB in response to glucagon. We used an antisense oligonucleotide directed against CRTC2 in both normal rodents and in rodent models of increased gluconeogenesis to better understand the role of CRTC2 in metabolic disease. In the context of severe hyperglycemia and elevated hepatic glucose production, CTRC2 knockdown (KD) improved glucose homeostasis by reducing endogenous glucose production. Interestingly, despite the known role of CRTC2 in coordinating gluconeogenic gene expression, CRTC2 KD in a rodent model of type 2 diabetes resulted in surprisingly little alteration of glucose production. However, CRTC2 KD animals had elevated circulating concentrations of glucagon and a ∼80% reduction in glucagon clearance. When this phenomenon was prevented with somatostatin or a glucagon-neutralizing antibody, endogenous glucose production was reduced by CRTC2 KD. Additionally, CRTC2 inhibition resulted in reduced expression of several glucagon-induced pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes that convert amino acids to gluconeogenic intermediates, suggesting that it may control substrate availability as well as gluconeogenic gene expression. CRTC2 is an important regulator of gluconeogenesis with tremendous impact in models of elevated hepatic glucose production. Surprisingly, it is also part of a previously unidentified negative feedback loop that degrades glucagon and regulates amino acid metabolism to coordinately control glucose homeostasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2136937602,"Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is the causative agent of erythema infectiosum in humans. B19 infection also causes severe disease manifestations, such as chronic anemia in immunocompromised patients, aplastic crisis in patients with a high turnover rate of red blood cells, and hydrops fetalis in pregnant women. Although a secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif has been identified in the unique region of the B19V minor capsid protein VP1(VP1u), the determinants for its enzyme activity and its influences on host cells are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of the PLA2 motif and other regions of the VP1u to the PLA2 activity, to determine the cellular localization of the VP1u protein, and to examine the effects of VP1u on cellular cytokines. We found that in addition to the critical conserved and non-conserved amino acids within the VP1u PLA2 motif, amino acid residues outside the VP1u PLA2 motif are also important for the PLA2 activity. VP1u and various mutants all revealed a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. UT7-Epo cells treated with prokaryotic expressed VP1u or mutant proteins with PLA2 activity released a large amount of free fatty acid (FFA), and the cell morphological change occurred dramatically. However, neither free fatty acid nor cell morphology change occurred for cells treated with the mutants without PLA2 activity. The wild type and the VP1u mutants with the PLA2 activity also activated TNF-α promoter and upregulated the transcription activity of NF-κB in transfected cells. In addition, we found that the amino acids outside the PLA2 domain are critical for the viral PLA2 activity, and that these tested VP1u mutants did not affect the localization of the VP1u protein."

In this study, we have taken advantage of our recently solved structure of HIV-1 RT containing an NNRTI and a non-polypurine tract RNA/DNA hybrid (PDB ID 4B3O) that differs structurally from all previously reported RT-nucleic acid complexes and is compatible with RNA degradation (23Lapkouski M.

Our studies were prompted by observations that the p51 and p66 are further separated ∼2.0 Å and that p51 helix α-helix M′ and surrounding residues are in the core of such movement (23Lapkouski M. Tian L. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F. Yang W. Complexes of HIV-1 RT, NNRTI, and RNA/DNA hybrid reveal a structure compatible with RNA degradation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The RT-RNA/DNA cocrystal structure also demonstrated hydrogen bonding between p51 residues Asn-348 and Tyr-427, in contrast to previous structures where Asn-348 was surrounded by hydrophobic side chains (23Lapkouski M.

Lastly, the peptide comprising Phe-416–Pro-421 preceding α-M′ was shown to interact with the DNA strand and cross the shallow minor groove to form Van der Waals contacts with the RNA strand adjacent to the scissile phosphate (Fig. 1). Because 13- and 19-residue C-terminal p51 deletions of the 440-residue p51 subunit were shown to inhibit polymerization-independent RNase H activity (21Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F. Benkovic S.J. Mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase which alter RNase H activity and decrease strand transfer efficiency are suppressed by HIV nucleocapsid protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Modulation of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase function in “selectively deleted” p66/p51 heterodimers.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our recent crystallographic data predicted that altering α-M′ architecture could affect both subunit dynamics and correct positioning of nucleic acid at the RNase H catalytic center. In this study, we have tested these predictions by combining site-directed and alanine scanning mutagenesis with additional studies of the selectively deleted RT mutant p66/p51Δ13 (1–427 amino acids), whose C terminus is Tyr-427. Collectively, our data highlight a hitherto unappreciated importance of p51 C-terminal architecture in activity of the parental heterodimer. Our data also provide a cautionary note for crystal engineering of HIV-1 RT when attempting to define contacts with RNA/DNA hybrids. Alanine substitutions were introduced into the p51 HIV-1 RT gene using the QuikChange protocol (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Selectively mutated and selectively deleted p66/(His)6p51 heterodimers were purified from recombinant Escherichia coli by a combination of immobilized metal affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Purified, concentrated enzymes were stored at −20 °C in a buffer of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Sequence-independent RNase H activity was evaluated on a 40-nt RNA/30-nt DNA hybrid, whereas PPT cleavage was determined on a 39-nt DNA/29-nt RNA hybrid. In both instances, the RNA strand was 5′ end-labeled with Cy5. Hydrolysis was initiated by adding 2 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 to 18 μl of mixture containing 1 ng of enzyme, 200 nm substrate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and combined with an equal volume of 8 m urea in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA. Hydrolysis products were resolved by high voltage and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorescent imaging (Typhoon Trio+, GE Healthcare). RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was determined on a viral RNA corresponding to nt 1–363 of the HIV-1 NL4-3 (+) strand genome. RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription utilizing an immobilized metal affinity-purified His6-tagged T7 RNA polymerase. A fluorescently labeled DNA primer (5′-Cy5 CAGACGGGCACACACTAC-3′) was combined with template RNA at a ratio of 1:1.2 in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl and heated in a thermal cycler at 85 °C for 3 min and then cooled to 4 °C at 0.1 °C/s. DNA polymerase reactions were performed at 37 °C and contained 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 25 nm template/primer, and 12.5 nm RT. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and combined with an equal volume of 8 m urea in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA. Before loading, samples were heated to 85 °C for 3 min and immediately placed on ice. Nucleic acids were fractionated by denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were scanned with a GE Healthcare Typhoon Trio + and analyzed with Image Quant Total Lab software. Serial dilutions of wild type and mutant enzymes were added to a mixture containing a 5′-Cy5-labeled RNA annealed to a DNA molecule in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After 20 min at 4 °C, 0.2 volume of 50% glycerol was added, and the samples were fractionated by nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel (25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis at 4 °C, gels were analyzed by fluorescent imaging (Typhoon Trio+, GE Healthcare), and Kd values were determined by curve-fitting analysis using Prism5 (GraphPad Software) To a LightCycler® 480 96-well plate (Roche Applied Science) 50 μl of 300 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and a 1:1000 dilution of SYPRO® Orange dye (Invitrogen) was added. The solution was heated from 30 to 80 °C in increments of 0.2 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured using excitation/emission wavelengths of 483 and 568 nm, respectively. Melting temperatures of the proteins were analyzed by using LightCycler® 480 Software. All assays were performed in triplicate. In a previous study, we reported inhibition of RNase H and tRNA-primed (−) strand strong-stop DNA synthesis activities of a mutant HIV-1 RT, whose p51 subunit contained a 13-residue C-terminal truncation removing Gln-428–Phe-440 (25Arts E.J.

Despite this surprising observation, the structural basis was unclear. Our recently solved cocrystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid and in the presence of an NNRTI (23Lapkouski M. Tian L. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F. Yang W. Complexes of HIV-1 RT, NNRTI, and RNA/DNA hybrid reveal a structure compatible with RNA degradation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

As a first step in testing this notion, we used differential scanning fluorometry (Thermofluor (26Phillips K. de la Peña A.H. The combined use of the Thermofluor assay and ThermoQ analytical software for the determination of protein stability and buffer optimization as an aid in protein crystallization.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2011Google Scholar)) to determine the thermal stability of reconstituted heterodimers whose p51 subunit contained 5-, 9-, and 13-residue C-terminal deletions, the results of which are illustrated in Fig. 2. In the absence of divalent cation, we determined a Tm for wild type RT of 56.8 °C, which increased to 59.2 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 or 10.0 mm MgCl2, indicating stabilization when divalent metal is bound at the DNA polymerase and RNase H active sites. Surprisingly, progressive p51 C-terminal deletions further stabilized the reconstituted heterodimer in both the absence and the presence of divalent metal, raising the Tm by ∼3 °C in the case of p66/p51Δ13 RT. Such observations suggest that removing what has been described as disordered residues from the p51 C terminus may improve packing at the dimer interface, a notion forwarded by Bauman et al. (27Bauman J.D. Das K. Ho W.C. Baweja M. Himmel D.M. Clark Jr., A.D. Oren D.A. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Shatkin A.J. Arnold E.

However, our previous work (21Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F. Benkovic S.J.

Thus, the observed Tyr-427 and Asn-348 hydrogen bond may correlate with an activated state for RNA degradation. When the RNase H activity of p66/p51Δ13 HIV-1 RT determined on a heteropolymeric RNA/DNA hybrid was examined (21Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F. Benkovic S.J. Mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase which alter RNase H activity and decrease strand transfer efficiency are suppressed by HIV nucleocapsid protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9054-9061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we and others observed retention of polymerization-dependent activity and loss of polymerization-independent function (Fig. 3, panel i). We therefore elected to re-examine RNase H activity of this mutant on a PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid, which lacks a recessed DNA primer 3′ terminus for recognition by the DNA polymerase active site. As indicated in Fig. 3, panel ii, wild type RT cleaves at the PPT/U3 junction, and additionally at positions −1 and −2. Although p66/p51Δ13 RT efficiently cleaved the RNA/DNA hybrid at the PPT/U3 junction, the additional −1 and −2 cleavage products were absent. The inability of mutant RT to cleave at positions −1/−2 suggests that after initial cleavage, mutant RT either (a) dissociates and fails to rebind the “nicked” substrate or (b) remains bound to the substrate, but in a “dead-end” conformation that fails to translocate. In an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, the experiment of Fig. 3 was repeated, but in this case with a DNA to which two RNA strands were hybridized, as a means of mimicking precleavage at the PPT/U3 junction. To achieve this, the RNA/DNA hybrid of Fig. 4, panel i, was first cleaved at the PPT/U3 with p66/p51Δ13 RT, after which enzyme was removed by phenol extraction and the nucleic acids were precipitated, resuspended, and incubated with a fresh aliquot of wild type or mutant enzyme (this step was necessary based on our past experience that commercially synthesized PPT oligoribonucleotides terminating in an (rG)6 sequence rapidly formed G-quartets and high molecular weight aggregates). Under these conditions, wild type RT retained the capacity to rebind in an orientation that permitted −1/−2 cleavage, whereas in contrast, p66/p51Δ13 RT again could not support additional hydrolysis (Fig. 4, panel ii). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed with the three-stranded substrate (Fig. 4, panels iii and iv) and indicated that both enzymes bound the nicked duplex with equal affinity, an observation that was also confirmed with a nonspecific heteropolymeric RNA/DNA hybrid (data not shown). Together with the thermal stability analysis of Fig. 1, the data of FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 suggest that the altered RNase H activity of p66/p51Δ13 RT may be the consequence of a stabilized heterodimer in the ground state that lacks the conformational flexibility to permit translocation following initial polymerization-dependent hydrolysis. As suggested by Fig. 1, a structural consequence of removing p51 residues Gln-428-Phe-440 might be disruption of hydrogen bonding between Tyr-427 of α-helix M′ and Asn-348 of the β-17/β-18 connecting loop. This notion was next investigated by substituting each of these residues with Ala, either individually or in tandem, in the context of a full-length p51 subunit. In addition, and based on data implicating the p51 mutation N348I in both NRTI and NNRTI resistance (13Ehteshami M. Beilhartz G.L. Scarth B.J. Tchesnokov E.P. McCormick S. Wynhoven B. Harrigan P.R.

The data of Fig. 5, panel i, indicate that, on a nonspecific RNA/DNA hybrid, both p66/p51Y427A and RT p66/p51Y427A,N348A RT, analogous to mutant p66/p51Δ13, retained equivalent levels of polymerization-dependent activity, whereas polymerization-independent activity was significantly reduced. Likewise, the same mutants efficiently cleaved the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid at the PPT/U3 junction, but failed to translocate to support cleavage at positions −1 and −2 (Fig. 5, panel ii). With respect to Tyr-427, such observations indeed lend support to the notion that a bulky aromatic side chain may be required to preserve the architecture of the p51 C terminus to facilitate RNA/DNA hybrid binding and impose the correct orientation on the RNA strand for hydrolysis in the p66 RNase H active site (23Lapkouski M.

https://openalex.org/W2020841101,"Background HIV-1 infects the host cell by interacting with the primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist binds to CCR5 receptor. Thus, it is important to identify the coreceptor used by the HIV strains dominating in the patient. In past, a number of experimental assays and in-silico techniques have been developed for predicting the coreceptor tropism. The prediction accuracy of these methods is excellent when predicting CCR5(R5) tropic sequences but is relatively poor for CXCR4(X4) tropic sequences. Therefore, any new method for accurate determination of coreceptor usage would be of paramount importance to the successful management of HIV-infected individuals. Results The dataset used in this study comprised 1799 R5-tropic and 598 X4-tropic third variable (V3) sequences of HIV-1. We compared the amino acid composition of both types of V3 sequences and observed that certain types of residues, e.g., Asparagine and Isoleucine, were preferred in R5-tropic sequences whereas residues like Lysine, Arginine, and Tryptophan were preferred in X4-tropic sequences. Initially, Support Vector Machine-based models were developed using amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and split amino acid composition, which achieved accuracy up to 90%. We used BLAST to discriminate R5- and X4-tropic sequences and correctly predicted 93.16% of R5- and 75.75% of X4-tropic sequences. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a Hybrid model was developed that achieved 91.66% sensitivity, 81.77% specificity, 89.19% accuracy and 0.72 Matthews Correlation Coefficient. The performance of our models was also evaluated on an independent dataset (256 R5- and 81 X4-tropic sequences) and achieved maximum accuracy of 84.87% with Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.63. Conclusion This study describes a highly efficient method for predicting HIV-1 coreceptor usage from V3 sequences. In order to provide a service to the scientific community, a webserver HIVcoPred was developed (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/hivcopred/) for predicting the coreceptor usage."
https://openalex.org/W1994646940,"The emergence of complex multicellular systems and their associated developmental programs is one of the major problems of evolutionary biology. The advantages of cooperation over individuality seem well known but it is not clear yet how such increase of complexity emerged from unicellular life forms. Current multicellular systems display a complex cell-cell communication machinery, often tied to large-scale controls of body size or tissue homeostasis. Some unicellular life forms are simpler and involve groups of cells cooperating in a tissue-like fashion, as it occurs with biofilms. However, before true gene regulatory interactions were widespread and allowed for controlled changes in cell phenotypes, simple cellular colonies displaying adhesion and interacting with their environments were in place. In this context, models often ignore the physical embedding of evolving cells, thus leaving aside a key component. The potential for evolving pre-developmental patterns is a relevant issue: how far a colony of evolving cells can go? Here we study these pre-conditions for morphogenesis by using CHIMERA, a physically embodied computational model of evolving virtual organisms in a pre-Mendelian world. Starting from a population of identical, independent cells moving in a fluid, the system undergoes a series of changes, from spatial segregation, increased adhesion and the development of generalism. Eventually, a major transition occurs where a change in the flow of nutrients is triggered by a sub-population. This ecosystem engineering phenomenon leads to a subsequent separation of the ecological network into two well defined compartments. The relevance of these results for evodevo and its potential ecological triggers is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2013098038,"Hypoxic/ischemic injury to kidney is a frequently encountered clinical problem with limited therapeutic options. Since microRNAs are differentially involved in hypoxic/ischemic events and δ-opioid receptor (DOR) activation is known to protect against hypoxic/ischemic injury, we speculated on the involvement of DOR activation in altering the microRNA (miRNA) expression in kidney under hypoxic condition. We selected 31 miRNAs based on microarray data for quantitative PCR analysis. Among them, 14 miRNAs were significantly altered after prolonged hypoxia, DOR activation or a combination of both. We found that 1) DOR activation alters miRNA expression profiles in normoxic conditions; 2) hypoxia differentially alters miRNA expression depending on the duration of hypoxia; and 3) DOR activation can modify hypoxia-induced changes in miRNA expression. For example, 10-day hypoxia reduced the level of miR-212 by over 70%, while DOR activation could mimic such reduction even in normoxic kidney. In contrast, the same stress increased miR-29a by >100%, which was reversed following DOR activation. These first data suggest that hypoxia comprehensively modifies the miRNA profile within the kidney, which can be mimicked or modified by DOR activation. Ascertaining the targeted pathways that regulate the diverse cellular and molecular functions of miRNA may provide new insights into potential therapies for hypoxic/ischemic injury of the kidney."

In the present study we hypothesized that healthy young subjects homozygous for the high-risk haplotype (CC) show abnormal choroidal blood flow (ChBF) regulation decades before potentially developing the disease. A total of 100 healthy young subjects were included in the present study, of which 4 subjects were excluded due to problems with genotyping or blood flow measurements. ChBF was measured continuously using laser Doppler flowmetry while the subjects performed isometric exercise (squatting) for 6 minutes. The increase in ChBF was less pronounced than the response in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), indicating for some degree of choroidal blood flow regulation. Eighteen subjects were homozygous for C, 47 subjects were homozygous for T and 31 subjects were heterozygous (CT). The increase in OPP during isometric exercise was not different between groups. By contrast the increase in ChBF was more pronounced in subjects homozygous for the high risk C allele (p = 0.041). This was also evident from the pressure/flow relationship, where the increase in ChBF in homozygous C carriers started at lower OPPs as compared to the other groups. Our data indicate that the regulation of ChBF is abnormal in rs1061170 CC carriers. So far this polymorphism has been linked to age related macular degeneration (AMD) mainly via inflammatory pathways associated with the complement system dysfunction. Our results indicate that it could also be related to vascular factors that have been implicated in AMD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1991423700,"Unlike other caspases, caspase-2 appears to be a nuclear protein although immunocytochemical studies have suggested that it may also be localized to the cytosol and golgi. Where and how caspase-2 is activated in response to apoptotic signals is not clear. Earlier immunocytochemistry studies suggest that caspase-2 is activated in the nucleus and through cleavage of BID leads to increased mitochondrial permeability. More recent studies using bimolecular fluorescence complementation found that caspase-2 oligomerization that leads to activation only occurs in the cytoplasm. Thus, apoptotic signals may lead to activation of caspase-2 which may already reside in the cytoplasm or lead to release of nuclear caspase-2 to the extra-nuclear cytoplasmic compartment. It has not been possible to study release of nuclear caspase-2 to the cytoplasm by cell fractionation studies since cell lysis is known to release nuclear caspase-2 to the extra-nuclear fraction. This is similar to what is known about unliganded nuclear estrogen receptor-α (ERα ) when cells are disrupted. In this study we found that pre-treatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which alkylates cysteine thiol groups in proteins, completely prevents redistribution of caspase-2 and ERα from the nucleus to the extra-nuclear fraction when cells are lysed. Using this approach we provide evidence that apoptotic signals rapidly leads to a shift of caspase-2 from the nucleus to the extra-nuclear fraction, which precedes the detection of apoptosis. These findings are consistent with a model where apoptotic signals lead to a rapid shift of caspase-2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where activation occurs."

Methods The recombinant adenovirus vector Ad5-hERL-IRES-VEGF (Ad-EIV), carrying a reporter gene (hERL) and a therapeutic gene (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF165) through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), was constructed. After transfection of Ad-EIV into bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-EIV-MSCs), hERL and VEGF165 mRNA and protein expressions were identified using Real-Time qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. The uptake of 18F-FES was measured in both Ad-EIV-MSCs and nontransfected MSCs after different incubation time. Micro-PET/CT images were obtained at 1 day after injection of Ad-EIV-MSCs into the left foreleg of the rat. The right foreleg was injected with nontransfected MSCs, which served as self-control. Results After transfection with Ad-EIV, the mRNA and protein expression of hERL and VEGF165 were successfully detected in MSCs, and correlated well with each other (R2 = 0.9840, P<0.05). This indicated the reporter gene could reflect the therapeutic gene indirectly. Ad-EIV-MSCs uptake of 18F-FES increased with incubation time with a peak value of 9.13%±0.33% at 150 min, which was significantly higher than that of the control group. A far higher level of radioactivity could be seen in the left foreleg on the micro-PET/CT image than in the opposite foreleg. Conclusion These preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that hERL/18F-FES might be used as a novel reporter gene/probe system for monitoring gene and cell therapy. This imaging platform may have broad applications for basic research and clinical studies."

Cytotoxicity/proliferative effects of baculovirus on hUCB-MSCs were assessed using CCK-8 assays. 125I uptake and perchlorate inhibition assays were performed on Bac-NIS-infected hUCB-MSCs. Radionuclide imaging of mice transplanted with Bac-NIS-infected hUCB-MSCs was performed by NanoSPECT/CT imaging. Results Infection efficiencies of recombinant baculovirus in hESCs, hiPSCs and hUCB-MSCs increased with increasing MOIs (27.3%, 35.8% and 95.6%, respectively, at MOI = 800). Almost no cytotoxicity and only slight effects on hUCB-MSCs proliferation were observed. Obvious GFP expression (40.6%) remained at 8 days post-infection. The radioiodide was functionally accumulated by NIS gene products and specifically inhibited by perchlorate (ClO4-). Radioiodide uptake, peaking at 30 min and gradually decreasing over time, significantly correlated with hUCB-MSCs cell number (R2 = 0.994). Finally, radionuclide imaging showed Bac-NIS-infected hUCB-MSCs effectively accumulated radioiodide in vivo, which gradually weakened over time. Conclusion Baculovirus as transgenic vector of radionuclide reporter gene imaging technology is a promising strategy for monitoring stem cell transplantation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1983909089,"The success of allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is limited by its treatment related complications, mostly graft versus host disease (GVHD) and fungal and viral infections. CMV reactivation after HCT has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and a causal relation between GVHD, immunosuppressive therapy and vice versa has been postulated. Using a low GVHD severity murine HCT model, we assessed the role of MCMV reactivation and GVHD development. BALB/c mice were infected with either murine CMV (MCMV) or mock and monitored for 25 weeks to establish latency, followed by sublethal irradiation conditioning and infusion of bone marrow plus splenocytes from either syngeneic (syn) BALB/c or allo B10.D2 donors. Engraftment of allo donor cells was confirmed by PCR for D2Mit265 gene product size. Day+100 mortality and overall GVHD severity in allo MCMV pre-infected recipients was higher than in allo mock controls. Pathologic changes of lung and liver GVHD in immediate-early gene 1 (IE1) positive recipients were significantly increased compared to mock controls, and were only slightly increased in IE1 negative. No significant gut injury was seen in any group. Aggravated lung injury in IE1 positive recipients correlated with higher BAL cell counts both for total cells and for CD4+ T cells when compared with mock controls, and also with protein expression of lung IFN-gamma and liver TNF. No evidence for CMV specific morphologic changes was seen on histopathology in any organ of IE1 positive recipients, suggesting that CMV reactivation is related to increased GVHD severity but does not require active CMV disease, strengthening the concept of a reciprocal relationship between CMV and GVHD."
https://openalex.org/W2013209046,"The breakdown of self-incompatibility, which could result from the accumulation of non-functional S-haplotypes or competitive interaction between two different functional S-haplotypes, has been studied extensively at the molecular level in tetraploid Rosaceae species. In this study, two tetraploid Chinese cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus) cultivars and one diploid sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivar were used to investigate the ploidy of pollen grains and inheritance of pollen-S alleles. Genetic analysis of the S-genotypes of two intercross-pollinated progenies showed that the pollen grains derived from Chinese cherry cultivars were hetero-diploid, and that the two S-haplotypes were made up of every combination of two of the four possible S-haplotypes. Moreover, the distributions of single S-haplotypes expressed in self- and intercross-pollinated progenies were in disequilibrium. The number of individuals of the two different S-haplotypes was unequal in two self-pollinated and two intercross-pollinated progenies. Notably, the number of individuals containing two different S-haplotypes (S1- and S5-, S5- and S8-, S1- and S4-haplotype) was larger than that of other individuals in the two self-pollinated progenies, indicating that some of these hetero-diploid pollen grains may have the capability to inactivate stylar S-RNase inside the pollen tube and grow better into the ovaries."
https://openalex.org/W2036894673,"Gene targeting is a powerful approach in reverse genetics. The approach has been hampered in most of human cell lines, however, by the poor targeting efficiency. Nalm-6, a human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, exhibits exceptionally high gene targeting efficiency and is used in DNA repair and the related research fields. Nonetheless, usage of the cell line is still limited partly because it lacks expression of MSH2, a component of mismatch repair complex, which leads to increased genome instability. Here, we report successful restoration of MSH2 expression in Nalm-6 cells and demonstrate that the recovery does not affect the high targeting efficiency. We recovered the expression by introduction of cDNA sequences corresponding to exons 9 to 16 at downstream of exon 8 of the MSH2 gene. Endogenous exons 9 to 16 were deleted in the cell line. The MSH2 expression substantially reduced spontaneous HPRT mutation frequency. Moreover, gene targeting efficiency in the MSH2-expressing cells was similar to that in the MSH2-lacking cells. In fact, we generated heterozygously REV3L knockout and the catalytically dead mutants in the MSH2-proficient Nalm-6 cells with efficiency of 20-30%. The established cell line, Nalm-6-MSH+, is useful for reverse genetics in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026978545,"Calpain is an intracellular Ca2+ -activated protease that is involved in numerous Ca2+ dependent regulation of protein function in many cell types. This paper tests a hypothesis that calpains are involved in Ca2+ -dependent increase of the late sodium current (INaL) in failing heart. Chronic heart failure (HF) was induced in 2 dogs by multiple coronary artery embolization. Using a conventional patch-clamp technique, the whole-cell INaL was recorded in enzymatically isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs) in which INaL was activated by the presence of a higher (1μM) intracellular [Ca2+] in the patch pipette. Cell suspensions were exposed to a cell- permeant calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 for 1–2 h before INaL recordings. The numerical excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) model was used to evaluate electrophysiological effects of calpain inhibition in silico. MDL caused acceleration of INaL decay evaluated by the two-exponential fit (τ1 = 42±3.0 ms τ2 = 435±27 ms, n = 6, in MDL vs. τ1 = 52±2.1 ms τ2 = 605±26 control no vehicle, n = 11, and vs. τ1 = 52±2.8 ms τ2 = 583±37 ms n = 7, control with vehicle, P<0.05 ANOVA). MDL significantly reduced INaL density recorded at –30 mV (0.488±0.03, n = 12, in control no vehicle, 0.4502±0.0210, n = 9 in vehicle vs. 0.166±0.05pA/pF, n = 5, in MDL). Our measurements of current-voltage relationships demonstrated that the INaL density was decreased by MDL in a wide range of potentials, including that for the action potential plateau. At the same time the membrane potential dependency of the steady-state activation and inactivation remained unchanged in the MDL-treated VCMs. Our ECC model predicted that calpain inhibition greatly improves myocyte function by reducing the action potential duration and intracellular diastolic Ca2+ accumulation in the pulse train. Conclusions Calpain inhibition reverses INaL changes in failing dog ventricular cardiomyocytes in the presence of high intracellular Ca2+. Specifically it decreases INaL density and accelerates INaL kinetics resulting in improvement of myocyte electrical response and Ca2+ handling as predicted by our in silico simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2027222576,"The International Consortium (FTDC) that revised the diagnostic criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) did not have an Asian representation. Whether the revised criteria are equally useful in the early detection of Asian bvFTD patients therefore remains largely unexplored. Earlier studies have indicated differences in clinical manifestations in Indian and other Asian bvFTD patients when compared to western groups. There is an urgent need for clarification, given the projected exponential rise in dementia in these countries and the imminent clinical trials on bvFTD.To assess how Indian bvFTD patients fulfil the FTDC criteria, hypothesizing that our patients might present differently early in the illness.In a hospital-based retrospective observational study, we assessed 48 probable bvFTD patients, diagnosed according to the FTDC criteria, for the speed with which these criteria were fulfilled, the frequency of individual symptoms and their order of appearance during the illness.Most of our patients presented with moderate to severe dementia, in spite of having relatively short onset to diagnosis times. Patients on average took 1.4 years from onset to meet the FTDC criteria, with 90% of them presenting with four or more symptoms at diagnosis. Disinhibition was the commonest symptom and the first symptom in most patients.With most patients presenting with advanced and florid disease, the FTDC criteria have little additional impact in early identification of bvFTD in India. Modifying the criteria further could allow detection of Indian patients early enough for their inclusion in future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2089438696,"Behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) is associated with synaptic modifications that are thought to underlie learning and memory. Because AMPH enhances extracellular dopamine in the striatum where dopamine and glutamate signaling are essential for learning, one might expect that the molecular and morphological changes that occur in the striatum in response to AMPH, including changes in synaptic plasticity, would affect learning. To ascertain whether AMPH sensitization affects learning, we tested wild-type mice and mice lacking NMDA receptor signaling in striatal medium spiny neurons in several different learning tests (motor learning, Pavlovian association, U-maze escape test with strategy shifting) with or without prior sensitization to AMPH. Prior sensitization had minimal effect on learning in any of these paradigms in wild-type mice and failed to restore learning in mutant mice, despite the fact that the mutant mice became sensitized by the AMPH treatment. We conclude that the changes in synaptic plasticity and many other signaling events that occur in response to AMPH sensitization are dissociable from those involved in learning the tasks used in our experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2062140772,"Absorption of small water-soluble nutrients in vertebrate intestines occurs both by specific, mediated transport and by non-specific, passive, paracellular transport. Although it is apparent that paracellular absorption represents a significant route for nutrient absorption in many birds and mammals, especially small, flying species, its importance in ectothermic vertebrates has not previously been explored. Therefore, we measured fractional absorption (ƒ) and absorption rate of three paracellular probes (arabinose, l-rhamnose, cellobiose) and of 3-O-methyl d-glucose (absorbed by both mediated and paracellular pathways) by the large herbivorous lizard, Uromastyx aegyptia, to explore the relative importance of paracellular and mediated transport in an ectothermic, terrestrial vertebrate. Fractional absorption of 3-O-methyl d-glucose was high (ƒ = 0.73±0.04) and similar to other vertebrates; ƒ of the paracellular probes was relatively low (arabinose ƒ = 0.31±0.03, l-rhamnose ƒ = 0.19±0.02, and cellobiose ƒ = 0.14±0.02), and decreased with molecular mass, a pattern consistent with other vertebrates. Paracellular absorption accounted for approximately 24% of total 3-O-methyl d-glucose uptake, indicating low reliance on this pathway for these herbivorous lizards, a pattern similar to that found in other terrestrial vertebrates, and different from small flying endotherms (both birds and bats)."
