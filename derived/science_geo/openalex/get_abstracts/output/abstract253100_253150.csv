We developed a process for the selective dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) that operates at high fructose concentrations (10 to 50 weight %), achieves high yields (80% HMF selectivity at 90% fructose conversion), and delivers HMF in a separation-friendly solvent. In a two-phase reactor system, fructose is dehydrated in the aqueous phase with the use of an acid catalyst (hydrochloric acid or an acidic ion-exchange resin) with dimethylsulfoxide and/or poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) added to suppress undesired side reactions. The HMF product is continuously extracted into an organic phase (methylisobutylketone) modified with 2-butanol to enhance partitioning from the reactive aqueous solution."

The CO2 fertilization factors used in models to project future yields were derived from enclosure studies conducted approximately 20 years ago. Free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) technology has now facilitated large-scale trials of the major grain crops at elevated [CO2] under fully open-air field conditions. In those trials, elevated [CO2] enhanced yield by approximately 50% less than in enclosure studies. This casts serious doubt on projections that rising [CO2] will fully offset losses due to climate change."

Although it is known that plants absorb and transport K+ through membrane transporters, it remains unclear how these transporters are regulated. Here we show that the protein kinase CIPK23, encoded by the LKS1 gene, regulates K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions. Lesion of LKS1 significantly reduced K+ uptake and caused leaf chlorosis and growth inhibition, whereas overexpression of LKS1 significantly enhanced K+ uptake and tolerance to low K+. We demonstrate that CIPK23 directly phosphorylates the K+ transporter AKT1 and further find that CIPK23 is activated by the binding of two calcineurin B-like proteins, CBL1 and CBL9. We propose a model in which the CBL1/9–CIPK23 pathway ensures activation of AKT1 and enhanced K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions.

We propose a model in which the CBL1/9–CIPK23 pathway ensures activation of AKT1 and enhanced K+ uptake under low-K+ conditions. Potassium is an essential element for plant growth and development, and it plays crucial roles in many fundamental processes in living plant cells, such as osmoregulation, electrical neutralization, regulation of membrane potential, cotransport of sugars, and so on (Clarkson and Hanson, 1980Clarkson D.T. Hanson J.B. The mineral nutrition of higher plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 239-298Crossref Google Scholar). Normal plant growth and development require millimolar K+ in the soil or growth medium. However, typical K+ concentration at the interface of roots and soils is within micromolar range (Schroeder et al., 1994Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Gassmann W.

Struct. 1994; 23: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Under low-K+ stress, most plants show K+-deficient symptoms, typically leaf chlorosis and subsequent inhibition of plant growth and development (Mengel and Kirkby, 2001Mengel K. Kirkby E.A. Potassium.in: Principles of Plant Nutrition. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, USA2001: 503-509Crossref Google Scholar). It is known that different genotypes of a plant species show varied K+ utilization efficiency (Epstein, 1978Epstein E. An inborn error of potassium metabolism in the tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum.Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 582-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that K+ uptake and translocation in plants is genetically controlled. Plants absorb and transport K+ ions through a number of transporters that vary in kinetics, energy coupling, and regulation (Schroeder et al., 1994Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Gassmann W.

Expression of a Cs+-resistant guard cell K+ channel confers Cs+-resistant, light-induced stomatal opening in transgenic Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1843-1857PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the regulatory mechanism of these K+ transporters. It is well known that some K+ channels in animal cells are regulated by specific kinases (Jan and Jan, 1997Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cloned potassium channels from eukaryotes and prokaryotes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether K+ transporters in plant cells are functionally regulated by protein phosphorylation, although circumstantial evidence exists for interaction between protein kinases and K+ transporters (Li et al., 1998Li J. Lee Y.-R.J. Assmann S.M. Guard cells possess a calcium-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates the KAT1 potassium channel.Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Mori et al., 2000Mori I.C.

Physical and functional interaction of the Arabidopsis K+ channel AKT2 and phosphatase AtPP2CA.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar reported the effect of AtPP2CA on AKT2 activity, suggesting possible regulation of plant K+ channels by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Despite some pharmacological studies investigating regulation of plant K+ transport systems by protein kinases, these data do not necessarily infer a direct effect of the regulatory proteins on K+ transporters (Chérel, 2004Chérel I. Regulation of K+ channel activities in plants: from physiological to molecular aspects.J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of a regulatory pathway for K+ uptake in Arabidopsis, in which a Ser/Thr protein kinase (CIPK23) phosphorylates K+ transporter AKT1 and enhances K+ uptake, particularly under low-K+ stress. Furthermore, two calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins were identified as the upstream regulators of CIPK23. In addition, activation of AKT1 by CIPK23 and CBL1 or CBL9 was further confirmed by voltage-clamp recording using a Xenopus oocyte expression system and by patch-clamp recording from root-cell protoplasts. All evidence supports the conclusion that there exists an AKT1-mediated and CBL/CIPK-regulated K+ uptake pathway in higher plants that plays crucial roles in plant K+ uptake, particularly under K+-deficient conditions. Arabidopsis low-K+-sensitive (lks) mutants were isolated from EMS-mutagenized M2 seedlings (see Experimental Procedures). Among a number of putative M3 mutants, lks1 showed significant lks phenotype. On low-K+ (LK, 100 μM) medium, the lks1 mutants (lks1-1 and lks1-2) stopped growing after 4 days, and their cotyledons and leaves showed chlorotic phenotype after 10 days (Figure 1A). The growth of wild-type seedlings also slowed down under LK conditions, but their leaves remained healthy (Figure 1A). As leaf chlorosis is a typical symptom under K+-deficient conditions (Mengel and Kirkby, 2001Mengel K. Kirkby E.A. Potassium.in: Principles of Plant Nutrition. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, USA2001: 503-509Crossref Google Scholar), we took leaf chlorosis as the standard lks phenotype for further analysis in this study. We noted that root growth of the lks1 mutants maintained a faster pace of elongation than the wild-type during the first 4 days after transfer to LK medium (Figure 1A). It should also be noted that the lks phenotype of the mutants was high ammonium dependent (see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), which is consistent with the previous report (Spalding et al., 1999Spalding E.P. Hirsch R.E. Lewis D.R. Qi Z. Sussman M.R. Lewis B.D. Potassium uptake supporting plant growth in the absence of AKT1 channel activity: Inhibition by ammonium and stimulation by sodium.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses showed that lks1-1 and lks1-2 harbor monogenic recessive mutations in a nuclear gene and that the two mutations in two independent lines, lks1-1 (in Landsberg erecta background) and lks1-2 (in Columbia background), are allelic to each other (Figure 1A and Table S1). The analyses of the F2 generations from a cross between either lks1-1 and wild-type (Ler) or lks1-2 and wild-type (Col) revealed a 3:1 segregation ratio of wild-type over lks1 (Table S1). Map-based cloning was carried out using an F2 population, and LKS1 was located within BAC clone F12P21 of chromosome I (Figure 1B) and finally identified to encode CIPK23 (At1g30270; Figure 1B), a member of the CBL-interacting protein kinase family (Luan et al., 2002Luan S. Kudla J. Rodriguez-Concepcion M. Yalovsky S. Gruissem W. Calmodulins and calcineurin B-like proteins: calcium sensors for specific signal response coupling in plants.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S389-S400PubMed Google Scholar). CIPKs form a plant-specific family of Ser/Thr kinases structurally similar to the SNF1 kinase from yeast and AMPK from mammalian systems (Shi et al., 1999Shi J. Kim K.-N. Ritz O. Albrecht V. Gupta R. Harter K. Luan S. Kudla J. Novel protein kinases associated with calcineurin B-like calcium sensors in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2393-2405PubMed Google Scholar). The single-nucleotide mutation C1317T in the lks1-1 allele (Figure 1B) caused a change of Ala199 to Val in the amino acid sequence located at the activation loop, a highly conserved domain in CIPKs (Guo et al., 2001Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Molecular characterization of functional domains in the protein kinase SOS2 that is required for plant salt tolerance.Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation C3039T in the lks1-2 allele led to Leu447-to-Phe substitution in the domain near the C terminus of CIPK23 (Figure 1B). A T-DNA insertion line (SALK_036154) containing a T-DNA insertion in the seventh intron of LKS1 (Figure 1B) was named lks1-3 in this study. Figure 1C shows that the T-DNA insertion in lks1-3 disrupted the transcription of the LKS1 gene. The lks1-3 mutants, like lks1-1 and lks1-2, displayed the lks phenotype (Figure 1D), indicating that these mutations are allelic. The F1 generations of the lks1-3 × lks1-1 and lks1-3 × lks1-2 crosses exhibited the same lks phenotype as their parents (Figure 1D; Table S1), further confirming that the phenotype of lks1 alleles resulted from loss of function of the LKS1 gene. Tissue expression profiles of the LKS1 gene were analyzed by creating transgenic plants carrying the LKS1 promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion. Histochemical GUS activity analysis indicated that CIPK23 was broadly expressed in whole seedlings (Figure 1E). In particular, GUS activity was high in vascular bundles (Figures 1E–1H). In root tissues, LKS1::GUS activity was strong in cortex and endodermis cells (Figures 1G and 1H) that are involved in K+ uptake and translocation (Pilot et al., 2003Pilot G. Gaymard F. Mouline K. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Regulated expression of Arabidopsis shaker K+ channel genes involved in K+ uptake and distribution in the plant.Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The results suggest that CIPK23 may play an important role in K+ uptake and translocation. The quantitative results of GUS enzymatic activity assays showed that CIPK23 expression was induced when plants were grown on LK medium (Figure 1I). Northern blot analysis further confirmed that the low-K+ treatment strongly induced the expression of LKS1 in roots (Figure 1J). To gain more information on the function of CIPK23, we constructed LKS1-overexpressing lines and analyzed the phenotype of these plants. The elevated expression of LKS1 mRNA in transgenic lines was verified by Northern blot (Figure 2A). All LKS1-overexpressing lines showed very significant low-K+-tolerant phenotype compared to the control lines (Figure 2B). The phenotype tests showed that, in LK medium, the seedlings of the LKS1-overexpressing lines kept growing even after 1 month, whereas the lks1 mutants died completely after 3 weeks (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of LKS1 enhances plant tolerance to low-K+ stress. One of the potential mechanisms for this phenotype may be associated with K+ uptake. To test this possibility, we determined the K+ uptake rates of the lks1 mutants, LKS1-overexpressing lines, and wild-type plants. Two independent LKS1-overexpressing lines showed the highest K+ uptake rates among all tested materials (Figure 2C), whereas the K+ uptake rates of the lks1 mutants were the lowest (Figure 2C). As shown in Table S2, the LKS1-overexpressing lines had the highest Vmax and the lowest Km and Cmin for K+ uptake among the plants tested, while the lks1 mutants had much lower Vmax and increased Km and Cmin compared to wild-type plants (Table S2). Compared with the lks1-3 mutants, the Vmax for K+ uptake of two LKS1-overexpressing lines increased by about 40%, while the Km for K+ uptake of these two transgenic lines decreased to 89 μM and 81 μM, respectively, compared to 105 μM for wild-type plants and 135 μM for lks1-3 mutants. The results demonstrate that overexpression of LKS1 results in significant increases in the maximum K+ uptake rate and K+ uptake affinity. The Cmin for K+ uptake of the LKS1-overexpressing lines Col+LKS1-2 and Col+LKS1-4 was decreased to 33 μM and 35 μM, respectively, compared to 61 μM for the wild-type plants (Table S2), indicating that the LKS1-overexpressing plants may initiate K+ uptake at much lower [K+] compared to wild-type plants. Some studies in animal cells have shown that K+ transporters, such as Kv channels, are regulated by protein kinases (see the review by Jan and Jan, 1997Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cloned potassium channels from eukaryotes and prokaryotes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The finding that CIPK23 participates in the regulation of K+ uptake in Arabidopsis led us to hypothesize that CIPK23 may regulate K+ uptake by phosphorylation of a K+ transporter (or transporters). To test the hypothesis, we first screened for potential downstream targets of CIPK23 by examining phenotypes of the various Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines for K+ transporter genes. The candidates for the targets were selected based on their possible functions in K+ uptake and/or their expression patterns (Véry and Sentenac, 2003Véry A.-A. Sentenac H. Molecular mechanisms and regulation of K+ transport in higher plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 575-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The selected T-DNA insertion mutants included akt1 (SALK_071803), atkc1 (SALK_140579), kup1 (SALK_148762), kup3 (SALK_002622), hak5 (SALK_005604), etc. The flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion sites were verified, and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the expression of the selected genes was disrupted in these mutants (Figure 3A; Figure S8). Among these mutants, akt1 showed the same lks phenotype as lks1 (Figure 3B; Figures S1 and S2). The atkc1 mutants exhibited a phenotype similar to lks1 and akt1 mutants in their root growth during the first 4 days under low-K+ stress; however, the leaves of atkc1 mutants did not show chlorotic phenotype like lks1 mutants did (Figure 3B). It has been reported that both AKT1 and AtKC1 are preferentially expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots (Lagarde et al., 1996Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis AKT1 gene is consistent with a role in K+ nutrition.Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Pilot et al., 2003Pilot G. Gaymard F. Mouline K. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Regulated expression of Arabidopsis shaker K+ channel genes involved in K+ uptake and distribution in the plant.Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) where LKS1 promoter activity is strong as well (Figures 1G and 1H). The same or similar phenotypes of the lks1, akt1, and atkc1 mutants and similar expression patterns of LKS1, AKT1, and AtKC1 genes suggested that CIPK23 may regulate AKT1 and/or AtKC1. To test whether CIPK23 would interact with AKT1 and AtKC1, we used the yeast two-hybrid method to test the potential interaction of the cytosolic region of AKT1 (cAKT1) or AtKC1 (cAtKC1) (Pilot et al., 2003Pilot G. Gaymard F. Mouline K. Chérel I. Sentenac H. Regulated expression of Arabidopsis shaker K+ channel genes involved in K+ uptake and distribution in the plant.Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with CIPK23. cAKT1 includes 564 amino acids from His294 to Ser857, and cAtKC1 includes 333 amino acids from His330 to Phe662. As shown in Figure 3C, CIPK23 specifically interacted with cAKT1, but not with cAtKC1, consistent with the observation that the akt1 and lks1 mutants displayed the same phenotype (Figure 3B). However, CIPK9, which is closely related to CIPK23, did not interact with cAKT1 in the yeast two-hybrid assays (Figure S3), which demonstrates the specific interaction of CIPK23 with AKT1. The in vivo interaction between these two proteins was confirmed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (Walter et al., 2004Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. et al.Visualization of protein interactions in living plant cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation.Plant J. 2004; 40: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). The BiFC results shown in Figure 3D not only demonstrate the in vivo interaction between two tested proteins but also show the specific localization of the interacting proteins at the plasma membranes (PM). In vitro protein phosphorylation assays further demonstrated the interaction of these two proteins. A constitutively active form of CIPK23 (CIPK23(CA)) is generated by deleting the binding site of CBLs (FISL/NAF motif) (Guo et al., 2001Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Molecular characterization of functional domains in the protein kinase SOS2 that is required for plant salt tolerance.Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399PubMed Google Scholar, Albrecht et al., 2001Albrecht V. Ritz O. Linder S. Harter K. Kudla J. The NAF domain defines a novel protein-protein interaction module conserved in Ca2+-regulated kinases.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and changing Thr190 to Asp in the activation loop (Guo et al., 2001Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Molecular characterization of functional domains in the protein kinase SOS2 that is required for plant salt tolerance.Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399PubMed Google Scholar). CIPK23(CA) was produced as a GST fusion and was used to phosphorylate the cytosolic region of AKT1 and AtKC1. The results showed that CIPK23 phosphorylated cAKT1, but not cAtKC1 (Figure 3E). The genetic evidence further proved this notion. Compared with the transgenic lines of SUPER::LKS1 in a wild-type or lks1 background (Figure 2B), the transgenic lines of SUPER::LKS1 in the akt1 background (verified by Northern blot; Figure 3F) did not rescue the lks phenotype (Figure 3G). All of these data are consistent with the hypothesis that AKT1 functions downstream of CIPK23. Further evidence demonstrating this conclusion came from the similar kinetic parameters of K+ uptake for lks1 and akt1 mutants (Figure 3H; Table S2). Compared with the Vmax for K+ uptake of wild-type plants, the Vmax for K+ uptake of the lks1-2, lks1-3, and akt1 mutants similarly decreased by 23%, 23%, and 17%, respectively (Table S2). The Km and Cmin for K+ uptake of these three mutants were also changed to a similar extent (Table S2). The results of K+ content measurements showed that, among the tested materials, the root K+ content of wild-type plants (Col) and the LKS1-overexpressing line (Col+LKS1-4) was much higher than that of the lks1 and akt1 mutants after cultured in MS medium for 4, 7, or 10 days (Figure 4A), while wild-type plants and the LKS1-overexpressing line had shoot K+ content similar to that of the lks1 and akt1 mutants (Figure 4B). The LKS1-overexpressing line had the highest K+ content in both roots (Figure 4C) and shoots (Figure 4D) after growth in LK medium for 4, 7, or 10 days. In addition, the K+ content in shoots of lks1 and akt1 mutants was not significantly different from that in shoots of wild-type plants under the normal conditions (Figure 4B), whereas the K+ content in shoots of lks1 and akt1 mutants was significantly different from that in shoots of wild-type plants under low-K+ conditions (Figure 4D). The results suggest that CIPK23-regulated AKT1 may play important roles in translocating K+ from roots to shoots at the root endodermis and vascular tissues when plants are subjected to low-K+ stress. This may explain the chlorotic phenotype in the lks1 and the akt1 mutants under the low-K+ stress. AKT1-overexpressing lines were also constructed and tested, but no significant low-K+-responsive phenotype was observed (data not shown). It has been reported that AKT1 expression level is high in roots (Lagarde et al., 1996Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C.

USA. 2002; 99: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that this expression is not induced by K+ starvation (Lagarde et al., 1996Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis AKT1 gene is consistent with a role in K+ nutrition.Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, Pilot et al., 2003Pilot G.

Biol. 2003; 51: 773-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This, together with our results, suggests that the expression level of AKT1 is sufficient to meet the need for K+ uptake under most conditions and that the limitation for AKT1 function may lie in its phosphorylation status regulated by CIPK23. Activity of a CIPK is regulated by one or more CBLs (Shi et al., 1999Shi J. Kim K.-N. Ritz O. Albrecht V. Gupta R. Harter K. Luan S. Kudla J.

SOS3 function in plant salt tolerance requires N-myristoylation and calcium binding.Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1667-1677PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays were conducted to identify the particular CBL (or CBLs) that interacts with CIPK23. As shown in Figure 5A, CIPK23 interacted with six members of the CBL family, including CBL1, CBL2, CBL3, CBL5, CBL8, and CBL9. Quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays showed that, among these six CBLs, CBL1 and CBL9 displayed the strongest interaction with CIPK23 (Figure 5B). To test the genetic link between these CBLs and LKS1, the T-DNA insertion lines for these two CBL genes were tested for their potential low-K+ sensitivity. Expression of CBL1 and CBL9 was disrupted in cbl1 (SALK_110426) and cbl9 (SALK_142774) mutants, respectively, and in cbl1 cbl9 double mutants (Figure 5C; Figure S8). Although the cbl1 and cbl9 single mutants did not show the typical lks phenotype under LK conditions, the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants showed the same lks phenotype as the lks1 or akt1 mutants (Figure 5D), indicating that CBL1 and CBL9 have overlapping functions. The low-K+ sensitivity of the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants was complemented after the mutants were transformed by CBL1 (Figures 5E and 5F) driven by its own promoter. Furthermore, wild-type plants transformed with SUPER::CBL1 or SUPER::CBL9 (Figure 6A) showed enhanced low-K+-tolerant phenotype (Figure 6B; Figure S5) similar to the LKS1-overexpressing lines (Figure 2B). However, overexpression of CBL1 or CBL9 in the lks1 mutants did not complement the low-K+ sensitivity of lks1 mutants (Figure 6B), and overexpression of LKS1 in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants did not complement the low-K+ sensitivity of the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants (Figures 6C and 6D). This genetic evidence demonstrates that CBL1 and CBL9 are the upstream positive regulators of CIPK23. Although CBL5, like CBL1 and CBL9, showed strong interaction with CIPK23 in our yeast two-hybrid assays (Figures 5A and 5B), the CBL5-overexpressing lines in wild-type background did not show any significant enhancement of low-K+ tolerance under low-K+ stress (Figure S5). Thus, CBL5 may not be involved in regulation of the AKT1-mediated K+ uptake pathway. As mentioned above, the CBLs specifically interact with the FISL/NAF domain of the CIPKs (Guo et al., 2001Guo Y.

The NAF domain defines a novel protein-protein interaction module conserved in Ca2+-regulated kinases.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 6E, the FISL-deletion form of CIPK23 (CIPK23-FISL) lost its interaction with CBL1 or CBL9. The in vivo interaction between CIPK23 and CBL1 or CBL9 was confirmed using BiFC assays as shown in Figure 6F. In addition, BiFC results also demonstrated that the two pairs of interacting proteins were specifically localized at the PM (compare to Figure S6), which is consistent with the notion that the CIPK23-CBL1 (or CIPK23-CBL9) complex regulates the activity of PM-localized AKT1. Furthermore, deletion of the FISL/NAF domain resulted in nonfunctional CIPK23 in vivo. Overexpression of LKS1(CA) in wild-type plants or in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants did not increase low-K+ tolerance of the transgenic plants (Figures 6G and 6H). In addition, overexpression of CBL1 or CBL9 significantly increased K+ content in both roots and shoots under low-K+ conditions (Figures 6I and 6J), while the disruption of CBL1 and CBL9 expression in the cbl1 cbl9 double mutants decreased K+ content, particularly in shoots (Figures 6I and 6J). Transgenic plants harboring CBL1::GUS and CBL9::GUS constructs were produced to analyze the promoter activity of these two genes in different plant tissues. The GUS histochemical assays showed that expression patterns of CBL1 and CBL9 were similar to CIPK23 and were particularly abundant in root tips and vascular bundles in the stem and the leaf (data not shown). Given that both CIPK23 and AKT1 are abundantly expressed in root tips and vascular bundles, these results may further support the notion that CBL1 and CBL9 regulate CIPK23/AKT1-mediated K+ uptake.

We report the modulation of pain sensitivity in mice produced solely by exposure to their cagemates, but not to strangers, in pain. Mice tested in dyads and given an identical noxious stimulus displayed increased pain behaviors with statistically greater co-occurrence, effects dependent on visual observation. When familiar mice were given noxious stimuli of different intensities, their pain behavior was influenced by their neighbor's status bidirectionally. Finally, observation of a cagemate in pain altered pain sensitivity of an entirely different modality, suggesting that nociceptive mechanisms in general are sensitized."
https://openalex.org/W2157443774,"Centrioles and centrosomes have an important role in animal cell organization, but it is uncertain to what extent they are essential for animal development. The Drosophila protein DSas-4 is related to the human microcephaly protein CenpJ and the C. elegans centriolar protein Sas-4. We show that DSas-4 is essential for centriole replication in flies. DSas-4 mutants start to lose centrioles during embryonic development, and, by third-instar larval stages, no centrioles or centrosomes are detectable. Mitotic spindle assembly is slow in mutant cells, and approximately 30% of the asymmetric divisions of larval neuroblasts are abnormal. Nevertheless, mutant flies develop with near normal timing into morphologically normal adults. These flies, however, have no cilia or flagella and die shortly after birth because their sensory neurons lack cilia. Thus, centrioles are essential for the formation of centrosomes, cilia, and flagella, but, remarkably, they are not essential for most aspects of Drosophila development."

Thus, the interplay between actomyosin and FA dynamics results in a specific balance between adhesion and contraction, which induces maximal migration velocity. Cell migration is described as a four-step cycle that spatially and temporally coordinates forces in the actomyosin cytoskeleton with extracellular adhesion (Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996Lauffenburger D.A.

Actin filaments (F-actin) in migrating epithelial cells are organized into two distinct modules that mediate different steps in the migration cycle (Gupton et al., 2005Gupton S.L. Anderson K.L.

The lamellipodium F-actin module is characterized by filament polymerization into a dense network followed by near complete depolymerization at the lamellipodium base (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A.

Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the second step of migration, the protrusion adheres to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by focal adhesions (FAs) that assemble at the lamellipodium base. FAs contain transmembrane integrins that link the ECM to F-actin via structural and signaling proteins (Critchley et al., 1999Critchley D.R. Holt M.R. Barry S.T. Priddle H. Hemmings L. Norman J. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion: the cytoskeletal connection.Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 79-99PubMed Google Scholar, Wozniak et al., 2004Wozniak M.A. Modzelewska K. Kwong L. Keely P.J.

The contractile F-actin module extends from nascent FAs at the lamellipodium base to near the nucleus and is comprised of F-actin-myosin II networks and bundles in the lamella, convergence zone, and central cell area (Salmon et al., 2002Salmon W.C.

Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Simultaneous mapping of filamentous actin flow and turnover in migrating cells by quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9660-9665Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This myosin II-driven actin convergence is thought to pull on strong FAs at the front to generate traction in the third step of migration and pull on weaker FAs in the rear that detach (Kaverina et al., 2002Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. Regulation of substrate adhesion dynamics during cell motility.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 746-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), moving the cell body forward in the fourth and final step of migration. Importantly, activities of F-actin, myosin II, and FAs within these actin modules must be implemented in a precise place and temporal order to achieve productive, directed cell movement. Fifteen years ago, a mathematical model predicted that migration speed would exhibit a biphasic response to increasing adhesion strength, with slow migration occurring at low and high strength and fast migration occurring at intermediate strength (DiMilla et al., 1991DiMilla P.A. Barbee K. Lauffenburger D.A. Mathematical model for the effects of adhesion and mechanics on cell migration speed.Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 15-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The model assumed that migrating cells possess an asymmetry in adhesion strength from front to rear, with front and rear connected by symmetric contractile elements, but did not consider dynamic organizational states of F-actin and FAs. This biphasic dependence of migration velocity on increasing adhesion strength has since been supported experimentally by modulating ECM ligand density, integrin expression levels, or integrin-ECM binding affinity (DiMilla et al., 1993DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Maximal migration of human smooth muscle cells on fibronectin and type IV collagen occurs at an intermediate attachment strength.J.

Integrin-ligand binding properties govern cell migration speed through cell-substratum adhesiveness.Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), and a front-to-rear gradient in cell adhesion strength has also been demonstrated (Schmidt et al., 1993Schmidt C.E. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. Integrin-cytoskeletal interactions in migrating fibroblasts are dynamic, asymmetric, and regulated.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The common explanation for the biphasic migration-velocity response to increased adhesion strength has been simple mechanical effects: At low adhesion, contraction pulls weak FAs at both the cell front and rear from the substrate; at high adhesion, contraction cannot overcome adhesion at the cell front or rear; while at intermediate adhesion, an optimum is reached, with traction generated at the front coupled to adhesion detachment in the rear. However, it is unknown whether adhesion strength spatially or temporally modulates the activities of F-actin, myosin II, or FAs within the lamellipodium or contractile modules to change characteristics of protrusion, adhesion, traction, or deadhesion phases of cell migration. This would be expected since adhesion strength alters signal-transduction pathways that regulate myosin II activity and FA and F-actin assembly/disassembly (Asthagiri et al., 1999Asthagiri A.R. Nelson C.M. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Quantitative relationship among integrin-ligand binding, adhesion, and signaling via focal adhesion kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2.J.

FAK-Src signalling through paxillin, ERK and MLCK regulates adhesion disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In addition, spatial and temporal dynamics of F-actin, myosin II, and FAs may be mechanically interdependent (Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Focal adhesions, contractility, and signaling.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Specifically, myosin II minifilaments are believed to generate tension in F-actin networks (Verkhovsky et al., 1999Verkhovsky A.B. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Network contraction model for cell translocation and retrograde flow.Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 207-222PubMed Google Scholar) to drive the clustering of actin-associated integrins at nascent integrin engagement sites to promote FA formation and maturation (Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). FA formation may immobilize the local actin network via connection to the ECM. Myosin II-dependent tension has been implicated in actomyosin network bundling between these adhesion-immobilized sites to concentrate contractile power into stress fibers (Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Rho-stimulated contractility drives the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Strongly contractile actomyosin bundles may pull weaker FAs from the ECM (Kaverina et al., 2002Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. Regulation of substrate adhesion dynamics during cell motility.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 746-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Webb et al., 2004Webb D.J. Donais K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). FA disengagement may then release immobilized F-actin, allowing local debundling and redistribution of myosin II tensile forces in the F-actin network. Together, these observations suggest that the adhesion-strength dependence of cell migration velocity could arise from spatially and temporally interdependent feedback between F-actin assembly/disassembly and motion, activated myosin II, and FA assembly/disassembly. Furthermore, optimization of cell migration velocity could occur by a specific spatiotemporal state of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and FAs. Here, we used quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy (qFSM) to test the hypothesis that adhesion strength, modulated by ECM ligand density, affects specific aspects of the organization and dynamics of the lamellipodium and contractile F-actin modules. We used immunofluorescence and live-cell microscopy to determine whether changes in organization and dynamics of myosin II and FA proteins correlate with cell adhesion strength and/or migration velocity. We characterize the unique dynamic organizational state of F-actin, myosin II, and FAs for rapid migration at intermediate adhesion strength and recapitulate fast migration mediated by this specific phenotype at a nonoptimal ECM density by manipulating myosin II activity. Thus, adhesion strength modulates migration speed by spatiotemporal feedback between specific parameters of actomyosin and FA dynamics. Previous studies have shown that vertebrate cells in culture display maximal migration velocity at intermediate adhesion strength, as modulated by ECM density (DiMilla et al., 1993DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Maximal migration of human smooth muscle cells on fibronectin and type IV collagen occurs at an intermediate attachment strength.J.

We first established a similar behavior for PtK1 epithelial cells since we have extensively characterized their F-actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics (Gupton et al., 2005Gupton S.L.

PtK1 cells express β1-integrins (data not shown), which dimerize with α-integrins to form a fibronectin (FN) receptor. PtK1 cells plated on coverslips coated with increasing FN concentration ([FN]) (0–100 μg/ml) showed increased spreading (Figure 1A), increased cell binding (Figure 1B), and increased adhesion strength (Figure 1C). Migration velocity of cells in small epithelial islands (two to six cells) was measured from time-lapse movies (see Figure 1D and Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Cells plated on coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml FN (0.84 ± 0.02 μm/min) migrated significantly faster than cells plated on higher and lower [FN] (Figure 1D; Table S1; p < 0.0001, Tukey's HSD post hoc test [HSD]), recapitulating behavior of other cell types (DiMilla et al., 1993DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Maximal migration of human smooth muscle cells on fibronectin and type IV collagen occurs at an intermediate attachment strength.J.

Integrin-ligand binding properties govern cell migration speed through cell-substratum adhesiveness.Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Since protrusion is the first step of migration, we used kymographs of time-lapse movies to analyze leading-edge behavior in cells migrating at various adhesion strengths (Figure 1E; Table S1). Surprisingly, unlike migration velocity, no parameters of protrusion or retraction exhibited a biphasic response to increasing adhesion strength. Specifically, the velocity or persistence of protrusion phases was not significantly altered (p = 0.7 and 0.5, respectively, HSD), while the distance of protrusion phases increased with increasing adhesion strength, with significance between some conditions (Table S1; p < 0.05 HSD). The duration and distance of retraction phases directly correlated with adhesion strength, while the velocity of retraction phases decreased with higher adhesion (Figure 1F; p < 0.0001 HSD). The increase in retraction duration caused a decrease in the frequency of switching from retraction to protrusion at high adhesion strength (Figure 1G). Since retraction parameters were affected by adhesion strength, this suggested that the lamellipodium interacts with the substrate during retraction (Bailly et al., 1998Bailly M. Yan L. Whitesides G.M. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Regulation of protrusion shape and adhesion to the substratum during chemotactic responses of mammalian carcinoma cells.Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by comparing edge dynamics with total internal reflection fluorescence and wide-field epifluorescence microscopy to determine when the cell edge was close to the substrate (Figure S1). Although no parameters of protrusion correlated with migration velocity, cell migration clearly requires leading-edge advance. Thus, transient edge fluctuations are decoupled from net edge advance. To determine whether adhesion-strength-dependent changes in migration rate affected the organization of F-actin dynamics within the lamellipodium and contractile F-actin modules, we performed fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) (Danuser and Waterman-Storer, 2003Danuser G. Waterman-Storer C.M. Quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy: where it came from and where it is going.J. Microsc. 2003; 211: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of cells microinjected with X-rhodamine actin as they migrated at low, intermediate, or high adhesion strength (Figure 1C; 5, 10, and 30 μg/ml FN coating concentrations will be used throughout the study to correspond to low, intermediate, and high [FN], respectively). The lamellipodium is the region of fast retrograde F-actin flow organized in a treadmilling array that resides between the leading edge and the lamella (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, Salmon et al., 2002Salmon W.C. Adams M.C. Waterman-Storer C.M. Dual-wavelength fluorescent speckle microscopy reveals coupling of microtubule and actin movements in migrating cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). FAs initiate at the junction between the lamellipodium and lamella, where F-actin flow velocity slows sharply (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The contractile module is located between the lamellipodium base and near the nucleus and is composed of the lamella, marked by slow retrograde flow; the central cell area, marked by slow anterograde flow; and the convergence zone at the junction of the lamella and the cell central region, with zero net actin flow (Salmon et al., 2002Salmon W.C.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We examined FSM movies to qualitatively evaluate the effects of adhesion strength on these modules (Movie S1). In cells at intermediate and high adhesion strength, the lamellipodium-lamella junction possessed a positionally stable, sharply defined F-actin flow-speed gradient. In contrast, at low adhesion strength, this border was variable in position and had a shallower speed gradient. Similarly, in cells at low adhesion strength, F-actin flow in the lamella and cell central region did not meet in a well-defined convergence zone of near zero F-actin flow as at medium and high adhesion strength. Thus, stronger adhesion is required to create or maintain F-actin flow-velocity gradients that define delineation between actin modules in migrating cells. We next used qFSM analysis software to produce spatiotemporal maps of the velocity of F-actin flow (kinematics) and the organization of F-actin assembly/disassembly rates (kinetics) (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We first examined F-actin kinematics and kinetics in the lamellipodium to determine whether they were modulated by adhesion strength. qFSM and kymograph analysis of kinematics (Figures 2C and 2E; Movie S2) revealed that F-actin retrograde flow velocity in the lamellipodium increased with adhesion strength (p < 0.0005 HSD; Figure 2G; Table S2). Lamellipodium width correlated inversely with migration velocity, being narrowest at intermediate adhesion strength (p < 0.005 HSD; Figure 2H; Table S2). qFSM mapping of F-actin assembly/disassembly rates (Figure 2D; Movie S3) revealed that cells at intermediate and high adhesion strength displayed high F-actin polymerization rates (bright red) along the cell edge juxtaposed to rapid depolymerization (bright green). This is indicative of a treadmilling lamellipodium array (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In contrast, at low adhesion strength, depolymerization spread throughout the cell front, in agreement with our qualitative notion of a poorly defined lamellipodium/lamella junction. Our image-analysis algorithms preclude the ability to compare absolute rates of F-actin kinetics between cells.

(H) Average width of cellular regions measured from kymographs (±SEM). Red asterisks in (G) and (H) denote significant differences (p < 0.05) between other conditions in the same cellular region (Tukey's HSD post hoc test [HSD]). We next analyzed F-actin dynamics in the contractile module in cells at different adhesion strengths. qFSM and kymograph analysis showed that F-actin flow velocity in both the lamella and cell central region decreased significantly with increasing adhesion strength (p < 0.0005 HSD; Figures 2C and 2G). At low adhesion, F-actin kinematics in the contractile module were fast and variable (indicated by large standard deviations in flow rates; Figure 2G). At high adhesion strength, F-actin flow in the lamella and central cell region was nearly fully inhibited, with a wide convergence zone of near zero flow rate (Figures 2G and 2H). In contrast, at intermediate adhesion strength, cells displayed well-organized, intermediate-speed retrograde and anterograde flows that met in a narrow zone of zero F-actin flow velocity (Figures 2C and 2E, white arrows; Figure 2F; Movies S1 and S2). In these cells, central anterograde flow was significantly greater than lamella retrograde flow (p < 0.001 t test), a front-to-back asymmetry in kinematics not observed at either low or high adhesion strength. Lamella width was significantly larger in cells at intermediate adhesion strength than at low or high strength, while the convergence zone was most narrow at intermediate adhesion strength (p < 0.0001 HSD). This indicates that fast cell migration at intermediate adhesion strength correlates with fast F-actin convergence over a small area. The spatial organization of F-actin assembly/disassembly kinetics was then compared in the contractile module. At all adhesion strengths, there were interspersed punctae of polymerization and depolymerization (Figure 2D; Movie S3), as described (Ponti et al., 2004Ponti A. Machacek M. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Two distinct actin networks drive the protrusion of migrating cells.Science. 2004; 305: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Comparison of F-actin kinetic and kinematic maps showed that for cells migrating at intermediate adhesion strength, rapid F-actin depolymerization (bright green) was concentrated in the convergence zone (white arrowhead, Figure 2D). Thus, fast flow convergence is coupled to rapid F-actin depolymerization. Together, analysis of FSM data shows that a narrow lamellipodium with an intermediate F-actin flow rate and a contractile module consisting of a wide lamella, well-organized, fast, asymmetric F-actin flow convergence, and a narrow zone of zero F-actin flow with rapid filament depolymerization correlate with fast migration at intermediate adhesion strength. Since F-actin kinematics in the contractile module of migrating epithelial cells are myosin II dependent (Gupton et al., 2002Gupton S.L. Salmon W.C. Waterman-Storer C.M.

We used Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models of DS to show that the increased dose of the amyloid precursor protein gene, App, acts to markedly decrease NGF retrograde transport and cause degeneration of BFCNs. NGF transport was also decreased in mice expressing wild-type human APP or a familial AD-linked mutant APP; while significant, the decreases were less marked and there was no evident degeneration of BFCNs. Because of evidence suggesting that the NGF transport defect was intra-axonal, we explored within cholinergic axons the status of early endosomes (EEs). NGF-containing EEs were enlarged in Ts65Dn mice and their App content was increased. Our study thus provides evidence for a pathogenic mechanism for DS in which increased expression of App, in the context of trisomy, causes abnormal transport of NGF and cholinergic neurodegeneration."

Eleven months after the main shock, afterslip continues at rates several times the average interseismic rate, resulting in deformation equivalent to at least a M w 8.2 earthquake. In general, along-strike variations in frictional behavior appear to persist over multiple earthquake cycles. Aftershocks cluster along the boundary between the region of coseismic slip and the up-dip creeping zone. We observe that the cumulative number of aftershocks increases linearly with postseismic displacements; this finding suggests that the temporal evolution of aftershocks is governed by afterslip."

https://openalex.org/W2089157578,"Synaptic vesicles have been proposed to form through two mechanisms: one directly from the plasma membrane involving clathrin-dependent endocytosis and the adaptor protein AP2, and the other from an endosomal intermediate mediated by the adaptor AP3. However, the relative role of these two mechanisms in synaptic vesicle recycling has remained unclear. We now find that vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1 interacts directly with endophilin, a component of the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery. In the absence of its interaction with endophilin, VGLUT1 recycles more slowly during prolonged, high-frequency stimulation. Inhibition of the AP3 pathway with brefeldin A rescues the rate of recycling, suggesting a competition between AP2 and -3 pathways, with endophilin recruiting VGLUT1 toward the faster AP2 pathway. After stimulation, however, inhibition of the AP3 pathway prevents the full recovery of VGLUT1 by endocytosis, implicating the AP3 pathway specifically in compensatory endocytosis."

PMd neurons encoded the relative position of the target, hand, and eye. MIP neurons encoded target location with respect to the eye only. These results indicate that whereas MIP encodes target locations in an eye-centered reference frame, PMd uses a relative position code that specifies the differences in locations between all three variables.

The growth of new synaptic contacts shapes the initial development and subsequent refinement of neural circuits. Genetic studies have identified highwire as a highly conserved presynaptic regulator of synapse growth and morphology. In Drosophila, loss of highwire causes dramatic synaptic overgrowth of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Wan et al., 2000Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S.

Highwire and its homologs are enormous proteins, ranging from 418 kDa in worms to 564 kDa in flies, and all share a series of domains that likely perform distinct biochemical activities. These include an N-terminal Ran GTP exchange factor-like domain that can inhibit adenylate cyclase (Pierre et al., 2004Pierre S.C. Hausler J. Birod K. Geisslinger G. Scholich K. PAM mediates sustained inhibition of cAMP signaling by sphingosine-1-phosphate.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3031-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), two PHR repeats of unknown function, a domain shown to bind the myc oncogene (Guo et al., 1998Guo Q.

The molecular function for each domain during synaptic growth is thus far unknown; however, the prevailing model for Highwire function focuses on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.

In addition, overexpression of ubiquitin hydrolases, which antagonize ubiquitination by removing ubiquitin from targeted proteins, promotes synaptic overgrowth and enhances the highwire phenotype (DiAntonio et al., 2001DiAntonio A.

These results support a model in which Highwire restrains synaptic growth by downregulating levels of a signaling protein that promotes synaptic growth. What is the target of Highwire regulation? In Drosophila, Highwire has been proposed to regulate a TGF-β signaling pathway through an interaction with co-SMAD Medea (McCabe et al., 2004McCabe B.D. Hom S. Aberle H. Fetter R.D. Marques G.

However, in C. elegans, the homolog rpm-1 regulates a p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y.

While Highwire may interact with all of these varied pathways, it is not known which pathway or pathways are essential for controlling synaptic growth. Our unbiased approach to this question was to conduct a genetic screen in Drosophila for mutations that rescue the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype. The model for Highwire function predicts that the levels of a synaptogenic signaling protein would be increased in a highwire mutant. Therefore, genetically reducing the activity of such a protein should suppress the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype. In a genetic screen for such suppressors, we identified mutations in a single gene that we have named wallenda, which encodes a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) homologous to the vertebrate dual leucine zipper-bearing kinases DLK and LZK. Wallenda behaves as expected for a downstream target of Highwire. Both loss of highwire and overexpression of ubiquitin hydrolases cause dramatic increases in the level of Wallenda protein at synapses. wallenda is absolutely required for highwire-dependent synaptic overgrowth, and overexpression of wallenda is sufficient to cause synaptic overgrowth. Downstream of Wallenda, we find that the MAP kinase JNK and the transcription factor Fos are also essential for highwire synaptic overgrowth. Hence, Highwire controls synaptic growth by regulating a MAP kinase signal and its transcriptional output. The C. elegans Wallenda homolog DLK-1 is also required for the synaptic phenotypes of rpm-1 mutants (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This evolutionary conservation suggests that downregulation of a specific MAPKKK is a fundamental function for this large neuronal E3 ligase. At the Drosophila NMJ, mutations in highwire cause dramatic synaptic overgrowth (Wan et al., 2000Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Highwire regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila.Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2005Wu C. Wairkar Y.P. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Highwire function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction: spatial, structural, and temporal requirements.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9557-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This implies that Highwire normally functions to downregulate a pathway that mediates synaptic growth; in its absence, this downstream pathway is overactive. A prediction from this model is that the synaptic overgrowth could be suppressed by decreasing the activity of this downstream pathway. To find potential components of this pathway, we conducted a genetic screen for mutations that can dominantly suppress the highwire phenotype. Such a screen should identify genes whose dosage is important for synaptic overgrowth. To conduct a large-scale screen, we took advantage of the observation that combining loss-of-function mutations in highwire with overexpression of the ubiquitin hydrolase fat facets (faf) is lethal (DiAntonio et al., 2001DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms regulate synaptic growth and function.Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This lethality could arise from the overactivity of a downstream target normally regulated by ubiquitination. If so, then mutating this hypothesized downstream target should rescue lethality. For the screen, flies carrying an upstream-activating sequence (UAS) promoter upstream of fat facets were chemically mutagenized and mated to highwire;elav-Gal4 virgins. Since highwire is on the X chromosome, all male offspring from this cross die because they are both mutant for highwire and overexpress fat facets in neurons. We screened over 20,000 mutagenized second and third chromosomes for suppression of lethality and found eighteen suppressors. Sixteen of these suppressors disrupt the fat facets gene, which was expected, since overexpression of nonfunctional fat facets is not lethal in combination with highwire (DiAntonio et al., 2001DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms regulate synaptic growth and function.Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The two suppressor mutations that did not map to fat facets were candidate suppressors of highwire. Genuine suppressors of highwire should not only suppress lethality, but should also suppress the cellular phenotype of synaptic overgrowth. Indeed, both mutations dominantly suppress the highwire synaptic morphology phenotype and, as transheterozygotes, completely suppress this phenotype (described in more detail below and in Figure 1). Both mutations map to a single locus on chromosome 3, and are phenocopied by deficiencies that delete this region (76B4–76D5). The mutations are therefore loss-of-function alleles of a single gene whose function is essential for the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype. We name this suppressor wallenda after the Flying Wallendas, an acrobat troupe famous for their world record stunts on the circus highwire. The ability of wallenda mutations to suppress the highwire synaptic morphology phenotype was characterized in detail (Figures 1A–1I) at the NMJ of muscle 4, which is formed from a single motoneuron, but similar results are observed at all glutamatergic type I NMJs (Figures 1A–1C, lower panels). Mutations in highwire cause dramatic synaptic overgrowth: a 4-fold increase in the number of boutons (Figure 1E) and synaptic branches (Figure 1F) and a 2-fold increase in total synaptic area (Figure 1G). The highwire mutant phenotype also causes a 66% reduction in bouton size (Figure 1H) and a 70% reduction in the average intensity (Figure 1I) and a 50% reduction in total intensity (data not shown) of staining for synaptic vesicle proteins. For our analysis, we use DVGLUT as a representative synaptic vesicle marker, but similar effects are observed for synaptotagmin (data not shown). All of the above parameters of the highwire mutant phenotype are suppressed by mutations in wallenda (Figures 1E–1I). Removing one copy of wallenda suppresses the highwire phenotype for each of these parameters by approximately 50% (p < 0.0001 for all parameters). Removing both copies of wallenda confers complete suppression. The highwire; wallenda double mutant (hiwND8;wnd1/wnd2) is not significantly different from wild-type (p > 0.9 for all parameters). Therefore, the wallenda gene is essential for the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype. The allele of highwire used in Figure 1 (hiwND8) contains a nonsense mutation in the N-terminal portion the protein (Wan et al., 2000Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Highwire regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila.Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, some full-length Highwire protein can be detected in this mutant due to read-through of the premature stop codon (Wu et al., 2005Wu C. Wairkar Y.P. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Highwire function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction: spatial, structural, and temporal requirements.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9557-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether suppression requires residual highwire activity, we generated deletions that remove either the N-terminal or C-terminal halves of the gene (Wu et al., 2005Wu C. Wairkar Y.P. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Highwire function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction: spatial, structural, and temporal requirements.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9557-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both hiwΔN and hiwΔC can be suppressed by wallenda similarly to hiwND8 (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). These results rule out the possibility that wallenda functions as an upstream regulator of highwire, and instead support the model that wallenda functions downstream as an effector of the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype. In the absence of highwire, this downstream pathway is overactive. This pathway requires wallenda and is sensitive to its dose. It has been previously observed that mutations in the BMP/TGF-β signaling pathway can suppress highwire synaptic overgrowth, so we wished to compare this suppression to suppression by wallenda. Figure 1D shows suppression by mutations in the type II receptor wishful thinking (witA12/witB11). Additional alleles of wit that are genetic nulls are shown in Figure S2. Several differences are of note. First, mutation of wit and other TGF-β pathway components cause a very strong reduction in synaptic growth (Aberle et al., 2002Aberle H. Haghighi A.P. Fetter R.D.

Hom S. Aberle H. Fetter R.D. Marques G. Haerry T.E. Wan H. O'Connor M.B. Goodman C.S. Haghighi A.P. Highwire regulates presynaptic BMP signaling essential for synaptic growth.Neuron. 2004; 41: 891-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). When highwire is wild-type, mutation of wit causes a dramatic reduction in bouton number (64%), branching (80%), and synaptic area (64%). In contrast, wallenda mutants show no reduction in synaptic growth in an otherwise wild-type background (p > 0.9 compared to wild-type for all parameters). Second, TGF-β mutants do not suppress the reduced bouton size or synaptic vesicle protein intensity phenotypes of highwire nearly as well as they suppress the bouton number phenotype of highwire (McCabe et al., 2004McCabe B.D. Hom S. Aberle H. Fetter R.D. Marques G. Haerry T.E. Wan H. O'Connor M.B. Goodman C.S. Haghighi A.P. Highwire regulates presynaptic BMP signaling essential for synaptic growth.Neuron. 2004; 41: 891-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar; Figures 1D, 1H, and 1I, and Figure S2). In contrast, wallenda mutations suppress all parameters of the highwire morphology phenotype completely. These differences suggest that wallenda and TGF-β mutants may suppress highwire through different mechanisms. Consistent with this, no dominant genetic interactions were observed between wallenda and mutations in wit or the co-SMAD medea. The genetic interactions between loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitin ligase highwire and gain-of-function mutations in the ubiquitin hydrolase fat facets suggest that both mutations may influence the same signaling pathway (DiAntonio et al., 2001DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms regulate synaptic growth and function.Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we assessed whether wallenda can suppress fat facets-induced synaptic overgrowth. Neuronal overexpression of fat facets, like loss-of-function highwire, leads to an increased number of synaptic boutons and branches and an increased synaptic span (Figure 1J, left panels). wallenda mutants suppress this phenotype (Figure 1K, p < 0.0005). Therefore, wallenda is required for the overgrowth caused by both overexpression of a ubiquitin hydrolase and loss of a ubiquitin ligase. wallenda thus behaves genetically like a candidate substrate for ubiquitination that could mediate synaptic overgrowth. highwire mutants have defects in synaptic function as well as synaptic morphology. Since wallenda mutants can suppress the morphological defects of highwire, we tested whether wallenda mutants can also suppress the synaptic transmission defects of highwire. highwire mutants show both reduced quantal size (response to a single vesicle) and reduced quantal content (number of vesicles released by the nerve) (Figure 2, and see Wan et al., 2000Wan H.I. DiAntonio A. Fetter R.D. Bergstrom K. Strauss R. Goodman C.S. Highwire regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila.Neuron. 2000; 26: 313-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2005Wu C. Wairkar Y.P. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Highwire function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction: spatial, structural, and temporal requirements.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9557-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). wallenda mutants alone have normal synaptic function, allowing us to ask whether they could confer suppression to the highwire mutant phenotype. wallenda mutations do suppress the highwire defect in quantal size: both the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous miniature events in the highwire; wallenda double mutant are similar to wild-type (p > 0.9). In contrast, the evoked potentials of the highwire; wallenda double mutant are only modestly increased, and this is due entirely to the increased quantal size. The quantal content, calculated as the excitatory junction potential (EJP) amplitude divided by the miniature EJP (mEJP) amplitude, remains the same between highwire and highwire; wallenda (p > 0.9). Therefore, wallenda does not suppress the primary defect in highwire synaptic function, the reduced number of vesicles released by the nerve. While the quantal size phenotype of highwire may be secondary to the synaptic morphology phenotype, the defect in quantal content cannot be secondary to morphology. Therefore, highwire regulates synaptic physiology through a distinct molecular pathway that does not require wallenda. The genetic results described above suggest that wallenda is a downstream target of highwire that functions to promote synaptic growth. Using meiotic recombination and deficiency mapping, wallenda was mapped to 76B4–76D5 on the third chromosome. This location was refined by male recombination mapping (Chen et al., 1998Chen B. Chu T. Harms E. Gergen J.P. Strickland S. Mapping of Drosophila mutations using site-specific male recombination.Genetics. 1998; 149: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar) to a 20 kb region at 76B9. Four annotated genes reside within this region, including the predicted kinase CG8789. Sequencing of both wallenda alleles revealed mutations in CG8789: wnd1 has a mutation in a conserved residue in the kinase domain, and wnd2 has a mutation in the stop codon that adds an extra 104 amino acid tail to the protein (Figure 3). We serendipitously found a third allele of wallenda, wnd3, in a highwire mutant line (hiwPF253) that showed heterogeneity in the synaptic overgrowth phenotype. We mapped the source of this heterogeneity to a suppressor mutation at the wallenda locus. This mutation of spontaneous origin behaves exactly like a new loss-of-function mutation in wallenda: wnd3 can fully suppress the highwire synaptic overgrowth phenotype (Figure S1). Sequencing revealed that wnd3 contains a roo transposon insertion in the middle of the CG8789. CG8789 belongs to the family of mixed lineage kinases that function as MAPKKKs for JNK and p38 signaling pathways. Its closest vertebrate homologs are the dual leucine zipper-bearing kinases DLK and LZK (Figure 3) (Holzman et al., 1994Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. Identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of dual leucine zipper bearing kinase. A novel serine/threonine protein kinase that defines a second subfamily of mixed lineage kinases.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28622-28629Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Its similarity to these vertebrate kinases (63% identity in the kinase domain) is much greater than to its closest Drosophila relative, the mixed lineage kinase slipper (which shares only 29% identity in the kinase domain). Vertebrate DLK is expressed in neurons and has been observed to localize to synapses (Hirai et al., 2005Hirai S. Kawaguchi A. Suenaga J. Ono M. Cui de F. Ohno S.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C. elegans homolog DLK-1 was identified as a suppressor of the highwire homolog rpm-1 (Nakata et al., 2005Nakata K. Abrams B. Grill B. Goncharov A. Huang X. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Regulation of a DLK-1 and p38 MAP kinase pathway by the ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 is required for presynaptic development.Cell. 2005; 120: 407-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Hence, the regulation of this kinase is conserved between C. elegans and Drosophila. If wallenda functions downstream of highwire, it should be expressed in neurons where highwire function is required. In situ hybridization experiments in embryos detect wallenda transcript in the CNS at stage 13 and later, stages when axon guidance and synapse development take place (data not shown). To determine where Wallenda protein localizes, we raised polyclonal antisera in rabbits (WndA1) to a peptide near the C terminus (denoted in Figure 3). In embryos stage 13 and older, the α-Wallenda antibodies stain the neurite- and synapse-rich neuropil in the CNS. wnd3 mutants show no neuropil staining, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies (Figures 4A and 4C). If wallenda is directly downstream of highwire then Highwire should regulate Wallenda protein levels. In embryos there is no significant difference in α-Wallenda staining between wild-type and highwire mutants (Figures 4A and 4C). In contrast, loss of highwire dramatically alters Wallenda staining in ventral nerve cords of third-instar larvae (Figures 4B and 4C). In wild-type larvae Wallenda is barely detectable in the neuropil, although there is slightly more (16%) staining than in the wnd3 mutant (p < 0.01). In highwire mutant larvae, Wallenda staining in the neuropil is dramatically increased. In addition, immunoblots of total protein extracts from dissected larval nerve cords demonstrate that mutation of highwire causes an increase in the total levels of Wallenda protein (2.5-fold, p < 0.01, Figures 4D and 4E). The difference in Wallenda levels between embryos and larvae, and the differential effect of highwire mutations during these two stages, indicates that Highwire functions to control Wallenda primarily in larvae. This is consistent with the finding that Highwire functions throughout larval development to control synaptic growth (Wu et al., 2005Wu C. Wairkar Y.P. Collins C.A. DiAntonio A. Highwire function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction: spatial, structural, and temporal requirements.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9557-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is the developmental period when the NMJ grows most dramatically (Schuster et al., 1996Schuster C.M. Davis G.W. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S.

We identified Lhx2 as a transcription factor positioned downstream of signals necessary to specify hair follicle stem cells, but upstream from signals required to drive activated stem cells to terminally differentiate.

An associated reduction in deep flow speed provides evidence of a significant change to a major downwelling limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

https://openalex.org/W1986014993,"The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) is central to a number of pathological processes through the induction of specific genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Even though HIF-1 is highly regulated by cellular oxygen levels, other elements of the inflammatory and tumor microenvironment were shown to influence its activity under normal oxygen concentration. Among others, recent studies indicated that transforming growth factor (TGF) β increases the expression of the regulatory HIF-1α subunit, and induces HIF-1 DNA binding activity. Here, we demonstrate that TGFβ acts on HIF-1α accumulation and activity by increasing HIF-1α protein stability. In particular, we demonstrate that TGFβ markedly and specifically decreases both mRNA and protein levels of a HIF-1α-associated prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), PHD2, through the Smad signaling pathway. As a consequence, the degradation of HIF-1α was inhibited as determined by impaired degradation of a reporter protein containing the HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain encompassing the PHD-targeted prolines. Moreover, inhibition of the TGFβ1 converting enzyme, furin, resulted in increased PHD2 expression, and decreased basal HIF-1α and VEGF levels, suggesting that endogenous production of bioactive TGFβ1 efficiently regulates HIF-1-targeted genes. This was reinforced by results from HIF-1α knock-out or HIF-1α-inhibited cells that show impairment in VEGF production in response to TGFβ. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which a growth factor controls HIF-1 stability, and thereby drives the expression of specific genes, through the regulation of PHD2 levels."

Nuclear neurons fire action potentials spontaneously unless strongly inhibited by Purkinje neurons, raising the possibility that plasticity-triggering signals in these cells differ from those at classical Hebbian synapses. Based on predictions of neuronal activity during delay eyelid conditioning, we developed quasi-physiological induction protocols consisting of high-frequency mossy fiber stimulation and postsynaptic hyperpolarization. Robust, NMDA receptor-dependent potentiation of nuclear cell EPSCs occurred with protocols including a 150-250 ms hyperpolarization in which mossy fiber stimulation preceded a postinhibitory rebound depolarization. Mossy fiber stimulation potentiated EPSCs even when postsynaptic spiking was prevented by voltage-clamp, as long as rebound current was evoked. These data suggest that Purkinje cell inhibition guides the strengthening of excitatory synapses in the cerebellar nuclei."

ABD-B regulation of pigmentation evolved through the gain of ABD-B binding sites in a specific cis-regulatory element of the yellow gene of a common ancestor of sexually dimorphic species. Within the melanogaster species group, male-specific pigmentation has subsequently been lost by at least three different mechanisms, including the mutational inactivation of a key ABD-B binding site in one lineage.

Many animal bodies are constructed of serially homologous parts, such as segments, somites, vertebrae, and appendages. In the course of evolution, the number and morphology of these structures have undergone dramatic diversification (reviewed in Weatherbee and Carroll, 1999Weatherbee S.D. Carroll S.B.

However, despite their prominent roles in development and evolution, knowledge of the scope and mechanisms of target regulation by Hox proteins is incomplete in several crucial respects (Mahaffey, 2005Mahaffey J.W.

Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). First, while Drosophila melanogaster is the best studied model species, only a modest number of direct Hox-regulated target genes have been identified (Pearson et al., 2005Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Modulating Hox gene functions during animal body patterning.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Second, nearly all identified target genes encode signaling proteins or transcription factors that act by regulating the expression of other genes (Pearson et al., 2005Pearson J.C. Lemons D. McGinnis W. Modulating Hox gene functions during animal body patterning.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It is not clear to what degree Hox proteins also directly regulate terminal differentiation genes and phenotypes in vivo. Third, for some Hox proteins, such as Abdominal-B, no direct target genes have been characterized. And finally, despite the inference that the sets of target genes regulated by individual Hox proteins have diverged between homologous structures (Warren et al., 1994Warren R.W. Nagy L. Selegue J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the evolutionary gain or loss of Hox regulation of individual genes has not been directly demonstrated at the molecular level. Understanding how Hox-regulated target genes and traits evolve requires both the identification of direct target genes and an evolutionary framework upon which the evolution of the Hox-target interaction can be reconstructed. Toward this end, we have analyzed the development and evolution of a Hox-regulated trait in Drosophila. In D. melanogaster, the male has fully pigmented tergites in the fifth and sixth abdominal segments (A5 and A6), whereas the female's tergites have only a narrow pigment stripe (Figures 1B and 1C). This sexually dimorphic pigmentation pattern is controlled by a genetic regulatory circuit involving the Hox gene Abd-B. Loss-of-function mutations of Abd-B cause the loss of male-specific pigmentation, while gain-of-function alleles, such as Abd-BMcp, cause the expansion of pigmentation to the A4 segment (Celniker et al., 1990Celniker S.E.

USA. 1993; 90: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two other loci, bric à brac (bab), which encodes the related transcription factors BAB1 and BAB2 (Couderc et al., 2002Couderc J.L. Godt D. Zollman S. Chen J. Li M. Tiong S. Cramton S.E. Sahut-Barnola I. Laski F.A.

The regulation of sex determination and sexually dimorphic differentiation in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), function to repress male-type pigmentation in the female abdomen. Loss of these gene functions causes ectopic pigmentation of the female A5 and A6 segments (Baker and Ridge, 1980Baker B.S. Ridge K.A. Sex and the single cell. I. On the action of major loci affecting sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1980; 94: 383-423PubMed Google Scholar, Couderc et al., 2002Couderc J.L. Godt D. Zollman S. Chen J. Li M.

The sexually dimorphic pigment pattern depends upon regulatory interactions among the Abd-B, bab, and dsx genes (Kopp et al., 2000Kopp A. Duncan I. Godt D. Carroll S.B. Genetic control and evolution of sexually dimorphic characters in Drosophila.Nature. 2000; 408: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses suggest that ABD-B has dual functions in promoting male-specific pigmentation: It appears to positively regulate the melanin pattern, and it represses the expression of both bab genes in the A5 and A6 segments. In females, the repressive action of ABD-B on bab is overcome by the DSXf protein, which promotes sufficient bab expression to suppress posterior pigmentation (Kopp et al., 2000Kopp A. Duncan I. Godt D. Carroll S.B. Genetic control and evolution of sexually dimorphic characters in Drosophila.Nature. 2000; 408: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the genus Drosophila, many species show differences in pigmentation traits. Pigmentation of the posterior male abdomen is a trait found in many members of the melanogaster species group but not in several other major groups. The dimorphic regulation of bab expression is closely correlated with dimorphic pigmentation (Kopp et al., 2000Kopp A. Duncan I. Godt D. Carroll S.B. Genetic control and evolution of sexually dimorphic characters in Drosophila.Nature. 2000; 408: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) as well other pigmentation patterns (Gompel and Carroll, 2003Gompel N.

It is not known, however, which regulatory interactions among Abd-B, bab, dsx, and pigmentation genes are direct and which are indirect. Here, we show through biochemical and transgenic analyses that ABD-B directly activates the expression of the yellow gene in the male A5 and A6 segments through binding sites in a specific cis-regulatory element (CRE) of the yellow gene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ABD-B regulation of the yellow gene evolved in a common ancestor of the melanogaster species group and that mutational inactivation of a key ABD-B binding site occurred within the D. kikkawai lineage that has lost dimorphic pigmentation. These results demonstrate that Hox proteins do directly regulate terminal phenotypes and that the gain and loss of Hox regulation occur at the level of individual species through modifications of CREs. The Yellow protein is expressed in the pupal epidermis in a striped pattern near the A/P compartment boundary in all abdominal segments of developing females, in segments A1–A4 of developing males, and in a broad intense pattern throughout the anterior of segments A5 and A6 of males. This pattern foreshadows the melanin pattern of the adult flies (Wittkopp et al., 2002aWittkopp P.J. True J.R. Carroll S.B. Reciprocal functions of the Drosophila Yellow and Ebony proteins in the development and evolution of pigment patterns.Development. 2002; 129: 1849-1858PubMed Google Scholar). In order to dissect the regulation of yellow expression in the abdomen, we first identified cis-regulatory sequences necessary for accurate gene expression. Genetic analysis has identified a region of the yellow locus required for gene function in the abdomen (Geyer and Corces, 1987Geyer P.K. Corces V.G. Separate regulatory elements are responsible for the complex pattern of tissue-specific and developmental transcription of the yellow locus in Drosophila melanogaster.Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and molecular studies have identified different regions of the yellow gene that govern expression in several structures, including the body, wings, and bristles (Wittkopp et al., 2002bWittkopp P.J. Vaccaro K. Carroll S.B. Evolution of yellow gene regulation and pigmentation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1547-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We noted, however, that a previously described 1.4 kb CRE (Wittkopp et al., 2002bWittkopp P.J. Vaccaro K. Carroll S.B. Evolution of yellow gene regulation and pigmentation in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1547-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), when placed upstream of a reporter gene, did not precisely recapitulate the native Yellow expression pattern in the abdomen: The contrast between expression in the more anterior portion of each segment and the stripe near the A/P compartment boundary was diminished, and the higher levels of expression in male segments A5 and A6 was less pronounced (data not shown). To determine whether additional sequences flanking this CRE could contribute to the fidelity of reporter-gene expression, we tested the activity of a 2.6 kb fragment located 269 bp from the 5′ end of the yellow transcription unit (Figure 1A). This region includes some regulatory sequences that contribute to gene expression in the wing. This element, termed the wing/body (wb) element, drove robust, sexually dimorphic expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the pupal abdomen and a sharp, striped pattern in the A1–A6 segments of females and A1–A4 segments of males (Figures 1F and 1G), thus recapitulating the native Yellow expression pattern. If the sexually dimorphic pattern of the wb element is regulated by Abd-B and bab, its expression should be modified differently in mutants for these genes. In females with one mutant copy of the bab locus, the activity of the wb element was fully derepressed in A6 and partially derepressed in A5, which correlated with the male-type adult pigmentation pattern of the same genotype (Figures 1D and 1H). In addition, the wb element responded to the Abd-BMcp gain-of-function allele—male-specific expression of EGFP was expanded to the A4 segment in mutant males (Figures 1E and 1I). These findings show that the wb element and, hence, the yellow gene are transcriptionally regulated, directly or indirectly, by both Abd-B and bab activities. In order to determine whether regulation of yellow might be direct, we sought to identify regions within the wb element that were ABD-B-responsive. We first determined whether smaller regions of the wb element were sufficient to drive sexually dimorphic expression of a reporter gene. A 1.6 kb portion of the wb element lacking the 1.0 kb 5′-most sequence that contains the wing CRE (Geyer and Corces, 1987Geyer P.K. Corces V.G.

We shall refer to this 1.6 kb element as the body CRE. We then made a series of deletion constructs for six subregions of the body CRE (BEΔ1–BEΔ6) to determine which subregion (or subregions) was necessary or sufficient to drive sexually dimorphic expression (Figure 2A). Only BEΔ3 males lost the male-specific expression of EGFP in the A5 and A6 segments, demonstrating an essential role of this region (Figures 2A and 2C). To determine whether the BE3 cis-regulatory region is also sufficient for the response to ABD-B, we made a set of constructs that contained BE3 and/or adjacent regions and examined reporter expression in the pupal abdomen (Figure 2A). All five BE3-containing constructs, including BE1–3, BE2–3, BE3, BE3–4, and BE3–6, express EGFP in a male-specific pattern at varying levels and respond to the Abd-BMcp allele (right column in Figure 2A; Figures 2D–2I). The BE3 region alone drove weak reporter expression in A5 and A6 (Figure 2F), while the BE3–6 region drove strong expression (Figure 2H) that was responsive to Abd-B (Figure 2I). These results suggest that the BE3 subregion is required for the response to ABD-B and that the BE3–6 region contains the cis-regulatory sequences required for robust male-specific activation of the yellow gene. We next examined whether the ABD-B protein directly activates the yellow gene through interaction with binding sites in the body CRE. We systematically searched for ABD-B binding sites in vitro by DNase I footprinting of all six subregions (BE1–BE6) with the purified ABD-B homeodomain (HD). We identified four sites that were strongly and specifically protected by ABD-B; all four putative binding sites were clustered together within the BE3 region (Figure 3A; BS4, BS5, BS6, and BS7). BS5 contains a TTAC motif and BS7 contains two overlapping TTAT motifs (which is the preferred core binding site for ABD-B; Ekker et al., 1994Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. The degree of variation in DNA sequence recognition among four Drosophila homeotic proteins.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), but the other two sites do not contain any potential core sequence for Hox proteins (Ekker et al., 1994Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. The degree of variation in DNA sequence recognition among four Drosophila homeotic proteins.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). In order to confirm ABD-B binding to these sites, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using four overlapping oligonucleotides containing pairs of putative sites. The short sequence between BS5 and BS6 is not required for ABD-B binding (data not shown), so we made substitutions in each putative core binding site sequence in the context of either the BS45 or the BS67 oligonucleotide (Figure 3B). Analysis of ABD-B binding to the wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides indicated that only mutations in BS5 and BS7 reduced ABD-B binding (Figure 3C). The footprinting of BS4 and BS6 appears then to be a consequence of ABD-B binding to the adjacent bona fide BS5 and BS7. To test whether BS5 and BS7 are required for the function of the CRE in vivo, we introduced mutations into the core sequences of both binding sites within the BE3–6 element (KO[ABD-B]; Figure 3B). Disruption of these sites completely abolished male-specific expression of reporter expression in segments A5 and A6 (compare Figures 3D and 3E), demonstrating that the yellow gene is directly regulated by the ABD-B Hox protein. In order to trace the evolution of ABD-B regulation of yellow expression and make an informative choice of species for further study, we first considered the evolutionary history of male-specific pigmentation in Drosophila. The melanogaster species group includes three major clades: the Oriental lineage (to which D. melanogaster belongs), the montium subgroup, and the ananassae subgroup (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Ancestral character reconstruction indicates that male-specific pigmentation is the most likely ancestral state in the Oriental lineage (posterior probability of dimorphically pigmented ancestor 97% ± 2%; Figure S2) and the melanogaster species group (probability of dimorphic ancestor 84% ± 8%; Figure S2). Furthermore, the male-specific repression of bab expression is widespread throughout all three clades (Kopp et al., 2000Kopp A. Duncan I. Godt D. Carroll S.B. Genetic control and evolution of sexually dimorphic characters in Drosophila.Nature. 2000; 408: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimorphic regulation of bab was present in the common ancestor of the entire melanogaster species group. Most species outside of the melanogaster group, including members of the obscura, willistoni, and saltans groups, do not exhibit male-specific pigmentation of A5 and A6. Thus, male-specific pigmentation appears to have arisen once in the melanogaster species group, and the absence of male-specific pigmentation in species such as D. bipectinata, D. kikkawai, and D. santomea (Figure 4) is due to subsequent losses of the trait. This trait history should be reflected in the molecular genetic architecture of trait formation. The identification of the ABD-B-regulated body CRE of the yellow gene offers the opportunity to trace when ABD-B regulation was gained, or lost, during the evolution of Drosophila lineages. Therefore, we selected several potentially informative species for further study based upon their pigmentation patterns and phylogenetic relationships (Figure 4). These included D. biarmipes, another member of the Oriental lineage that is dimorphically pigmented; D. santomea, D. kikkawai, and D. bipectinata, which represent independent losses of the trait in the Oriental, montium, and ananassae subgroups, respectively; and D. subobscura, a member of the obscura group (the sister clade of the melanogaster species group) that exhibits intense monomorphic pigmentation of all abdominal segments. In order to determine how the function of the body CRE may have changed during Drosophila evolution, we isolated orthologous body CREs from D. santomea, D. kikkawai, D. bipectinata, and D. subobscura; the entire 5′ region of the D. biarmipes yellow gene, which includes the body CRE, was isolated previously (Gompel et al., 2005Gompel N. Prud'homme B. Wittkopp P.J. Kassner V.A. Carroll S.B. Chance caught on the wing: cis-regulatory evolution and the origin of pigment patterns in Drosophila.Nature. 2005; 433: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We then tested CRE activity when linked to the EGFP reporter and transformed into D. melanogaster. Reporter expression driven by the D. biarmipes 5′ region (5′ ybia, Figures 5A and 5F) was sexually dimorphic, as we expected if the D. biarmipes and D. melanogaster body CREs have a common origin and respond to the same transcription factors. Surprisingly, the D. santomea (san body, Figures 5B and 5G) and D. bipectinata (bip body, Figures 5C and 5H) CREs also drove sexually dimorphic expression of EGFP, even though in these species abdominal pigmentation is either monomorphic (D. bipectinata) or absent (D. santomea). These results show that the two elements can still respond to transcriptional regulatory inputs present in D. melanogaster. Indeed, the expression of the san body and bip body reporter constructs responded to the Abd-BMcp mutation (Figures 5L and 5M). Based upon the phylogenetic relationships among these species (Figure 4), the most parsimonious explanation for the shared responsiveness of the D. santomea, D. biarmipes, and D. bipectinata CREs to Abd-B is that the common ancestor of all of these species possessed an ABD-B-responsive CRE and therefore, as we inferred above, was likely to have been dimorphically pigmented. However, while D. kikkawai is descended from the same ancestor, the kik body CRE drives only monomorphic reporter expression (Figures 5D and 5I) and does not respond to ectopic Abd-B activity (Figure 5N). Therefore, the absence of male-specific pigmentation in D. kikkawai could be due to the loss of ABD-B regulation, whereas the losses of pigmentation in D. bipectinata and D. santomea must have a different mechanistic basis. In order to trace the fate of ABD-B regulation of the body CRE in detail, we examined the CREs from these species for ABD-B binding sites, focusing in particular on a region that is shared in all species and contains the functional ABD-B sites identified in D. melanogaster (Figure 6A). When compared to the BS5 and BS7 sequences of D. melanogaster, base substitutions have occurred within these sites in some species (Figure 6A). We tested the effect of sequence divergence on the DNA binding affinity of ABD-B HD protein through EMSA experiments with oligonucleotides containing each binding site. We found that changes in the sequence of BS7, and not BS5, that altered binding by ABD-B were correlated with the divergent function of the CREs when tested in D. melanogaster. For example, BS5 is perfectly conserved between D. kikkawai, D. santomea, and D. melanogaster and differs only at a single base in D. biarmipes (Figure 6A). ABD-B binds to all four of these sequences equally well (Figure 6B, left). However, in D. kikkawai, BS7 contains two base substitutions (Figure 6A) that diminish ABD-B binding (Figure 6B, right). In order to test whether these base changes within the ABD-B binding sites of the D. kikkawai body CRE could account for the loss of male-specific reporter expression in A5 and A6, the TT→CC point mutations were introduced into BS7 of the D. melanogaster BE3–6 element. We found that the mutated CRE completely lacked activity in the abdomen (Figure 6C). Thus, mutation of these sites alone is sufficient to inactivate an otherwise functional element. In order to test whether these substitutions account fully for the unresponsiveness of the D. kikkawai CRE to Abd-B, we also made the reciprocal substitution of the D. melanogaster TT sequence into the CC sites of the D. kikkawai CRE. These substitutions did not restore posterior expression (Figure 6D). This result indicates that other functional sites (e.g., for cofactors) have also diverged in the D. kikkawai CRE, which should be expected if selection for their maintenance has been relaxed. Together, these reciprocal substitutions indicate that mutations in ABD-B BS7 and other sites in the D. kikkawai CRE contributed to the evolutionary loss of ABD-B regulation of this element.

To minimize adaptations during development and potential dominant-negative effects of overexpression, we have combined silencing of endogenous PSD-95 in mature neurons with heterologous expression of specific SAP97 or PSD-95 isoforms. We find that both PSD-95 and SAP97 contain alternative N termini expressing either double cysteines that normally are palmitoylated (α-isoforms) or an L27 domain (β-isoforms). Whereas α-isoforms of PSD-95 and SAP97 influence AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic strength independent of activity, the effects of β-isoforms are regulated by activity in a CaMKII-dependent manner. Importantly, the synaptic effects of the β-isoforms are masked by the endogenous α-isoform of PSD-95. These results demonstrate that the different N termini of the predominant endogenous forms of PSD-95 (α-isoform) and SAP97 (β-isoform) govern their role in regulating synaptic function.

Changes in strength at glutamatergic synapses are considered to be fundamentally important for information processing and storage in the brain. One important mechanism for the regulation of synaptic strength is the synaptic incorporation and retrieval of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), the principal receptors for fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S.

Genetic deletions or loss-of-function mutants of DLG-MAGUK family members, on the other hand, consistently have been found to have minimal effects on basal synaptic transmission. Specifically, genetic knock out of PSD-95 at synapses was reported to have no effect on basal synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, although long-term depression was absent (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. et al.Enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired learning in mice with mutant postsynaptic density-95 protein.Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Similarly, knock out of PSD-93, the only family member normally present in cerebellar Purkinje cells, had no detectable effect on synaptic structure or function in the cerebellum (McGee et al., 2001McGee A.W. Topinka J.R. Hashimoto K. Petralia R.S. Kakizawa S. Kauer F.W. Aguilera-Moreno A. Wenthold R.J. Kano M. Bredt D.S.

Although loss-of-function mutants of SAP97 and Dlg, its Drosophila ortholog, are lethal due to major defects in cell-cell contact formation during embryogenesis (Caruana and Bernstein, 2001Caruana G.

These findings raise the possibility that DLG-MAGUK family members share redundant functions in neurons and loss of one can be partially compensated by other family members. Alternatively, other adaptive processes during synaptogenesis and synapse maturation might compensate for the loss of the normal function of DLG-MAGUKs in basal synaptic transmission. The detailed structures of the various DLG-MAGUKs provide clues as to whether family members are redundant or have functionally distinct roles. All share a common modular structure of five protein-protein interaction domains; specifically, three N-terminal PDZ domains are followed by an SH3 and an enzymatically inactive GK domain (Funke et al., 2005Funke L.

However, SAP97 and PSD-95, the most extensively studied family members, have two important differences. First, they interact with AMPAR subunits via distinct mechanisms: SAP97 appears to directly bind to the AMPAR subunit GluR1 (Cai et al., 2002Cai C. Coleman S.K. Niemi K. Keinanen K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) while PSD-95 requires stargazin to interact with AMPARs (Fukata et al., 2005Fukata Y. Tzingounis A.V. Trinidad J.C. Fukata M.

Second, their N-terminal domains can differ (Cho et al., 1992Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant isoform of PSD-95 has an N-terminal domain, which is palmitoylated and also capable of multimerizing PSD-95 with itself and other MAGUKs with a palmitoylated N terminus, such as PSD-93 (Hsueh et al., 1997Hsueh Y.P.

The palmitoylated N terminus of PSD-95 appears to be particularly important for its synaptic targeting (Craven et al., 1999Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Synaptic targeting of the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 mediated by lipid and protein motifs.Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, SAP97 contains a longer N-terminal L27 domain, capable of heteromultimerization and homomultimerization with itself and other L27 domain-containing proteins, such as CASK (Lee et al., 2002Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. A novel and conserved protein-protein interaction domain of mammalian Lin-2/CASK binds and recruits SAP97 to the lateral surface of epithelia.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although synaptic targeting of SAP97 is thought to be dependent on the presence of the alternatively spliced exon I3, which is localized in the SH3-GK linker (Rumbaugh et al., 2003Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. Synapse-associated protein-97 isoform-specific regulation of surface AMPA receptors and synaptic function in cultured neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the multimerization of SAP97 via its L27 domain has recently been suggested to also be important for mediating its synaptic effects (Nakagawa et al., 2004Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Quaternary structure, protein dynamics, and synaptic function of SAP97 controlled by L27 domain interactions.Neuron. 2004; 44: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a small proportion of PSD-95 in the brain contains an N-terminal L27 domain (Chetkovich et al., 2002Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. Postsynaptic targeting of alternative postsynaptic density-95 isoforms by distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the functions of this isoform have not been examined. To further examine and clarify the roles of PSD-95 and SAP97 in the regulation of basal excitatory synaptic transmission and provide explanations for some of these apparently conflicting results, we have taken a different approach to study the molecular basis of synaptic function. Specifically, we have used a cell-restricted, molecular replacement strategy, in which expression of endogenous PSD-95 is acutely reduced via RNAi and replaced by specific isoforms of the DLG-MAGUK family. Our results suggest that the specific roles of PSD-95 and SAP97 in synaptic function are governed by differences in their N-terminal domains, which impart activity dependence or independence on their function. Both PSD-95 and PSD-93 are expressed in brain with one of two alternative N-terminal domains (Chetkovich et al., 2002Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. Postsynaptic targeting of alternative postsynaptic density-95 isoforms by distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Parker et al., 2004Parker M.J. Zhao S. Bredt D.S. Sanes J.R. Feng G. PSD93 regulates synaptic stability at neuronal cholinergic synapses.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) containing either an N-terminal cysteine doublet that is palmitoylated (Topinka and Bredt, 1998Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. N-terminal palmitoylation of PSD-95 regulates association with cell membranes and interaction with K+ channel Kv1.4.Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or an N-terminal L27 domain, similar to SAP97. To determine whether such alternative N termini are a feature common to all DLG-MAGUK family members, we first searched the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) expressed sequence tag (EST) database. This resulted in the identification of one mouse EST clone (BY131151) that originates from the SAP97 gene and codes for N-terminal double cysteines identical to the α-isoform of PSD-95. We next analyzed the rat gene structures of all four DLG-MAGUKs, PSD-95, PSD-93, SAP97, and SAP102, in more detail to reveal common elements of the gene structures (Figure 1A). For their N-terminal regions, SAP97 and PSD-95 share a common gene structure that contains three β-exons that code for an L27 domain and one α-exon that codes for the cysteine doublet (Figure 1A). Either the β-exons or the α-exon are spliced into the common exon 2. PSD-93 shares a common gene structure with PSD-95 and SAP97 but also has an additional α-exon spliced into exon 2 and three unique alternative N termini coding exons, which are spliced into exon 3 (Figure 1A) (Parker et al., 2004Parker M.J. Zhao S. Bredt D.S. Sanes J.R. Feng G. PSD93 regulates synaptic stability at neuronal cholinergic synapses.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, compared to other DLG-MAGUK family members, the N terminus coding region of SAP102 is unique in that it lacks any of the α- or β-exons that are spliced into exon 2 (Figure 1A). To determine whether SAP97 is indeed transcribed in rat brain with two alternative 5′ sequences, we performed RT-PCR analysis. This confirmed the presence of different species of SAP97 mRNA, one coding for a potentially palmitoylated cysteine pair (SAP97α) and the other coding for an L27 domain (SAP97β) (Figure 1B). Thus both PSD-95 and SAP97, the two most extensively studied DLG-MAGUKs, are present in brain in two isoforms; the α-isoforms contain an N-terminal cysteine doublet that is normally palmitoylated, and the β-isoforms contain an L27 domain. To date, virtually all studies on these proteins have focused only on either the prototypic PSD-95α or the prototypic SAP97β. We were therefore interested in how these domains might underlie differences in the synaptic function of these molecules. Although PSD-95, SAP97, and PSD-93 are known to be expressed in the hippocampus (Sans et al., 2000Sans N. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Blahos 2nd, J. Hell J.W. Wenthold R.J. A developmental change in NMDA receptor-associated proteins at hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), before examining potential functional differences between the α- and β-isoforms of PSD-95 and SAP97, it was important to have some knowledge about their relative abundance. We first expressed GFP-tagged PSD-95α, PSD-93α, and SAP97β in HEK293 cells, and using an anti-GFP antibody, their expression levels were adjusted to provide reference points for the quantification of different DLG-MAGUKs in crude synaptosomal fractions of juvenile hippocampus (Figure 1C, middle panel). An antibody that recognizes both α- and β-isoforms of DLG-MAGUKs detected prominent bands at 95 kDa and 120 kDa, the former representing PSD-95 and the latter, according to its size, SAP97β (Figure 1C, left panel). To determine whether DLG-MAGUK family members other than PSD-95 might contribute to the 95 kDa band, we examined extracts from PSD-95 knockout mice and found no DLG-MAGUK close to this molecular weight (Figure 1C, right panel). Thus, PSD-95 and SAP97β appear to be the only DLG-MAGUKs with either a palmitoylated N terminus or an L27 domain detectable in the hippocampus by Western blotting. Although this analysis did not allow independent measurement of the α- and β-isoforms of PSD-95, previous work has found that the majority of brain PSD-95 is the α-isoform, with only ∼10% of brain PSD-95 being the β-isoform with an N-terminal L27 domain (Chetkovich et al., 2002Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. Postsynaptic targeting of alternative postsynaptic density-95 isoforms by distinct mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that the single band at 95 kDa represents PSD-95α, this indicates that PSD-95α was far more abundant than SAP97β, the levels of which were ∼16% of PSD-95α levels in the hippocampus. There are striking inconsistencies between the synaptic effects of overexpressing PSD-95, which greatly enhances basal synaptic transmission (Beique and Andrade, 2003Beique J.C. Andrade R.

USA. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), versus genetically deleting it, which has minimal effects on synaptic strength (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. et al.Enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired learning in mice with mutant postsynaptic density-95 protein.Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). To examine the synaptic function of the different isoforms of PSD-95 and SAP97, we therefore reasoned it would be advantageous to express them in cells in which endogenous PSD-95 was acutely reduced. This approach minimizes compensatory adaptations due to the lack of PSD-95 during synaptogenesis and synapse maturation and, in addition, opens the possibility of analyzing the function of heterologously expressed constructs without the necessity of a dominant effect as required by a standard overexpression approach. To accomplish this task, we constructed a dual promoter lentiviral vector in which the human H1 promoter drove expression of a shRNA to PSD-95, while an ubiquitin promoter simultaneously drove expression of GFP or a GFP-fusion protein (Figure 1D). The shRNA to PSD-95 (sh95) was highly effective in silencing heterologous PSD-95 expression in HEK293 cells (data not shown) as well as endogenous PSD-95 when introduced into dissociated cortical cultures using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer (Figure 1E). Indeed, Western blot analysis showed that endogenous PSD-95 expression could be silenced efficiently when examined over a week after infection (Figure 1E). Furthermore, immunocytochemical examination of endogenous PSD-95 in cells expressing sh95 revealed no detectable puncta (data not shown). To allow for expression of recombinant PSD-95 in the same cells expressing sh95, silent mutations were introduced into the sh95-targeted region of the GFP-tagged PSD-95 cDNA (Figure 1D). In cortical cultures infected with this lentivirus, endogenous PSD-95 is efficiently silenced, whereas the recombinant GFP-tagged protein is expressed at levels comparable to cultures infected with a lentivirus lacking the shRNA expression cassette (Figure 1E). These results demonstrate that endogenous PSD-95 in neurons can be efficiently knocked down and replaced by a recombinant protein using this bicistronic lentiviral expression system. To investigate the acute effect of knocking down endogenous PSD-95 on AMPAR EPSCs, we injected concentrated sh95-expressing lentivirus into the CA1 cell body layer of hippocampal slice cultures the day after plating. GFP expression in individual cells could be detected as early as two days after infection. This allowed us to make simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from an infected and neighboring uninfected cell while stimulating the same Schaffer collateral axons (Figure 1F). Consistent with a previous study (Nakagawa et al., 2004Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Quaternary structure, protein dynamics, and synaptic function of SAP97 controlled by L27 domain interactions.Neuron. 2004; 44: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), AMPAR EPSCs were reduced on average by 35%–45% in cells expressing sh95 (n = 181 pairs) (Figures 2A–2C). The magnitude of the reduction in AMPAR EPSCs was examined at three different time points from 3 to 8 days after infection and was not significantly different (Figures 2B and 2C), demonstrating that the synaptic effect of silencing PSD-95 is constant over this time period. In contrast to the clear effects on AMPAR EPSCs, NMDAR EPSCs were not significantly affected by acute reduction of PSD-95 (n = 149 pairs) (Figure 2C). Consistent with these results, the ratio of AMPAR EPSCs to NMDAR EPSCs was significantly reduced in cells expressing sh95 (n = 145 pairs) (Figure 2D). The lack of effect of sh95 on NMDAR EPSCs is important not only because it supports a specific role for PSD-95 in AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, but also because it rules out the possibility that the lentivirus-mediated expression of this shRNA had some nonspecific deleterious effect on cell or synapse health. As an additional control, an ineffective shRNA to PSD-95 was expressed and had no detectable effect on either AMPAR or NMDAR EPSCs (n = 15 pairs, p > 0.05). Overexpression of PSD-95 during synaptogenesis modulates presynaptic maturation (El-Husseini et al., 2000El-Husseini A.E. Schnell E. Chetkovich D.M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. PSD-95 involvement in maturation of excitatory synapses.Science. 2000; 290: 1364-1368PubMed Google Scholar), and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses, a measure of presynaptic function, was altered in PSD-95 knockout mice (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. et al.Enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired learning in mice with mutant postsynaptic density-95 protein.Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine the PPR in cells expressing sh95. In contrast to these previous results, however, acute knockdown of PSD-95 had no detectable effect on the PPR (n = 16 pairs) (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus there are at least two differences in the synaptic consequences of acutely reducing PSD-95 with shRNA versus genetically deleting it: the acute knockdown of PSD-95 depresses AMPAR EPSCs but has no detectable effect on presynaptic function, while knocking out PSD-95 leaves basal synap"

We show here a role for p120 catenin (p120ctn) in regulating spine and synapse formation in the developing mouse brain. p120catenin gene deletion in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo resulted in reduced spine and synapse densities along dendrites. In addition, p120 catenin loss resulted in reduced cadherin levels and misregulation of Rho-family GTPases, with decreased Rac1 and increased RhoA activity. Analyses in vitro indicate that the reduced spine density reflects aberrant Rho-family GTPase signaling, whereas the effects on spine maturation appear to result from reduced cadherin levels and possibly aberrant Rho-family GTPase signaling. Thus, p120ctn acts as a signal coordinator between cadherins and Rho-family GTPases to regulate cytoskeletal changes required during spine and synapse development."

Using timelapse microscopy, we have developed a new assay to analyze the dynamics of DNA replication both spatially and temporally in individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. This allowed us to visualize replication factories, nuclear foci consisting of replication proteins where the bulk of DNA synthesis occurs. We show that the formation of replication factories is a consequence of DNA replication itself. Our analyses of replication at specific DNA sequences support a long-standing hypothesis that sister replication forks generated from the same origin stay associated with each other within a replication factory while the entire replicon is replicated. This assay system allows replication to be studied at extremely high temporal resolution in individual cells, thereby opening a window into how replication dynamics vary from cell to cell."

The molecular mechanisms by which palindromes can cause gene amplification are largely unknown. Using yeast as a model system, we found that hairpin-capped double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurring at the location of human Alu-quasipalindromes lead to the formation of intrachromosomal amplicons with large inverted repeats (equivalent to homogeneously staining regions in mammalian chromosomes) or extrachromosomal palindromic molecules (equivalent to double minutes [DM] in mammalian cells). We demonstrate that the specific outcomes of gene amplification depend on the applied selection, the nature of the break, and the chromosomal location of the amplified gene relative to the site of the hairpin-capped DSB.

Extrachromosomal amplicons or double minutes (DM) have up to several hundred copies of a genomic segment and form mini-chromosomes with inverted symmetry. Intrachromosomal amplicons, also described as abnormally banded or homogeneously staining regions (HSR), are head-to-tail or tail-to-tail tandem repeats, which have ten or fewer copies at early stages of amplification. Some gene amplifications are accompanied by aneuploidy, deletions, or translocations (Albertson et al., 2003Albertson D.G. Collins C. McCormick F. Gray J.W.

In addition, in human and rodent cells, chromosomal regions containing fragile sites, which are natural hot spots for breakage and recombination, are highly susceptible to amplification and are found to frame the early amplicons (reviewed in Debatisse and Malfor, 2005Debatisse M.

The stability of broken ends of chromosomes in Zea mays.Genetics. 1941; 26: 234-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the most popular model to explain intrachromosomal amplification. In cancer cells, HSRs are often organized as an inverted ladder associated with a deletion that spans from the amplicon toward a telomere (Debatisse and Malfor, 2005Debatisse M. Malfor B. Gene amplification mechanisms.in: Nigg E.A. Genome Instability in Cancer Development. Springer, Netherlands2005: 343-361Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). According to the BFB model, such a complex rearrangement results from the following repeating cycle: an initial DSB; replication of the broken molecule; fusion of sister chromatids; formation of a bridge during anaphase; and asymmetrical breakage due to mechanical tension, which generates one chromatid with an inverted repeat at the broken end. Although the fusion of broken chromatids has not yet been directly demonstrated, this step seems likely because mammalian cells have a robust nonhomologous end joining machinery. Anaphase bridges are often observed in cells undergoing gene amplification, implicating BFB cycles during this process (Coquelle et al., 1997Coquelle A. Pipiras E. Toledo F. Buttin G. Debatisse M.

In addition, end-to-end chromosome fusions are well documented in cells with telomere dysfunction due to the recognition of unprotected chromosome ends as DSBs (Chan and Blackburn, 2004Chan S.R.

DNA palindromes are abundant in human cancer cells and often colocalize with the chromosomal regions that are predisposed to gene amplification (Tanaka et al., 2005Tanaka H. Bergstrom D.A. Yao M.C.

Genet. 2005; 37: 320-327Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Palindromic sequences are implicated in early steps of gene amplification and are hot spots for other types of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) in many organisms (Fried et al., 1991Fried M.

Repeat expansion by homologous recombination in the mouse germ line at palindromic sequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8326-8333Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar and references therein). However, the molecular mechanisms by which palindromes cause GCRs in eukaryotic genomes are poorly understood. Previous studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that a quasipalindrome comprised of two human Alu repeats induces DSBs terminated by covalently closed hairpins. Unprocessed DSBs lead to the formation of acentric and dicentric rearranged molecules characterized by inverted symmetry (Lobachev et al., 2002Lobachev K.S. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. The Mre11 complex is required for repair of hairpin-capped double-strand breaks and prevention of chromosome rearrangements.Cell. 2002; 108: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the fate of these rearranged intermediates and determined how they can be directed into chromosomal aberrations. We have found that chromosomal arm loss and extrachromosomal and intrachromosomal gene amplification events are different consequences of the hairpin-capped breaks. Using the yeast model system, we define a novel, palindrome-dependent pathway of gene amplification that can mimic the formation of oncogene amplicons in humans. To characterize the GCRs that result from secondary structure-mediated DSBs, we developed an experimental system based on the loss of the CAN1 and ADE2 genes and the amplification of CUP1 and SFA1 genes located on chromosome V (Figure 1). Two sets of haploid yeast strains were constructed where the left arm of chromosome V in the region of the CAN1 gene was modified. A LYS2 cassette containing homologous and homeologous inverted or direct Alu repeats was placed centromere-proximal to CAN1, such that the region between LYS2 and the telomere does not contain essential genes and can be deleted. The Alu repeats are 320 bp long and separated by a 12 bp spacer. One hundred percent, ninety four percent, and eighty six percent identical inverted Alu repeats (Alu-IR) were used as a source of hairpin-capped breaks (Lobachev et al., 2000Lobachev K.S. Stenger J.E. Kozyreva O.G. Jurka J. Gordenin D.A.

As a control, 100% identical direct Alu repeats that cannot form a secondary structure were inserted at the same chromosomal location. The ADE2 gene was moved telomere-distal to CAN1, while CUP1 and SFA1 genes were positioned either telomere-proximal (Figure 1, TP strains) or telomere-distal (Figure 1, TD strains) to CAN1. This system allows for selection of two types of GCRs. First, a hairpin-capped break can cause deletion of the chromosome V region, including CAN1 and ADE2, resulting in canavanine-resistant red colonies (CanRAde-). Second, breakage at the location of the inverted repeat can cause amplification of the telomere-proximal or telomere-distal regions, including CUP1 (encoding copper chelatin) and SFA1 (encoding formaldehyde dehydrogenase) genes that serve as convenient gene dosage markers (Resnick et al., 1990Resnick M.A. Westmoreland J.

Expression cassettes for formaldehyde and fluoroacetate resistance, two dominant markers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1997; 13: 551-559Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Clones carrying amplified CUP1 are initially selected on medium containing a high concentration of copper, and copper-resistant colonies (CuR) are replica plated onto media with a high concentration of formaldehyde, which selects for amplification of SFA1. The rates of GCRs were scored in strains carrying homologous or homeologous Alu-IRs and in a control strain with direct repeated Alu sequences. The rate of CAN1 region loss was nearly 25,000-fold higher in strains containing 100% homologous inverted repeats than in control strains with direct repeats (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The majority of CanRAde- colonies were small in size (Figure 2A). Forty to sixty percent of the cells in these colonies were “large budded,” suggesting ongoing DNA damage in these isolates (Figure 2B). These colonies, when subcultured, gave rise to both small and normal colonies (Figure 2C). For small-sized colonies, ethidium bromide-stained CHEF gels showed that chromosome V was undetectable or had diminished intensity (data not shown), but multiple bands of different sizes (Figure 2D; I-S1 and I-S2 isolates) were revealed by hybridization with the chromosome V-specific probe. In each of the derived normal-sized colonies, a discrete band was detected (Figure 2D; I-1 to I-12 isolates). The cells in these colonies were morphologically normal (data not shown). These results suggest that arm-loss events lead to the generation of a mixed population of cells carrying unhealed broken chromosome Vs. These broken chromosomes are detected by DNA-damage checkpoints, resulting in the characteristic G2/M arrest phenotype. In the small colonies, the lack of a single species of healed chromosome also results in the absence of a discrete chromosome V band. Subsequent repair of the broken molecules leads to the formation of rearranged chromosomes (as described below) and recovery from the arrest, resulting in normal-sized colonies. Most of the rearranged chromosome Vs in CanRAde- normal-sized isolates were equal to or larger than the unrearranged chromosome V. This result suggests that the loss of the 42 kb telomeric region adjacent to the DSB site was accompanied by a gain of genetic material from elsewhere (right panel in Figure 2D). To determine the structure of GCRs in these strains, we examined genomic DNA from 18 independent CanRAde- isolates using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on microarrays (Figure 2E). Based on the CGH and CHEF data, four classes of GCRs were identified. Class I (I-9) had a chromosome V that was about 40 kb smaller than the wild-type (Figure 2D) and had a terminal deletion of V with a breakpoint near the CAN1 locus (Figure 2E). This pattern can result from a DSB near the Alu-IR, followed by resection of the broken end and de novo addition of telomeric sequences. The initiating DSB for I-9 and all of the other rearrangements is likely to reflect processing of an extruded cruciform containing the Alu repeats (Figure 3). In class II isolates (I-4, I-7, I-10, I-11, I-13, I-14, I-18) chromosome V had a deletion of the region of centromere-distal to CAN1 and a duplication of about 30 kb located centromere-proximal to CAN1 (Figure 2E). In six of the seven class II isolates, chromosome V was slightly smaller than the wild-type V, suggesting that the duplication of 30 kb is within chromosome V, since the duplication of 30 kb compensates for the deletion of 40 kb. For six of the seven class II isolates, the duplication breakpoint is within a region of about 1 kb containing YELWdelta1, YELWdelta2, and PAU2 (a repetitive sequence found near most telomeres; Rachidi et al., 2000Rachidi N. Martinez M.J. Barre P. Blondin B. Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAU genes are induced by anaerobiosis.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1421-1430Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As in class I, the likely initiating event for the class II isolates is a DSB at the extruded Alu cruciform, followed by replication of the resulting hairpin-capped molecule, generating a dicentric chromosome (Figure 3). The frequent involvement of the repetitive elements in the resulting rearrangement in the class II isolates as well as in classes III and IV (see below) might indicate that the dicentric breaks preferentially near the region of the chromosome with the delta elements and PAU2. A more likely alternative, however, is that the position of the anaphase break is random, but the subsequent resection of the DSB end continues until repetitive sequences are exposed. The resulting broken end is either capped by de novo telomere addition or repaired by break-induced replication (BIR) (Malkova et al., 1996Malkova A. Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Double-strand break repair in the absence of RAD51 in yeast: a possible role for break-induced DNA replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 7131-7136Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar) utilizing PAU2-related or delta-related repeats located near the telomeres of other chromosomes (Figure 3). It is interesting to note that GCRs in other studies frequently involve repetitive elements such as delta elements (Lemoine et al., 2005Lemoine F.J. Degtyareva N.P. Lobachev K. Petes T.D.

Structural analysis of aberrant chromosomes that occur spontaneously in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae: retrotransposon Ty1 plays a crucial role in chromosomal rearrangements.Genetics. 2002; 160: 97-110Google Scholar). In most of the class III isolates (I-1, I-2, I-6, I-8, I-12, I-15, I-17), there was a 30 kb duplication adjacent to the deletion, as for class II isolates. In addition, a region of variable size on the right arm of chromosome V was duplicated. In the isolate shown in Figure 2E (I-12), the duplicated region was about 130 kb, with a breakpoint near YERCTy1-1; three other class III isolates (I-6, I-8, and I-17) shared this breakpoint. In two other isolates (I-2 and I-15), the duplicated region was at YERCTy1-2. Thus, one simple way of explaining most of the class III isolates is that the delta elements near the breakpoint of the 30 kb duplication (YELWdelta1 and YELWdelta2) initiate a BIR event with a delta or Ty element located on the right arm of chromosome V (Figure 3). In class IV isolates, a deletion of the sequences centromere-distal to CAN1 is adjacent to a duplication of 30 kb (I-3) or 100 kb (I-5 and I-16); both of these breakpoints are near delta elements (YELdelta1,2 and YELdelta4-6, respectively). In addition, in these isolates, duplications of sequences derived from another chromosome were observed: chromosome XII in I-3 and I-5 and chromosome VIII in I-16 (shown in Figure 2E). The breakpoints of the duplications on the other chromosomes are near delta elements (delta elements 9-12 on chromosome XII for I-3, delta elements 18 and 19 for I-5, and delta elements 10 and 11 for I-16). The simplest explanation of these strains is that the delta elements at the breakpoints of chromosome V were involved in a BIR event using delta elements on another chromosome. PCR was used to confirm the structure of GCRs in one class III isolate (I-6) and two class IV isolates (I-3 and I-16) (Figures S1A and S1B). CHEF gel analysis and Southern blots were also carried out for the class IV isolates using probes for MET6 and the translocation donor chromosome (Figure S1C). Previous studies demonstrated BIR events involving very large duplications (Malkova et al., 1996Malkova A. Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Double-strand break repair in the absence of RAD51 in yeast: a possible role for break-induced DNA replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 7131-7136Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and nonreciprocal translocations mediated by transposable elements (Lemoine et al., 2005Lemoine F.J. Degtyareva N.P. Lobachev K.

Chromosomal translocations in yeast induced by low levels of DNA polymerase a model for chromosome fragile sites.Cell. 2005; 120: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The model shown in Figure 3 predicts that the intrachromosomal duplication at the left end of chromosome V in class II, III, and IV isolates will form a large (30–100 kb) quasipalindrome with the inverted Alu repeats in the middle. This prediction was confirmed in two ways. First, DNA fiber fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular combing (Conti et al., 2001Conti C. Caburet S. Schurra C. Bensimon A. Molecular combing.in: Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 8.10.11-18.10.23Google Scholar) were used to examine the DNA of one class II isolate (I-7), three class III isolates (I-6, I-8, and I-12), and two class IV isolates (I-5 and I-10). Two 14 kb chromosomal DNA regions centromere-proximal to the Alu repeats (positions shown in Figure 2F) were PCR amplified and used as probes for this analysis. One fragment was labeled with biotin-tagged dUTP and the other with digoxigenin-tagged dUTP. Chromosomal DNA from each strain was stretched on siliconized cover slips and hybridized to the labeled probes, and the probes were detected with green and red fluorescent-conjugated antibodies to biotin or digoxigenin, respectively. Each isolate had a palindromic pattern (shown in Figure 2F for I-8), in which a green region was flanked by two red regions approximately half the size of the green region. The structure was also confirmed by Southern analysis (Figure S2). In summary, these results show that hairpin-capped breaks primarily induce GCRs that have a very specific pattern: terminal deletion coupled with an adjacent inverted duplication (large quasipalindromes). This pattern of chromosomal rearrangements is different from GCR events that result from spontaneous or damage-induced breaks analyzed in other yeast studies where CAN1 was used as a reporter (Myung and Kolodner, 2003Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Induction of genome instability by DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 243-258Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Putnam et al., 2005Putnam C.D.

Biol. 2005; 25: 7226-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and references therein). The GCRs described above were compared with GCRs in 12 CanRAde- clones isolated from a control strain with direct Alu repeats. Chromosome V structure was determined in these 12 clones by CHEF gel analysis, Southern blot hybridization (Figure 2D), CGH (Figure S3), and DNA combing (Figure S3). This analysis identified four classes of rearrangements involving the left arm of chromosome V. In contrast to the GCR isolates from strains with inverted Alus, most (8 of 12) of the isolates obtained from strains with directly repeated Alus had terminal deletions of the left arm of chromosome V (including the CAN1 region) with no associated duplication (top panel in Figure S3A). In such isolates (D-1, D-2, D-3, D-5, D-8, D-9, D-10, D-12), it is likely that the deleted chromosome is capped by a telomere. One of the isolates (D-7) had a 20 kb interstitial deletion (second panel from the top in Figure S3A). The remaining three isolates resemble class II and class III isolates from strains with the inverted Alu repeats. D-6 and D-11 had a duplication of about 30 kb adjacent to a terminal deletion of about 40 kb (third panel from top in Figure S3A) and D-4 had a terminal deletion, an adjacent duplication of 30 kb, and a duplication of about 130 kb from the right arm of chromosome V near YERCTy1-1. Molecular combing showed that the 30 kb duplications in D-4, D-6, and D-11 were inverted repeats (D-6 in Figure S3B). How are inverted repeats generated from yeast strains with direct Alu repeats? It is possible that a spontaneous DSB centromere-proximal to CAN1 triggers the resection of the broken end. The processed single-strand end can fold back on itself (utilizing very short inverted repeats), priming DNA synthesis to form a dicentric in an intramolecular reaction (Rattray et al., 2005Rattray A.J. Shafer B.K. Neelam B. Strathern J.N. A mechanism of palindromic gene amplification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that large inverted duplications are approximately 105-fold more frequent in strains with inverted Alu repeats than with direct Alu repeats. Table S2 summarizes the data on the CanRAde- isolates derived from strains with the direct and inverted Alu repeats. Since hairpin-capped breaks at Alu-IRs often generate GCRs with 30 or 100 kb quasipalindromes, we hypothesized that these large quasipalindromes could also cause hairpin-capped DSBs that would trigger a new round of chromosome V rearrangements. We observed previously that one phenotypic manifestation of hairpin-capped DSBs is the occurrence of small colonies containing a high percentage of large-budded cells. Thus, we used these criteria to follow the fate of the individual palindromes by isolating on nonselective medium-small, non-petite, colonies in the progeny of CanRAde- clones. Depending on the GCR isolate, the frequency of the occurrence of the small colonies varied from 1% to 10%. The structure of chromosome V in normal-sized colonies derived from small colonies was assessed by CHEF analysis, Southern blot with MET6, and CGH (Figure 4). The results showed that chromosome V containing a 30 kb quasipalindrome with added telomeric sequences at the end can give rise to differently-sized chromosomes that have either changed the length of the qua"
https://openalex.org/W1969367585,"Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the genome complement, producing haploid gametes/spores from diploid cells. Proper separation of homologous chromosomes at the first meiotic division requires the production of physical connections (chiasmata) between homologs through recombinational exchange of chromosome arms after sister-chromatid cohesion is established but before chromosome segregation takes place. The events of meiotic prophase must thus occur in a strictly temporal order, but the molecular controls coordinating these events have not been well elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the budding yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 directly regulates the formation of the DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination by phosphorylating the Mer2/Rec107 protein and thereby modulating interactions of Mer2 with other proteins required for break formation. We propose that this function of Cdc28 helps to coordinate the events of meiotic prophase with each other and with progression through prophase."

We report that DEK, a chromatin- and RNA-associated protein mutated or overexpressed in certain cancers, enforces 3′ splice site discrimination by U2AF. DEK phosphorylated at serines 19 and 32 associates with U2AF 35 , facilitates the U2AF 35 -AG interaction and prevents binding of U2AF 65 to pyrimidine tracts not followed by AG.

Activation of the initiator caspases represents the key event in the apoptotic process. Different from the effector caspase activation, the intrachain cleavage only modestly enhances the catalytic activities of the initiator caspases. Rather, initiator caspase activation involves adaptor protein-mediated oligomerization. For example, caspase-8 activation involves FADD-mediated recruitment of procaspase-8 to plasma membrane death receptors resulting in proximity-induced dimerization and autocatalytic activation (Boatright et al., 2003Boatright K.M.

Thus, CC binding to Apaf-1 represents the most apical and critical event in apoptosome formation and caspase activation. In cell-free reconstitution experiments, μM to low-mM concentrations of (d)ATP are added to cell lysates, together with CC, to initiate caspase-9 activation (Cain et al., 2000Cain K. Bratton S.B.

Therefore, it is unclear how physiological levels of nucleotides affect CC-initiated caspase activation in vivo (i.e., in the cells). Here we show that intracellular nucleotides as well as many nucleotide derivatives exert a strong inhibitory effect on the CC-initiated apoptosome formation by directly binding to CC and inhibiting the interaction of CC with Apaf-1. As microinjection of nucleotides inhibits whereas experimentally reducing NTP pools enhances both CC and apoptotic stimuli-induced cell death, our results suggest that nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives, in addition to their well-established roles in nucleic acid synthesis, energy metabolism, biosynthesis regulation, and signal transduction, also function as physiological prosurvival factors. To determine the effects of intracellular nucleotides on caspase activation, we isolated fresh cytosol (S100) from GM701 human fibroblasts. Addition of CC, without exogenous (d)ATP, to the fresh cytosol initiated a time-dependent processing of procaspase-9 to p35/37 and procaspase-3 to p24/20/17, along with the expected increases in enzymatic activity (Figures 1A and 1B). Similar results were obtained from various cancer and primary cells (Figure S1). Since (d)ATP is essential for the CC-initiated apoptosome formation and caspase activation in cell-free reconstitution experiments (Jiang and Wang, 2000Jiang X. Wang X. Cytochrome c promotes caspase-9 activation by inducing nucleotide binding to Apaf-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31199-31203Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, Li et al., 1997Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cytochrome c and dATP-dependent formation of Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex initiates an apoptotic protease cascade.Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5991) Google Scholar), the above results suggest that freshly purified cytosols may contain sufficient amounts of nucleotides to assist in the CC-initiated caspase activation. Indeed, direct measurements of (d)NTP levels in six tumor cell lines and three primary cell strains revealed that these cells had ATP levels of 1.5–5 mM, and they possessed an NTP pool of ∼3–7 mM and a dNTP pool of ∼10–80 μM (Table S1). Most surprisingly, when we added different amounts of dATP, together with CC, to the fresh cytosol, we observed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of dATP on the CC-initiated caspase activation. Western blot (Figure 1C) and caspase activity (Figure 1D) revealed that the inhibition occurred at 1 mM, became obvious at 2 mM, and was complete at 5 mM. Similar inhibitory effects of dATP were observed using cytosols freshly prepared from various cancer or primary cells (Figure S1). Other nucleotides such as ATP also inhibited CC-initiated caspase activation (Figures 1E and 1F). Like (d)ATP, all other (d)NTPs [(deoxy)ribonucleotide triphosphates; see Figure S2 for general structures] also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the CC-initiated caspase activation (Figures 1G and S3A). The inhibitory effects of (d)ATP were unlikely due to Na+ salts (Cain et al., 2001Cain K. Langlais C. Sun X.M. Brown D.G. Cohen G.M. Physiological concentrations of K+ inhibit cytochrome c-dependent formation of the apoptosome.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41985-41990Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) contained in the nucleotide preparations, as their Tris forms demonstrated equipotent effects (Figure S3B). Moreover, pure NaCl did not exert an inhibitory effect until 75–150 mM (Figure S3B, lane 13; data not shown). Pooled nucleotides comprising equimolar concentrations of individual nucleotides similarly showed a dose-dependent inhibition on the CC-initiated caspase activation (Figure S3C). The inhibitory effects of (d)NTPs were independent of hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds as three nonhydrolyzable analogs (ATPγS, AMP-PCP, and AMP-PNP) inhibited caspase-9 and -3 processing as efficiently as (d)ATP (Figure 1H, lanes 4–6 versus lane 3). All (d)NDPs [(deoxy)ribonucleotide diphosphates] except for dADP and dGDP also inhibited the CC-initiated caspase activation (Figures 1H and S3A, data not shown). dADP and dGDP did show an inhibitory effect but only at higher (∼10 mM) concentrations (not shown). By contrast, none of the (d)NMPs [(deoxy)ribonucleotide monophosphates] demonstrated any inhibitory effect (Figure 1H). Apart from (d)NTPs or (d)NDPs, the major coenzymes, NAD, NADP, FAD, Co-A, nucleotide analogs, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP; the most important precursor to nucleotide synthesis), all showed inhibitory effects (Figures S2, S3D, and S3F). By contrast, several abundant nucleotide intermediates such as UDP-glucose (precursor of glycogen), CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DG; precursor of phosphoglycerides), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; activated methyl-group donor), nucleoside analogs, D- or L-ribose, and ribose-phosphate did not show any inhibitory effect (Figures S2, S3D, S3E, and S3F). Caspase-9 activation involves Apaf-1 oligomerization/apoptosome formation followed by sequential recruitment and activation of caspase-9 and -3 (Bratton et al., 2001Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Recruitment, activation and retention of caspases-9 and -3 by Apaf-1 apoptosome and associated XIAP complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To determine at which step nucleotides exert the inhibitory effect, we preincubated fresh cytosol with CC for different periods of time and then added dATP. The inhibitory effects of dATP on caspase-9 and -3 processing were progressively lost when dATP was added later in time (Figure 2A). By contrast, coaddition of CC and dATP (5 mM), or preaddition of dATP followed by CC addition to the cytosol, completely inhibited the CC-initiated caspase processing (not shown). Since IAPs, and in particular, XIAP, bind to and inhibit caspase activity, we immunodepleted the fresh GM701 cytosol of XIAP (Figure 2B) and then used it in reconstitution experiments. We observed that ATP similarly inhibited the CC-induced caspase processing (Figure 2C). Since IAPs other than XIAP also bind to active caspases and inhibit their activity, we included in the reaction mixture the recombinant, functionally active Smac protein, which relieves the caspase inhibitory effects of all IAPs. As shown in Figure 2D, Smac did not affect the inhibitory effect of ATP on the CC-initiated caspase-9 and -3 processing. These results (Figures 2A–2D) suggest that the inhibitory effect of nucleotides is not mediated through IAPs but rather through direct interference of apoptosome formation/function. To test this possibility, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in the presence or absence of dATP. The anti-CC antibody pulled down nearly all Apaf-1 in the absence of dATP (Figure 2E). By contrast, in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of dATP, much less Apaf-1 was coprecipitated by anti-CC antibody (Figure 2E, lanes 4 and 5). The anti-CC antibody did not pull down caspase-9 or caspase-3 (Figure 2E). Co-IP using anti-caspase-9 antibody precipitated Apaf-1 from the CC-activated cytosol but little Apaf-1 was precipitated down in the presence of dATP (Figure 2F). The anti-caspase-9 antibody did not pull down caspase-3 (Figure 2F), as previously shown (Bratton et al., 2001Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S.M. Sun X.M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Recruitment, activation and retention of caspases-9 and -3 by Apaf-1 apoptosome and associated XIAP complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Reciprocal co-IP with anti-Apaf-1 antibody pulled down caspase-9 in the absence of dATP but not in its presence (Figure 2G). As expected, the Apaf-1 antibody did not bring down caspase-3 (Figure 2G) and the control antibody, Rb IgG, did not precipitate any molecule (Figure 2H). Finally, Apaf-1 IP, using cytosol that had been subjected to 1 hr preincubation with CC, coprecipitated processed caspase-9 (p37/35) as well as processed caspase-3 (p20) in the absence but not in the presence of dATP (Figure 2I). If 5 mM dATP inhibits the CC interaction with Apaf-1, it should also inhibit Apaf-1 oligomerization, which was revealed by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography experiments (Figure 3A). In control cytosol, Apaf-1 eluted as monomeric protein with a relative molecular mass of ∼158 kDa and procaspase-9 and -3 eluted as unprocessed zymogens (Figure 3A). In the CC-activated cytosol, most of the Apaf-1 eluted as an ∼700 kDa complex and procaspase-9 was completely processed to p37/35, which were associated with the complex or as the free processed form (Figure 3A). Caspase-processing activity (CPA) of the ∼700 kDa apoptosome complex (Figure 3B, fractions 10–15) also demonstrated its functional activity. The processed caspase-3 (p20/17) eluted mostly as free form (Figure 3A), which coeluted with all the DEVDase activity (Figure 3B). Presence of dATP (5 mM) in the CC-activated cytosol completely prevented formation of the ∼700 kDa oligomeric active Apaf-1 complex and caspase processing and activation (Figures 3A and 3B). To provide the most direct evidence that high concentrations of nucleotides inhibit the CC-Apaf-1 interaction and subsequent Apaf-1 oligomerization, we used the baculovirus expression system to generate recombinant Apaf-1 XL (Apaf-1 for short), which has additional WD-40 repeats and is highly active in initiating apoptosome formation (Benedict et al., 2000Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. Expression and functional analysis of Apaf-1 isoforms. Extra WD-40 repeat is required for cytochrome c binding and regulated activation of procaspase-9.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Far Western analysis showed that 5 mM ATP directly inhibited CC binding to recombinant Apaf-1 immobilized on the PVDF membrane (Figure 4A). Subsequently, we carried out reconstitution experiments using recombinant Apaf-1 and in vitro-translated (IVT), 35S-labeled procaspase-9. Coincubation of Apaf-1, procaspase-9, and CC in the absence of nucleotides did not result in caspase-9 processing (Figure 4B, lane 1; Figure 4C, lane 3). Inclusion of 0.5–1 mM of dATP (Figure 4B, lane 2; Figure 4C, lanes 4 and 5) or ATP (Figure 4C, lane 9), but not dGTP (Figure 4C, lane 13), GTP (Figure 4C, lane 18), or other nucleotides (not shown), in the reaction led to caspase-9 processing. However, increasing amounts of dATP (Figure 4C, lanes 6–8), ATP (lanes 10–12), dGTP (lanes 15–17), or GTP (lanes 20–22) clearly inhibited CC/Apaf-1/dATP-mediated processing of caspase-9. Similarly, other nucleotides such as dADP (Figure 4B, lanes 12–14), ADP (Figure 4B, lanes 15 and 16), nucleotide intermediates such as ADP-ribose (Figure 4B, lanes 3–6), and nucleotide analogs such as 8-NH2-ATP and 2-Cl-ATP (Figure 4B, lanes 17–20) also inhibited apoptosome-induced caspase-9 activation at higher concentrations. Interestingly, cyclic ADP-ribose (Figure S2P) did not inhibit caspase-9 processing (Figure 4B, lanes 7–10). To determine whether the inhibition of apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 processing, in this pure recombinant system, was associated with hindrance in Apaf-1 oligomerization or inhibition of caspase-9 autoprocessing, we evaluated the CC-induced Apaf-1 oligomerization in the presence of a low versus high concentration of ATP. As shown in Figure 4D, although 0.5 mM ATP induced robust Apaf-1 oligomerization leading to the formation of ∼700 kDa active apoptosome complex, 5 mM ATP abrogated the CC-initiated Apaf-1 oligomerization. It is well known that CC interaction with its natural redox partners in the respiratory chain (i.e., CC reductase and CC oxidase) involves electrostatic interactions. Therefore, it was possible that physiological levels of nucleotides might directly bind CC via electrostatic interactions and consequently prevent CC from binding to Apaf-1. If this were the case, nucleotides should not demonstrate significant inhibitory effects on caspase activation initiated by an Apaf-1 mutant that does not bind CC but still retains the ability to activate caspase-9. We tested this postulate by using Apaf-543 (i.e., the aa 1–543 fragment; courtesy of S. Kornbluth), an Apaf-1 mutant that lacks the WD-40 domain. As shown in Figure S4A, the Apaf-543 (but not Apaf-1 CARD domain) initiated caspase-9 activation without requiring CC, consistent with earlier observations (Srinivasula et al., 1998Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Autoactivation of procaspase-9 by Apaf-1-mediated oligomerization.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ATP at up to 10 mM only slightly inhibited the caspase-9 activation initiated by Apaf-543 (Figure S4A). To prospectively identify the potential amino acid residues on the CC that mediate nucleotide binding, we employed the sensitive matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) approach. The results revealed a concentration-dependent increase in ATP (mass = 506 ± 4 Da) binding to CC (12,231 Da), with 1–3 ATP molecules (CC + 1 ATP ligand = 12,737 ± 5 Da) binding at 10–100 μM (Figures 5B and 5C), up to 5 ATP molecules binding at 0.5–1 mM (Figures 5D and S4C), and 5–7 ATP molecules binding at 2–5 mM (Figure 5E; data not shown). The complex formed between CC and ATP was due to noncovalent interactions as no ligand binding was observed following desalting of the sample on a protein trap and column followed by ESI-MS analysis (not shown). Peptide mapping and LC-MS/MS using photoaffinity probe 8-azido-ATP revealed 11 sites with a +28 Da modification at presumed ATP binding sites (Table S2). These were K7, K8, K13, K25, K27, K39, K72, K73, K86, K87, and K88 (Table S2 and Figure 5F), which represent 11 of the 18 lysine (K) residues in CC. Similar to ATP, 2 mM of CTP (not shown), dATP (Figure S4D), NTP pool (Figure S4E), dNTP pool (Figure S4F), and NADP (not shown) also demonstrated binding to CC. In contrast to ATP and other nucleotides, 2 mM of ADP and AMP demonstrated much reduced or no binding to CC (Figures 5G and 5H). To directly test the relationship between ATP binding to CC and CC-mediated caspase activation, we preincubated CC with 2 or 5 mM ATP and then removed the unbound ATP through dialysis. As shown in Figure 5I, CC prebound with ATP failed to activate Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 cleavage (lanes 6–8). Four of the eleven K residues identified (i.e., K7, K25, K39, and K72) have previously been shown to be involved in CC-Apaf-1 interaction (Figure 5F; Yu et al., 2001Yu T. Wang X. Purring-Koch C. Wei Y. McLendon G.L. A mutational epitope for cytochrome C binding to the apoptosis protease activation factor-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13034-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleotide binding to these K residues will interfere with CC binding to Apaf-1. Structural modeling revealed that three other potential ATP binding sites on CC, i.e., K8, K27, and K73, were in the immediate vicinity of K7, K25, and K72, respectively (Figure 5F), suggesting that nucleotide binding to these K residues will likely also interfere with CC-Apaf-1 interactions. Indeed, prospective mutation of K8 into Ala (K8A) abolished the ability of CC to activate the Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation (Figure S4B). In contrast, the wild-type CC induced robust caspase-9 activation that was inhibited, as expected, by increasing amounts of ATP (Figure S4B, lanes 2–6). The other four K residues identified, i.e., K13, K86, K87, and K88 (Figure 5F), had not been studied with respect to their importance in CC-Apaf-1 interaction. Therefore, we carried out site-specific mutagenesis on wild-type human CC to create K13A, K86A, K87A, K88A, K86A/K87A, and K86A/K87A/K88A mutants. The results revealed that all these individual and compound mutant CC proteins failed to activate the Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation (Figure S4B). To determine whether nucleotides inhibit the CC-initiated apoptosis in vivo, we first microinjected CC into the cytoplasm of various cells to mimic CC release induced by apoptotic stimuli. Microinjection of CC (note that microinjected solutions generally get diluted ∼100-fold in the cytoplasm; Zhou et al., 2000Zhou H. Li X.M. Meinkoth J. Pittman R.N. Akt regulates cell survival and apoptosis at a postmitochondrial level.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) into PC3 (Figure S5A) or GM701 (Figure S5B) cells induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis. Apoptotic cells showed typical blebbing cell morphology (Figure S5Cb, arrows) or compromised plasma membrane integrity, allowing live cell nuclei stained by DAPI (Figures S5Cc and S5Cd, arrowheads; Chandra et al., 2002Chandra D. Liu J.W. Tang D.G. Early mitochondrial activation and cytochrome c up-regulation during apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Some dead cells lost the coinjected Texas red dye (Figure S5Cd, arrows). Cell death induced by the microinjected CC was Apaf-1 dependent as apoptosis was diminished in Apaf-1-deficient SKOV-3 cells or Apaf-1−/− MEFs (Figure S5D). We then coinjected CC (3 mg/ml stock; final intracellular concentration ∼30 μg/ml) and various nucleotides into cells. Coinjection of dATP (1 mM stock; ∼[10 μM]) or ATP (100 mM stock; ∼[1 mM]) in PC3 (Figure 6A) or GM701 (Figure S5E) cells strongly inhibited the CC-induced cell death. Other NTPs or dNTPs coinjected into the PC3 cells also inhibited the CC-induced apoptosis (Figure 6B). Coinjection of dNTP (∼[10 μM]) or NTP (∼[1 mM]) pools into PC3, GM701, HeLa, MDA-MB231, and HMEC (Figure 6C) cells also inhibited the CC-induced cell death. If physiological levels of nucleotide pools exert such a dominant inhibitory effect on the CC-initiated apoptosome formation and caspase activation, how then do the stimulated cells die? One possibility is that persistent apoptotic stimulation might result in increasing CC release from the mitochondria, which would help to overcome the inhibitory effects of nucleotides. This possibility is partially supported by our demonstration that increasing amounts of microinjected CC induces more cell death (Figures S5A and S5B). To further test this possibility, we carried out cell-free reconstitution experiments by incubating fresh GM701 cell cytosol with an increasing amount of CC in the presence of 0, 2, 3, or 5 mM ATP. We found that in the absence of exogenous ATP, addition of increasing amounts of CC led to correspondingly increased caspase-9 and -3 processing (Figure 6D, lanes 2–8). In the presence of 2–5 mM of ATP, caspase processing initiated by lower levels of CC (2–10 μg/ml) was inhibited, as evidenced by the levels of procaspase-9 bands and decreased levels of the processed caspase-9 and -3 fragments (Figure 6D; data not shown). However, higher concentrations of CC could partially overcome the inhibitory effects of ATP at 2–5 mM, as evidenced by increased apoptosome-derived p35 (Figure 6D; data not shown). Similarly, microinjection of higher amounts of CC to the cells diminished the protective potential of coinjected nucleotides (Figure 6E). Another possibility is that during apoptosis, the levels of (d)NTP pools, in particular, the ATP levels, might decline to allow CC to bind to Apaf-1. To directly test this possibility, we first measured the levels of ATP (and other NTPs) in several apoptotic systems. We observed that in GM701 cells treated with staurosporine (STS, staurosporine, a widely used kinase inhibitor that triggers intrinsic death pathway), caspase activation was directly correlated with prominent reductions in the levels of ATP (Figures 6F and S6A). In fact, there was a time-dependent decrease in the intracellular ATP levels and a corresponding increase in caspase activation (Figures 6F and S6A). Importantly, not only ATP levels but also other NTPs showed a time-dependent decrease (Figures 6F and S6A). Similar correlations between the decline in ATP (and NTP) levels and caspase activation were observed in the following: MDA-MB231 (Figures 6G and S6B) or LNCaP (Figure S6C) cells treated with STS, MDA-MB231 cells treated with etoposide (VP16; Figure S6D), multiple cell types treated with the BMD compound (Figure S6E), a mitochondrial toxin that upregulates the mitochondrial activities and triggers CC release (Chandra et al., 2002Chandra D. Liu J.W. Tang D.G. Early mitochondrial activation and cytochrome c up-regulation during apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with STS, Fas, and etoposide (Figure S6F). Decrease in ATP/NTP level early during apoptosis induction was not a consequence of caspase activation as z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not show any inhibitory effect (Table S3). We then further tested the hypothesis that as the apoptotic process goes on, the levels of nucleotides bound to CC will also decrease in vivo"

To study the basis of this polarity, we measured the rates of dissociation of Tus from forked TerB oligonucleotides, such as would be produced by the replicative DnaB helicase at both the fork-blocking (nonpermissive) and permissive ends of the Ter site. Strand separation of a few nucleotides at the permissive end was sufficient to force rapid dissociation of Tus to allow fork progression. In contrast, strand separation extending to and including the strictly conserved G-C(6) base pair at the nonpermissive end led to formation of a stable locked complex. Lock formation specifically requires the cytosine residue, C(6). The crystal structure of the locked complex showed that C(6) moves 14 Å from its normal position to bind in a cytosine-specific pocket on the surface of Tus.

In most bacterial species, chromosomal DNA replication initiates at a unique origin (oriC in Escherichia coli), and it proceeds bidirectionally until the two replication forks meet in the terminus region located opposite the origin (Figure 1A). The E. coli terminus contains ten 23 bp Ter sites (TerA–J) arranged in two oppositely oriented groups of five (Coskun-Ari and Hill, 1997Coskun-Ari F.F. Hill T.M.

Thus the first of the two forks to arrive in the terminus region encounters the same face of Tus bound at each of the first series of Ter sites, termed the permissive face. It apparently displaces the bound Tus and passes through to the second series, where it now encounters a nonpermissive face, and its progress is blocked: the fork is trapped between oppositely oriented Ter sites (Hill et al., 1987Hill T.M.

Microbiol. 1992; 46: 603-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since the ten Ter sites have no inverted symmetry of sequence or direct repeats (Figure 1B), and Tus is a monomeric protein that forms a simple 1:1 complex with them (Coskun-Ari et al., 1994Coskun-Ari F.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this evident polarity of fork arrest cannot be due to Tus acting as a simple thermodynamic clamp. Moreover, despite knowledge of the crystal structure of a Tus-TerA complex (Kamada et al., 1996Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto N. Morikawa K. Structure of a replication-terminator protein complexed with DNA.Nature. 1996; 383: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and extensive work on the process of replication fork arrest and the stability of complexes of Tus with variant Ter sites, there has been no satisfactory explanation of the mechanism that determines polarity of the Tus-Ter block (reviewed by Neylon et al., 2005Neylon C. Kralicek A.V. Hill T.M. Dixon N.E. Replication termination in Escherichia coli: structure and anti-helicase activity of the Tus-Ter complex.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This mechanism is resolved in the present work. The X-ray crystal structure of the Tus-TerA complex showed that many of the conserved residues among the various Ter sites make base-specific contacts with the protein (Kamada et al., 1996Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto N. Morikawa K.

The dissociation constant (KD) of the Tus-TerB complex was reported to be 0.3 pM in 0.15 M potassium glutamate, and the half-life of the complex was 550 min (Gottlieb et al., 1992Gottlieb P.A. Wu S. Zhang X. Tecklenburg M. Kuempel P. Hill T.M. Equilibrium, kinetic, and footprinting studies of the Tus-Ter protein-DNA interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7434-7443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is therefore the most stable complex known of a monomeric, sequence-specific, DNA binding protein with its double-stranded recognition sequence. As expected for a complex in which many interactions are electrostatic (Kamada et al., 1996Kamada K. Horiuchi T. Ohsumi K. Shimamoto N. Morikawa K. Structure of a replication-terminator protein complexed with DNA.Nature. 1996; 383: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), binding is strongly dependent on ionic strength, with the value of KD rising to about 1 nM and the half-life decreasing to about 2 min in a buffer containing 0.25 M KCl, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C.

Complexity beyond simple DNA binding in determining the polarity of fork arrest is suggested by identification of mutants of TerB that bind Tus as strongly as the wild-type but that are defective in replication fork arrest in vivo (Coskun-Ari and Hill, 1997Coskun-Ari F.F. Hill T.M. Sequence-specific interactions in the Tus-Ter complex and the effect of base pair substitutions on arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26448-26456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and mutants of Tus that are more defective in fork arrest than DNA binding (Skokotas et al., 1995Skokotas A. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. O'Donnell L. Hill T.M. Mutations in the Escherichia coli Tus protein define a domain positioned close to the DNA in the Tus-Ter complex.J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the Escherichia coli Tus protein: DNA-protein interactions alone can not account for Tus activity.Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Residues specifically implicated in this behavior are the G-C(6) base pair of Ter (Figure 1B) and the side chain of Glu49 of Tus. Alternate mechanisms for determination of polarity in this system have been discussed in detail by Neylon et al., 2005Neylon C. Kralicek A.V. Hill T.M. Dixon N.E. Replication termination in Escherichia coli: structure and anti-helicase activity of the Tus-Ter complex.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. The major replicative helicase (DnaB) is the first replisomal protein at a replication fork to encounter the Tus-Ter complex (Schaeffer et al., 2005Schaeffer P.M. Headlam M.J. Dixon N.E. Protein-protein interactions in the eubacterial replisome.IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and binding of Tus has been known for some time to compromise unwinding of Ter DNA by DnaB in vitro in a polar fashion (Lee et al., 1989Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Hidaka M. Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Escherichia coli replication termination protein impedes the action of helicases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The replication terminator protein of E. coli is a DNA sequence-specific contra-helicase.Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A direct physical interaction between Tus and DnaB at the nonpermissive face that prevents unwinding of Ter is a potential mechanism to enforce polarity, and there is experimental support for this (Mulugu et al., 2001Mulugu S. Potnis A. Shamsuzzaman Taylor J. Alexander K. Bastia D. Mechanism of termination of DNA replication of Escherichia coli involves helicase-contrahelicase interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9569-9574Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, a major difficulty with this mechanism is that the Tus-Ter complex seems to exhibit polarity in inhibition of strand separation by a variety of DNA helicases, including some that move on their single-stranded DNA tracks in the 5′–3′ direction (such as DnaB) and those that have 3′–5′ polarity (e.g., E. coli Rep, PriA, UvrD, and SV40 virus large T antigen) (Lee et al., 1989Lee E.H.

Moreover, transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase is also reported to be blocked in a polar manner (Sahoo et al., 1995Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Manna A.C. Bastia D. The contrahelicase activities of the replication terminator proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are helicase-specific and impede both helicase translocation and authentic DNA unwinding.J.

Mechanistic studies on the impact of transcription on sequence-specific termination of DNA replication and vice versa.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found previously that the kinetics of interaction of Tus with TerB were affected differently by mutations in Tus, depending on their location at the permissive or the nonpermissive face of the complex, and these data suggested that dissociation of Tus occurs in a stepwise manner (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Interaction of the Escherichia coli replication terminator protein (Tus) with DNA: a model derived from DNA-binding studies of mutant proteins by surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Polarity could then be explained by the existence of a different series of elementary steps in dissociation of the complex when the helicase approaches from one face as opposed to the other (Neylon et al., 2005Neylon C. Kralicek A.V. Hill T.M. Dixon N.E. Replication termination in Escherichia coli: structure and anti-helicase activity of the Tus-Ter complex.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This led to a more precise definition of this hypothesis, considered here: That approach of DnaB, at the forefront of the replisome, to a Tus-Ter complex engineers a structure in DNA that differentially affects dissociation of Tus depending on the direction of approach. The simplest DNA structure engineered by a helicase is forked duplex DNA, and a simple way to test the hypothesis was to measure the rates of dissociation of Tus from forked variants of TerB that mimic structures that would be produced by helicase action. Here, we first show that the rates of dissociation of Tus from forked TerB oligonucleotides are indeed profoundly different, depending on whether the fork is at one end of TerB or the other. In particular, forks that expose the strictly conserved G-C(6) base pair at the nonpermissive face produce a complex in which Tus is locked onto the DNA: It dissociates about 40-fold more slowly than from wild-type TerB. We trace this locking behavior to a single nucleotide base (C6) of Ter, which we propose forms a new contact with a cryptic cytosine-specific, single-stranded DNA binding site on the surface of Tus. This site is then identified in an X-ray crystal structure of Tus in complex with an appropriate forked duplex version of Ter. Finally, we address the question of what may happen when the later-arriving, oppositely moving replisome approaches the first replisome stalled at the Tus-Ter complex: we show that strand separation at the permissive face can unlock the first complex, displacing Tus to allow replication of the remaining double-stranded DNA at the terminus. These studies thus provide simple and elegant explanations of many of the unresolved questions regarding the mechanism of replication fork arrest at Tus bound Ter sites in the final stages of chromosomal DNA replication. In addition, they reveal an unprecedented stable interaction between a monomeric DNA binding protein and a particular forked DNA structure, which might be exploited in practical ways. The kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction of Tus with TerB and its forked versions were studied by SPR using a Biacore instrument at 20°C in a buffer at pH 7.5 containing 250 mM KCl; 21 nucleotide 5′-biotinylated TerB oligonucleotides were immobilized through an abasic spacer to streptavidin-coated Biacore chip surfaces (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Interaction of the Escherichia coli replication terminator protein (Tus) with DNA: a model derived from DNA-binding studies of mutant proteins by surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Each of the strands of TerB was immobilized separately, and the other (hybridized) strand contained noncomplementary regions (e.g., as shown in Figure 2A). We could thus examine dissociation of Tus from TerB sites containing noncomplementary mutated regions of various lengths on both strands at each end. As observed previously (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Interaction of the Escherichia coli replication terminator protein (Tus) with DNA: a model derived from DNA-binding studies of mutant proteins by surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the interaction of Tus with TerB is a well-behaved interaction for study by SPR. Dissociation generally followed a first-order rate law; half-lives and values of KD for the wild-type complex in both orientations (TerB and rTerB) are given in Figure 2A (complete kinetic and thermodynamic data, including estimates of error limits in all measurements, and sequences of these and all other oligonucleotides are given in Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The data for TerB and rTerB indicate that the orientation of the wild-type duplex with respect to the surface has little effect on binding parameters. Values of KD were 1–2 nM; use of 250 mM KCl in the buffer brings parameters into a range reliably quantifiable by SPR (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Interaction of the Escherichia coli replication terminator protein (Tus) with DNA: a model derived from DNA-binding studies of mutant proteins by surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As the forked region was progressively extended at the permissive end of TerB, dissociation rates became progressively faster, and it mattered little which strand was mutated (Figures 2A and 2B) or if either of them was removed completely (Figure S1). It is clear that strand separation even as far as A-T(20) of TerB would lead to rapid dissociation of Tus (Figure 2A, oligonucleotides F3p-TerB and F3p-rTerB), resulting in unimpeded progression of the replisome through Ter (Figure 2C). The data are thus consistent with removal of Tus due to the progressive loss of protein-DNA contacts during strand separation by the helicase at the permissive end of Ter. The situation was different with single-stranded regions at the nonpermissive end. A 5- to 7-fold increase in KD was observed when the mismatched regions were three or four nucleotides long, with dissociation rates similar to those with wild-type TerB regardless of which strand was mutated (Figures 3A and 3B). However, strand specificity became dramatically obvious when the forked region extended to the G-C(6) base pair. When the strand containing C(6) was mutated (the bottom strand in Figure 3A; oligonucleotide F5n-TerB), Tus dissociated about twice as rapidly as from TerB (Figures 3A and 3C), and KD increased almost 30-fold. On the other hand, mutation of the top strand (F5n-rTerB) resulted in Tus being firmly locked onto the forked TerB (Figures 3A–3C): Tus dissociated about 40-fold more slowly than from TerB, and KD was about 3-fold lower. Although extension of the fork to include T-A(7) (F6n-rTerB) resulted in a similarly locked behavior, its further lengthening to A-T(8) (F7n-rTerB) resulted in poorer binding because of a slower association rate (Figures 3A and S1). It is clear therefore that strand separation by a helicase approaching from the nonpermissive face of the Tus-Ter complex would lead to a locked complex that is even more stable than the regular complex with fully duplex TerB, while at the permissive face helicase action would simply promote dissociation of Tus. These observations provide an adequate explanation of the polarity observed in replication termination. It is clear that the strictly conserved C(6) base on the bottom strand of the TerB sequence in Figure 3A must not be base-paired to lock the complex. Some further experiments verified this. The locking behavior still occurred when the first five residues of the mutant strand in F5n-rTerB were completely removed (Δ5n-rTerB; Figure 3A), indicating that a forked structure is not required and systematic mutagenesis of each of the first five residues of the wild-type strand of F5n-rTerB showed that mutagenesis of C(6), and only C(6), abrogated the locking behavior of the complex (Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D). Indeed, complete removal of the first four residues on the 3′ strand, leaving only C(6), still resulted in formation of a locked species (“single O/H C,” Figure 3A). The unpaired C(6) residue is thus necessary and sufficient for lock formation. The T-A(7) base pair in TerB is not conserved, being replaced by G-C in TerC and two other Ter sites (Figure 1B). Its mutagenesis resulted in only small effects on the strength of the Tus-TerB interaction or in vivo fork arrest activity (Coskun-Ari and Hill, 1997Coskun-Ari F.F. Hill T.M. Sequence-specific interactions in the Tus-Ter complex and the effect of base pair substitutions on arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26448-26456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Data in Figure 3E show that changing T-A(7) to G-C has very little effect on formation or stability of the locked species and that substitution of C(6) by G again results in loss of the locking behavior. These data indicate that a molecular mousetrap operates during replication fork arrest at the nonpermissive face of Tus-Ter (Figure 3F). The trap is set by the binding of Tus to the Ter site, and it is sprung by strand separation by DnaB at the forefront of the approaching replisome. This results in the flipping of the C(6) residue out of the double helix by rotation of the phosphodiester backbone and its base-specific binding in a cryptic cytosine-specific binding pocket in or near the DNA binding channel of Tus. Other contacts of Tus with the displaced strand may occur, but they are not sequence specific. Base-flipping processes that bear some similarity to this occur in DNA modification and repair enzymes like DNA N-glycosylases, apurinic endonucleases, and DNA methyltransferases (Cheng and Roberts, 2001Cheng X. Roberts R.J. AdoMet-dependent methylation, DNA methyltransferases and base flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This mechanism explains the observation that mutagenesis of the G-C(6) base pair of TerB compromises fork arrest without severely affecting Tus binding (Coskun-Ari and Hill, 1997Coskun-Ari F.F. Hill T.M. Sequence-specific interactions in the Tus-Ter complex and the effect of base pair substitutions on arrest of DNA replication in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26448-26456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the strict conservation of this base pair in all Ter sites (Figure 1B). Specific physical interaction of DnaB with Tus is not precluded but would appear to be unnecessary. Several further experiments were carried out to study aspects of this model. We anticipated that Tus would dissociate very slowly from oligonucleotides that expose C(6) at the nonpermissive end in 200 mM potassium glutamate buffer at 25°C, conditions that have been used in many earlier studies of the Tus-Ter interaction (e.g., see Skokotas et al., 1995Skokotas A. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. O'Donnell L. Hill T.M. Mutations in the Escherichia coli Tus protein define a domain positioned close to the DNA in the Tus-Ter complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30941-30948Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, Henderson et al., 2001Henderson T.A. Nilles A.F. Valjavec-Gratian M. Hill T.M. Site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the Escherichia coli Tus protein: DNA-protein interactions alone can not account for Tus activity.Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); the half-life of the wild-type Tus-TerB complex is 150 min in this buffer. Accordingly, measurements of dissociation of Tus from 32P-labeled TerB and partial-duplex TerB derivatives (Table 1) in solution were made using the conventional filter binding assay. Complexes with Tus were challenged with excess unlabeled TerB oligonucleotide, and samples were filtered at various times to determine the proportion of protein bound 32P remaining. Dissociation of Tus generally followed a first-order rate law; half-lives of the complexes are given in Table 1. It is apparent that dissociation half-lives in glutamate buffer were much more similar for the wild-type TerB oligonucleotide and those that expose C(6), indicating that the locked conformation of the DNA either no longer forms under these conditions or, more likely, that its dissociation from Tus occurs at a similar rate as from wild-type TerB, i.e., existence of the lock is masked by the higher stability of the wild-type complex.Table 1Half-lives for Dissociation of Tus-Ter Complexes in 200 mM Potassium GlutamateOligonucleotideaThe core TerB sequences are overlined.Half-life (min)bAverage of three independent experiments (± SEM), using a competition filter binding assay in KG200 buffer at 25°C (Skokotas et al., 1995).150 ± 6131 ± 7205 ± 8a The core TerB sequences are overlined.b Average of three independent experiments (± SEM), using a competition filter binding assay in KG200 buffer at 25°C (Skokotas et al., 1995Skokotas A.

Open table in a new tab These observations prompted examination of the effects of ionic strength on dissociation rate constants (kd) as measured by SPR (Figure 3G). At high ionic strength, a large difference in kd was observed for F5n-rTerB cf. rTerB, with little dependence on ionic strength. At low ionic strength, the two lines in Figure 3G have a steeper slope and converge. The slopes of lines in such log/log plots are directly related to the numbers of ionic contacts that need to be disrupted during the rate-determining step in the dissociation of a protein from a DNA complex (Record et al., 1991Record Jr., M.T. Ha J.-H.

These data therefore offer further support for a stepwise mechanism for dissociation of Tus from both TerB (Neylon et al., 2000Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Interaction of the Escherichia coli replication terminator protein (Tus) with DNA: a model derived from DNA-binding studies of mutant proteins by surface plasmon resonance.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the forked species, and they show that the rate-determining step in each process changes abruptly with ionic strength. With both oligonucleotides, the slowest step in dissociation at high ionic strength involves loss of a single (or few) ionic interaction(s), while at low ionic strength the rate-determining step requires disruption of a much larger number of such interactions. The slowest step in dissociation of Tus from the locked complex at higher salt concentrations is likely to be removal of the C(6) base from its binding pocket, while for the wild-type complex, it is the breakage of a particular but undetermined site-specific interaction. At a physiological ionic strength corresponding to 150 mM KCl, the half-lives for the wild-type and locked complexes were still very different, being about 80 and 490 min, respectively (Figure 3G). Thus, the more stable locked species would be expected to be generated by the action of DnaB under cellular conditions. Duggan et al., 1996Duggan L.J. Asmann P.T. Hill T.M. Gottlieb P.A.

Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation.Neuron. 1999; 22: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar have shown that attentional modulations in V1 from attending to a location occur in the absence of a stimulus; i.e., they are completely endogenous. To date, however, there has been little to challenge the general assumption that modulations of early visual areas are directly attributable to perceptual processing (but see Shuler and Bear, 2006Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Reward timing in the primary visual cortex.Science. 2006; 311: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The present experiments show that two entirely endogenous modulations coexist within V1: one is related to spatial attention; the other, to task structure. We use a detection task similar to that of Ress et al., 2000Ress D. Backus B.T. Heeger D.J. Activity in primary visual cortex predicts performance in a visual detection task.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar in which participants detect a threshold contrast visual stimulus. We replicate their observation that attending to a location in the absence of a stimulus produces a robust modulation of human visual cortex (V1, V2, V3, and VP). In a series of experiments, by varying the time and frequency of response, and the location and modality of the target, we demonstrate the presence of an endogenous signal time-locked to task events. The results demonstrate that the modulation due to spatial attention is separable from modulations due to task structure. The attentional modulation is confined to the time period in which the stimulus is presented, its location within V1 changes with the location of the attended stimulus, and it is observed with the same or greater magnitude in retinotopic areas subsequent to V1 (e.g., V2 and V3). The task structure modulation occurs both at the time of stimulus presentation and at the time of response, is biased toward the peripheral representation within V1 irrespective of the stimulus location, is independent of the modality of the target stimulus, and is much stronger in V1 than in subsequent visual areas such as V2 and V3. Control experiments establish that the task structure modulation of V1 is not due to sensory stimulation, spatial attention, motor factors, blinks, or eye movements. In addition, an experiment involving two response intervals, separated in time, demonstrates modulation of V1 associated with an intermediate task event, not just with events marking task onset and offset. Experiment 1 separated activity due to attention and activity associated with response by comparing immediate and delayed response conditions. The task is described in Figure 1A (also see Experimental Procedures). In the delayed response condition, the time between stimulus presentation and response was long enough to resolve the blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) modulation associated with each event. Behavioral data from this and subsequent experiments can be found in the Supplemental Data. Figures 2A–2E show a flattened representation of the occipital lobe of a representative participant. Passive retinotopy was used to map the borders of early visual areas and the representation of eccentricity in those areas (Figures 2A and 2B, see Experimental Procedures). Figure 2C shows that immediate response trials produced surprisingly widespread activity throughout V1, with no evidence of stronger activation at the eccentricity corresponding to the stimulus (i.e., the region corresponding to the second largest hot pink semicircle in Figures 2B–2E). Delayed response trials produced two distinct peaks of activity. Figure 2D shows that the first peak in activity, putatively related to attention, was most evident at the retinotopically appropriate region (near the second largest hot pink semicircle), while the map in Figure 2E shows that the second peak in activity was most pronounced outside the stimulus region in peripheral V1 (i.e., outside the largest hot pink semicircle in Figures 2B–2E). Figure 2F shows time courses averaged across the three participants for regions corresponding to the stimulus eccentricity (blue time courses) and most peripheral mapped eccentricity (red time courses) in V1, V2, and V3/VP. Immediate response trials are shown on the left; delayed response trials, on the right. Statistical analyses of the time courses were conducted separately for each participant using repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) (see Statistical Methods subsection). The distribution of peak activity can be seen individually for each participant, and for all four eccentricities, in Figure S1 of the Supplemental Data. The time course for immediate response trials (left panel) showed a single, early peak, while that for delayed response trials (right panel) showed both the early peak and a later peak, consistent with a response-related signal. This difference in the time course for the immediate and delayed conditions was significant for each participant, as indicated by the interaction of Time by Condition (immediate, delayed) (P1, number of trials [n] = 528, p < 0.001; P2, n = 548, p < 0.001; P3, n = 576, p = 0.006). The attention-related and response-related signals were distinguished not only by their time of occurrence, but also by their retinotopy. Attention-related activity occurred in the retinotopically appropriate location. The right panels of Figure 2F show that during the stimulus window, activity in the stimulus region (shown by the blue lines) was greater than activity in the most peripheral region (shown by the red lines). Repeated measures ANOVAs on the subset of the data corresponding to the first peak of activation (7.5 s) during delayed trials showed a significant effect of eccentricity in all three participants (P1, n = 264; P2, n = 274; P3, n = 288; p < 0.001 for all tests). In contrast, the response-related signal isolated by the second peak of activity was stronger in the most peripheral region than in the stimulus region (i.e., for the second peak, the red lines are above the blue lines). Inspection of all four mapped eccentricities revealed that the increase in response-related activity for more eccentric regions was highly systematic (see Figure S1). A repeated measures ANOVA on the subset of the data corresponding to the second peak of activation (17.5 s) on delayed trials indicated that all participants showed significantly greater activations in the peripheral than stimulus region (P1, n = 264; P2, n = 274; P3, n = 288; p < 0.001 for all tests). The difference in the retinotopic distribution of the two peaks of activity during delayed response trials was statistically significant within V1. A repeated measures ANOVA limited to V1 with the factors Time of Activation (7.5 s versus 17.5 s) and Region (stimulus region versus peripheral region) yielded a significant interaction of Time of Activation by Region in each of the three participants (P1, n = 264; P2, n = 274; P3, n = 288; p < 0.001 for all tests). A final dissociation between the two types of signals was reflected in their distribution across visual areas V1, V2, and V3/VP. The second peak in activity was strongest in V1, and became progressively weaker moving to V2 and then to V3/VP. In contrast, the first peak, at the eccentricity corresponding to the stimulus, showed, if anything, a small trend to be greater in higher visual areas. A closer examination of the distribution of attentional and nonperceptual modulations across visual areas can be found at the end of the Results section. Importantly, the time courses from trials in which the stimulus was present (continuous line) or absent (dashed line) were virtually indistinguishable, indicating that the putative attention-related first peak of activity did not reflect sensory activity but was endogenously generated, as previously noted (Ress et al., 2000Ress D. Backus B.T. Heeger D.J. Activity in primary visual cortex predicts performance in a visual detection task.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Identical stimulus-present and stimulus-absent time courses were also observed for the second peak, indicating that it was also unrelated to sensory activity. In summary, the results from the time course analysis (Figure 2F) and from the statistical maps (Figures 2A–2E) generated by using an assumed hemodynamic response show that the responses on immediate and delayed response trials consisted of the combination of two distinct endogenous modulations. The first was time-locked to the stimulus window, was stronger at the eccentricity where the stimulus was presented, and was approximately equal across different visual areas. This modulation likely corresponds to that reported by Ress et al., 2000Ress D. Backus B.T. Heeger D.J. Activity in primary visual cortex predicts performance in a visual detection task.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar and is associated with the voluntary orienting of spatial attention to the stimulus location. The other modulation varied with the time of response, was more prominent in V1 than in later visual areas, and was distributed to more peripheral regions. Although the second modulation was clearly greatest in regions representing more peripheral parts of the visual field, it also appeared in more foveal regions. The time course of activity at the stimulus eccentricity (blue time courses) on delayed response trials showed a small second peak of activity that was not present on immediate response trials. t tests that compared activity on delayed and immediate response trials at the time of the second peak (17.5 s) for each of the four mapped eccentricities and for each of the three participants revealed significantly higher activity for delayed as opposed to immediate response trials for all twelve comparisons (independent samples paired t tests, p < 0.05, two-tailed). This effect was significant even at the most central region of the localizer, which abuts the foveal confluence. Therefore, the second modulation occurred throughout V1. Finally, while Experiment 1 provided strong evidence for modulation of V1 at the end of each trial, the results were also consistent with the presence of a similar modulation at task onset, the time of stimulus presentation. On delayed response trials (right panel, Figure 2F), the magnitude of the first peak of activity in the peripheral region (red time courses) was very similar to that of the second peak. Furthermore, it showed a similar decline across visual areas V1, V2, and V3/VP. This trend was significant for all three participants (repeated measures ANOVA on the magnitude of the first peak of delayed response trials in the peripheral eccentricity, main effect of visual area: P1, n = 264; P2, n = 274; P3, n = 288; p < 0.001 for all tests). The next experiment provides stronger evidence for the presence of a modulation at the time of stimulus presentation, which cannot be easily accounted for by perceptual demands. Experiment 2 eliminated the confounding effects of visual stimulation at the start of each trial by including an auditory task condition. The use of an auditory task also allowed a test of whether the second peak in activity occurs in V1 even when the task does not involve any visual perceptual or attentional demands. Three new participants (P4, P5, P6) performed visual and auditory discrimination tasks in alternating blocks (see Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures). Figure 3 shows activity in occipital cortex time-locked to stimulus presentation and response in the two tasks. At the time of response, the pattern of activity is similar for both auditory and visual tasks (Figure 3B and 3D), and is distributed more in the periphery than fovea, consistent with Experiment 1. In addition, however, Figure 3C shows a similar activation at the time of stimulus presentation in V1 during the auditory task, which is remarkable since it cannot be accounted for by visual stimulation or by visual attentional demands. The activation of peripheral V1 during the auditory stimulus presentation was highly significant for two of the three participants, while the third showed a trend in the same direction (P4, z = 9.08, p < 0.001; P5, z = 0.36, p = 0.36; P6, z = 3.07, p < 0.001). When data from the three participants were pooled, it was highly significant, as illustrated by the thresholded maps shown in Figure 3. Finally, the time courses in Figure 3E confirm that peripheral V1 showed very similar stimulus presentation and response-related signals irrespective of task modality. Experiment 2 shows that activations occur both at the time of stimulus presentation and at the time of response, are weighted toward peripheral V1, and occur even during performance of a nonvisual task. These findings suggest a quite general activation of visual cortex. It does not appear to relate to perceptual demands, nor to any specific aspect of the task, but is instead more generally related to task structure—it is time-locked to significant task events. While this characterization will be further tested in subsequent experiments, for convenience we will refer to it from here as the “nonperceptual” modulation of V1. Experiment 3 shows that the cortical distribution of the attention signal changes with the attended location. Experiment 3 also provided an initial test of the hypothesis that activation of V1 occurs independently of motor execution by including both response (go) and no-response (no-go) conditions (the effect of the go/no-go variable will be discussed in the next section, which describes several control experiments). Three participants performed a variation of the delayed response condition of Experiment 1 (see Figure 1C and Experimental Procedures). Figure 4 shows time courses, averaged across the three participants and over go and no-go trials, for regions corresponding to the central and peripheral stimulus locations in V1, V2, and V3/VP. Only trials on which the stimulus was absent are shown. The magnitude of activity that was time-locked to the stimulus window followed the pattern predicted by passive retinotopy. In cortical regions corresponding to the central stimulus (Figure 4, left column), the first peak of activity was greater when participants attempted to detect the central stimulus (dotted lines) rather than the peripheral stimulus (solid lines). In cortical regions corresponding to the peripheral stimulus (right column, Figure 4), the first peak of activity was greater when participants attended to the peripheral stimulus as opposed to the central stimulus. We tested the reliability of the change in the attention-related signal with stimulus eccentricity using a repeated measures ANOVA on the data corresponding to the first peak of activation (7.5 s) on stimulus-absent trials (see the Statistical Methods subsection). The interaction of stimulus location (central versus peripheral) with retinotopic region (central versus peripheral), tested separately for each participant and for each visual area (V1, V2, and V3/VP), was highly significant (p < 0.001) in 8 of the 9 tests (P1, n = 168; P2, n = 159; P3, n = 166). The only exception was for V1 in participant P1 (n = 168, p = 0.47), where the trend was in the predicted direction. Conversely, there was no consistent effect of attended location on the magnitude of the second peak of activity, confirming that this signal is independent of the distribution of spatial attention. (In peripheral V1, z stats for the contrast attend central minus attend peripheral for stimulus absent trials were: P1, z = −2.42, p = 0.016; P2, z = 0.82, p = 0.412; P3, z = 0.53, p = 0.596). In conclusion, varying the location of attention produces a reliable and retinotopically appropriate modulation of endogenous activity in early visual areas, but has no effect on the second peak of activity in V1 that occurs in delayed response trials. While the endogenous modulation of early visual areas associated with spatial attention has been anticipated in the literature (Kastner et al., 1999Kastner S. Pinsk M.A. De Weerd P. Desimone R.

Backus B.T. Heeger D.J. Activity in primary visual cortex predicts performance in a visual detection task.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we do not know of any reports of nonperceptual activation in V1 associated with task structure. We conducted a number of control studies to check that this activation could not be accounted for by other perceptual or motor factors. Our first goal was to rule out an explanation related to sensory processing of auditory stimuli, which were used in Experiments 1 and 3 to mark both the time of visual stimulus presentation and of response. This possibility had been partly ruled out in Experiment 2, which demonstrated a second peak in activity even when the response was self-paced rather than cued by an auditory tone. However, it is important to carefully consider this hypothesis, since it is known that V1 receives back projections from auditory cortex, which are weighted toward the periphery (Falchier et al., 2002Falchier A. Clavagnier S. Barone P. Kennedy H. Anatomical evidence of multimodal integration in primate striate cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5749-5759PubMed Google Scholar, Rockland and Ojima, 2003Rockland K.S. Ojima H. Multisensory convergence in calcarine visual areas in macaque monkey.Int. J. Psychophysiol. 2003; 50: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To directly test whether auditory input has any influence on the second peak, Experiment 4 compared two conditions, one in which participants waited for an auditory tone before making their response, as in Experiment 1 (immediate/delayed), and a second condition in which participants self-paced their own delayed response by silently counting to a fixed number before responding, as in Experiment 2. The two conditions were made directly comparable by yoking the timing of the auditory tones in one block of trials to the time of the self-paced responses in the previous block (see Experimental Procedures; response times are given in Supplemental Data). A second goal of this experiment was to investigate the relationship between the second peak in activity and motor factors by measuring the effect of responding with the left hand, held on the left side of the body, versus responding with the right hand, held on the right side of the body (see Experimental Procedures). The most important result was that the second peak in activity was present in both the self-paced and auditory cue conditions (Figure 5A). The self-paced condition (and yoked auditory cue condition) resulted in a less sharp second peak than that observed for auditory cue trials with a fixed timing (compare time courses in Figure 1F to the present time courses), because trials with fixed timing allow a more precise time-locked synchronization with task structure. In order to compare the auditory cue and self-paced conditions, we took the maximum BOLD response in the interval from 12.5 to 22.5 s as the peak magnitude for each trial. The delayed activation in peripheral V1 actually showed a trend for greater activity when no auditory stimulus was present (i.e., during self-paced responses) (independent samples t tests: P1, t = 6.4, p < 0.001; P2, t = 0.9, p = 0.4; P3, t = 1.3, p = 0.2), showing that the second peak in activity cannot be attributed to auditory stimulation. An alternative hypothesis is that activation of V1 may result from the act of making a manual response, either because of some intrinsic connection between perceptual and motor processes (e.g., see Astafiev et al., 2004Astafiev S.V. Stanley C.M. Shulman G.L. Corbetta M. Extrastriate body area in human occipital cortex responds to the performance of motor actions.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) or because V1 is involved in processing somatosensory information (as has been shown in the blind e.g., see Sadato et al., 1998Sadato N. Pascual-Leone A. Grafman J. Deiber M.P. Ibanez V. Hallett M. Neural networks for Braille reading by the blind.Brain. 1998; 121: 1213-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, in Experiment 4, we found that the delayed responses in right and left visual cortex did not vary as a function of the responding hand. The go/no-go manipulation of Experiment 3, in which half the trials (randomly interleaved) were signaled as “no-go” trials by a change in the auditory tone, provided a further test of this hypothesis. Figure 5B shows that the time courses on go and no-go trials were very similar, contrary to the hypothesis that the second peak in activity was caused by motor execution. However, there was a trend for a greater response in go than no-go trials, suggesting a possible role for motor or premotor processes in generating the V1 activation. (Contrast of go minus no-go [see Statistical Methods subsection]: P1, z = 1.13, p = 0.26; P2, z = 0.17, p = 0.87; P3, z = 2.83, p = 0.005). A further control experiment, Experiment 5 (respond/count), assessed activity in peripheral V1 in the complete absence of motor preparation and response. This experiment compared activity between a condition in which a manual response was made (identical to immediate response trials in Experiment 1) and a condition in which participants kept a covert count of the total number of stimuli presented, giving a verbal response after the end of each scan (16 trials). An immediate response task was used, instead of a delayed response task, since it was not feasible to ask participants to delay a covert action. Figure 5C shows that the time course of activity in the two conditions in peripheral V1 was similar, with the counting condition perhaps showing a smaller peak magnitude but a broader sustained response. This difference may simply reflect greater variation in task timing during the counting condition. A t test comparing the two conditions, using the maximum BOLD response in the interval from 7.5 to 17.5 s as the peak magnitude for each trial, revealed no difference between the conditions (independent samples t tests: P1, t = 0.64, p = 0.5; P3, t = 1.0, p = 0.3). This null result cannot rule out a role for motor factors in modulating activity in peripheral V1. However, it is notable that robust activation of peripheral V1 persists in a task that does not involve any overt action or limb movement. This result, consistent with the motor manipulations in Experiments 3 and 4, and with the finding of activation of V1 at the time of stimulus presentation in Experiments 1 and 2, indicates that any contribution of motor factors to the observed activation of V1 must occur at an abstract premotor level, such as motor planning. The nonperceptual modulation of V1 has been found to occur whenever a significant task event has occurred, regardless of whether that event corresponds to stimulus presentation or response. However, the experiments reported so far have involved a maximum of two task events, capable of being distinguished given the temporal resolution of BOLD, which occurred at the start and end of each trial. One possibility, suggested by studies of BOLD activity at block transitions (Dosenbach et al., 2006Dosenbach N.U.F. Visscher K.M. Palmer E.D. Miezin F.M. Wenger K.K. Kang H.C. Burgund E.D.

However, a molecular link between these gene products and neuronal cell death has not been established. In the trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse there is increased apoptosis in the cortex, and hippocampal neurons undergo accelerated cell death that cannot be rescued by administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Ts16 neurons have normal levels of the TrkB tyrosine kinase receptor but an upregulation of the TrkB.T1 truncated receptor isoform. Here we show that restoration of the physiological level of the TrkB.T1 receptor by gene targeting rescues Ts16 cortical cell and hippocampal neuronal death. Moreover, it corrects resting Ca2+ levels and restores BDNF-induced intracellular signaling mediated by full-length TrkB in Ts16 hippocampal neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2033082381,"The subunit composition determines AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) function and trafficking. Mechanisms underlying channel assembly are thus central to the efficacy and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. We previously showed that RNA editing at the Q/R site of the GluR2 subunit contributes to the assembly of AMPA-R heteromers by attenuating formation of GluR2 homotetramers. Here we report that this function of the Q/R site depends on subunit contacts between adjacent ligand binding domains (LBDs). Changes of LBD interface contacts alter GluR2 assembly properties, forward traffic, and expression at synapses. Interestingly, developmentally regulated RNA editing within the LBD (at the R/G site) produces analogous effects. Our data reveal that editing to glycine reduces the self-assembly competence of this critical subunit and slows GluR2 maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, RNA editing sites, located at strategic subunit interfaces, shape AMPA-R assembly and trafficking in a developmentally regulated manner."

Based on crystal structure and mutagenesis studies the LBD can be subdivided into three regions: the suppressor domain (amino acids 1–223), the β-domain (amino acids 224–436), and the α-domain (amino acids 437–604) (5Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M.

Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two models have been put forward to explain how the binding of IP3 at the N terminus gates the opening of the channel pore some 2000 amino acids away at the C terminus. The first envisions that conformational changes in the LBD may be transmitted through the regulatory domain and suppressor domain to the channel domain (7Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The second model is based on the observation that the LBD is directly coupled to the channel domain (8Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This latter model predicts that conformational changes in the LBD can gate the opening of the channel through a direct mechanical interaction between the domains. Overall, very little is known about the exact gating mechanism of IP3R channels.The coupling of the LBD to the channel domain was proposed to be intermolecular and to involve interaction sites located between amino acids 1–340 in the N terminus of one subunit and amino acids 2418–2749 in the C terminus of the adjacent subunit (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present study we have utilized mutations in the C-terminal channel domain to further define the sites of C-N interaction. We show that one C-terminal site of interaction is the cytosol-exposed loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (S4-S5 linker). The 159 amino acids of the cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail were not involved in the C-N interaction, but deletion of 60 amino acids from the tail, which completely removes a predicted coiled-coil, was sufficient to impair channel function. A model of IP3R channel gating is proposed that involves the S4-S5 linker and a coiled-coil in the C-terminal tail as key components of the gating mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Cloning—The cDNA encoding the IP3RtypeIin pCMV3 was the kind gift of Dr. Thomas Südhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). All amino acid numbering is with reference to the rat type I IP3R (10Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The splice variant used in this study was SI (–), SII (+), SIII (–). All point mutants were made using the QuikChange or the QuikChange Multi Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) utilizing a cassette encompassing the BstBI/XbaI fragment of the type I IP3R in pBluescript (Invitrogen). Mutants were confirmed by sequencing and the BstBI/XbaI-digested inserts were subcloned into the full-length IP3R or HA-tagged full-length IP3R cDNA in pCMV3. For the GST fusion protein an insert of nucleotides 8050–8205 was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, CA) and primers encoding BamHI and EcoRI sites. The BamHI/EcoRI PCR product was ligated into similarly digested pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). This construct expresses amino acids 2684–2735 of type I IP3R with GST fused to its N terminus. All primer sequences are available upon request.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were grown on 100-mm or 150-mm plates (Sarstedt) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 100 international units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 0.04 mg/ml Gentamicin (Invitrogen) until 70–80% confluent. Transfections typically were done overnight in DMEM without serum. LT-1 (Mirus) and NovaFECTOR (VennNova, Inc.) were used together during transfections and each was added at a cationic lipid to DNA ratio of 1:1. Transfections typically involved 5 μg and 20 μg of DNA for 100-mm and 150-mm plates, respectively. Co-transfections were done on 100-mm plates with 5 μg of IP3R and 5 μg of SERCA2b. After 24 h, serum containing DMEM was added, and cells were allowed to grow for 48–72 h.Expression, Purification, and Concentration of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-(2684–2735) was propagated in BL21-Gold (DE3) Escherichia coli (Stratagene) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. After induction, bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in a lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25% lysozyme, 5 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, and a broad spectrum protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Bacteria were rotated at room temperature for 30 min then sonicated. Lysed bacteria were spun down at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was rotated overnight at 4 °C with 5 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were spun down, washed three times with PBS and resuspended in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione, 150 mm KCl). After overnight rotation at 4 °C the supernatant was removed and concentrated 10× using an Amicon-10 Ultra centrifugal device (Millipore, MA). Cleaved GST fusion protein was concentrated using Vivaspin 2 concentrators with a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (ISC BioExpress).Preparation of Microsomal Vesicles—COS-7 cells were harvested in isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA). The cell suspension was then lysed by 6–8 passes through a 26.5-gauge needle. Lysates were spun at 750 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were spun at 115,000 × g for 50 min. The pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer A for flux assays (500 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 300 mm KCl) or in resuspension buffer B for trypsin digestion (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH pH 7.6, 20 μm EGTA).Sephacryl S-200 Column—2–5 mg of cleaved and purified GST fusion protein was loaded onto the column. Fractions were eluted with a column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and 130 fractions were collected (1 ml/tube). 50–200 μl were removed from each fraction and assayed for protein. Fractions containing the eluted coiled-coil were pooled and concentrated for use in circular dichroism spectroscopy.Circular Dichroism—Far UV CD spectra from 190–250 nm (in steps of 1 nm) were obtained by averaging 2–5 scans on a CD spectrometer (Jasco J-810). The recordings were done with 0.45 mg/ml peptide in column elution buffer using a cuvette with a 1-mm path length. The helical content of the peptide was predicted by deconvolution of the spectra using Selcon3 (11Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar).Trypsin Digestion and Co-immunoprecipitation—Microsomal vesicles containing recombinant IP3Rs were incubated (0.25 μg/μl) in 200 μl of trypsin digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA). Trypsin was added to the vesicles at 4 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Microsomes were solubilized in 600 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and 10 μl of Staphylococcus aureus cell wall (Pansorbin cells; Calbiochem). The supernatants were collected after centrifugation (12,000 × g; 10 min) and 70 μl of PrA-Sepharose (20% slurry) and immunoprecipitating antibody were added for 4–16 h at 4 °C on a rocker. PrA-Sepharose beads were spun down and washed twice in solubilization buffer. Samples were quenched, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (unless stated otherwise).Trypsin Digestion in the Presence of a Cross-linking Reagent—Microsomal vesicles containing recombinant IP3Rs were incubated (0.5 μg/μl) in 100 μl of PBS with 0.7 mm dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) for 2 h. After the incubation, 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 was added to a concentration of 35 mm to stop the cross-linking reaction. An equal volume of trypsin digestion buffer was added, and microsomes were processed for trypsin digestion as described above. After immunoprecipitation, the protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were incubated an additional 15 min at 4 °C in 1% Zwittergent 3–14 to disrupt any non-covalent interactions. Samples were then washed in PBS and quenched in sample buffer supplemented with 10 mm DTT to ensure cleavage of the cross-linker.3H-IP3 Binding Assays—COS-7 cells from a 150-mm plate were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in 10 ml of HRB-HEDTA (20 mm Tris-HEPES pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm HEDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in 800 μl of HRB-HEDTA. The suspension was permeabilized by the addition of 40 μg saponin/mg protein. Saponin-treated cells (0.8 ml) were incubated with a medium containing 120 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HEPES (pH 7.2) and 10 nm [3H]IP3. Nonspecific binding was estimated by inclusion of 10 μm cold IP3. After 5 min on ice, the incubations were vacuum-filtered on type A/E glass fiber filters (Pall Corporation) and washed with 15 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Filters were counted in Budget-Solve complete counting mixture (Research Products International, Corp.).45Ca2+ Flux Assays—Assays were performed as previously described (12Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal vesicles prepared from COS-7 expressing SERCA2b and IP3R were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C in a 200 nm Ca2+ buffer supplemented with ATP and an ATP regenerating system, 45Ca2+, and 20 μm ruthenium red. 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated in the absence of any addition, 10 μm IP3, or 1 μm A23187. After incubation, microsomes were vacuum-filtered over a 0.3-μm filter (Millipore), washed (150 mm KCl), and filters were counted in Budget-Solve complete counting mixture (Research Products International, Corp.). Depending on the exact level of SERCA2b expression the 45Ca2+ counts accumulated in the vesicles ranged from 16,000 to 112,000 cpm in the absence of IP3 for all the constructs used in this study with the exception of TL-6. For the latter construct the accumulated counts were significantly lower (2342 ± 30.5 cpm, n = 4), which may indicate that TL-6 encodes a constitutively open channel.Membrane Attachment Assays—Microsomal vesicles were prepared from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with various IP3R constructs. 40 mg of vesicles were incubated in a buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 10 μg/ml of trypsin for 0–60 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After digestion the vesicles were spun down at 62,000 × g, and then pellets and supernatant fractions were quenched in SDS sample buffer and processed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, a single time point of 7 min of trypsin digestion was used for the quantitative analysis of point mutations. All mutants were run in parallel with LoopA so that the loss of fragment I could be compared for each mutant. After SDS-PAGE both the pellets and the supernatants were immunoblotted with NT-1, an N-terminal specific IP3R antibody. Densitometric analysis of bands was carried out using the program ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The loss of fragment I into the supernatant for each loop mutant was expressed as a percentage of the loss of fragment I for the LoopA mutant. For analysis of the tail-less mutants the TL-2 mutant was used as a normalization control.RESULTSAssembly Status of IP3R Mutants—Fig. 1A depicts a linear cartoon of the IP3R showing the three main functional domains. IP3Rs are cleaved by limited trypsin digestion into five distinct fragments (I-V) whose boundaries and molecular weights are labeled in Fig. 1A. We and Yoshikawa et al. (13Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that these five fragments remain bound to one another through non-covalent interactions after tryptic cleavage, such that immunoprecipitation of the 95-kDa tryptic fragment V with an antibody against the C terminus will co-immunoprecipitate the 40-kDa fragment I of an adjacent subunit in the tetramer (8Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that fragment I and V could be directly cross-linked indicating that they were within the cross-linking distance of ∼12 Å. GST pull-down assays using a GST-tagged LBD and various in vitro translated transmembrane segments from the channel domain, showed that the interacting sites within the channel domain resided downstream of S4 (i.e. between amino acids 2418 and 2749, see also Fig. 1B) (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Within these residues the only exposed cytosolic regions, which could be involved in the C-N interaction are the S4-S5 linker and C-terminal tail (Fig. 1B). To further narrow down the interaction site(s) we deleted 10 amino acids from the proximal or distal portion of the S4-S5 linker and also made progressive deletions of the C-terminal tail. All mutant constructs were tagged with an HA epitope for detection and immunoprecipitation. We refer to the S4-S5 linker mutants as ΔLoopA (Δ2418–2427) and ΔLoopB (Δ2428–2437), and the C-terminal tail deletions as “tail-less” mutants (TL-1 through TL-6) (Fig. 1B).Several criteria were used to ascertain if the mutations caused gross structural alterations of the protein. We employed size exclusion FPLC to determine if the mutants were able to form tetramers. Type I IP3R from rat cerebellum microsomes in the presence and absence of Zwittergent 3–14 were used as controls to distinguish the monomeric from the tetrameric fraction, respectively (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). All mutant constructs were able to form stable tetramers that peaked at fraction 24 (supplemental data, Fig. S1). These results were replicated using 5–20% sucrose density gradients (data not shown). Previous work had suggested that amino acids 2629–2654 in the C-terminal tail may be critical to the assembly of IP3Rs (14Galvan D.L. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48248-48260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both TL-5 and TL-6 retained the ability to form tetramers despite the absence of amino acids 2629–2654 (supplemental data, Fig. S1). Secondly, we tested the ability of each of the mutant constructs to be cleaved by trypsin using microsomal vesicles prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Previous studies have shown that mutant IP3R constructs with gross structural alterations produce aberrant trypsin cleavage patterns (7Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All the mutant constructs used in this study showed the expected pattern of cleavage into five fragments (data not shown).Limited Tryptic Digestion and Co-immunoprecipitation—We analyzed the C-N interaction of ΔLoopA, ΔLoopB, and TL-6 mutants employing a co-immunoprecipitation assay we have used previously (8Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All the mutants formed a 40-kDa N-terminal fragment I (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 7, and 10) and a ∼90–95-kDa HA-tagged C-terminal fragment V (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–20). As observed previously, the immunoprecipitation of wild-type (FL-HA) fragment V with HA antibody resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of fragment I (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This was also observed for TL-6, a mutant IP3R lacking 159 amino acids of the C-terminal tail (Fig. 2A, lane 11). From this result we conclude that the C-terminal tail region is not necessary for C-N interaction. The same procedure, however, showed that fragment I of the ΔLoopA and ΔLoopB mutants was not coprecipitated by HA-tagged fragment V (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 8). Dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) is a cross-linking reagent reactive toward lysines that has previously been shown to cross-link fragments V & I in a manner that survives immunoprecipitation in the presence of Zwittergent 3–14, a detergent that disrupts all intra- and intermolecular non-covalent interactions (9Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). If the loop mutants caused gross structural changes in the receptor, then DTSSP cross-linking of fragmentsV&I would be expected to be altered. Fig. 2A (lanes 6 and 9) shows this was not the case, indicating that the cross-linked lysine side chains in the two tryptic fragments remain within ∼12 Å in both loop mutants. These data suggest that the S4-S5 linker may be one major site of interaction between the ligand binding and channel domains. In the absence of cross-linking reagents, this interaction may be destabilized in the loop mutants during the prolonged period required for immunoprecipitation.FIGURE 2Co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking of tryptic fragment I by HA-tagged fragment V in type I IP3R deletion mutants. A, COS cells were transfected with FL-HA (wild type), ΔLoopA, ΔLoopB, or TL-6. Microsomal vesicles were prepared and digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures” in a final volume of 400 μl (0.125 μg of protein/μl). An aliquot (5 μg of protein) of each digestion was saved for immunoblot analysis (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The remaining digested IP3R was subjected to immunoprecipitation with HA mAb and protein A-Sepharose for 4–16 h at 4 °C (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). Alternatively, vesicles were cross-linked with 0.7 mm DTSSP for 2 h on ice prior to trypsin digestion and immunoprecipitation (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Lanes 13–20 show analysis of lysates by immunoblotting with HA mAb and indicate that fragment V is formed normally in the loop and tail-less mutants. B, WT and loop mutant cDNA were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The cells were permeabilized with saponin, and binding was measured with a subsaturating concentration of [3H]IP3 (10 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of the loop mutants was quantified densitometrically from immunoblots and expressed as a ratio (R) relative to the WT receptor. The binding values of the loop mutants were divided by R to correct for small variations in expression (16Joseph S.K. Brownell S. Khan M.T. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). WT binding values were between 0.8–1 pmol/mg protein. Data are the means ± S.E. of 6–8 independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fragment I (amino acids 1–340) encompasses the entire suppressor domain (amino acids 1–223) as well as some of the IP3 binding core (amino acids 224–576) (5Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that a loss of C-N interaction could affect the IP3 binding characteristics of the IP3R. We performed [3H]IP3 binding assays on each of our constructs as previously described (16Joseph S.K. Brownell S. Khan M.T. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To correct for different expression levels the data were normalized to the binding and expression levels of wild-type type I IP3R measured in parallel. Both loop deletions displayed statistically significant increases in the binding of IP3 relative to the wild-type IP3R (Fig. 2B). The finding that deletions made to the S4-S5 linker have effects on the binding of IP3 to the receptor is consistent with an interaction between these two domains and suggests that the C-N interaction may indirectly affect the structure of the N-terminal LBD. None of the tail-less mutants tested showed any significant changes in [3H]IP3 binding (data not shown; for TL-5 see also Refs. 7Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Structural and Functional Characterization of Loop Mutants—Previous studies have shown that a major proportion of the cleaved fragment I remains associated with the membrane fraction after trypsin digestion (8Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). If the interaction between fragment I and fragment V is weakened in the loop mutants we would predict that a greater proportion of fragment I would be released into the supernatant. To test this, the supernatants of trypsin treated microsomal vesicles expressing FL-HA, ΔLoopA or ΔLoopB were assayed for fragment I. FL-HA had almost no loss of fragment I from the membrane after 60 min of trypsin digestion (Fig. 3A). However, fragment I dissociated from the membrane in a time-dependent manner in both ΔLoopA and ΔLoopB mutants (Fig. 3A). The results observed with the loop mutants in membrane attachment assays are consistent with the findings obtained in co-immunoprecipitation assays and suggest that C-N interactions are weakened by deletions made within the S4-S5 linker.FIGURE 3Assessment of the stability of the C-N interaction and functional analysis of S4-S5 linker mutations. A, microsomal vesicles expressing wild type, ΔLoopA, or ΔLoopB IP3Rs were treated with trypsin for 0–60 min. The reaction was quenched, and pellets and supernatants were separated and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2090433709,"ErbB-4 is cleaved by α- and γ-secretases to release a soluble 80-kDa intracellular domain, termed s80, which translocates to the nucleus. s80 is present in the nucleus of normal and cancerous mammary cells and is predicted to have a role in cell differentiation. To further investigate the mechanism by which s80 may mediate differentiation, we tested whether s80 regulates Eto2, a transcriptional corepressor that is involved in erythrocyte differentiation and is also implicated in human breast cancer. Here we show that ligand binding to ErbB-4 causes s80 translocation to the nucleus, where it colocalizes and interacts with Eto2. Expression of s80 blocks Eto2-mediated transcriptional repression of a heterologous promoter. This effect on Eto2 does not require s80 kinase activity and is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of s80. Although other cell surface receptors regulate transcription by activating signal transduction cascades, these data present a novel mechanism of corepressor regulation and suggest a role for Eto2 in ErbB-4-dependent differentiation. ErbB-4 is cleaved by α- and γ-secretases to release a soluble 80-kDa intracellular domain, termed s80, which translocates to the nucleus. s80 is present in the nucleus of normal and cancerous mammary cells and is predicted to have a role in cell differentiation. To further investigate the mechanism by which s80 may mediate differentiation, we tested whether s80 regulates Eto2, a transcriptional corepressor that is involved in erythrocyte differentiation and is also implicated in human breast cancer. Here we show that ligand binding to ErbB-4 causes s80 translocation to the nucleus, where it colocalizes and interacts with Eto2. Expression of s80 blocks Eto2-mediated transcriptional repression of a heterologous promoter. This effect on Eto2 does not require s80 kinase activity and is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of s80. Although other cell surface receptors regulate transcription by activating signal transduction cascades, these data present a novel mechanism of corepressor regulation and suggest a role for Eto2 in ErbB-4-dependent differentiation. ErbB-4 (also known as HER4) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell differentiation in the mammary gland as well as other cell types (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ErbB-4 is activated by the binding of heregulins (also known as neuregulins), which provokes ErbB-4 homo- or heterodimerization (predominantly with ErbB-2). Dimerization allows tyrosine autophosphorylation of the ErbB-4 carboxyl-terminal region and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 2The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; PLC, phospholipase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ICD, intracellular domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CT, carboxyl-terminal region; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; IP, immunoprecipitation. phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), and phospholipase C (PLC-γ) (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ErbB-4 is sequentially cleaved by two proteases following ligand binding or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment. The first cleavage step involves tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, which cleaves within the extracellular juxtamembrane region between His-651 and Ser-652 (2Cheng Q.C. Tikhomirov O. Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38421-38427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), releasing the extracellular domain and leaving a membrane-bound intracellular domain (ICD), termed m80 (2Cheng Q.C. Tikhomirov O. Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38421-38427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The m80 fragment is subsequently cleaved within its membrane region by a γ-secretase complex to produce a soluble ICD termed s80. s80 is localized in both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The ability of ErbB-4 to regulate differentiation, particularly in the mammary gland, is attributed to s80 localization in the nucleus (4Long W. Wagner K.U. Lloyd K.C. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). ErbB-4 levels increase during mammary gland lactogenesis, and nuclear ErbB-4 is observed in lactating but not normal gland (4Long W. Wagner K.U. Lloyd K.C. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role, genetic studies have shown that ErbB-4 is necessary for lactogenesis (4Long W. Wagner K.U. Lloyd K.C. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Also, in cell culture, ErbB-4 activation provokes differentiation of breast cancer cells (5Sartor C.I. Zhou H. Kozlowska E. Guttridge K. Kawata E. Caskey L. Harrelson J. Hynes N. Ethier S. Calvo B. Earp III, H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4265-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Whether ErbB-4 or s80 confers a positive or negative prognosis in breast cancer patients is unclear (6Gullick W.J. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, the cleavable ErbB-4 isoform, JMa, which is specifically overexpressed in breast cancers, increases cell growth (7Maatta J.A. Sundvall M. Junttila T.T. Peri L. Laine V.J. Isola J. Egeblad M. Elenius K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Also, breast cancer cells containing nuclear ErbB-4 are more differentiated than those without nuclear ErbB-4 (8Srinivasan R. Poulsom R. Hurst H.C. Gullick W.J. J. Pathol. 1998; 185: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further understanding of s80 function will help clarify the role of ErbB-4 in breast cancer and normal cell differentiation. Eto2 (also known as MTG16 or CBFA2T3) is a nuclear transcriptional corepressor involved in breast cancer and normal cell differentiation. It is expressed in normal breast epithelial cells (9Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J.

Linggi and G. Carpenter, unpublished observations. and is a candidate tumor suppressor due to it being a target of loss of heterozygosity at 16q24.3, which is common in breast cancer (9Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Cornelisse C. Whitmore S.A. Crawford J. Kremmidiotis G. Sutherland G.R. Callen D.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4599-4604PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Eto2 regulates differentiation during erythropoiesis by repressing genes important for cell differentiation (10Schuh A.H. Tipping A.J. Clark A.J. Hamlett I. Guyot B. Iborra F.J. Rodriguez P. Strouboulis J. Enver T. Vyas P. Porcher C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10235-10250Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Goardon N. Lambert J.A. Rodriguez P. Nissaire P. Herblot S. Thibault P. Dumenil D. Strouboulis J. Romeo P.H. Hoang T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, little is known concerning how Eto2 function is regulated during cell growth and differentiation. Thus, both ErbB-4 and Eto2 are described as having a role in both breast cancer and differentiation; however, the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ErbB-4 regulates Eto2 function. This was examined by assessing the ability of these proteins to interact and determining whether ErbB-4 can regulate Eto2-mediated transcriptional repression. Materials—Antibodies ErbB-4 (sc-283, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or FLAG-M2-agarose (A2220, Sigma) were used for immunoprecipitations. Membranes were blotted with antibodies to ErbB-4 (rabbit polyclonal from M. Kraus, University of Alabama-Birmingham), FLAG (F3165, Sigma), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40), tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8035), PLC-γ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-81), phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, PY99), and GAL4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-577). For immunofluorescence, Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40) or V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used followed by anti-mouse TRITC antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Propidium iodide was purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatments—Cos7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium with 10% fetal calf serum. HC11 cells were maintained as described previously (12Jankiewicz M. Groner B. Desrivieres S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 10.1210/me.2006-0071PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Polyfect (Qiagen). Cells were treated with either TPA (100 ng/ml, Sigma) or heregulin 1β (Hrg1β 50 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for 1 h. Plasmids—FLAG-s80-cyt2 was created by PCR amplifying the region corresponding to residues 676–1292 of GFP-s80-Cyt2 (3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) and inserting it into the BglII and SalI of pCMV-FLAG2 (Sigma). FLAG-s80-Cyt1 was created by exchanging the KpnI to PstI region with the corresponding region from pCDNA3 ErbB-4-JmA/Cyt1 (provided by Klaus Elenius, University of Turku, Finland). FLAG-s80-K751R was created by using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) to change nucleotides AAG to AAA at residue 751–753 of ErbB-4 using FLAG-s80-Cyt2 as a template. FLAG-s80KD was created by amplifying the regions corresponding to residues 676–988, with the addition of the restriction sites BglII and SalI, and inserting the regions into BglII and SalI of pCMV-FLAG2. Similarly, FLAG-s80CT was created by amplifying the regions corresponding to residues 989–1292 (does not contain the Cyt1 region). Unless otherwise noted, the Cyt2 isoform of s80 was used. Myc-Eto2 and Gal4-Eto2 were provided by S. Hiebert (13Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Human V5-ETO2 (MTG16) was provided by N. Sacchi (14Hoogeveen A.T. Rossetti S. Stoyanova V. Schonkeren J. Fenaroli A. Schiaffonati L. van Unen L. Sacchi N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6703-6712Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared with TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4 min) to remove insoluble material. To obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates, cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min), and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (10 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, plus inhibitors as above) including 1% Igepal, vortexed, and then centrifuged (400 × g for 5 min). The supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction; the pellet was washed in Buffer B and then centrifuged (400 × g for 5 min). The pellet was then resuspended TGH buffer plus inhibitors and sonicated to release nuclear proteins. Both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions were then centrifuged (13,000 rpm for 10 min), and the pellet was discarded. For phosphotyrosine analysis of Myc-Eto2, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.1% Igepal, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in phosphate-buffered saline + inhibitors as above), sonicated, and centrifuged. The protein levels in the lysates were quantitated using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For fractionation experiments, three times the amount of protein was used in immunoprecipitation for the cytoplasmic fraction relative to the nuclear fraction to account for the different sizes of these cellular compartments. These lysates were precipitated with the indicated antibodies for 1–2 h followed by the addition of protein-A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min. The antibody-Sepharose complexes were washed three times in TGH buffer plus inhibitors. Complexes and lysates (equal to 5% of the volume immunoprecipitated) were incubated (70 °C for 10 min) in 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), separated on a 4–12% gel (Invitrogen Novex Midi gel), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the addition of secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells were transferred into 4-well chamber slides (Labtek) the day after transfection. The next day, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween. Myc-Eto2 was detected using Myc antibody and human V5-tagged ETO2 with V5 antibody followed by anti-mouse TRITC secondary antibody. The slides were mounted with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and images were obtained under ×40 magnification with additional digital zoom on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a pinhole size set to 1 Airy unit. Reporter Assays—Cos7 or HC11 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 0.01 μg pCMV-Renilla, 0.29 μg Gal-TK-luciferase (firefly), 0.3 μg GAL4-Eto2, the indicated expression plasmids for ErbB-4-s80, and empty pCMV-FLAG2 to a total of 1.5 μg of DNA. Two days later, a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) was used to calculate luciferase activity, which was adjusted to control for transfection efficiency by dividing the luciferase value by the Renilla value of the sample. Fold repression is calculated by dividing the control value by the sample value. Total lysates or nuclear fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. ErbB-4 is cleaved following stimulation of cells with either TPA or heregulin (3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), releasing the s80 intracellular domain into the cytoplasm and nucleus. To determine whether s80 generated from ErbB-4 colocalizes with Eto2, a nuclear corepressor, Cos7 cells were transfected with both ErbB-4-GFP and murine Myc-Eto2 and treated with TPA or heregulin, and ErbB-4 and Eto2 localization was visualized using confocal microscopy. Without treatment, ErbB-4-GFP was localized to the plasma membrane (and Golgi), and Myc-Eto2 was nuclear (Fig. 1). Following treatment with either TPA or heregulin, ErbB-4-GFP, likely in the form of s80 (3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), was present in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1). s80 and Eto2 were both present in many regions of the nucleus, showing an overlap between s80 (GFP) and Myc-Eto2 (Fig. 1, red) signals. This demonstrates that ErbB-4 stimulation allows s80 to transport to the nucleus and colocalize with the corepressor Eto2. Given that the GFP tag that is used in the above assays has weak dimerization properties (15Shaner N.C. Steinbach P.A. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar), the localization of GFP-tagged and untagged s80 was compared and found to be indistinguishable (data not shown). Nuclear corepressors are regulated by extracellular signals that are transmitted to the nucleus via signaling cascades (16Jonas B.A. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54676-54686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells expressing ErbB-4 with either TPA or heregulin would, in addition to causing ErbB-4 cleavage and s80 formation, also activate either protein kinase C or signaling cascades downstream of ErbB-3 or ErbB-1 (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether formation of s80 alone is sufficient for colocalization with Eto2, cells were co-transfected with GFP-s80 and Myc-Eto2, and their respective localization was examined in the absence of heregulin or TPA. In these cells, GFP-s80 and Myc-Eto2 colocalized in the nucleus similar to that observed with cells expressing ErbB-4-GFP after treatment with TPA or heregulin (Fig. 2A). These data reveal that s80 expression alone, in the absence of other signals, leads to colocalization of s80 and Eto2 and suggests that s80 might regulate Eto2 function through a direct mechanism. In the mouse, ErbB-4 and Eto2 are expressed in many tissues, including the breast, brain, and heart (17Davis J.N. McGhee L. Meyers S. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In view of the known functions of ErbB-4 and Eto2 in human breast physiology and cancer, we tested whether human ETO2 (also known as CBFA2T3 or MTG16), which shares 86% identity with mouse Eto (17Davis J.N. McGhee L. Meyers S. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), also colocalizes with s80 in the nucleus. Cells were transfected with GFP-s80 and V5-tagged ETO2 and then stained with V5 antibody. In these experiments, GFP-s80 and V5-ETO2 colocalized in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), similar to that observed with murine Eto2 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that s80 can colocalize with either mouse or human Eto2. Since s80 and Eto2 colocalize in the nucleus, we next tested whether s80 interacts with Myc-Eto2. Cells expressing both s80 and Myc-ETO2 were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and precipitated with an antibody to an epitope in the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-4. Although only 5–10% of s80 was present in the nuclear fraction, it coprecipitated with Myc-Eto2 (Fig. 3A). s80 also interacted with human V5-ETO2, indicating that, similar to the colocalization experiments, this interaction is conserved. (Fig. 3B). To verify specificity of the antibody, Myc-Eto2 was expressed in the absence of s80 and did not precipitate with the ErbB-4 antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). Together, these results show that s80 interacts with Eto2 in the nucleus. s80 contains an active tyrosine kinase domain that autophosphorylates its carboxyl-terminal region (CT) (19Linggi B. Cheng Q.C. Rao A.R. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)(Fig. 4A). This phosphorylated CT can serve as a docking site for both phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins and SH2 domain-containing proteins in the context of full-length ErbB-1 (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). s80 can also phosphorylate substrates, including Mdm2 (20Arasada R.R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30783-30787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether kinase activity or a phosphorylated CT is required for s80 to interact with Eto2, the mutant s80 protein, s80K751R, which lacks both tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylated CT tyrosine residues (due to the lack of kinase activity), was utilized (20Arasada R.R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30783-30787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To characterize this mutant, we first tested whether s80K751R enters the nucleus since nuclear localization is required for the interaction between s80 and Eto2 (Fig. 3). Cells were transfected with GFP-s80K751R and wild type GFP-s80, and the localization was examined. Similar to GFP-s80, GFP-s80K751R localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that neither kinase activity nor CT phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear localization (Fig. 4B). Next, s80K751R was tested for its ability to interact with Eto2. Cells were transfected with s80K751R (or wild type s80 as a positive control) and Eto2, separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, precipitated with ErbB-4 antibodies, and analyzed by immunoblotting for Eto2. In these experiments, s80K751R and wild type s80 were associated with similar amounts of Eto2 (Fig. 5A). Additionally, Eto2 was not phosphorylated in cells expressing wild type s80 (data not shown). Thus, neither kinase activity nor CT phosphorylation is required for the interaction between s80 and Eto2, and Eto2 is not a substrate for s80 kinase activity. In an effort to determine how s80 might regulate Eto2, we mapped the region of s80 required to interact with Eto2. s80 retains three distinct regions of ErbB-4: a short juxtamembrane sequence, an active tyrosine kinase domain, and a CT region (Fig. 4A). Due to alternative splicing, the CT is present as either a Cyt1 isoform, containing a 16-residue sequence, including a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binding motif, or a Cyt2 isoform, which lacks this sequence (21Sawyer C. Hiles I. Page M. Crompton M. Dean C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Also, a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within the juxtamembrane region of ErbB-4 is reported to be required for s80 nuclear localization (22Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether Eto2 differentially interacts with the Cyt1 and Cyt2 isoforms of s80. Cells expressing each isoform and Myc-Eto2 were fractionated, precipitated with ErbB-4 antibodies, and immunoblotted for Myc-Eto2. We found that Eto2 was associated with similar levels of s80Cyt1 and s80Cyt2 (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that both isoforms can associate with Eto2. Next, s80 mutants composed of either the juxtamembrane and kinase domain (s80KD) or the CT region (s80CT) were created (Fig. 4A). A FLAG epitope was added to the amino terminus of each construct to facilitate detection. While characterizing these mutants, we found that a larger percentage of the total amount of s80KD is in the nucleus when compared with the percentage of wild type s80 in the nucleus (Fig. 5B). Also, although the s80CT domain lacks the NLS in the juxtamembrane region, it is still localized in the nucleus as measured by either cell fractionation (Fig. 5B) or cell fluorescence (Ref. 3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar and data not shown). This suggests that, in the absence of the putative NLS, s80CT utilizes another NLS or enters the nucleus via non-NLS mediated transport. These mutants were then tested for their ability to interact with Eto2. In these assays, both wild type s80 and s80CT interacted with Eto2 in the nucleus and, although it had the highest amount of protein in the nucleus of all s80 mutants tested, s80KD did not associate with Eto2 (Fig. 5B). Thus, the CT region of s80 is sufficient to interact with Eto2. Although Eto2 functions as a non-DNA binding transcriptional corepressor in hematopoietic cells (10Schuh A.H. Tipping A.J. Clark A.J. Hamlett I. Guyot B. Iborra F.J. Rodriguez P. Strouboulis J. Enver T. Vyas P. Porcher C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10235-10250Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Goardon N. Lambert J.A. Rodriguez P. Nissaire P. Herblot S. Thibault P. Dumenil D. Strouboulis J. Romeo P.H. Hoang T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the target genes regulated by Eto2 in the mammary gland are not known. Therefore, to address the possible functional consequence of the s80 interaction with Eto2, we tested whether s80 could alter GAL4-Eto2-dependent repression of a heterologous promoter. Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing multimerized binding sites for GAL4 and empty vector, GAL4-Eto2, or GAL4-Eto2 and s80. Transfection of GAL4-Eto2 reduced transcription (as measured by luciferase activity) by ∼20-fold (13Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). When s80 was co-transfected, GAL4-Eto2-mediated repression was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). s80 also reduced GAL4-Eto2-mediated repression in HC11 cells, a normal mouse mammary gland cell line (data not shown). As a control, we note that s80 did not have a significant effect on luciferase activity in the absence of GAL4-Eto2 (data not shown). In addition, the overall level of Gal4-Eto2 expression did not change, indicating that this regulation is not due to a reduction of total Gal4-Eto2 levels (Fig. 6A). Previous studies using GAL4 transfection assays with the ICDs of ErbB-4 and ErbB-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) have shown that only the CT fragments regulate transcription, whereas the intact ICDs (corresponding to ErbB-4 s80) do not (3Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 23Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Therefore, s80 inhibition of Eto2-mediated repression is unique in that the intact ICD can regulate transcription. Although kinase activity is not required for s80 to interact with Eto2 (Fig. 5A), it remained possible that s80 kinase activity is necessary to block Eto2-mediated repression. To test this, s80K751R was co-transfected with GAL4-Eto2, and the luciferase values were measured. In these experiments, s80K751R reduced Gal4-Eto2-mediated repression to levels equivalent to the effect of wild type s80 (Fig. 6B), indicating that kinase activity is dispensable for s80 inhibition of Eto2-mediated repression. In view of the fact that the CT of s80 is sufficient for the interaction between s80 and Eto2 and kinase activity is not required for s80 reduction of Gal4-Eto2 repression, we next tested whether the CT is sufficient to reduce Gal4-Eto2-mediated repression. FLAG-s80, FLAG-s80KD, and FLAG-s80CT were co-transfected with Gal4-Eto2 into cells, and the luciferase values were measured. In this assay, both wild type s80 and s80CT reduced Gal4-Eto2-mediated repression, whereas s80KD was severely impaired (Fig. 6C). Thus, s80CT is sufficient to interact with Eto2 and to functionally reduce Gal4-Eto2-mediated repression. The kinase domain is not necessary for these functions, thereby identifying a novel, kinase-independent mechanism of Eto2 inhibition. Here we show that ErbB-4 regulates Eto2 function. The mechanism involves a nuclear interaction between s80 and Eto2 that is sufficient to reduce Eto2-mediated repression. The evidence that this mechanism involves a nuclear interaction between s80 and Eto2 is that both proteins colocalize (Fig. 2) and interact (Fig. 3) in the nucleus. Also, s80 does not require the kinase domain to block Eto2-mediated repression (Fig. 6, B and C), eliminating the possibility that ErbB-4 regulates Eto2 by phosphorylating and activating a signaling cascade. These data present a novel mechanism to regulate Eto2 function. Others have shown that receptor tyrosine kinases can regulate corepressors by activating signaling cascades. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor, through activation of ERK, activates the thyroid hormone receptor by inhibiting nuclear corepressor/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (NCoR/SMRT) (16Jonas B.A. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54676-54686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and in Drosophila, ErbB-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) activates Notch by blocking the corepressor Groucho (24Hasson P. Egoz N. Winkler C. Volohonsky G. Jia S. Dinur T. Volk T. Courey A.J. Paroush Z. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) activates promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription by inhibiting SMRT (25Takahashi S. McConnell M.J. Harigae H. Kaku M. Sasaki T. Melnick A.M. Licht J.D. Blood. 2004; 103: 4650-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In each of the above examples, corepressor function is reduced by intact receptor activating a signaling cascade, typically involving ERK and, ultimately, phosphorylation of the corepressor. In contrast, we find that ErbB-4 regulates transcription by undergoing ligand-mediated proteolysis and transport to the nucleus, where it interacts with Eto2 (Figs. 1, 3, and 6). A similar pathway has recently been described for the plasma membrane protein CKIP-1, which is cleaved by caspase-3 to release carboxyl-terminal fragments that regulate AP-1 activity (26Zhang L. Xing G. Tie Y. Tang Y. Tian C. Li L. Sun L. Wei H. Zhu Y. He F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 766-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although others have demonstrated a role for phosphorylation and/or export of corepressors, we find that Eto2 is not phosphorylated by s80 (data not shown), nor is the kinase domain necessary for inhibition of Eto2 repression (Fig. 6). Additionally, we did not observe Eto2 export from the nucleus (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5). Currently, studies are ongoing investigating whether s80 sterically or allosterically disrupts interactions between Eto2 and other corepressors. ErbB-4 regulation of Eto2 may be important for controlling differentiation in many cell types. Eto2 is expressed in multiple tissues (27Davis J.N. Williams B.J. Herron J.T. Galiano F.J. Meyers S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and loss of Eto2 function or expression may be involved in breast cancer progression or initiation (9Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Cornelisse C. Whitmore S.A. Crawford J. Kremmidiotis G. Sutherland G.R. Callen D.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4599-4604PubMed Google Scholar). To date, however, its function has only been clearly described in erythropoietic progenitors, in which ErbB-4 is not expressed. In these cells, Eto2 is a key member of a multiprotein transcription complex including T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia/stem cell leukemia (TAL1/SCL), HeLa E-Box-binding protein (HEB), LM02, mSin3a, and Gfi1-b, which together regulate the transcription of differentiation-specific genes (10Schuh A.H. Tipping A.J. Clark A.J. Hamlett I. Guyot B. Iborra F.J. Rodriguez P. Strouboulis J. Enver T. Vyas P. Porcher C. Mol. Cell.

Reducing the amount of Eto2 in these complexes increases gene transcription and, conversely, increasing the levels of Eto2 reduces transcription (10Schuh A.H. Tipping A.J. Clark A.J. Hamlett I.

Beyond regulating Eto2, other Eto2 family members might be regulated by s80 since s80 also interacts with both Eto and Mtgr1. 4B. Linggi and G. Carpenter, unpublished data. Eto2 family members contain conserved Nervy homology domains 1–4, and each binds a similar set of corepressors (13Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17Davis J.N. McGhee L. Meyers S. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Eto interacts with the DNA binding transcription factors PLZF and Gfi-1b (17Davis J.N. McGhee L. Meyers S. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Eto and Mtgr1 are expressed in many tissues, and in some cases, are expressed in the same cell type (27Davis J.N. Williams B.J. Herron J.T. Galiano F.J. Meyers S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In gene deletion experiments, Eto was necessary for gut development (28Calabi F. Pannell R. Pavloska G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Mtgr1 was necessary in the development of the small intestine (29Amann J.M. Chyla B.J. Ellis T.C. Martinez A. Moore A.C. Franklin J.L. McGhee L. Meyers S. Ohm J.E. Luce K.S. Ouelette A.J. Washington M.K. Thompson M.A. King D. Gautam S. Coffey R.J. Whitehead R.H. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9576-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This suggests that although similar, each Eto family member has distinct roles and that in some instances, these processes might be regulated by ErbB-4. Since the discovery that ErbB-4 is proteolytically cleaved and translocates to the nucleus, a number of s80-interacting proteins have been identified. Among these are Mdm2 (20Arasada R.R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30783-30787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Stat5 (22Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activation of the differentiation gene β-casein requires STAT5 phosphorylation and s80 nuclear translocation (22Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Two WW domain-containing proteins, Wwox and Yes-associated protein (YAP) (30Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), interact with PXXP motifs in the carboxyl terminus of s80. Wwox interacts with s80 in the cytoplasm (31Aqeilan R.I. Donati V. Palamarchuk A. Trapasso F. Kaou M. Pekarsky Y. Sudol M. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6764-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas YAP interacts with s80 in the nucleus, where together they synergize to activate transcription (30Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33334-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because Eto2 can be part of multiprotein transcriptional complexes, it is possible that proteins that interact with s80 might be part of the same complex or compete with one another for s80 binding. We did not observe an effect of Eto2 on β-casein promoter activity,4 suggesting that the STAT5 and Eto2 pathways are independent. Further investigation is required to test the role of these proteins on ErbB-4 function. Although ErbB-4 is not expressed in hematopoietic cells, including erythropoietic progenitors, ErbB-4 regulation of Eto2 may similarly regulate differentiation in other cell types. ErbB-4 and Eto2 are both expressed in the normal mammary gland, and changes in the levels of both proteins have been linked to breast cancer (6Gullick W.J. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E.

ErbB-4 is in the nucleus of the lactating mammary gland, and ErbB-4-deficient mice do not undergo lactogenesis (4Long W. Wagner K.U. Lloyd K.C. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Eto2 is expressed in normal mammary gland cells and is underexpressed or deleted in many breast cancers (9Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Cornelisse C. Whitmore S.A. Crawford J. Kremmidiotis G. Sutherland G.R. Callen D.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4599-4604PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that Eto2 may be a key target of s80 function in the mammary gland. In conclusion, our data that ErbB-4 s80 regulates Eto2 present a novel mechanism to regulate corepressor function. In addition, it implies that ErbB-4 and Eto2 are linked in the same pathway to regulate cell differentiation and that this pathway might be deregulated in cancer. We thank Dr. S. Hiebert for helpful discussions, reading the manuscript, and providing reagents and Dr. N. Sacchi and Dr. S. Earp III for providing reagents."

A theory based on the interaction of magnons with longitudinal spin fluctuations provides an excellent, parameter-free description of the data, except at the lowest momenta and temperatures. This is surprising, given the prominence of alternative theories based on magnon-magnon interactions in the literature. The results and technique open up a new avenue for the investigation of fundamental concepts in magnetism. The technique also allows measurement of the lifetimes of other elementary excitations (such as lattice vibrations) throughout the Brillouin zone."

The heterotrimeric complex of peptide-MHC consists of a polymorphic heavy chain (∼45 kDa) with three domains (α1, α2, and α3), an invariant light chain called β2-microglobulin (12 kDa), and an 8- to 10-amino acid peptide. The peptide binds within a cleft formed by the membrane distal α1 and α2 domains. The peptide, together with helices from the α1 and α2 domains, are recognized by the T-cell receptor (TCR). The MHC locus is the most highly polymorphic gene locus known, with hundreds of different MHC alleles at each of three class I MHC loci: in humans, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C and in mice, H-2K, H-2D, and H-2L (although H-2L is absent in many strains of mice) (1Kulski J.K. Shiina T. Anzai T. Kohara S. Inoko H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 190: 95-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This allelic variation has important immunological consequences, affecting peptide binding, thymic repertoire selection, and allograft rejection (2Reche P.A. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 623-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that some human MHC alleles are associated with disease susceptibility or resistance (3Vukmanovic S. Neubert T.A. Santori F.R. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Shiina T. Inoko H. Kulski J.K. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 64: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, there is considerable interest in understanding the diversity of structures and the peptide-binding features represented by this class of proteins. Polymorphisms of class I MHC proteins are primarily localized to the peptide binding pocket, where the cleft is formed by two parallel α helices and the floor is formed by a β-pleated sheet (5Bjorkman P.J.

Tissue Antigens. 1998; 51: 417-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Amino acid differences influence the shape of the pocket as well as the set of peptides that a particular MHC allele will bind. MHC class I genes have evolved many allelic variants to protect the population against pathogens which have developed mechanisms to evade the immune system (2Reche P.A. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 623-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Collectively, MHC polymorphisms have yielded a diverse array of proteins with varying degrees of stability. Less stable MHC complexes have been difficult to study biochemically and structurally. Various efforts have been made to generate single-chain forms of class I complexes, with some success (reviewed in Ref. 8Hansen T.H. Lybarger L. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2006; 55: 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For example, a single-chain trimer consisting of peptide-linker-β2m-linker-heavy chain has been shown to be expressed as a stable complex on the surface of target cells (9Yu Y.Y. Netuschil N. Lybarger L. Connolly J.M. Hansen T.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3145-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Methods. 2003; 272: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), few studies have used directed evolution approaches to engineer more stable MHC molecules (14Starwalt S.E. Masteller E.L.

Bioeng. 2005; 92: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this regard, H-2Ld has been shown through both biochemical and structural studies to be less stable than many other MHC complexes. For example, Ld is expressed on the surface of splenocytes at 3- to 4-fold lower levels than the class I products Kd and Dd (17Potter T.A. Hansen T.H. Habbersett R. Ozato K. Ahmed A. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 580-584PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 431-435PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this difference, Beck et al. (19Beck J.C. Hansen T.H. Cullen S.E. Lee D.R. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 916-923PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Ld complexes exhibited slower intracellular processing and weaker association with β2m compared with Kd and Dd. A chimera combining the N-terminal Dd domain (α1/α2) and the C-terminal Ld domain (α3) exhibited the same rate of intracellular processing and level of association with β2m as Dd. This result suggests that the α1 and/or α2 domains influence the stability of the Ld complex (19Beck J.C. Hansen T.H. Cullen S.E. Lee D.R. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 916-923PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, using multiple chimeras of Ld and Lq, a single amino acid at residue 97 of the Ld complex was shown to be responsible for decreased cell surface expression of Ld and its lower affinity for β2m (20Smith R.A. Myers N.B. Robinson M. Hansen T.H. Lee D.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of Ld, complexed with an endogenous peptide p29 (YPNVNIHNF) (21Balendiran G.K. Solheim J.C. Young A.C. Hansen T.H. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6880-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or with a mixture of peptides (22Speir J.A. Garcia K.C. Brunmark A. Degano M. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have been solved, providing insight into the weaker association of β2m and the generally low affinity of peptides for Ld. Balendiran et al. (21Balendiran G.K. Solheim J.C. Young A.C. Hansen T.H. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6880-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggested that the structural instability of the Ld-β2m complex is due to the unique orientation of the α1/α2 domains relative to β2m and that this orientation causes a loss of productive contacts between α1/α2 and β2m. For example, a comparison of the intermolecular interactions, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonds between α1/α2 and β2m for three different MHC complexes, Kb,Db, and Ld revealed 17, 21, and 6 contacts, respectively. Structural features of the peptide binding cleft influence peptide selection and peptide binding affinity, and these properties can also influence the stability of the peptide-MHC complex. The Ld-β2m protein binds octamer or nonomer peptides with anchor residues of proline at peptide position 2 (P2) and leucine, methionine, or phenylalanine at the C-terminal position (23Corr M. Boyd L.F. Frankel S.R. Kozlowski S. Padlan E.A. Margulies D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, peptides that lack proline at P2 have also been identified as Ld-binding peptides (e.g. tum-, TQNHRALDL and p2CA, LSPFPFDL, a peptide recognized by the 2C TCR used in the present studies) (24Lurquin C.

Eisen H.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The peptide binding pocket for proline exhibits less shape complementarity than other MHC alleles with a proline anchor residue at P2 (26Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Harlos K. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Also, the peptide binding pocket of Ld is composed of more hydrophobic residues than other MHC complexes, limiting the possible number of hydrogen bonds that can form between the peptide and α1/α2 residues. Finally, a central bulge from the floor of the peptide binding cleft in Ld prevents peptides from having a central, stabilizing anchor residue as has been observed in Kb and other class I molecules (22Speir J.A. Garcia K.C. Brunmark A. Degano M. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These characteristics most likely contribute to the lower affinities of peptides for Ld. It has been suggested that these unique features of the Ld-β2m complex provide an alternative mechanism to the classic antigen presentation pathway (26Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Harlos K. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27Hansen T. Balendiran G. Solheim J. Ostrov D. Nathenson S. Immunol.

Notwithstanding the physiological function, the instability of peptide·Ld-β2m complexes has been problematic in attempts to examine structural features of this system. 5L. L. Jones, S. E. Brophy, A. J. Bankovich, L. A. Colf, N. A. Hanick, K. C. Garcia, and D. M. Kranz, unpublished observations. In the present study, Ld mutants were engineered to overcome stability problems by a process of directed evolution. Randomly mutated Ld-β2m products were displayed as single-chain fusions on the surface of yeast. Stabilized mutants of Ld, complexed with the Ld-binding peptide QL9 (QLSPFPFDL) (28Sykulev Y. Brunmark A. Tsomides T.J. Kageyama S. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Eisen H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11487-11491Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), were selected by flow cytometric sorting using anti-Ld antibodies and a soluble QL9·Ld-specific high affinity TCR (29Holler P.D. Holman P.O. Shusta E.V. O'Herrin S. Wittrup K.D. Kranz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5387-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This approach yielded several mutants, including a stabilized, single-chain MHC module consisting of only the α1/α2 peptide binding domains. The α1/α2 module was capable of binding QL9, and QL9·Ld-specific TCRs bound to the QL9-α1/α2 complex with the same affinities as wild-type QL9·Ld complex on the cell surface. Bacterial expression and characterization of soluble complexes of the QL9-α1/α2-Ld module indicated that they could be bound by soluble TCRs with affinities similar to full-length peptide·Ld complexes. The results demonstrate that class I MHC can be engineered to generate more stable complexes and that individual peptide-binding domains can be produced for biochemical and structural studies. Peptides and Antibodies—Peptides that bind to Ld (QL9, QLSPFPFDL; and MCMV, YPHFMPTNL) were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry at the Protein Science Facility at the University of Illinois (Urbana, IL) or the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX) or the Macromolecular Core Facility at Penn State University College of Medicine (Hershey, PA). Peptides were purified by C-18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a linear acetonitrile gradient. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-Ld (α2) antibody 30-5-7 (purified from ascites), anti-Ld (α3) antibody 28.14.8 (BD Pharmingen), anti-His antibody (Covance, Cumberland, VA), and anti-TCR(Vβ8.1-8.3) antibody F23.1 (purified from ascites) and anti-TCR(Cβ) antibody H57-597 (BD Pharmingen). Polyclonal antibodies used included fluorescein isothiocyanate F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Yeast Display of the Single-chain Ld/β2m—The mouse MHC Ld α chain gene was fused to the mouse β2m gene using PCR overlap extension (30Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The Ld-β2m PCR product consisted of the Ld heavy-chain gene (α1, α2, and α3) covalently linked to the mouse β2m gene with a 45-bp Gly-Ser (Gly3Ser) linker followed by a c-myc epitope tag (Fig. 1A). The Ld-β2m PCR product and the yeast display vector pCT302 were digested with restriction enzymes NheI/XhoI, ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH10B by electroporation. E. coli colonies were grown on LB/ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates and then inoculated into LB/ampicillin for 24 h at 37 °C. Plasmids were isolated using Qiagen mini-prep kits (Valencia, CA), diagnostically analyzed with restriction enzymes, and sequenced. Ld-β2m-encoded plasmids were transformed by the lithium acetate transformation method (31Geitz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EBY100 (32Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast colonies were grown on nutrient-selective media that lacked tryptophan (SD-CAA, glucose 2 wt%, yeast nitrogen base 0.67 wt%, casamino acids 0.5 wt%). Soluble T-cell Receptors—Selection of yeast displayed Ld libraries was performed with a soluble high affinity derivative of the 2C TCR called m6 (2C-m6), which was expressed as an αβ heterodimer in insect cells as previously described (33Garcia K.C. Tallquist M.D. Pease L.R. Brunmark A. Scott C.A. Degano M. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Teyton L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Culture supernatants from these transfectants were used directly as a source of soluble high affinity TCR for staining cells (34Holler P.D. Chlewicki L.K. Kranz D.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For some experiments, TCR was purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-200 HR, Amersham Biosciences) (34Holler P.D. Chlewicki L.K. Kranz D.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 35Holler P.D. Kranz D.M.

For surface plasmon resonance and native gel experiments, single-chain TCRs (scTCRs) of the wild-type 2C TCR (called 2C-T7) and 2C-m6 were used. The scTCRs were cloned into the NcoI/XhoI restriction sites of pET22b as a Vα-(Gly4Ser)4 linker-Vβ construct containing a C-terminal His6 tag. Vβ8.2 mutations, G17E (36Kieke M.C. Shusta E.V.

Protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) Codon Plus E. coli (Stratagene) and purified as previously described (39Maynard J. Adams E.J. Krogsgaard M. Petersson K. Liu C.W. Garcia K.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 306: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB/ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Cells were transferred to fresh Terrific Broth (TB)/ampicillin, grown 1 h at 25 °C,and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested and subjected to an osmotic shock procedure. Osmotic shock supernatant was dialyzed in 10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and subjected to affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Ld-β2m on Yeast Cell Surface—Transformed yeast colonies were inoculated into SD-CAA medium and grown at 30 °C. After 18-24 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and incubated in SG-CAA (2 wt% galactose replacing glucose in SD-CAA) at 20 °C. Where indicated, Ld-binding peptide QL9 (QLSPFPFDL) was added in excess (1 μm) to SG-CAA medium to stabilize Ld-β2m complexes expressed on the yeast surface. After 48 h, yeast cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS (10 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated on ice with anti-Ld antibodies (28.14.8 or 30-5-7) or high affinity 2C-m6 TCR. After a 30-min incubation, cells were washed with PBS/BSA and incubated on ice with either biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) or fluorescein isothiocyanate F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells incubated with 2C-m6 TCR were washed with PBS/BSA and incubated with biotinylated anti-TCR antibodies (F23.1 or H57-597), then washed again and incubated with SA-PE. Labeled yeast cells were analyzed on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer at the Flow Cytometry Center of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Biotechnology Center. Construction of Random Mutagenesis Libraries—Error-prone PCR and homologous recombination were used to generate libraries of randomly mutated Ld-β2m genes (14Starwalt S.E. Masteller E.L. Bluestone J.A. Kranz D.M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Error-prone PCR products of the Ld-β2m gene were created using a modified PCR reaction that generates ∼4 to 7 nucleotide mutations per 1000 bp. 6L. L. Jones, S. E. Brophy, A. J. Bankovich, L. A. Colf, N. A. Hanick, K. C. Garcia, and D. M. Kranz, unpublished results. PCR reactions included Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), polymerase buffer (without MgCl2), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm MnCl2, template Ld-β2m in pCT302 (50 ng), and upstream and downstream primers (5 μm). To facilitate homologous recombination, upstream and downstream primers were designed within the pCT302 vector backbone ∼100 bp upstream and downstream of the Ld/β2m gene insert (upstream primer, 5′-GGC AGC CCC ATA AAC ACA CAG TAT-3′; downstream primer, 5′-CGA GCT AAA AGT ACA GTC CC-3′). Error-prone PCR products (150 ng) and pCT302 vector (150 ng) were digested with NheI/XhoI, combined, and transformed into EBY100 yeast by electroporation in multiple reactions (20-40 electroporations). Library sizes, determined by plating an aliquot of the pooled transformations, averaged ∼106 independent variants. Error-prone PCR and homologous recombination were used to generate a second random error-prone library, using a template from a clone identified in the first error-prone Ld-β2m library called Ld-m8. Flow Cytometric Sorting of Yeast Libraries—The first generation Ld-β2m error-prone yeast library was sorted in four sequential rounds with anti-Ld antibodies. Briefly, the yeast library was grown in SD-CAA media for ∼24 h at 30 °C followed by induction of protein expression in SG-CAA media containing 1 μm QL9 peptide (QLSPFPFDL) for ∼48 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS/BSA, and incubated on ice with anti-Ld (α3) antibody (28.14.8) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG. The Cytomation MoFlo cell sorter (UIUC Biotechnology Center) analyzed cells at a rate of 30,000 cells/s, and the 1% of yeast cells exhibiting the highest fluorescence was collected. These cells were immediately cultured in SD-CAA for 24 h at 30 °C and induced for ∼48 h at 20 °C. The second, third, and fourth sorts used anti-Ld (α2) antibody (30-5-7), but in these sorts the 0.25-0.5% of yeast cells that exhibited the highest fluorescence were collected. Following four rounds of sorting, cells were plated on SD-CAA agar plates and individual clones were analyzed. Plasmids were rescued using Zymoprep, a yeast plasmid miniprep kit from Zymogen Research (Orange, CA) and transformed into E. coli by electroporation. Plasmids were isolated from E. coli using the Qiagen mini-prep kit and sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility at the UIUC Biotechnology Center. The second-generation library, using mutant Ld-m8 as a template, was screened through four rounds of sorting using two different strategies. The strategies were: one round with anti-Ld (α2) antibody 30-5-7 followed by three rounds with 2C-m6 TCR (Strategy 1) or three rounds with anti-Ld (α2) antibody 30-5-7 followed by one round with 2C-m6 TCR (Strategy 2). To obtain more thermostable Ld mutant clones, libraries were incubated at a higher temperature (40 °C) prior to each sort (37Shusta E.V. Holler P.D. Kieke M.C. Kranz D.M. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 40Weber K.S. Donermeyer D.L. Allen P.M. Kranz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19033-19038Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yeast libraries were induced for 48 h at 20 °C, harvested, and incubated at 40 °C for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with either 30-5-7 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG or 2C-m6 TCR followed by biotinylated anti-TCR (F23.1) and SA:PE. The 0.5-1% of yeast cells with the highest fluorescence was collected. Following the fourth sort, cells were plated on SD-CAA agar, and individual clones were analyzed. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single-site mutations were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with overlapping forward and reverse primers that contained the mutations. Reactions included Pfu polymerase (2.5 units/μl), reaction buffer, Ld-β2m pCT302 template (10 ng), dNTPs (25 μm), and primers (125 ng). PCR cycles were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s; 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 16 min. The restriction enzyme DpnI (Invitrogen) was added to PCR reactions for 60 min at 37 °C to degrade methylated template Ld-β2m pCT302 plasmid. Plasmid DNA was precipitated with ethanol and transformed into electrocompetent DH10B E. coli cells. Ld-m31 Protein Expression and Purification—For recombinant Ld-m31 expression, the platform MHC (Ld-m31) was shortened by seven additional amino acids, truncating it between the α2 and α3 domains. The resulting construct refolded as efficiently as the original yeast mutant and was used for all further studies. Ld-m31 was cloned into pET28a as two different constructs, one containing a GGS spacer and a C-terminal biotin ligation domain (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) (41Cull M.G. Schatz P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 430-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one without this domain into NcoI/XhoI sites. Expression of Ld-m31 was done in BL21(DE3) Codon Plus E. coli (Stratagene). Cultures were grown in LB/kanamycin (30 μg/ml) to an A600 of 1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h. Cells were passed through a microfluidizer, and inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 m urea, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5 at room temperature overnight. Biotinylated Ld-m31 was expressed using an in vivo biotinylation method in which Ld-m31-biotin pET28a was co-transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli (Stratagene) with a plasmid containing an arabinose-inducible gene for E. coli BirA ligase (provided by John Cronan at UIUC) (42Cronan Jr., J.E. Reed K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 440-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression was carried out as described above, with the exception that 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol was added to all media for maintenance of the BirA plasmid, and BirA ligase expression was induced with 2 mm l-arabinose in the presence of 50 μm d-biotin when A600 ∼ 0.6. For the refolding reaction, 8 mg of purified QL9 peptide was added to 400 ml of refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm l-arginine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm oxidized/5 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0). Over a 24-h period, 200 mg of urea-solubilized Ld-m31 inclusion bodies were added in three equal additions. The refold mixture was filtered, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, concentrated in a stirred cell concentrator (Amicon), and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Purity of select fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE, and fractions were pooled and concentrated in a YM10 Centriprep (Amicon). The yield of refolded protein from a 400-ml refold was 2-4 mg. Excess QL9 peptide was added to the purified protein to prevent unfolding of Ld-m31 due to dissociation of peptide. TCR·QL9·Ld Affinity Measurements—To examine if Ld mutants displayed on the surface of yeast exhibited structures similar to normal Ld on T2-Ld cells, the affinity of QL9·Ld complexes for the 2C-m6 TCR was measured. Purified 2C-m6 TCR was used in an equilibrium binding flow cytometry assay. Yeast cells or human T2 cells transfected with Ld (44Shusta E.V. Kieke M.C. Parke E. Kranz D.M. Wittrup K.D. J. Mol.

Pathol. 2004; 32: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PPARγ may, under different circumstances, function as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor promoter. However, little is known about the physiological role of PPARγ in the gastrointestinal epithelium, which makes it difficult to construct testable hypotheses concerning those aspects of PPARγ signaling that may account for these paradoxical effects of thiazolidinediones.To address these questions, we carried out a series of studies to elucidate the functions of PPARγ in nontransformed gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Our initial studies indicate that PPARγ plays a critical role in a number of processes that are central to renewal of the intestinal epithelium (11Chen L. Bush C. Necela B. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P. Fields A. Thompson E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 251: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium is one of the most dynamic tissues in the adult. The entire epithelium is replaced every 3 days or so by a highly orchestrated process that involves proliferation, migration, and exfoliation. Proliferation is restricted to a population of transit amplifying cells located within the crypts of Lieberkühn. These cells are extruded from the crypts, withdraw from the cell cycle, and differentiate into mature villus epithelial cells. The transition from transit amplifying to villus epithelial cells occurs at the crypt/villus junction. Mature villus epithelial cells then migrate to the villus tips where they dissociate from the epithelium and the underlying basement membrane and are shed into the intestinal lumen. Thus, transit amplifying cells are characterized by their proliferative capacity, whereas mature villus epithelial cells are characterized by a high degree of motility and ultimately by decreased cellular adhesion. PPARγ is expressed at low levels in the transit amplifying cells but is induced at the crypt/villus junction, suggesting that PPARγ might play a role in epithelial migration and/or adhesion.To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of PPARγ in nontransformed rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cell lines in culture. RIE cells are derived from proliferative crypt cells of embryonic rat bowel (12Blay J. Brown K.D. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1984; 8: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and, like the transit amplifying cells from which they are derived, RIE cells express low levels of PPARγ. We engineered these cells to express PPARγ to recapitulate the transition that occurs at the crypt/villus junction and thereby test the hypothesis that induction of PPARγ is linked to differentiated functions of mature villus epithelial cells. A genomic analysis revealed that PPARγ regulates a large cohort of genes that are involved in establishment and maintenance of the cytoskeleton and in cellular motility (11Chen L. Bush C. Necela B. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P. Fields A. Thompson E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 251: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Activation of PPARγ results in acquisition of a polarized mesenchymal morphology, which is associated with increased directional motility, colony scattering, and decreased cellular adhesion (11Chen L. Bush C. Necela B. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P. Fields A. Thompson E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 251: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that PPARγ induces epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in intestinal epithelial cells. EMT is a complex process that involves acquisition of a polarized mesenchymal morphology, associated with alteration in the structure of the cytoskeleton caused by activation of Rho family GTPases. EMT is associated with increased cellular motility and decreased cellular adhesion, and it is thought that EMT reflects in vitro those processes that are involved in epithelial motility in vivo. Induction of EMT is a well known response to polypeptide factors such as hepatocyte growth factor and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). However, induction of EMT by a nuclear receptor has not previously been reported, and the mechanism that accounts for such a response is unknown.Here we have elucidated the mechanism that accounts for the morphogenetic effects of PPARγ in intestinal epithelial cells. PPARγ activates the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, our data indicate that the PPARγ-mediated morphogenetic response involves activation of ERK1/2 downstream of PAK1 and MEK1. These studies represent the first demonstration of a mechanistic link between activation of a nuclear receptor and regulation of cellular motility through PI3K, Rho family GTPases, and MAPKs. Elucidation of this mechanism provides new insight into the physiological role of PPARγ in renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, the ability of PPARγ to induce EMT suggests one possible mechanism that may account for the ability of this receptor to promote tumorigenesis under certain circumstances.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagent—U0126, LY294202, and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Unless otherwise stated, the cultures were treated with 10 nm RS5444 in Me2SO, and control cultures received 0.1% Me2SO.Cell Culture and Plasmids—RIE/S3 and RIE/S3γ1 cells were grown in 5% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, as previously described (11Chen L. Bush C. Necela B. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P. Fields A. Thompson E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 251: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h before the addition of RS5444. Full-length mouse PPARγ1 cDNA was subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pLNCX. Mutation at C129S was introduced using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Stably transformed populations expressing wild type and C129S mutant PPARγ1 were isolated by drug selection. Hemagglutinin-tagged wild type (WT), constitutively active, and kinase dead rat MEK1 or MEK2 constructs, FLAG-tagged WT and dominant negative (DN) mouse ERK2 constructs, and Myc-tagged dominant negative mouse PAK1 were obtained from Dr. Scott Eblen (University of Virginia). These were subcloned into the pLNCX retroviral expression vector. Retroviruses encoding Myc-tagged dominant negative RhoA and Rac1 were provided by Dr. Panos Anastasiadis. DN Rac1, DN RhoA, and DN PAK1 were cloned in the pLZRS retroviral expression vector, which encodes green fluorescent protein. RIE/S3γ1 cells were transiently infected with these retroviruses, and the efficiency of infection in all cases was >90%, as assessed by green fluorescent protein expression.Protein Preparation and Western Blotting Analysis—The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication in protein lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. An aliquot of total protein (5 μg) was resolved by electrophoresis in 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the membrane was incubated with antibodies to PPARγ (Santa Cruz), phospho-MEK1 Ser298 (Cell Signaling), MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 (Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), phospho-RSK1 Thr359/Ser363 (Cell Signaling), RSK1 (Cell Signaling), phospho-FAK Ser910 (BIOSOURCE), FAK, hemagglutinin (BD), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), p110α (Cell Signaling), p85 (Cell signaling), PTEN (Cell Signaling), phospho-Akt T423 (Cell Signaling), Akt (Cell signaling), or actin (Santa Cruz) diluted in 1% milk/TBST at room temperature for 2 h, after which the membrane was washed in TBST three times for 10 min each. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Santa Cruz), anti rabbit (Cell signaling), or anti-goat (Santa Cruz) secondary antibodies in 1% milk/TBST at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times in TBST for 10 min each. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the ECL Plus chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences).Rho GTPase Pulldown Assays—The activity of Rho family GTPases was measured as previously described (15Zhang J. Anastasiadis P.Z. Liu Y. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22118-22123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed by incubating for 5 min on ice in cold lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture. The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant (20 μl) was saved for protein quantitation (as described above) and loading as whole cell lysate. The rhotekin Rho-binding domain bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) was used to isolate Rho-GTP, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The p21-binding domain of human PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) was used to isolate Rac1-GTP and Cdc42-GTP. The amount of RhoA-, Rac1-, or Cdc42-GTP bound to the corresponding beads, and the amounts of total RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were quantitated by Western blotting with anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz), anti-Rac1 (BD), or anti-Cdc42 (BD) antibodies as described above.Transient Transfection Assay—pLNCX/PPARγ, pLNCX/PPARγC129S, and/or PPRE3-TK-Luc were cotransfected with phRL-SV40 (Promega) into subconfluent RIE cells in 6-well plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a DNA: liposome ratio of 1:3. Transfection was carried out in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. Fresh medium was added along with appropriate treatment. The cells were harvested after 24 h. Total cell extracts were prepared for dual luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems). The activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control. The results are expressed as the means of triplicate determinations ± standard deviations.Immunocytochemistry—The cells grown on cover glasses were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with Antibody Diluent (DAKO) for 30 min. The cover glasses were then incubated with a nonspecific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Biomol) diluted in Antibody Diluent for 1 h, after which the cover glasses were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The cover glasses were then incubated with Biotinylated Link Universal and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase from the DakoCytomation LSAB+ system-horseradish peroxidase kit (DAKO), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Following three times of PBST wash, the cells were stained with a DAKO liquid DAB+ substrate-chromogen system (DAKO). Cover glasses were mounted on glass slides using Poly.Mount Xylene (Polysciences). The cells were observed with an Olympus BX51/52 system microscope using a 20× objective. The images were captured using Olympus DP70 microscope digital camera and digital image capture software and compiled into Adobe Photoshop. Alternatively, the cells cultured on cover glasses were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, blocked with 3% nonfat milk/PBS for 10 min, and incubated with Texas Red-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min in the dark. The cover glasses were then washed three times with PBS and mounted on glass slides using Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences). The cells were visualized under a Leica DM5000B fluorescent microscope using a 60× planApo Leica objective. Photos were acquired with the FX4000 program using a DFC350FX CCD camera and compiled in Photoshop.Male adult mice (6-8 weeks) were used for PPARγ immunohistochemistry. For analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, two age-matched female mice received 10 mg/kg/day RS5444 by oral gavage for 3 days, and two mice received diluent (carboxymethyl cellulose). All of the mice were anesthetized by CO2, followed by cervical dislocation. Then 4% paraformaldehyde in ice-cold PBS was perfused through the left ventricle. The whole small bowel from duodenum to ileum was isolated. Luminal contents were flushed briefly with PBS and suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h. The tissues were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm-thick sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were fully immersed in DAKO target retrieval solution and steamed for 20 min. The sections were cooled for 30 min at room temperature before further processing. After quenching with 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, the sections were blocked with DAKO antibody diluent, and incubated with antibody against PPARγ (Cell Signaling) or phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. The sections incubated with diluent alone were used as controls. After washing with PBS, the PPARγ antibody was detected by Vectasain ABC (Vector Laboratories) and the phospho-ERK1/2 antibody by Envision Dual Link (DAKO). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 10 s. Dehydrated sections were mounted on glass slides by DAKO permanent mounting medium (DAKO). All of the sections were observed under a transmission light microscope (Olympus BX51/52). The images were captured using an Olympus DP70 microscope digital camera and digital image capture software and compiled into Adobe Photoshop. Phospho-ERK1/2 nuclear staining intensity was measured using ImagePro Plus Ver5.0. Staining intensity was measured in 30 crypts and 30 villi from each of two control mice and in 42 crypts and 42 villi from each of the RS5444-treated mice. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the t test function of SigmaStat 32.Live Cell Imaging—The cells were plated in glass-bottomed culture dishes (35-mm Petri dish, 14-mm Microwell, No. 0 cover glass; MatTek Corporation). A Leica AS-MDW live cell imaging work station was used to capture live cell images at 400×, every 30 min for 24 h. The photos were compiled into AVI files at three frames/s.RESULTSPPARγ Induces EMT of Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Renewal of the epithelium depends upon proliferation of “transit amplifying” cells within the crypts of Lieberkühn. When these cells reach the crypt/villus interface, they cease to proliferate and differentiate into absorptive epithelial cells, which migrate to the villus tip, where they are shed into the lumen. PPARγ is expressed at very low levels in proliferative transit amplifying crypt cells (Fig. 1A). Fetal RIE cells are proliferative enterocytes, and, like the transit amplifying crypt cells from which they are derived, RIE/S3 cells expressed very low levels of PPARγ (Fig. 1B). PPARγ expression increases dramatically as cells reach the crypt/villus junction and begin their migration to the villus tips (Fig. 1A). This observation suggests that PPARγ may play a critical role in regulating the differentiated functions of intestinal epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we engineered RIE/S3 cells to express mouse PPARγ1 (RIE/S3γ1 cells; Fig. 1B), thereby recapitulating the transition that occurs at the crypt/villus interface, where transit-amplifying cells differentiate into villus epithelial cells. These RIE/S3γ1 cells exhibited a characteristic morphological response when PPARγ was activated.RIE/S3 cells grow as distinct colonies when seeded at low densities, indicating that such cells exhibit very little inherent motility (Fig. 2A, panel 1). RIE/S3 cells express little or no PPARγ, and no perceptible change in cellular morphology occurred when the PPARγ agonist RS5444 was added to RIE/S3 cells (Fig. 2A, panel 2). On the other hand, RIE/S3γ1 cells, upon activation of PPARγ, acquired a characteristic polarized mesenchymal morphology and moved away from each other in a scattering response (Fig. 2A, panels 3 and 4).FIGURE 2Activation of PPARγ induces scattering of RIE cells. A, RIE/S3 (panels 1 and 2) and RIE/S3γ1(panels 3 and 4) cells were incubated with 0.1% Me2SO (panels 1 and 3) or 10 nm RS5444 (panels 2 and 4) for 24 h. Treated cells were fixed and stained. The bar equals 30 μm. B, RIE/S3 cells were cultured for 24 h in conditioned medium from RIE/S3γ1 cells that had been growth for 24 h in RS5444. The bar equals 20 μm. C, RIE cells were transfected with either W T PPARγ or PPARγ C129C. PPRE3-TK-Luc reporter activities were measured following a 24-h treatment of Me2SO or RS5444. The data represent the normalized means ± S.D. (n = 3). Western blotting was used to measure PPARγ and actin expression in RIE cells stably expressing WT PPARγ or PPARγ C129S. D, RIE cells expressing either wild type or C129S PPARγ, as shown in C, were treated for 24 h with RS5444 and stained. The bar equals 20 μm. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Colony scattering may be caused by a number of secreted polypeptide factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor and TGF-β. We considered the possibility that PPARγ might induce expression and secretion of soluble scatter factors, resulting in an autocrine/paracrine scattering response. However, conditioned medium from RS5444-treated RIE/S3γ1 had no effect on the morphology of RIE/S3 cells (Fig. 2B, panel 2), suggesting that PPARγ-mediated cytodifferentiation is not exclusively due to elaboration of soluble scatter factors.The observation that RIE/S3 cells do not respond to thiazolidinediones (Fig. 2A) indicates that the morphological response is absolutely dependent upon expression of PPARγ. To determine whether DNA binding by PPARγ was required for this response, we generated a mutated form of mouse PPARγ1, in which the critical forth cysteine in the first zinc finger was mutated to serine (C129S). The corresponding mutation in PPARγ2 (C159S) forms heterodimers with RXRα but cannot bind peroxisome proliferator response elements or activate transcription (16Temple K.A. Cohen R.N. Wondisford S.R. Yu C. Deplewski D. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3529-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PPARγ C129S was stably introduced into RIE cells using retrovirus-mediated transduction. Wild type PPARγ was introduced in parallel, and stably transformed populations were selected. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells that express PPARγ C129S did not activate a transiently transfected PPRE/luc reporter, and such cells did not undergo colony scattering or morphological transformation upon activation of PPARγ (Fig. 2D, panels 3 and 4). This observation indicates that DNA binding is required for PPARγ-mediated cytodifferentiation of intestinal epithelial cells.Scattering of RIE/S3γ1 colonies was accompanied by marked changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization. Untreated RIE/S3γ1 cells exhibited a relatively typical epithelial morphology: rounded, flattened, nonpolarized, with concentric actin rings about the nucleus (Fig. 3A, panel 1). Activation of PPARγ resulted in acquisition of a polarized, mesenchymal morphology with elaboration of distinct filopodia and lamellapodia (Panel 2). The structure of the actin cytoskeleton was markedly altered by activation of PPARγ, although we did not observe formation of pronounced actin stress fibers, as seen in TGF-β-treated RIE/S3γ1 cells (panel 4).FIGURE 3PPARγ induces a polarized morphology but does not promote actin stress fiber formation. A, RIE/S3γ1 cells (panels 1-4) were treated for 24 h with either 10 nm RS5444 or 1 ng/ml TGF-β1. IEC/γ1 cells (panels 5 and 6) were treated with 100 nm rosiglitazone for 24 h. The cells were fixed and stained with Texas Red-X phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. B, RIE/S3γ1 cells were treated 24 h with Me2SO (panel 1), 10 nm RS5444 (panel 2), 6 μm troglitazone (panel 3), 100 nm rosiglitazone (panel 4), 1 μm 15-d-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (panel 5), or 200 nm piagliatzone (panel 6). The cells were stained with Texas Red-X phalloidin. The bars equal 10 μm. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the PPARγ-mediated morphogenetic response is not restricted to RIE cells, we engineered a second rat embryonic crypt cell line, IEC-6, to express mouse PPARγ1. Like RIE, IEC-6 cells express little or no PPARγ, whereas the IEC/γ1 derivatives express PPARγ at levels comparable with those observed in RIE/S3γ1 (data not shown). Activation of PPARγ in IEC/γ1 cells using rosiglitazone resulted in acquisition of a mesenchymal morphology and colony scattering, as shown in Fig. 3A (panels 5 and 6). Furthermore, cytodifferentiation of RIE/S3γ1 cells was observed when PPARγ was activated by the thiazolidinediones RS5444, troglitazone, rosiglitizone, and pioglitazone, as well as the naturally occurring PPARγ agonist 15-d-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that colony scattering and the associated morphological transformation that we have observed are general features of PPARγ activation in intestinal epithelial cells.The scattering response and morphological transition that occur upon activation of PPARγ indicate that this receptor stimulates cellular motility. We have previously shown that activation of PPARγ in RIE/S3γ1 cells increases the chemotaxic response to fetal bovine serum (11Chen L. Bush C. Necela B. Yanagisawa M. Anastasiadis P. Fields A. Thompson E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 251: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We used micro-cinematography to determine whether PPARγ promoted nondirectional migration (i.e. scattering) of RIE/S3γ1 cells. The cells were treated with agonist for 24 h. Thereafter photographs were taken every half hour for 24 h, and the"

We reported previously that a fragment (Ile824–Pro950) of the collagen α1(V) chain, HepV, binds to heparin via a cluster of three major basic residues, Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921, and two additional residues, Lys905 and Arg909 (Delacoux, F., Fichard, A., Cogne, S., Garrone, R., and Ruggiero, F. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 29377–29382). Here, we further characterized the binding of HepV and collagen V to heparin and heparan sulfate by surface plasmon resonance assays. HepV bound to heparin and heparan sulfate with a similar affinity (KD ∼ 18 and 36 nm, respectively) in a cation-dependent manner, and 2-O-sulfation of heparin was shown to be crucial for the binding. An octasaccharide of heparin and a decasaccharide of heparan sulfate were required for HepV binding. Studies with HepV mutants showed that the same basic residues were involved in the binding to heparin, to heparan sulfate, and to the cell surface. The contribution of Lys905 and Arg909 was found to be significant. The triple-helical peptide GPC(GPP)5G904–R918(GPP)5GPC-NH2 and native collagen V molecules formed much more stable complexes with heparin than HepV, and collagen V bound to heparin/heparan sulfate with a higher affinity (in the nanomolar range) than HepV. Heat and chemical denaturation strongly decreased the binding, indicating that the triple helix plays a major role in stabilizing the interaction with heparin. Collagen V and HepV may play different roles in cell-matrix interactions and in matrix assembly or remodeling mediated by their specific interactions with heparan sulfate. Collagen-proteoglycan interactions participate in the regulation of matrix assembly and in cell-matrix interactions. We reported previously that a fragment (Ile824–Pro950) of the collagen α1(V) chain, HepV, binds to heparin via a cluster of three major basic residues, Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921, and two additional residues, Lys905 and Arg909 (Delacoux, F., Fichard, A., Cogne, S., Garrone, R., and Ruggiero, F.

Collagen V and HepV may play different roles in cell-matrix interactions and in matrix assembly or remodeling mediated by their specific interactions with heparan sulfate. Proteoglycans are widely distributed at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. They consist of a protein core to which one or more glycosaminoglycan side chains are covalently attached, conferring a strong negative charge on proteoglycans (1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 2Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Interactions of proteoglycans with a number of matrix proteins, including collagens, are important in regulating cell behavior and fibril formation during development and pathophysiological events. Interactions with collagens can be dependent on the proteoglycan core protein or on the glycosaminoglycan chains. The heparan sulfate chain has various important biological properties and influences cell behavior through interactions with a variety of matrix proteins. Heparin binding sites have been identified and characterized in a wide range of matrix proteins, including collagens, but the structural requirements for heparan sulfate to bind these proteins are not fully understood. Collagen V, although a quantitatively minor component of connective tissues, plays a crucial role in matrix organization. Several isoforms of collagen V, including hybrid molecules containing collagen XI chains (3Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), occur in tissues, but the predominant molecular form is the heterotrimer (α1(V))2α2(V), whereas the α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) molecule and the (α1(V))3 homotrimer are minor isoforms with a more restricted tissue distribution. Collagen V interacts with proteoglycans, which are widely distributed at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It binds to the two small proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, to the proteoglycan form of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Whinna H.C. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Church F.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Binding to collagen V involves either the core protein or the glycosaminoglycan chains. Collagen V was shown to bind heparin through a 12-kDa fragment of the α1(V) chain referred to as HepV. Interestingly, we also showed that the recombinant HepV fragment supports heparin-dependent cell adhesion (8Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding site for heparin is found in the α1 chain of collagen V, whereas the two other chains of collagen V, α2(V) and α3(V), do not bind to heparin. Sequence alignment of α chains of collagens V and XI indicated that these two collagen types may use a common sequence motif to interact with heparin. This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally by others (9Vaughan-Thomas A. Young R.D. Phillips A.C. Duance V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5303-5309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recombinant production of HepV in Escherichia coli has set the stage for identifying the heparin binding site by site-directed mutagenesis and affinity chromatography. We have previously identified within the Lys905–Arg921 sequence of the α1(V) chain five basic residues participating in the binding of HepV to heparin (10Delacoux F. Fichard A. Cogne S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29377-29382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the molecular features of heparin responsible for the specific recognition of HepV have not been characterized, although the characteristics of heparin/heparan sulfate-protein interactions have been elucidated for several other proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 11Capila I.

Furthermore, previous studies were performed with heparin, a chemical analog of heparan sulfate (HS), 4The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; dp, degree of polymerization. but not with HS. However, HS, which is ubiquitously distributed on the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix, is the physiological glycosaminoglycan ligand of collagen V, and a number of biological roles have been reported for HS through its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 13Coombe D.R.

HepV and its mutants were eluted with sodium chloride, the concentration of which was taken as an estimate of the binding affinity. However, this commonly used technique measured only the ionic component, the most prominent interaction between heparin and a protein, but failed to measure the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding contribution to the binding (11Capila I. Linhardt R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the interactions between collagen V and heparin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays (i) to take into account the whole set of noncovalent interactions participating in the interactions, (ii) to study the influence of divalent cations, and (iii) to measure rate constants and to calculate the affinity constant governing those interactions by kinetic analysis. The amino acids crucial for the binding of HepV to heparin/heparan sulfate and to cells were precisely mapped within the heparin binding site. We also determined the chemical structures of the glycosaminoglycan chains (size, sulfate substitution pattern) required for binding, because subtle changes in heparan sulfate structure, and especially the fine structure of heparan sulfate with specific monosaccharide sequences characterized by the sulfation pattern (11Capila I.

Those experiments were carried out using the monomeric, non-triple-helical fragment HepV, and full-length, triple-helical isoforms of collagen V, namely the (α1(V))2α2 heterotrimer and the (α1(V))3 homotrimer. The dependence of the interaction between collagen V and heparin/heparan sulfate upon the triple-helical conformation of collagen V was also investigated with a triple-helical synthetic peptide containing the 15 amino acid residues of the previously defined heparin binding site (10Delacoux F. Fichard A. Cogne S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29377-29382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken altogether, these results emphasize differences between the binding of the HepV fragment and of the full-length collagen V molecules to heparan sulfate. This suggests that a different network of interactions between collagen V molecules and HepV with their respective glycosaminoglycan ligands may modulate biological functions in vivo during remodeling of the extracellular matrix for HepV or in the organization and assembly of extracellular matrix for the collagen V isoforms. Construction, Expression, and Purification of HepV and Its Mutants—The recombinant HepV fragment and mutant constructs were prepared as previously described and inserted into the EcoRI and PstII sites of the pT7/7 expression vector (8Delacoux F.

The recombinant wild type plasmid named pHepV and the mutants named after the mutation (e.g. pR909A and R909A) were transformed in an E. coli strain (BL21 SI-GJ1158) that carries the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lac promoter/operator and that makes use of NaCl as an inducer (19Bhandari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation 6 h after 0.2 m NaCl induction, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and then sonicated. After centrifugation and filtration, bacterial supernatants were first subjected to cation exchange chromatography using a HiTrapSP column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove most contaminant bacterial proteins and were purified to homogeneity using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (8Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteincontaining fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel and dialyzed against a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The recombinant HepV fragment and its mutants were stored at –20 °C until use. Collagens I and V and Synthetic Peptides—Collagen I and V heterotrimers were extracted from embryonic calf bones by pepsin digestion in 0.5 m acetic acid, 0.2 m NaCl at 4 °C for 20 h. They were purified by repeated salt fractionation in acetic acid as previously described (20Chanut-Delalande H. Fichard A. Bernocco S. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24352-24359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified collagens were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining using human placental collagen V (Sigma) as a standard. Collagens were dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid and then lyophilized and stored at –20 °C. Production and purification of the recombinant collagen V homotrimer was performed as previously described (21Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293-EBNA cells were transfected by electroporation with an expression vector containing full-length cDNA encoding the human pro-α1(V) chain. The purified homotrimer was dialyzed against 0.5 m acetic acid containing 0.2 m NaCl and digested with pepsin. The digestion product was dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid and stored at –20 °C until use. The concentration of the pepsinized homotrimer was determined after hydrolysis under vacuum (6 n HCl, 115 °C, 24 h) in an amino acid analyzer (Beckman). The peptide 901GTPGKPGPRGQRGPTGPRGERGP923 referred to as HepP was prepared using a methodology previously described (8Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The corresponding triple-helical peptide, Gly904–Arg918, GPC(GPP)5GKOGPRGQRGPTGPR(GPP)5GPC-NH2, was prepared as previously described, and its triple-helical state was checked by polarimetry (22Raynal N. Hamaia S.W. Siljander P.R. Maddox B. Peachey A.R. Fernandez R. Foley L.J. Slatter D.A. Jarvis G.E. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3821-3831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Polarimetry demonstrated a sigmoidal transition in optical rotation, confirming the triple-helical structure, and gave a melting point of 53.46 °C for the peptide. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Assays—The SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore Upgrade and on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin (100 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0) was covalently immobilized to the dextran matrix of a CM4 sensor chip via its primary amine groups (amine coupling kit; BIAcore AB) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Activation and blocking steps were performed as previously described (23Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J.

Streptavidin surfaces were used to capture biotinylated heparin and heparan sulfate. Heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa, 16 kDa; Sigma) and heparan sulfate (from porcine intestinal mucosa; Celsus) were biotinylated at their reducing end (24Ricard-Blum S. Feraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

An immobilization level ranging between 80 and 250 resonance units was obtained. A control flow cell was prepared by immobilizing only streptavidin. Control sensorgrams were automatically subtracted from the sensorgrams obtained with immobilized heparin or heparan sulfate in order to yield specific binding responses. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing or not containing 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant. Collagen V, HepV, and mutants and synthetic peptides were injected at several concentrations and different flow rates over immobilized glycosaminoglycans. When indicated, the triple-helical peptide was reduced with dithiothreitol and heated at 100 °C for 15 min before injection. The surface was then regenerated with a pulse of 1 m sodium chloride. The kinetic parameters ka and kd (association and dissociation rate constants, respectively) were analyzed simultaneously using a global data analysis program (BIAevaluation 3.1 software). This software also fitted simultaneously the sensorgrams obtained at different concentrations of HepV, constraining the kinetic rate constants to a single value for each set of curves. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. Rmax, the maximal capacity of the surface, was calculated during the fitting procedure. Heparin and Heparan Sulfate Oligosaccharides and Modified Heparins—Heparin oligosaccharides of defined size were prepared by digestion of heparin with heparinase I followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (25Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate oligosaccharides were prepared by digestion of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. Glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides were a generous gift from Rabia Sadir (Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble, France). Selectively desulfated heparins were kindly provided by Professor John Gallagher (Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK) (26Lyon M. Rushton G.

Ligand Blotting—Calcium binding was studied by ligand blotting and 45Ca autoradiography (23Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M.

Different concentrations of purified proteins were applied on the membrane using a dot-blot apparatus. Each well was washed twice (2 × 200 μl) with 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.8, containing 60 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Membranes were incubated with 45CaCl2 (Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml for 15 min, rinsed with 50% ethanol for 5 min, dried, and exposed overnight to a BioMax MS film in a cassette with an intensifying screen. The C-terminal propeptide of procollagen III (gift from D. Hulmes, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines, Lyon, France) was used as a positive control (23Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B.

CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-800 dichrograph. HepV (5 μm) was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8. Glycosaminoglycans were either added to HepV prior to analysis or incubated overnight with HepV at 4 °C with gentle mixing before recording the CD spectra. Spectra were collected from 190 to 260 nm with a step size of 1 nm and a bandwidth of 1 nm at 20 °C. They were corrected for buffer base line measured in the same cells of path length 0.1 cm. Five spectra of each sample were averaged. The circular dichroism signal of heparin and heparan sulfate was also subtracted to determine genuine changes in HepV conformation. The results were normalized to mean molar residue ellipticities. Cell Adhesion Assays—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and a mixture of antibiotics. Prior to the adhesion assay, cells were harvested with 1% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. 96-Well plates (Costar) were coated overnight at 4 °C with HepV and mutants with 1 μg/well. After blocking the wells with 1% bovine serum albumin, cells freshly suspended in serum-free medium (5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto wells (0.1 ml/well) and allowed to attach for 45 min at 37 °C. Then the wells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. After extensive washing, the dye adsorbed to the cells was solubilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (SLT Laboratory Instruments). Cell adhesion experiments were performed three times, each assay point being carried out in duplicate. HepV Binds to Heparin and Heparan Sulfate with a High Affinity—The expression of the wild-type HepV fragment and its mutants was markedly increased (by up to 20-fold) using the BL21 SI E. coli strain that used NaCl as an inducer. HepV (Fig. 1A) and mutants were efficiently purified by successive anion and cation exchange chromatography steps. The binding of HepV to heparin and heparan sulfate was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin and heparan sulfate (Table 1) in SPR inhibition assays, thus assessing the specificity of the binding. Kinetic analysis of those interactions was performed by injecting different concentrations of HepV over immobilized heparin (Fig. 1B) and heparan sulfate to determine the affinity constant KD, which was calculated as the ratio of the rate constants ka/kd using the BIAevaluation software. The 1:1 Langmuir model was found to fit the kinetic data and might account for the mechanism of HepV binding to glycosaminoglycans. The affinity constants were KD ∼ 18 nm for the interaction of HepV with heparin (ka ∼ 3.69 × 104 m–1 s–1, kd ∼ 6.56 × 10–4 s–1, χ2 = 0.67) and KD ∼ 36 nm (ka ∼ 3.43 × 104 m–1 s–1, kd ∼ 1.23 × 10–3 s–1, χ2 = 1.61) for the interaction of HepV with heparan sulfate. Binding data to heparin also fitted well to the heterogeneous ligand model predefined in the BIAeval 3.1 software. The two sets of calculated affinity constants were as follows: KD1 = 12.5 nm and KD2 = 22 nm for heparin (χ2 = 0.519). These values were similar to the values obtained when data were fitted to the 1:1 Langmuir model. The good fit to the heterogenous ligand model can be explained by the natural heterogeneity of heparin. Heparin undergoes extensive modification after the initial polymer synthesis, and binding to subpopulations of the glycosaminoglycan heparin has been reported by others (7San Antonio J.D. Slover J.

Fibronectin, collagen I, and laminin fractionate heparin into subpopulations that differ substantially in binding affinity, and the same phenomenon might occur for HepV (7San Antonio J.D. Slover J.

Furthermore, we have shown by dual polarization interferometry that the binding stoichiometry for the HepV-heparin complex was 1.7:1 (28Ricard-Blum S. Peel L.L. Ruggiero F. Freeman N.J. Anal.

Fichard A. Cogne S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29377-29382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate in detail the contribution of each basic residue to the HepV-heparan sulfate interaction, SPR binding assays to heparin and heparan sulfate were performed with several mutants of HepV. Mutations of Arg900 and Arg924 to alanine did not affect the binding of HepV to heparin and heparan sulfate. In contrast, a significant decrease in binding was observed when Arg912, Arg918, and Arg921 were mutated to alanine (Fig. 2A). Contrary to our previous results (10Delacoux F. Fichard A. Cogne S. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29377-29382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the binding level of K905A and R909A mutants to heparin/heparan sulfate was significantly reduced, indicating that these two residues are also essential for HepV binding to heparan sulfate. Those two particular residues were also critical for CHO cell adhesion to HepV, whereas R912A and R918A, but not R921A, mutants decreased CHO cell adhesion to HepV (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the cell adhesion site to HepV was somewhat shorter than the HepV binding site to the glycosaminoglycans. Indeed, mutation of Arg921 did not affect cell attachment to HepV, whereas it decreased the binding of HepV to heparin by two-thirds. Furthermore, although the amino acid sequence located between Lys905 and Arg921 was necessary for heparin binding, it was not sufficient, because a synthetic peptide (called HepP) comprising this sequence did not bind to heparin, either in affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose or in SPR assays (Fig. 3A). The sequences flanking the heparin binding site might play a role in heparin binding, or alternatively the short HepP peptide (23 amino acid residues) might fail to adopt a conformation suitable to bind heparin. A triple-helical synthetic peptide comprising the Gly904–Arg918 sequence (GPC(GPP)5GKOGPRGQRGPTGPR(GPP)5GPC-NH2), which contains the heparin binding site, was found to bind heparin/heparan sulfate to a higher extent than HepV as measured in resonance units. In addition, it forms much more stable complexes with the glycosaminoglycans than HepV, demonstrated on the sensorgram by a slower dissociation rate (Fig. 3B). This suggests a strong stabilizing role of the triple helix in HepV binding to heparin/heparan sulfate. When the triple-helical conformation of the synthetic peptide GPC(GPP)5G904–R918(GPP)5GPC-NH2 was lost upon reduction by 1,4-dithiothreitol followed by heat denaturation, its binding to heparin was inhibited by 98.18%, further emphasizing the role of the triple helix in the binding of collagen to heparin.

https://openalex.org/W2153323885,"Abstract This article reports on the interaction of conducting (K+) and blocking (Na+) monovalent metal ions with detergent-solubilized and lipid-reconstituted forms of the K+ channel KcsA. Monitoring of the protein intrinsic fluorescence reveals that the two ions bind competitively to KcsA with distinct affinities (dissociation constants for the KcsA·K+ and KcsA·Na+ complexes of ∼8 and 190 mm, respectively) and induce different conformations of the ion-bound protein. The differences in binding affinity as well as the higher K+ concentration bathing the intracellular mouth of the channel, through which the cations gain access to the protein binding sites, should favor that only KcsA·K+ complexes are formed under physiological-like conditions. Nevertheless, despite such prediction, it was also found that concentrations of Na+ well below its dissociation constant and even in the presence of higher K+ concentrations, cause a remarkable decrease in the protein thermal stability and facilitate thermal dissociation into subunits of the tetrameric KcsA, as concluded from the temperature dependence of the protein infrared spectra and from gel electrophoresis, respectively. These latter observations cannot be explained based on the occupancy of the binding sites from above and suggest that there must be additional ion binding sites, whose occupancy could not be detected by fluorescence and in which the affinity for Na+ must be higher or at least similar to that of K+. Moreover, cation binding as reported by means of fluorescence does not suffice to explain the large differences in free energy of stabilization involved in the formation of the KcsA·Na+ and KcsA·K+ complexes, which for the most part should arise from synergistic effects of the ion-mediated intersubunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2100964764,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) in its active heterodimeric form is the catalytic center of the γ-secretase complex, an enzymatic activity that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce amyloid β (Aβ). Ubiquilin 1 is a recently described PS1 interacting protein, the overexpression of which increases PS1 holoprotein levels and leads to reduced levels of functionally active PS1 heterodimer. In addition, it has been suggested that splice variants of the UBQLN1 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD). However, it is still unclear whether PS1 and ubiquilin 1 interact when expressed at endogenous levels under normal physiological conditions. Here, we employ three novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based techniques to investigate the interaction between PS1 and ubiquilin 1 in intact cells. We consistently find that the ubiquilin 1 N terminus is in close proximity to several epitopes on PS1. We show that ubiquilin 1 interacts both with PS1 holoprotein and heterodimer and that the interaction between PS1 and ubiquilin 1 takes place near the cell surface. Furthermore, we show that the PS1-ubiquilin 1 interaction can be detected between endogenous proteins in primary neurons in vitro as well as in brain tissue of healthy controls and Alzheimer disease patients, providing evidence of its physiological relevance."

Kinetic dissociation experiments, including fluorescence anisotropy and a continuous native electrophoretic mobility shift assay, confirmed that two EBNA1·DNA complex conformers are in slow equilibrium; one dissociates slowly (t½ ∼ 41 min) through an undissociated intermediate species and the other corresponds to a fast twostep dissociation route (t½ ∼ 0.8 min). In line with this, at least two parallel association events from two populations of protein conformers are observed, with on-rates of 0.25–1.6 × 108 m–1 s–1, which occur differentially either in excess protein or DNA molecules. Both parallel complexes undergo subsequent firstorder rearrangements of ∼2.0 s–1 to yield two consolidated complexes.

These OBPs nucleate the replication machinery by recruiting various proteins and induce the local distortion of the DNA as a previous step for unwinding. There are two groups of viral OBPs, one of them is represented by the EpsteinBarr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and by the E2 protein from papillomaviruses, both of which bind to the origin but rely on other factors to melt the DNA (1McBride A.A. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second group consists of viral OBPs that have both DNA binding activity and helicase activity, represented by the SV-40 T antigen and the E1 helicase from papillomavirus. The second group of OBPs facilitates the binding and cooperates with those of the first group, such as the case of papillomavirus E2 that cooperates with the E1 helicase (1McBride A.A. Romanczuk H.

It binds to the EBV replication origin oriP where it plays several roles: initiation of DNA replication, segregation of EBV episomes, and transactivation of latent viral gene expression (3Yates J.L.

Comparison of the crystal structures of the DNA-complexed forms suggested a quite different DNA binding recognition mode (10Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The portion of the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization domain that resembles the E2 DNA binding domain from papillomavirus is referred to as the core domain (residues 504–604). This includes the dimeric barrel interface and two α-helices, one of which is the recognition helix. A noticeable difference in the core domain is the length and position of a loop connecting β-strands 2 and 3. In EBNA1, this loop contains nine extra residues, five of which are proline residues, and is therefore termed the proline loop. Although the helix corresponding to the recognition helix in E2 domain is present in the EBNA1, it is located 6 Å away from the DNA. However, mutagenesis of this helix and the fact that the core alone binds DNA suggest a role of this helix in DNA binding (11Cruickshank J. Shire K. Davidson A.R. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The EBNA1 flanking domain (Fig. 1) is composed of an extended chain (461–476) that tunnels through the minor groove of the α-helix (477–489), and a connector (490–503) linking this domain with the core domain. An acidic tail is located at the C terminus of the protein (608–641). Neither acidic nor flanking domains or equivalent domains are present in papillomavirus E2 C-terminal domains. The Epstein-Barr genome includes repetitive contiguous EBNA1 binding elements, and assembly at these sites is cooperative, where the DNA binding domain alone is sufficient for cooperative binding (12Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the DNA, including bending, take place upon binding (10Bochkarev A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which result in permanganate sensitivity (13Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and DNA unwinding is predicted to accompany assembly of EBNA1 on two adjacent sites (10Bochkarev A. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have been investigating the DNA binding mechanisms of the E2 DNA binding domain from human papillomavirus (14Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Ferreiro D.U. de Prat-Gay G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Ferreiro D.U.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32480-32484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and our goal is to compare the only two dimeric β-barrel domains described so far that incidentally bind at or near DNA replication origins. In the present work, we analyzed the DNA binding mechanism of EBNA1 to a single specific DNA site in solution, a model for eukaryotic replication origins, using various spectroscopic, biophysical, and calorimetric techniques. We integrated structural thermodynamic and kinetic data and compared them with the E2 DNA binding domain. Chemicals—All reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from ICN (Aurora, OH) or Sigma. All solutions were prepared with distilled and deionized (Milli-Q plus) water and filtered through 0.45-μm membranes prior to use. DNA Synthesis—Double-stranded 20-bp oligonucleotides containing one EBNA1 recognition sequence (Site 1 of the dyad symmetry element of oriP in the Epstein-Barr B95-8 strain genome) were prepared as follows: single-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased, high-performance liquid chromatography-purified, from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA): Site 1A, 5′-CGGGAAGCATATGCTACCCG-3′ (recognition sequence is italicized); Site 1B, 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) is the complementary strand with a fluorescein molecule attached to the 5′-end via a 6-carbon linker. Singlestranded oligonucleotide concentration was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient at 260 nm obtained from the nucleotide composition. Annealing was performed by mixing equal amounts of the oligonucleotides in 10 mm Bis-Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl, further incubating the mixture for 5 min at 95 °C, and slowly cooling to 25 °C for 16 h. This yielded a double-stranded oligonucleotide termed Site 1 5′-FAM, and no detectable single-stranded oligonucleotide was present as judged by PAGE (not shown). A similar procedure was followed to anneal the Tesi-1-5′-FAM 5′-ATCCCAGCCAGTGTCGAGAG-3′. This oligonucleotide corresponds to the randomized Site 1 sequence keeping the same base composition. The double-stranded E2 oligonucleotide, termed Site 35-5′-FAM and used as nonspecific DNA, was 5′-GTAACCGAAATCGGTTGA-3′. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant fulllength EBNA1 was expressed and purified from baculovirusinfected insect cells as previously described (17Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47753-47761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The procedure is much more complex, the yields are lower, and this protein cannot be expressed in bacteria. The recombinant C-terminal domain of EBNA1 (EBNA1452–641) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys S, using a modified protocol from the one previously described (18Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Barwell J.A. Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Tong H. Yang D.S. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20556-20559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells expressing EBNA1452–641 were grown in a 1.5-liter fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc, Edison, NJ) in Terrific Broth culture medium at 37 °C, to an absorbance of 5 at 600 nm. EBNA1452–641 expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by the addition of 150 μg/ml rifampicin 3 h later. The cells were incubated overnight, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 600 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were frozen at –70 °C and then thawed at room temperature, and subsequently lysed by sonication at 0 °C twice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then placed in a 75 °C water bath until the temperature of the protein solution reached the temperature of the bath. Heating was followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min and then loaded onto a heparin HyperD (BioSepra, Villeneuve la Garenne, France) affinity column equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer, and eluted with 0.15–1.0 m NaCl linear gradient. The fractions that were over 90% pure were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A without 2-mercaptoethanol, and digested with thrombin (1.5 units/mg of protein) at 37 °C for 7 h to remove the His6 tag. Digestion was stopped with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protein was loaded onto a Mono Q ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with buffer A, and washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer. The protein eluted in a 15-ml linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions that were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled, concentrated using Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Bedford, MA), and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). This procedure yielded around 20 mg/liter of >98% pure EBNA1452–641. The purified protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and stored at ∼150 μm fractions at –70 °C after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 4.19 × 104 m–1 cm–1. DNA Binding—Fluorescence measurements were recorded in an Aminco Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer assembled in “L” geometry. For fluorescein anisotropy measurements excitation was set to 495 nm with a 4 nm slit, and emission was recorded at 520 nm. When fluorescein concentration was lower than 20 nm, the excitation slit was set to 8 nm. The temperature was kept constant at 25 ± 0.1 °C through all experiments. All titrations were performed adding small amounts of a concentrated solution of the variable ligand to fixed amounts of a concentrated solution of the other and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min. In all cases, maximal dilution was 20%, and the data were corrected accordingly. Dissociation constants for the EBNA1·DNA complex were performed in 25 mm Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 1mm dithiothreitol by measuring the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the 5′-FAM·DNA as a function of added EBNA1. Data were fitted using nonlinear least squares to Equation 1,[EBNA1-DNA]=0.5ΔF([DNA]+[EBNA1]+KD)-(([DNA]+[EBNA1]+KD)2-(4[DNA][EBNA1]))0.5(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the difference in the signal between the EBNA1·DNA complex and free DNA; [DNA] and [EBNA1] are the oligonucleotide and protein concentrations, respectively; and KD is the dissociation constant for the interaction. No computational corrections for emission intensity were required, because the quantum yield did not change significantly upon binding. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Standard equilibrium EBNA1·Site 1 binding was carried out in identical conditions to equilibrium binding by fluorescence spectroscopy (25 mm BisTris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 2 μm Site 1 5′-FAM and different molar ratios of EBNA1452–641, followed by 60-min incubation at room temperature in a final volume of 50 μl. For the EBNA1·Site 1 dissociation experiment, reaction mixtures in the same buffer containing 1 μm EBNA1452–641·Site 1 5′-FAM complex and large excess of unmodified Site 1 were incubated 60 min at room temperature in a final volume of 15 μl. Finally, for EBNA1·Site 1 off-rate kinetics, the procedure was as follows: reaction mixtures in the same buffer containing a 5 μm EBNA1452–641·Site 1 5′-FAM complex were incubated 60 min at room temperature and then a 30-fold excess of unmodified Site 1 was added to a final volume of 100 μl to displace the Site 1 5′-FAM from the complex. Mixtures were loaded continuously into running 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing TBE (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m sodium borate, 4 mm EDTA) 0.5×. The gels were resolved at 4 V/cm, 4–8 °C for 2–8 h. Fluorescein bands were detected by UV transilumination. After visualization and documentation, the gels were silver stained. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were monitored in the near UV region using Jasco J-810 equipment. Ten scans were averaged for each measurement at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C controlled by a peltier, and contribution of the protein was subtracted. It is expected that in the 250 to 320 nm range, the ellipticity of the protein does not change substantially (i.e. the contribution is linear), and thus we can assume we are evaluating mainly changes in DNA conformation (20Gray D. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 469-499Crossref Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All experiments were conducted using a VP ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Titrations were performed as described elsewhere (21Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, 22Ladbury J.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 8-μl injections of EBNA1452–641 were made into DNA solution in the cell. The heat of dilution of the protein into the buffer was determined in separate experiments and subtracted from the titration prior to data analysis. The data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software supplied with the calorimeter. The dissociation binding constants in the temperature range of 293–308 K were too high to be determined from the ITC results, because of the high concentrations of protein that were required to detect the heats of binding and the tight binding involved. Stopped-flow Kinetics—All fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using an SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Concentrations reported are those resulting from mixing equal volumes of each syringe at 25 ± 0.1 °C, unless otherwise stated. The reactions were monitored using the fluorescence of the 5′-FAM moiety of the modified oligonucleotides or the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the protein. Excitation was set to 490 nm or 280 nm and the total fluorescence recorded through cut-off filters (Schott, PA). Five to ten kinetics traces were collected and averaged for each concentration point. The data were analyzed to extract the rates and amplitudes using non-linear least squares fitting software provided by the manufacturer, using single or double exponential equations. The errors for the constants were between 2 and 10%. The Double-jump association-dissociation experiments were performed mixing 0.5:0.5 volumes of protein and 5′-FAM·DNA, and, after the “delay time,” the reaction sample was subsequently mixed with one volume of nonfluoresceinated DNA, and the fluorescent decay was measured. Binding of EBNA1452–641 at the Equilibrium—To determine the stoichiometry in solution we carried out binding titration experiments at concentrations well above the expected dissociation constant. We used fluorescein modified or unmodified 20-bp duplexes corresponding to the specific Site 1 of the dyad symmetry element of EBV oriP (7Ambinder R.F. Shah W.A. Rawlins D.R. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2369-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the buffer conditions were optimized for minimizing aggregation and additives (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy were measured upon addition of pure recombinant EBNA1452–641 and revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2A). We wanted to confirm the stoichiometry by different techniques, because we had to either rule out or consider nonspecific or low affinity binding events in solution. The related HPV E2C DNA binding domain showed additional binding events in solution, not observed in previous assays or x-ray structures (14Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Hegde R.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Gel-filtration experiments show that, even in a large excess of protein, the complex formed has the expected size of a 1:1 EBNA1·Site 1 globular complex (not shown). We carried out an EMSA experiment at similar concentrations to those in the binding titration and confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry, either in excess of protein (Fig. 2B) or DNA (not shown). This differs from what was observed in E2C in identical conditions used as control in this experiment (not shown) (14Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It agrees with the stoichiometry observed in previous EMSA assays using radioactive detection, carried out at much lower concentrations (11Cruickshank J. Shire K. Davidson A.R. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a probe for the binding from the DNA end, we used near-UV CD, which allows discrimination of changes exclusively taking place on the DNA. Upon addition of EBNA1452–641 to an unmodified Site 1 duplex, there was a change in the spectra, indicative of a substantial change on its conformation upon binding of the domain (Fig. 2C). An increase in the bands at ∼280 nm could be indicative of DNA unwinding, but because the contributions in this region are so complex, it is virtually impossible to assign a particular structure (20Gray D. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 469-499Crossref Google Scholar). The inset of the figure shows that the stoichiometry was also 1:1, as judged by the ellipticity change in the DNA followed at two different wavelengths (Fig. 2C, inset). To determine the dissociation constant, we carried out binding isotherms under near dissociation conditions, following fluorescein anisotropy at different DNA and protein concentrations (Fig. 3A). The data were fitted to a quadratic binding equation, and the residuals are indicated in the inset. The KD was determined to be 0.5 ± 0.1 nm, in excellent agreement with previous EMSA results (11Cruickshank J. Shire K. Davidson A.R. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22273-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using the same procedure, the binding of a nonspecific sequence with the same base content yield as the specific E2 site showed a KD > 10 μm (Fig. 3, inset), and the discrimination capacity (KDnon-specific/KDspecific) is at least 20,000, in the same range of what was observed for HPV16 E2C (14Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As a test for the biological relevance of studying the DNA binding domain rather than the difficult to express full-length form, we determined the dissociation constant of the baculovirus-expressed EBNA1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) for comparison. We carried out the comparison in 400 mm NaCl in the same buffer, because it weakens the extremely tight interaction, and allows an accurate determination with the best signal-to-noise ratio possible. In these conditions, the KD of EBNA1 was 1.0 ± 0.1 nm, compared with 1.2 ± 0.2 nm for the EBNA1452–641 domain to the same DNA site, which validates our analysis. Thermodynamics of EBNA1452–641-DNA Binding—To evaluate the thermodynamic parameters governing the interaction of EBNA1452–641 with its specific DNA site, we carried out ITC experiments. Upon addition of EBNA1452–641 to a solution containing the EBNA1 Site 1 duplex, a strong enthalpic change was observed, where the raw data indicated a tight and saturable interaction, as expected (Fig. 4A). The data were fitted to a standard binding equation, showing a 1:1 stoichiometry, and the dissociation could not be determined accurately, due to the limits imposed by the technique. The KD used was that determined from fluorescence titration experiments: 0.5 × 10–9 ± 0.1 × 10–9 m (free energy for the binding process ΔG = –12.7 ± 0.1 kcal mol–1); the ΔHobs was –11.9 ± 0.14 kcal mol–1 (Fig. 4A). Using these data, the entropic change, ΔS was calculated to be only +2.7 ± 0.9 cal mol–1 K–1, indicating that the interaction is, to a great extent, enthalpically driven. Formation of protein·DNA complexes is accompanied by a heat capacity change (ΔCp), which is related to the amount of hydration of the polar or apolar molecular surfaces (24Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). ITC experiments were carried out at different temperatures, and the ΔHobs was plotted against the temperature, and the slope corresponds to the ΔCp of the interaction. The formation of the EBNA1·DNA complex was accompanied by a ΔCp of –1.22 ± 0.08 kcal mol–1 K–1. Kinetic Dissociation of EBNA1452–641·DNA—To determine the overall binding mechanism, we started analyzing the kinetic dissociation of EBNA1452–641 to DNA. For this, we incubated an EBNA1452–641·5′-FAM Site 1 complex with an excess of unmodified EBNA1 Site 1 DNA duplex, and determined the anisotropy change after 4 h. A 25-fold excess of unmodified DNA ensures dissociation of the complex as the anisotropy change indicated (not shown). The formation of the complex was very fast as the change in anisotropy of the 5′-FAM Site 1 was immediately increased upon addition of EBNA1452–641 protein (not shown). After a 30-min stabilization period, addition of a 25-fold excess of unmodified Site 1 DNA decreased the anisotropy, as expected for the dissociation (Fig. 5A). The anisotropy change that accompanies dissociation was fitted to two exponential phases, and the residuals are indicated (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). The phases contribute each with 50% of the amplitude, and the first order rates were 2.8 × 10–4 s–1 for kr–3, and 2.7 × 10–3 s–1 for kr–2, corresponding to t½ values of 41 and 4.3 min, respectively. A similar experiment was carried out in the stopped-flow equipment monitoring fluorescence intensity. The advantage of this technique is that faster reactions can be observed, but there is a limitation for slow reactions that can be observed in a standard fluorometer. Fig. 5B shows the data in the 0 to 1000-s range where a fast phase corresponding to 20% of the amplitude and a kFAM–1 rate of 0.011 s–1 was observed, and a slower phase with a rate of 0.001 s–1 was observed, which we assigned by coincidence to the kr–2 from anisotropy (Fig. 5A). We confirmed the complete dissociation of the DNA by an EMSA experiment. The EBNA1452–641·5′-FAM Site 1 complex (Fig. 5B, inset, lane 3) was displaced into the free 5′-FAM Site 1 by excess unmodified Site 1 DNA (Fig. 5B, inset, lanes 4–8). Finally, to assign the observed constants (kr–3 and kr–2) within the overall dissociation reaction by a direct measurement, we followed the displacement of the EBNA1452–641·5′-FAM Site 1 complex by a continuous EMSA assay. After complex formation, the same excess of unfluoresceinated Site 1 DNA duplex as in the anisotropy experiments was added (Fig. 5), and at the indicated times aliquots were withdrawn and loaded into a continuously running native gel. Fig. 6A shows the gradual increase of free 5′-FAM Site 1 DNA, a product of the dissociation of the complex increasing with elapsed time. The integrated bands were plotted against time, and the data were fitted to a single exponential equation, yielding a t½ of ∼100 min, in very good agreement with the anisotropy experiment (41 min), considering the large difference in the accuracy of the experiments (Fig. 6B). Analysis of the early points indicates that they do n"
