Absorption of these products may therefore occur by both inhalation and ingestion, but, although measurements of the activity of lead-210 in many human bone samples have been reported3–6, the ratio of polonium-210 to lead-210 in bone and the activities of these nuclides in human soft tissues have been reported in only a few samples1,3,7,8. This communication describes the results of preliminary radiochemical estimations of polonium-210 and lead-210 in human bone and soft tissue samples."
https://openalex.org/W2062849041,"MYCOBACILLIN, a new antifungal antibiotic isolated from the culture filtrate of a strain of Bacillus subtilis, is a cyclic peptide containing 13 residues of 7 different amino-acids, the sequence of which has also been worked out1–2. Now the stereotypic nature of the constituent amino-acids is an interesting query. Antibiotics are often characterized by the presence of D-amino-acids. Penicillin and antibiotics of actinomycin group contain D-valine3. Actinomycin also contains D-alloisoleucine. Likewise, D-phenylalanine is the constituent of gramicidine S4 and tyrocidines5. Extreme examples are, however, polymyxin-B, polymyxin-D and bacitracin A. Polymyxins contain D-phenylalanine, D-leucine, D-serine and D-α γ-diaminobutyric acid, and bacitracin contains D-ornithine, D-glutamic acid, DL-aspartic acid and D-phenylalanine6. This communication records the stereotypic nature of each of the constituent amino-acids of mycobacillin. In essence the method is based on the substrate specificity of D- and L-amino-acid oxidases and L-glutamic acid dehydrogenase."

In particular, the alkalating agents1, the antipurines2 and the folic acid antagonists3 have been effective chemicals. However, since none of these drugs has offered complete suppression under conditions of clinical trial, the discovery of new classes of chemicals which inhibit immune reactions remains an important objective. The double indole-indoline alkaloids4 ‘Vincristine’ (vincristine sulphate) and ‘Vinblastine’ (vincaleukoblastine sulphate) were isolated from the common periwinkle plant Vinca rosea by two groups of investigators working independently5,6. Since these compounds have been effective growth inhibitors of a variety of lymphoid neoplasms7–9, it appeared worth while to investigate their effects on immune responses. This communication reports inhibition of antibody formation and delayed hypersensitivity to bovine serum albumin in rats following administration of the two drugs."

Glaser1 expressed the extreme view when he wrote “a dummy” [that is, a pharmacologically inert substance] “identifies those patients who can be disregarded, either because they need no treatment or else because they can be cured by psychological influences, and this is as reasonable a procedure as the exclusion from experiments with anti-asthmatic drugs of patients who do not have attacks of bronchial asthma”."

As fluorine substitution alters the geometrical form of the parent molecule only very little, while it can be expected to have a marked effect on the electron density1, its effect on the carcino-genicity of the parent compound may well help in further elaboration of the theories existing in this field."

In a more detailed and extended investigation of the interrelationships of dietary protein-level and lipid metabolism in the rat, we have examined the possibility of alleviating the fatty liver produced in protein deficiency by including a low level of the ordinarily lipotropic agent, methionine, in a protein-free ration. When this was done it was observed that the livers increased markedly in size and became light brown in colour and very friable. Further investigation revealed that the livers had become very fatty."

From the well-known facts that enzyme secretion depends on oxygen consumption of the gland and that the rate of oxygen consumption is proportionately diminished with the decrease of body temperature, it would logically follow that pancreatic enzyme secretion was reduced in general hypothermia. Several years ago we performed some experiments on dogs with duodenal intubation to discover if this was really the case. The results suggested that with lowering body temperature to between 31° and 29° C the enzyme activity of duodenal juice was even more reduced than expected; then between 26° and 21° C excretion stopped. The composition of juice appeared to be normal except for a slight downward shift of the pH (ref. 1). Similar observations were made on a few hypothermic patients, as the duodenal juice aspirated through the suction tube seemed to be reduced in volume and activity but normal in composition at body temperatures between 32° and 28° C. The question, however, arose whether owing to lack of intestinal motion at these temperatures the aspirated juice was freshly excreted by the pancreas. There was little doubt about the reduction of volume output being true; but the question remained open as to the rate of both this reduction and that of enzyme synthesis, and whether the single enzymes were affected in an identical fashion by lowering the body temperature. We have now investigated this problem in the rat."

https://openalex.org/W2016831236,"THE single-cell culture method of mammalian cells was established by Puck et al.1, and is now applied in cell physiology and genetics. Edlinger2 has simplified this method, using a rubber-stoppered bottle without 5 per cent carbon dioxide incubator. However, this was used only for the nutritionally non-exact L strain cell: the method has also been used for the nutritionally more exact HeLa strain S3 clone3 as well as the other two strains, and has provided results applicable to the cell-cloning technique. This communication is concerned with the technical details of this method, and presents a nutritional investigation of the single-cell culture medium for bottle technique."

Several workers have suggested that thyroid hormones enable poikilotherms to withstand changes in environmental temperature. For example, Evropeitzeva2 reported that larvæ of Coregonus lavaretus ludoga withstood exposure to 29° C for 5 min after treatment with 0.033 per cent thiourea, whereas untreated animals died. Suhrmann3 found that immersion in a solution of thiourea increases the upper lethal temperature in the goldfish, Carassius auratus. Dent and Lynn4 also indicated that the thyroid may play a part in tolerance to changes in temperature. But the most striking report in this field comes from the work of Fortune5,6, who has reported that in the minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus L., the thermal death point is raised some 10° C by treatment with thiourea. She states: “Phoxinus already treated with thiourea for 3 days, were subjected to a rise in temperature of 10° C (that is, to 33° C) over 2 days. They survived indefinitely at this temperature and appeared normal, the controls dying under such conditions between 23° C and 24° C”. On the other hand, La Roche and Leblond7 state that the ability of salmon parr to withstand rising temperatures is impaired by radiological thyroidectomy and is restored by the administration of thyroid powder."

https://openalex.org/W1989819293,"IT is a well-known fact that high concentrations of heavy metal salts inactivate most enzymes and that they are generally used to precipitate proteins1. Evidence is available regarding the noxious effect of various heavy metals on the body2. Increasing utilization of molybdenum and tungsten in industry determined the investigations presented here, concerning the effect of molybdenum and tungsten ions on some stages of intermediate metabolism in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2022433020,"THE communication by McLester and Graham1 illustrates the difficulties which can arise when the concentration of a plasma protein cannot be measured but can only be inferred from its biological activity. Patients with von Willebrand's disease can synthesize antihæmophilic globulin (AHG, factor VIII): their plasma has AHG activity ranging from 1.6 to 100 per cent of the normal2 and, when stimulated by injection of a plasma fraction free from AHG, the AHG activity of their plasma rises3. If the hypothetical ‘activator’ or ‘inhibitor’ or ‘inducer’ of AHG suggested by McLester and Graham exists, it is presumably qualitatively and quantitatively normal in hæmophilia-A and in carriers of the hæmophilia-A gene. It follows that von Willebrand's disease is irrelevant to any discussion of gene action in heterozygotes for hæmophilia-A, though of great importance in the hæmatological aspects of the bleeding diatheses."

https://openalex.org/W2011896214,"IN an earlier communication1, I reported a finding indicating that the power dissipated in the subcutaneous tissues, where the receptors lie, is the parameter most relevant to the determination of threshold electric shocks. This led to the assertion that it would be more reasonable and safer to control wattage rather than voltage or current when using electro-convulsive therapy. As a result of correspondence with Dr. G. R. Hawkes, of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, I am persuaded that this assertion is misleading. A more accurate conclusion would have been that, although the standard practice of controlling voltage is less safe than controlling the wattage, it would probably be safer still to control current under the conditions obtaining in a mental hospital."
