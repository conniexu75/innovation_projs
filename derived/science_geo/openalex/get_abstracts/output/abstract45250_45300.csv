https://openalex.org/W2143072217,"Recent scientific work has established both a theoretical basis and strong empirical evidence for a causal impact of social relationships on health. Prospective studies, which control for baseline health status, consistently show increased risk of death among persons with a low quantity, and sometimes low quality, of social relationships. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies of humans and animals also suggest that social isolation is a major risk factor for mortality from widely varying causes. The mechanisms through which social relationships affect health and the factors that promote or inhibit the development and maintenance of social relationships remain to be explored."

https://openalex.org/W1992289621,"We report that the thyroid hormone (T3) receptor binds to DNA recognition sequences that are variations of the palindromic motif 5'-TCAGGTCA.TGACCTGA-3', resulting in transcriptional activation in vivo. This sequence is identical to the vitellogenin A2 estrogen response element except for the absence of 3 bp at the center of dyad symmetry, which we have termed a ""gap."" The T3 receptor binds to estrogen response elements with high affinity in vitro, as well as to variations of the same sequence containing gaps of 1-6 bp. The T3 receptor not only fails to activate transcription from estrogen response elements in vivo, but inhibits estrogen-dependent transactivation. We propose that the T3 receptor binds to estrogen response elements in a transcriptionally inactive form and competes for estrogen receptor binding, resulting in a net decrease in gene expression. These data reveal that only a subset of T3 receptor DNA-binding elements function as T3 response elements."
https://openalex.org/W1992073293,"The structure of a presumptive DNA intermediate in the integration of retroviral DNA was studied in a cell-free reaction with exogenously added target DNA. The product made by viral core particles of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) containing linear viral DNA has a structure consistent with an integration mechanism similar to that observed during bacteriophage Mu transposition. In this intermediate, the 3′ ends of the LTR sequences are joined to the target DNA, while the 5′ ends of the viral DNA remain unjoined. The 5′ ends of the LTR sequences in the intermediate are exactly the same as those found in the unintegrated linear double-stranded viral DNA. This result demonstrates that the linear form of Mo-MLV DNA can integrate directly without prior circularization."
https://openalex.org/W2148859347,"The steroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone is the physiological inducer of molting and metamorphosis in insects. In ecdysone-sensitive Drosophila Kc cells, the insecticide RH 5849 (1,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine) mimics the action of 20-hydroxyecdysone by causing the formation of processes, an inhibition of cell proliferation, and induction of acetylcholinesterase. RH 5849 also competes with [3H]ponasterone A for high-affinity ecdysone receptor sites from Kc cell extracts. Resistant cell populations selected by growth in the continued presence of either RH 5849 or 20-hydroxyecdysone are insensitive to both compounds and exhibit a decreased titer of measurable ecdysone receptors. Although it is less potent than 20-hydroxyecdysone in both whole-cell and cell-free receptor assays, RH 5849 is the first nonsteroidal ecdysone agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1574033922,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells incorporate 12-(1'-pyrene) dodecanoic acid (P12) into membrane lipids. Exposure of P12-labeled cells to long wavelength ultraviolet light causes cell killing, presumably because excitation of the pyrene moiety (a photosensitizer) leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Cytotoxicity is dependent upon the concentration of P12 used to label the cells, and time of UV exposure, and the presence of oxygen during irradiation. CHO mutant cells deficient in plasmalogen biosynthesis and peroxisome assembly (Zoeller, R.A., and Raetz, C.R.H. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 5170-5174) are several orders of magnitude more sensitive to P12/UV treatment than wild-type cells, permitting direct selection of one wild-type cell in 1 X 10(4) mutant cells. A major factor responsible for the P12/UV hypersensitivity of these mutants appears to be the absence of plasmalogens. Supplementation of the mutants with 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycerol restores plasmalogen levels and nearly normal resistance to P12/UV treatment, whereas the biogenesis of peroxisomes is not restored. The P12/UV hypersensitivity of the plasmalogen-deficient mutants, together with the selective, P12/UV-induced decomposition of plasmalogens in wild-type cells, documented in the accompanying manuscript, suggest that the vinyl ether linkage of plasmalogens plays a direct role in protecting animal cell membranes against certain oxidative stresses."

https://openalex.org/W2012120642,"Drug resistance represents a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy. However, the specific biochemical mechanisms responsible for clinical drug resistance are unknown. In these studies resistance to the antitumor agent adriamycin was found to involve two mechanisms, one that decreased drug accumulation by the P170 mechanism and another that altered the glutathione redox cycle, an important pathway in the detoxification of reactive oxygen. This dual mechanism of drug resistance was demonstrated in cell lines that had acquired the multidrug-resistant phenotype and in human colorectal cancer cells with de novo resistance. These studies support a model of acquired and de novo multidrug resistance that includes alterations in both drug accumulation and the glutathione redox cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2051254858,"An octamer DNA sequence plays a critical role in directing transcription of immunoglobulin genes in B lymphocytes. A new technique of direct binding of radioactive DNA was used to screen a complementary DNA expression library from the BJAB cell line in lambda gt11 phage to derive molecular cDNA clones representing a putative B lymphocyte-specific octamer binding protein. The plaques were screened with DNA containing four copies of the octamer sequence and positive phage recombinants were identified. The fusion protein produced on inducing a lysogen of one phage bound to a monomeric octamer probe. The cDNA insert from this phage hybridized to messenger RNA found in B lymphocytes, but not in most other cells. Thus, this cDNA derives from a gene (oct-2) that specifies an octamer binding protein expressed preferentially in B lymphocytes, proving that, for at least one gene, a cell-specific transcription factor exists and its amount is controlled through messenger RNA availability."
https://openalex.org/W1986614396,"Swarmer cell genes, laf, are induced when V. parahaemolyticus is grown on the surface of solidified media, embedded in solidified media, suspended in viscous media, or agglutinated with antibody in liquid media. These conditions have in common the constraint of the movement of the polar flagellum. To test the hypothesis that the polar flagellum functions as a sensor necessary for control of swarmer cell formation, we have constructed a variety of mutations in genes encoding components of the polar flagellum, fla. The consequence of such mutations is the constitutive expression of laf genes. So, the performance of the polar flagellum is coupled to the transcription of laf genes such that when function is perturbed, either physically or genetically, swarmer cell genes are induced. Because the polar flagellum appears to be capable of sensing external forces influencing its motion, we suggest it is acting as a dynamometer."

https://openalex.org/W2089981004,"A series of four hairpin deoxyoligonucleotides was synthesized with a four-nucleotide central loop (either C or G) flanked by the complementary sequences d(T)10 and d(A)10. Two of the molecules contain either a 3'-p-3' or 5'-p-5' linkage in the loop, so that the strands in the stem have the same, that is, parallel (ps) polarity. The pair of reference oligonucleotides have normal phosphodiester linkages throughout and antiparallel (aps) stem regions. All the molecules adopt a duplex helical structure in that (i) the electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels of the ps and aps oligomers are similar. (ii) The ps hairpins are substrates for T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and Escherichia coli exonuclease III. (iii) Salt-dependent thermal transitions are observed for all hairpins, but the ps molecules denature 10 degrees C lower than the corresponding aps oligomers. (iv) The ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectra are indicative of a base-paired duplex in the stems of the ps hairpins but differ systematically from those of the aps counterparts. (v) The bis-benzimidazole drug Hoechst-33258, which binds in the minor groove of B-DNA, exhibits very little fluorescence in the presence of the ps hairpins but a normal, enhanced emission with the aps oligonucleotides. In contrast, the intercalator ethidium bromide forms a strongly fluorescent complex with all hairpins, the intensity of which is even higher for the ps species. (vi) The pattern of chemical methylation is the same for both the ps and aps hairpins. The combined results are consistent with the prediction from force field analysis of a parallel stranded right-handed helical form of d(A)n.d(T)n with a secondary structure involving reverse Watson-Crick base pairs and a stability not significantly different from that of the B-DNA double helix. Models of the various hairpins optimized with force field calculations are described."
https://openalex.org/W2012490729,"A novel CCAAT binding factor (CBF) composed of two different subunits has been extensively purified from rat liver. Both subunits are needed for specific binding to DNA. Addition of this purified protein to nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stimulates transcription from several promoters including the alpha 2(I) collagen, the alpha 1(I) collagen, the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV-LTR), and the adenovirus major late promoter. Point mutations in the CCAAT motif that show either no binding or a decreased binding of CBF likewise abolish or reduce activation of transcription by CBF. Activation of transcription requires, therefore, the specific binding of CBF to its recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W1500405769,"Abstract Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) photosensitized with 12-(1'-pyrene)dodecanoic acid (P12) are killed when exposed to long wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light (greater than 300 nm). Mutants deficient in plasmalogen biosynthesis are hypersensitive to this treatment. We now demonstrate that plasmenylethanolamine is rapidly and preferentially destroyed when CHO-K1 cells, photosensitized either with P12 or merocyanine 540, are irradiated with light of the appropriate wavelength. Using [2-14C]ethanolamine, [1-14C]hexadecanol, or [U-14C]hexadecanol to follow the turnover of plasmenylethanolamine, we show that 2-monoacylglycerophosphoethanolamine, formic acid, and pentadecanal are formed during P12/UV treatment of CHO-K1 cells, but not of mutant cells deficient in plasmalogen synthesis. The decomposition of plasmenylethanolamine is O2-dependent, is enhanced in D2O, and is reduced in the presence of sodium azide. The process may be explained, in part, by the cycloaddition of singlet oxygen to the vinyl ether linkage of plasmenylethanolamine, generating a dioxetane intermediate that would be expected to decompose under physiological conditions to the observed products. An additional possibility is the formation of an allylic hydroperoxide at the 1'-carbon of the alkyl moiety by an ene reaction of singlet oxygen, or by radical-mediated oxidation, followed by metabolism or chemical decomposition of the hydroperoxide. Given the P12/UV hypersensitivity of plasmalogen-deficient mutants, we suggest that plasmalogens might protect animal cell membranes from singlet oxygen and/or radical-initiated oxidation by functioning as scavengers and decomposing to products that can be reutilized."
https://openalex.org/W1595534151,"Injection of cycloheximide into rats induced the incorporation of up to 5 mol of phosphate/mol of liver 40 S ribosomal protein S6. Treatment of the protein with cyanogen bromide generated three phosphopeptides of Mr approximately 31,000, approximately 27,000, and approximately 4,000. Increasing the concentration of cyanogen bromide or redigestion of the larger peptides with additional cyanogen bromide converted almost all the phosphate-containing peptides into the Mr approximately 4,000 peptide. This peptide was isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the phosphoserines were identified by amino acid sequence analysis after being converted to S-ethyl-cysteine. The results show that the phosphate is incorporated into 5 of 7 serines clustered in a small 13-amino acid segment of the protein. By aligning the sequence of the Mr approximately 4,000 peptide with the recently published mouse cDNA sequence of S6, it is shown that this peptide resides at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The relevance of the cycloheximide-induced sites of S6 phosphorylation to those stimulated by a variety of mitogens and oncogenes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1679079033,"Chromogranin A (CGA), also referred to as secretory protein I, is an acidic protein that has been detected in all neuroendocrine cell types examined and is often present in large amounts relative to other secreted proteins. For example, CGA comprises at least 40% of the soluble protein of the adrenal chromaffin granule, and it appears to be the major secretory protein in the parathyroid secretory granules. CGA complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from bovine adrenal and pituitary have recently been cloned and sequenced and found to be nearly identical. A region of bovine CGA has a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to pancreastatin, a recently isolated porcine peptide that inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion. This suggests that CGA may be a prohormone. We have cloned and sequenced a human cDNA encoding CGA. This human CGA cDNA has an overall 86% nucleic acid identity to the bovine cDNA. Like the bovine CGA cDNA, the human cDNA has little homology to pancreastatin at the 5' region of this peptide but significant amino acid homology to the carboxyl-terminal portion of pancreastatin where the biologic activity resides. There is an area within the pancreastatin region of human CGA and porcine pancreastatin with a 70% amino acid identity to the calcium-binding moiety of the E-F hand proteins such as parvalbumin and oncomodulin. These data suggest that CGA and pancreastatin may both be members of a larger family of calcium-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1970370354,"mRNA splicing in C. elegans is unusual: most introns are very short (approximately 50 bases), and many mRNAs receive a leader by trans-splicing. The donor in trans-splicing is a 94 nucleotide molecule, termed the leader RNA, that contributes its 5' 22 nucleotides to a variety of mRNAs. We show here that C. elegans has the usual snRNAs, which presumably catalyze the splicing reactions. As expected, they are bound to the Sm antigen and have 2,2,7-methylguanosine caps. Remarkably, the trans-spliced leader RNA is also Sm-associated and has this special cap. Hence, a molecule discovered as a substate of splicing has properties of molecules heretofore known only to facilitate splicing of other RNAs. Mature mRNAs that have received the leader evidently lack 2,2,7-methylguanosine caps, suggesting that these caps are removed or altered during processing."
https://openalex.org/W1604915447,"Rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 form RLM2 is a testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase reported to be male-specific on the basis of purification studies (Jansson, I., Mole, J., and Schenkman, J. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7084-7093). The sex dependence, developmental regulation, xenobiotic induction, and hormonal control of P-450 RLM2 expression were studied using P-450 form-specific immunochemical and catalytic assays. Polyclonal antibodies raised to rat hepatic P-450 3 (P-450 gene IIA1) were found to cross-react strongly with P-450 RLM2, but not with 10 other rat P-450 forms, suggesting that P-450 3 and P-450 RLM2 are highly conserved in primary structure. Western blotting of liver microsomes under conditions where P-450s 3 and RLM2 are resolved electrophoretically revealed that P-450 RLM2 is markedly induced at puberty in male rats, with no protein detected (less than or equal to 5% of adult male levels) in adult females or immature animals of either sex. A similar developmental dependence was observed for hepatic microsomal testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity, which was found to be catalyzed primarily by P-450 RLM2. P-450 RLM2 was resistant to induction by several xenobiotics and in the case of phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone, was suppressed by 50-60%. Studies on the steroid hormonal regulation of P-450 RLM2 revealed that its adult male-specific expression is imprinted (programmed) in response to neonatal testosterone exposure. Ovariectomy studies demonstrated that suppression by estrogen does not contribute significantly to the absence of P-450 RLM2 in adult female rats. Although the male-specific developmental induction of P-450 RLM2 in response to neonatal testosterone is strikingly similar to that of P-450 2c (testosterone 2 alpha/16 alpha-hydroxylase; gene IIC11), P-450 RLM2 expression is not dependent on the pulsatile pituitary growth hormone secretion required for P-450 2c synthesis. Rather, hypophysectomy of adult male rats increased P-450 RLM2 and its associated testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity by 50-100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Previous attempts to isolate miraculin from deeply colored alkaline extracts of the miracle fruit were unsuccessful. We found that miraculin is extracted with 0.5 M NaCl solution. The extracted solution is colorless and shows the strong sweet-inducing activity. Miraculin was purified from the extracted solution by ammonium sulfate fractionation, CM-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography, and concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified miraculin thus obtained gave a single sharp peak in reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, indicating that it is highly pure. The sample also gave a single band having molecular weight 28,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This value was much lower than the values reported previously (40,000-48,000). The amino acid composition of the purified miraculin was determined. Sequence analysis of the purified miraculin indicated that it is composed of a pure single polypeptide and identified 20 amino-terminal amino acids. The purified miraculin contained as much as 13.9% of sugars, which consisted of glucosamine, mannose, galactose, xylose, and fucose in a molar ratio of 3.03:3.00:0.69:0.96:2.12."
https://openalex.org/W1544613268,"Cofilin is a widely distributed, pH-sensitive, actin-modulating protein with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa, which forms intranuclear and/or cytoplasmic actin/cofilin rods in cultured fibroblastic cells under specific conditions. In this study, a cDNA library from porcine brain mRNA was constructed, and full-length brain cofilin cDNA clones were isolated by screening with oligonucleotide probes. The deduced amino acid sequence of cofilin is 166 residues long and contains a sequence of Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Lys which is very similar to the nuclear transport signal sequence (Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val) of SV40 large T antigen. The sequence may act as a signal capable of inducing nuclear accumulation of cofilin in cells exposed to heat shock or dimethyl sulfoxide. The cofilin sequence contains a hexapeptide (Asp-Ala-Ile-Lys-Lys-Lys) identical to the amino-terminal sequence (residues 2-7) of muscle and nonmuscle tropomyosin. Cofilin also has in the carboxyl-terminal portion a region homologous to the sequence shared by gelsolin, fragmin, and Acanthamoeba profilin. Furthermore, the overall amino acid sequence of cofilin shows weak homology with the rod portion of myosin and suggests a high alpha-helical content."

Transport of HCO3- was estimated from its effect on intracellular pH (pHi) measured with the fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. The associated ion fluxes were estimated from the transport of 36Cl- and 22Na+. Na+-dependent and Na+-independent HCO3-/Cl- antiport were found in many, but not in all cell lines tested. The Na+-independent HCO3-/Cl- antiport was found to be highly pHi-dependent in a number of cell lines, whereas in others this was not the case. Some cell lines were found to have both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent HCO3-/Cl- antiport, whereas in others we could detect only one of these mechanisms. Na+/H+ antiport, which is quantitatively the most important H+-extruding mechanism, was found in all cell lines tested, but the activity varied strongly. Possible reasons for the qualitative and quantitative differences in antiport activity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1548140634,"Elongation factor 1 beta (EF-1 beta) from Artemia is phosphorylated to a high percentage at serine 89 by an endogenous kinase present in EF-1 beta gamma. Protein sequencing of EF-1 beta revealed that this serine residue is located N-terminally of an acidic cluster of amino acids, (formula; see text) which is critical for casein kinase II-type substrate recognition. A number of compounds known to influence casein kinases were studied, revealing that the kinase activity as present in EF-1 beta gamma belongs to the class of casein kinase II. The rate of nucleotide exchange on EF-1 alpha as catalyzed by EF-1 beta was found to be affected reversibly by the state of phosphorylation of EF-1 beta. In the presence of dephosphorylated EF-1 beta, the exchange rate is almost twice as large compared to the rate in the presence of phosphorylated EF-1 beta. Rephosphorylation of dephosphorylated EF-1 beta diminishes the activity of the protein again. The role of casein kinase II-type enzymes in modulating the function of proteins involved in polypeptide synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565049972,"Abstract A bacteriophage T4 insertion/substitution vector system has been developed as a means of introducing in vitro generated mutations into the T4 chromosome. The insertion/substitution vector is a 2638-base pair plasmid containing the pBR322 origin of replication and ampicillin resistance determinant, a T4 gene 23 promoter/synthetic supF tRNA gene fusion, and a polylinker with eight unique restriction enzyme recognition sites. A T4 chromosomal DNA sequence is cloned into this vector and mutated by standard recombinant DNA techniques. Escherichia coli cells containing this plasmid are then infected with T4 bacteriophage that carry amber mutations in two essential genes. The plasmid integrates into the T4 chromosome by recombination between the plasmid-borne T4 target sequence and its homologous chromosomal counterpart. The resulting phage, termed integrants, are selectable by the supF-mediated suppression of their two amber mutations. Thus, although the integrants comprise 1-3% or less of the total phage progeny, growth on a nonsuppressing host permits their direct selection. The pure integrant phage can be either analyzed directly for a possible mutant phenotype or transferred to nonselective growth conditions. In the latter case, plasmid-free phage segregants rapidly accumulate due to homologous recombination between the duplicated target sequences surrounding the supF sequence in each integrant chromosome. A major fraction of these segregants will retain the in vitro generated mutation within their otherwise unchanged chromosomes and are isolated as stable mutant bacteriophage. The insertion/substitution vector system thereby allows any in vitro mutated gene to be readily substituted for its wild-type counterpart in the bacteriophage T4 genome."
https://openalex.org/W1563824362,"We have purified S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase about 3000-fold from bovine brain extract. The Km values of the enzyme for L-methionine and ATP were 10 and 50 microM, respectively. An apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 160 kDa by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation gave a sedimentation coefficient of 8 S. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in native system revealed a single protein band, whereas two polypeptide bands with molecular masses of 48 kDa (p48) and 38 kDa (p38) were observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme. Antibody against bovine brain AdoMet synthetase was prepared by injecting the purified enzyme into a rabbit. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the antibody recognized both p48 and p38 in the impure enzyme preparations from bovine brain as well as in the purified enzyme. Specific antibodies against p48 and p38 were separated from the immunoglobulin fraction by an affinity purification, both of which inhibited the enzyme activity. These results indicate that AdoMet synthetase from bovine brain consists of two different polypeptides, p48 and p38."
https://openalex.org/W1546247834,"We have characterized a cDNA with complete coding sequence for the rat liver glutathione S-transferase subunit 4 (Yb2) isolated from a constructed lambda gt10 cDNA library. Functional expression of the cDNA sequence has resulted in the purification to homogeneity of an enzymatically active anionic glutathione S-transferase. In addition to three previously described Yb-type subunits (Yb1, Yb2, Yb3), we now report characterization of a fourth Yb subunit sequence in the form of a genomic DNA clone lambda GTR15-2. The Yb4 gene has no apparent defect, and the deduced Yb4 polypeptide sequence differs from the other three Ybs by 40 to 53 amino acids. The Yb4 gene organization is similar to that of the Yb2 gene in having a minimum of eight exons. Three out of the seven introns between the two genes are conserved to the extent of more than 88% nucleotide identity. We propose that gene conversion may have played a role in the evolution of these Yb genes."
https://openalex.org/W1507169382,"Aging of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts in vitro is accompanied by significant changes of polyamine metabolism, most notably, a 5-fold decrease of serum-induced activity of ornithine decarboxylase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines (Chen, K. Y., Chang, Z. F., and Liu, A. Y.-C. (1986) J. Cell. Physiol. 129, 142-146). In this paper, we employed Northern blot hybridization and affinity radiolabeling techniques to investigate the molecular basis of this age-associated change of ornithine decarboxylase activity. Since the induction of ornithine decarboxylase by serum is a mid-G1 event, we also examined expressions of other cell cycle-dependent genes that are induced before and after the mid-G1 phase to determine if their expressions may also be age-dependent. Our results demonstrated a 3-fold decrease of the amount of active ornithine decarboxylase molecules that can be labeled by alpha-difluoromethyl[3H]ornithine in senescent IMR-90 cells (population doubling level (PDL) = 52) as compared to young cells (PDL = 22). However, the levels and kinetics of induction of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA in both young and senescent IMR-90 cells were found to be identical throughout a 24-h time period after serum stimulation. The time course and the magnitude of the expression of c-myc, an early G1 gene, were quite similar in young and senescent IMR-90 cells and appeared to be PDL-independent. In contrast, the expression of thymidine kinase, a late G1/S gene, was significantly reduced in senescent IMR-90 cells. Levels of thymidine kinase mRNA and thymidine kinase activity in senescent IMR-90 cells were 6- and 8-fold less than those in young cells, respectively. Based on these data, we proposed that impairment of cell cycling in senescent IMR-90 cells may occur at the late G1/S phase and that decreases of ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine accumulation during cell senescence may contribute to this impairment."
https://openalex.org/W1544152444,"Two ATPase inhibitor proteins were isolated together from bovine heart mitochondria by a new procedure; each was purified further. The one inhibitor is a Ca2+-binding protein. It was found to contain 2 cysteine residues/mol as well as threonine and proline residues, all of which the other inhibitor (first isolated by Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M.E., and Monroy, G. C. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762-3769] lacks. Its minimal molecular weight was 6390 with 62 amino acid residues/mol, and its isoelectric point was 4.6. Besides differences in size, composition, and response to Ca2+, the two inhibitor proteins also differed in response to sulfhydryl compounds, pH, KCl, and cardiolipin. Inhibition by the two inhibitor proteins was additive. Both cross-reacted with mitochondrial ATPase from rat skeletal muscle. Calmodulin, with or without Ca2+, had no effect on the activity of either inhibitor protein. Antibody to the Ca2+-binding inhibitor protein did not interact with the Pullman-Monroy inhibitor or have any effect on its activity. The antibody interacted with intact submitochondrial particles that contained both inhibitor proteins but not with particles from which only the Ca2+-binding inhibitor had been removed. Clearly, the two inhibitors are distinct immunologically as well as in other properties. The two types of inhibitor protein were also isolated from rat skeletal muscle mitochondria by the new procedure."
https://openalex.org/W1553994079,"The stability (reflected in denaturation temperature, Td) of defatted human albumin monomer, monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, decreases with increasing protein concentration. This is shown to be compatible with a simple model in which reversible polymerization of denatured monomer promotes unfolding. This model also predicts an increase in transition cooperativity with decreasing protein concentration whereas experimentally cooperativity decreases because the rate of thermally induced polymerization of unfolded monomer is slow relative to the scan rate of the calorimeter. The denaturation of undefatted human albumin monomer, subsaturated with high affinity endogenous long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), was previously observed by differential scanning calorimetry to be a biphasic process. Td for the first endotherm, associated with the denaturation of LCFA-poor species, decreases with increasing protein concentration similar to that for defatted monomer whereas Td for the second endotherm, associated with denaturation of LCFA-rich species, is independent of concentration. The magnitude of the concentration dependence of Td relates directly to the extent of polymerization of denatured monomer, which decreases with increasing level of bound ligand. The bimodal thermogram observed for undefatted monomer persists upon simultaneous extrapolation of Td values to low concentration and low scan rate thereby demonstrating that this biphasic denaturation arising from ligand redistribution during denaturation is a true thermodynamic phenomenon and not an artifact of specific experimental conditions or the method used to induce denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1547967030,"Abstract Carboxypeptidase I from germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare) grain consists of two peptide chains linked by disulfides; the A- and B-chains contain 266 and 148 amino acid residues, respectively (Sorensen, S. B., Breddam, K., and Svendsen, I. (1986) Carlsberg Res. Commun. 51, 475-485). A cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from scutella of 2-day germinated barley has now been screened with a mixed oligonucleotide encoding a peptide fragment of the A-chain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 1443-nucleotide pair cDNA clone revealed that both chains of the enzyme are translated from a single mRNA. The coding region of the A-chain is located at the 5'-end of the cDNA and is separated from the B-chain coding region by a 165-nucleotide pair linking region. The B-chain coding region is followed by a stop codon, a 187-nucleotide pair 3'-untranslated sequence, and a short polyadenylic acid tail. The results indicate that the A- and B-chains of barley carboxypeptidase I arise by endoproteolytic excision of a 55-residue linker peptide from a single precursor polypeptide chain. The putative linker peptide is rich in proline, lysine, and arginine residues, has an apparent pI of 11.9, and appears to be excised by cleavage of peptide bonds on the COOH-terminal side of serine residues."

To evaluate more directly the effects of the proliferative state, subconfluent cultures of smooth muscle cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum; under these conditions of growth factor deprivation, cells become quiescent within 72 h. The mRNA levels for type I and III collagens increased markedly within 12 h; at 48 h, they were between 2- and 15-fold higher than in cells growing exponentially. Upon addition of serum to quiescent cultures, cells re-entered the cycle, and collagen mRNA levels decreased. Expression of alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(III) mRNAs differed significantly, indicating differential gene regulation. In nuclear run-off assays, changes detected in collagen transcription were insufficient to account for changes in mRNA levels, suggesting additional post-transcriptional sites of control. The inverse response of collagen expression to the proliferative state suggests that exposure of smooth muscle cells in vivo to factors which influence their growth state could have profound effects on the structure of the arterial wall."
https://openalex.org/W1499563901,"Previous observations established that fibroblasts from a proband with atypical osteogenesis imperfecta synthesized about equal amounts of normal pro-alpha 2(I) chains and shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen. The pro-alpha 2(I) chains were shortened because of an in-frame deletion of most or all of the 18 amino acids encoded by exon 11 of the pro-alpha 2(I) gene. Here it was demonstrated that one of the proband's alleles for the pro-alpha 2(I) gene contained a 19-base pair deletion at the junction of intervening sequence 10 and exon 11 that produced an RNA splicing defect. Probe protection experiments did not reveal any evidence for use of cryptic splice sites, and they suggested that the major species of abnormally spliced pro-alpha 2(I) mRNA in the proband's fibroblasts was completely spliced from exon 10 to 12. The defect in RNA splicing is unusual among RNA-splicing mutations in producing an abnormal polypeptide chain that is used for protomer assembly. Since the probe protection experiments showed the same defect in the mRNA from the fibroblasts of the asymptomatic mother, the mutation was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but showed variable phenotypic expression in the proband's family."
https://openalex.org/W1570302662,"The human metallothionein (MT)-IG gene (hMT-IG) is tandemly linked in a head-to-head fashion with the hMT-IF gene. The hMT-IG gene encodes a MT-I polypeptide and has a tripartite structure. The 5'-flanking region of the hMT-IG gene has a TATAA box, four GC motifs, and at least four metal responsive elements. The 3'-untranslated region has a variation of the polyadenylation signal, AATTAA, and the 3'-flanking region a YGTGTTYY RNA processing signal. This gene is expressed in hepatoma-derived cell lines (Hep G2 and Hep3B2) in response to the heavy metals (cadmium, copper, and zinc) but not to the glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone. In contrast, the lymphoblastoid cell line (Wi-L2) does not express the hMT-IG gene. These results suggest that the hMT-IG gene is regulated differentially and in a cell type-specific manner. Transient expression studies of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the transcriptional control of either the hMT-IG or hMT-IF promoter in Hep G2 cells has demonstrated that both promoters contain all the necessary cis-acting elements to elicit a similar pattern of heavy metal inducibility. However, the hMT-IG promoter in all instances is five times more active than the hMT-IF promoter. The differences in promoter activity of these genes could possibly be due to inherent differences in their basal level regulatory sequences. The expression of MT-IGcat in transfected Wi-L2 cells demonstrates that the hMT-IG promoter is not cell type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1588869034,"Tertiary initiation of bacteriophage T4 DNA replication is resistant to the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin and apparently involved in the activity of recombination hot spots in the T4 genome (Kreuzer, K. N., and Alberts, B. M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3345-3349). One of the origins that function by the tertiary mechanism maps at the promoter for gene uvs Y. A deletion and a linker-insertion mutation in the uvsY promoter/origin region were generated by in vitro manipulations and then placed into the T4 genome using the insertion/substitution system (Selick, H. E., Kreuzer, K. N., and Alberts, B. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11336-11347). Both resulting phage strains are uvsY- mutants, but they differ in that one has a deletion of the minimal tertiary origin and the other does not. The effects of the uvsY mutations on tertiary origin activity were assayed by infecting tertiary origin plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli with the two phage mutants. The tertiary origin plasmids replicated extensively after infection by either uvsY- phage mutant, demonstrating that the uvsY protein is not required for tertiary initiation. The extent of plasmid replication was increased dramatically as a result of either mutation, indicating that the uvsY protein plays some negative role in either the initiation or subsequent processing of plasmid replicative intermediates. The phage strain with an origin deletion induced the replication of a tertiary origin plasmid with which it shared no homology. Therefore, plasmid-phage recombination is not required for the replication of tertiary origin plasmids. The replication of a tertiary origin plasmid is also shown to be independent of the phage genes uvsX, 59, and 46, but markedly reduced by mutations in the T4-induced topoisomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1519264432,"The replication of plasmids containing fragments of the T4 genome, but no phage replication origins, was analyzed as a possible model for phage secondary (recombination-dependent) replication initiation. The replication of such plasmids after T4 infection was reduced or eliminated by mutations in several phage genes (uvsY, uvsX, 46, 59, 39, and 52) that have previously been shown to be involved in secondary initiation. A series of plasmids that collectively contain about 60 kilobase pairs of the T4 genome were tested for replication after T4 infection. With the exception of those known to contain tertiary origins, every plasmid replicated in a uvsY-dependent fashion. Thus, there is no apparent requirement for an extensive nucleotide sequence in the uvsY-dependent plasmid replication. However, homology with the phage genome is required since the plasmid vector alone did not replicate after phage infection. The products of plasmid replication included long concatemeric molecules with as many as 35 tandem copies of plasmid sequence. The production of concatemers indicates that plasmid replication is an active process and not simply the result of passive replication after the integration of plasmids into the phage genome. We conclude that plasmids with homology to the T4 genome utilize the secondary initiation mechanism of the phage. This simple model system should be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanism of recombination-dependent DNA synthesis in phage T4."
https://openalex.org/W1607797227,"The effects on cultured baby hamster kidney cells of 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane, a potent new inhibitor of mammalian ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases and of spermidine synthase, were studied. At 0.5 mM concentration in the culture medium, the drug did not interfere with the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway nor with the polyamine transport system, but it blocked the proliferation and macromolecule synthesis of the cells and reduced the cellular spermidine level to less than 10% of the control value at identical cell density. These changes were accompanied by a total cessation of the excretion of putrescine, spermidine, and acetylated polyamines into the culture medium, greatly increased activity of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases, and an accumulation of both decarboxylated and intact S-adenosylmethionine. These effects were reversed by the removal of the inhibitor from the culture medium or by supplementing the medium with either 0.5 mM putrescine or 0.1 mM spermidine. In the former case, however, a lag period of 24 h was necessary for the cells to recover. The elevated concentration of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine normalized very slowly but apparently had no harmful effects on the cells. The clonigenic potential of the cells was only slightly reduced by prolonged treatment with 0.5 mM 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane. Thus, the new drug is not toxic to the cells, but either directly or indirectly stops their proliferation by preventing the adequate formation of putrescine and spermidine."
https://openalex.org/W2158605718,"Apical membranes of renal epithelial cells were shown to be more rigid than other plasma membranes, due in part to the abundance of sphingomyelin among their constituent phospholipids. Tight junctions play a key role in maintaining differences between the apical and the basolateral domains of the plasma membrane with respect to their lipid composition and fluidity. To evaluate the influence of alterations of membrane fluidity on the activity of two apically located transport systems, we compared the effect of opening of tight junctions, by a preincubation period in calcium-deprived medium and of increasing fluidity, with benzyl alcohol, on Na-dependent uptakes of Pi and alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (MGP) in intact, confluent LLC-PK1 cells and MDCK cells. Benzyl alcohol, at 10 mM, increased the Vmax of Pi uptake by 55 and 42% in LLC-PK1 cells and MDCK cells, respectively, but decreased the Vmax of MGP uptake in LLC -PK1 cells by 23%. Similarly to 10 mM benzyl alcohol, opening of tight junctions also increased the Vmax of Pi uptake by 45 and 46% in LLC-PK1 cells and MDCK cells, respectively, and depressed MGP uptake in LLC-PK1 cells by inducing a 15% decrease of the Vmax. None of the two maneuvers (i.e. addition of benzyl alcohol or opening of tight junctions) affected the Km values of the transport systems. From these results it is concluded that (i) the increase in membrane fluidity, achieved either by benzyl alcohol or by opening of tight junctions, affects Na-Pi and Na-glucose cotransports differently, reflecting differences in the lipid environments of the two transport systems, and (ii) membrane fluidity might play a physiological role in the modulation of the activity of transport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1485522786,"The DNA sequence requirements of two T4 tertiary replication origins have been characterized by a deletion analysis of origin-containing plasmids. Maximal replication of each origin-containing plasmid required both an intact gpmotA-dependent middle-mode promoter sequence and approximately 50 base pairs of the downstream region. In contrast, gpmotA-dependent transcription from the origin promoter was found to be independent of the downstream region. The requirement for a promoter element within the tertiary origins is striking, particularly since the replication of tertiary origin-containing plasmids is resistant to the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin."
https://openalex.org/W2097697129,"8-Azidoadenine was employed as a photoaffinity probe of the adenine binding site of the seed lectin from lima beans and from Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin. This compound was shown to (a) bind competitively to the adenine binding site of these lectins and (b) exhibit enhanced binding in the presence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid in the same manner as adenine. The presence or absence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid during labeling caused no change in the peptide maps of either lectin when digested with trypsin. The peptide maps of each lectin showed one major peak of radioactivity. Sequencing of the corresponding tryptic peptide from lima bean lectin indicated the primary structure to be Val-Leu-Ile-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Ser-Ser-Thr-Lys. The sequence of the labeled peptide isolated from P. vulgaris erythroagglutinin was Thr-Thr-Thr-Trp-Asp-Phe-Val-Gly-Glu-Asn-Glu-Val-Leu-Ile-Thr-Tyr, which corresponded to residues 173-190 of the cDNA-derived sequence (Hoffman, L. M., and Donaldson, D. D. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 883-889). Residues 186-190 (italicized) are identical to the first five amino acids in the lima bean lectin peptide. The peptides are located at the COOH-terminal half of the lectin and show extensive homology with other legume lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1662064273,"Two functional human genes coding for 7 S RNA species K and L were analyzed for promoter requirements by in vitro transcription experiments with cytoplasmic S-100 extracts. Since accurate and efficient transcription of both genes is dependent on the presence of 5'-flanking sequences, hybrid genes representing crossover fusions between the 5' external control regions and the coding sequences of both genes were analyzed for their capacity to direct RNA synthesis in vitro. Differing results were obtained with both types of constructs. While the 5'-flanking L-7 S K gene fusion revealed no activity in the in vitro transcription assay, the 5'-flanking sequence of the 7 S K RNA gene did confer the ability for accurate in vitro transcription to the 7 S L coding sequence. However, a 5'-flanking L sequence element including the first 22 nucleotides of the 7 S L RNA coding sequence was active in promoting transcription of the 7 S K RNA gene. Together, these results demonstrated that the 7 S L promoter is located inside and outside the coding region, whereas the 7 S K RNA gene is exclusively controlled by an upstream promoter element."

https://openalex.org/W1572198013,"Glycoproteins synthesized by the Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants LEC11 and LEC12 carry the Lex determinant (Gal beta 1,4(Fuc alpha 1,3)GlcNAc), while those synthesized by LEC11 cells also carry the sialyl-Lex determinant (NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4(Fuc alpha 1,3)GlcNAc), and both mutants have been shown to possess a distinct alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase of the appropriate specificity to synthesize these determinants (Campbell, C., and Stanley, P. (1983) Cell 35, 303-309; Campbell, C., and Stanley, P. (1984), J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11208-11214; Howard, D. R., Fukuda, M., Fukuda, M. N., and Stanley, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16830-16837). The LEC11 cells therefore provide a source of carbohydrates terminating in sialylated, fucosylated lactosamine, a relatively rare structure not previously characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy when in association with an N-linked carbohydrate. In this paper we use a monoclonal antibody specific for Lex to show that the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) grown in LEC11 and LEC12 cells possesses the Lex determinant and that G from LEC11/VSV also possesses sialylated Lex. Biantennary carbohydrates purified from LEC11/VSV and LEC12/VSV were therefore used to examine the effects on the 1H NMR spectrum of the presence of alpha(1,3)-fucose residues on sialylated and unsialylated lactosamine units. Comparisons of one-dimensional spectra obtained at 500 MHz from LEC11/VSV and LEC12/VSV glycopeptides before and after neuraminidase treatment with spectra of biantennary carbohydrates lacking alpha(1,3)-fucose allowed the assignment of several new resonances. Resolution of certain signals and determinations of coupling constants were achieved by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (COSY) at 400 MHz and allowed the assignment of several more resonances in the one-dimensional spectrum."

E., Weiel, J., and Yount, R. G. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4696-4706; Cheung, H. C., Gonsoulin, F., and Garland, F. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 832, 52-62). Fluorescence stopped-flow experiments on the same system have yielded biphasic traces which are resolvable into a fast and slow component, k1 and k2, respectively. Results of experiments in which k1 and k2 were measured as a function of excess ADP concentration showed: 1) a nonlinear dependence of the apparent rate constants on [ADP]; 2) k1 is a factor of 10 faster than k2. These results are consistent with the 3-step mechanism previously proposed for nucleotide binding to myosin S1 (Garland, F., and Cheung, H. C. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 5281-5289). Kinetic experiments in which the anisotropy of the donor was monitored show this quantity to be unchanged over the course of the reaction. The biphasic decrease of donor intensity is assigned to an increase in energy transfer efficiency which, from the above results, is due to a decrease in donor-acceptor distance, occurring in two steps. The fast step is associated with a 4-5-A decrease of the donor-acceptor separation, while the slow step is associated with a further decrease of approximately 2 A."
https://openalex.org/W1919945150,"Human and rabbit plasma contains a lipid transfer protein that transfers cholesteryl esters and triglycerides among the plasma lipoproteins and may also have a role in the movement of lipids into and out of cells. Little is known about the regulation of the activity of the lipid transfer protein, but in the rabbit, hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plasma lipid transfer activity (LTA). Perfused rabbit livers secrete LTA, and hepatic cholesterol secretion is increased in rabbits with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Thus, experiments were performed with rabbits to determine if LTA is regulated by a concerted hepatic secretion of lipoprotein protein cholesterol and LTA. Rabbits were fed chow or chow plus coconut oil (14% wt/wt), and plasma lipids, LTA, and the rate of secretion of cholesterol into plasma were determined. Coconut oil feeding increased plasma cholesterol by 68%, LTA by 42%, and hepatic cholesterol secretion by 69%. Mevinolin (75 mg/day), an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, lowered LTA and plasma cholesterol without affecting the rate of secretion of cholesterol into plasma. These studies provide further evidence that, in the rabbit, plasma cholesterol and LTA are closely related, and the association is not likely to be caused by a concerted hepatic secretion of cholesterol and LTA."
https://openalex.org/W1509918354,"Abstract To examine the degree of clonal heterogeneity in the synthesis of polypeptides in neoplastic cells, single-cell subclones from the rat hepatoma cell line H4-II-E were isolated. Polypeptides from the clones were resolved on high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), and quantitatively analyzed with a computerized two-dimensional PAGE analysis system developed in this laboratory. Only four qualitatively different spots were found which were synthesized in one of the subclones in four out of five experiments. In contrast, 5-20% of the spots showed statistically significant quantitative differences when any one subclone was compared to any other. These differences were generally quite small, averaging about 1.5-fold in intensity, although variations of fourfold or more were observed. Different cultures of the same subclone showed quantitative differences of the same order as seen in different subclones, indicating that this variability was primarily intraclonal in nature, i.e. associated with the cultures rather than the subclones. The distribution of quantitatively variable spots indicates that 50% or more of the polypeptides in these cells may display intraclonal variability. Similar results were obtained with a second set of subclones derived from these primary ones. Time course studies were conducted where cells were maintained continuously for 12 weeks, with samples taken for two-dimensional PAGE analysis once a week. The fraction of polypeptides that vary significantly generally increased with time between sampling points. Experiments with independent cultures grown in parallel indicate that about 4% of this variability can be correlated to the age of the culture media, although the majority appears due to uncontrolled and/or random differences that arise between cultures. These results indicate that independent cultures quickly develop detectable quantitative differences in the expression of a large fraction of their polypeptides. These differences cannot, at present, be associated with the observable biology of the cells and probably reflect time-associated variations in the balance of cellular macromolecular synthesis which arise in tissue culture cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572520754,"Amino acid analogs, which can be incorporated into nascent peptide chains were used in cultures of endocrine cells from canine pancreas to study the effect on processing of the metabolically labeled precursor for pancreatic polypeptide. Analogs for basic amino acids, canavanine, and aminoethylcysteine prevented the di-basic processing of the prohormone. The polar leucine analog, beta-hydroxyleucine, only partially perturbed the function and cleavage of the signal peptide but efficiently and unexpectedly blocked the dibasic cleavage of the prohormone. Other nonbasic amino acid analogs, beta-hydroxynorvaline and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, which only could be incorporated into the prohormone at a distance from the processing site, also prevented dibasic cleavage of the prohormone. Although there are no phenylalanine residues in the prohormone, analogs for this amino acid, fluoro-phenylalanine and particularly phenylserine, could also block the processing of the prohormone at the dibasic site. This effect was prevented by addition of a small quantity of phenylalanine. It is concluded that amino acid analogs can interfere with precursor processing through altering both the primary and the secondary structure of the precursor but also through incorporation into cosynthesized protein(s) which are necessary for the precursor processing."
https://openalex.org/W1557667241,"The relationship between chemical modifications of arginine derivatives and inhibitory activity to horse serum cholinesterase (BuChE) was investigated. It provided a new insight into the topography of the active site of BuChE. 1) BuChE has the hydrophobic binding pocket, the depth of which corresponds to the length of ethylpiperidine. 2) In the opposite side to the hydrophobic binding pocket, BuChE has a certain entity which repulses carboxyl group at the 2-position of piperidine of L-arginine piperidine amide. 3) The P site of BuChE can allow 4-propyl and 4-phenyl group attached to piperidine. Comparison of the results with those of thrombin and trypsin clearly revealed similarities and dissimilarities among BuChE, trypsin, and thrombin in the active site topography, and hence, we introduce a new selective inhibitor for BuChE, N alpha-dansyl-L-arginine 4-phenylpiperidine amide. It inhibits BuChE strongly (Ki = 0.016 microM), whereas it inhibits trypsin, thrombin, plasmin, and glandular kallikrein only weakly and shows actually no inhibition on acetylcholinesterase from the human erythrocyte. In addition, the new inhibitor becomes highly fluorescent when bound with BuChE, indicating that the compound is an ideal probe of the interactions of BuChE as well as a titrant of it."
https://openalex.org/W1573563160,"The uptake of cobalt(II) ions by apoalkaline phosphatase at pH 8 (the pH optimum for activity) has been investigated by the combined use of electronic and 1H NMR spectroscopies. The presence of fast-relaxing high spin cobalt(II) ions in the active site cavity of the protein induces sizable isotropic shifts of the 1H NMR signals of metal-coordinated protein residues, allowing us to propose a metal uptake pattern by the various metal binding sites both in the presence and in the absence of magnesium ions. In the absence of magnesium the active site is not organized in specific metal binding sites. The first equivalent of cobalt(II) ions per dimer binds in an essentially unspecific and possibly fluxional fashion, giving rise to a six-coordinated chromophore. The second and third equivalents induce the formation of increasing amounts of metal ions pairs, cooperatively arranged into the A and B sites of the same subunit with a five- and six-coordinated geometry, respectively. The fourth and fifth equivalents induce the formation of fully blocked A-B pairs in both subunits. Magnesium shows the property of organizing the metal binding sites, probably through coordination to the C sites. Electronic and 1H NMR titration with Co2+ ions show that the initial amount of fluxional cobalt is smaller than in the absence of magnesium and that A-B pairs are more readily formed. Titration of fully metalated Co4Mg2alkaline phosphatase samples with phosphate confirms binding of only one phosphate per dimer."
