https://openalex.org/W3177819637,"Currently approved viral vector-based and mRNA-based vaccine approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consider only homologous prime-boost vaccination. After reports of thromboembolic events, several European governments recommended using AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (ChAd) only in individuals older than 60 years, leaving millions of already ChAd-primed individuals with the decision to receive either a second shot of ChAd or a heterologous boost with mRNA-based vaccines. However, such combinations have not been tested so far. We used Hannover Medical School's COVID-19 Contact Study cohort of healthcare professionals to monitor ChAd-primed immune responses before and 3 weeks after booster with ChAd (n = 32) or BioNTech/Pfizer's BNT162b2 (n = 55). Although both vaccines boosted prime-induced immunity, BNT162b2 induced significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and, in particular, high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2."
https://openalex.org/W3179071715,"An ideal therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody would resist viral escape1–3, have activity against diverse sarbecoviruses4–7, and be highly protective through viral neutralization8–11 and effector functions12,13. Understanding how these properties relate to each other and vary across epitopes would aid the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide vaccine design. Here we comprehensively characterize escape, breadth and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Despite a trade-off between in vitro neutralization potency and breadth of sarbecovirus binding, we identify neutralizing antibodies with exceptional sarbecovirus breadth and a corresponding resistance to SARS-CoV-2 escape. One of these antibodies, S2H97, binds with high affinity across all sarbecovirus clades to a cryptic epitope and prophylactically protects hamsters from viral challenge. Antibodies that target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding motif (RBM) typically have poor breadth and are readily escaped by mutations despite high neutralization potency. Nevertheless, we also characterize a potent RBM antibody (S2E128) with breadth across sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and a high barrier to viral escape. These data highlight principles underlying variation in escape, breadth and potency among antibodies that target the RBD, and identify epitopes and features to prioritize for therapeutic development against the current and potential future pandemics. A survey of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies identifies those with activity against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-related coronaviruses, highlighting epitopes and features to prioritize in antibody and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3177498683,"Amazonia hosts the Earth's largest tropical forests and has been shown to be an important carbon sink over recent decades1-3. This carbon sink seems to be in decline, however, as a result of factors such as deforestation and climate change1-3. Here we investigate Amazonia's carbon budget and the main drivers responsible for its change into a carbon source. We performed 590 aircraft vertical profiling measurements of lower-tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at four sites in Amazonia from 2010 to 20184. We find that total carbon emissions are greater in eastern Amazonia than in the western part, mostly as a result of spatial differences in carbon-monoxide-derived fire emissions. Southeastern Amazonia, in particular, acts as a net carbon source (total carbon flux minus fire emissions) to the atmosphere. Over the past 40 years, eastern Amazonia has been subjected to more deforestation, warming and moisture stress than the western part, especially during the dry season, with the southeast experiencing the strongest trends5-9. We explore the effect of climate change and deforestation trends on carbon emissions at our study sites, and find that the intensification of the dry season and an increase in deforestation seem to promote ecosystem stress, increase in fire occurrence, and higher carbon emissions in the eastern Amazon. This is in line with recent studies that indicate an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in photosynthesis as a result of climatic changes across Amazonia1,10."
https://openalex.org/W3177624067,"The ability to accurately control the dynamics of physical systems by measurement and feedback is a pillar of modern engineering. Today, the increasing demand for applied quantum technologies requires to adapt this level of control to individual quantum systems. Achieving this in an optimal way is a challenging task that relies on both quantum-limited measurements and specifically tailored algorithms for state estimation and feedback. Successful implementations thus far include experiments on the level of optical and atomic systems. Here we demonstrate real-time optimal control of the quantum trajectory of an optically trapped nanoparticle. We combine confocal position sensing close to the Heisenberg limit with optimal state estimation via Kalman filtering to track the particle motion in phase space in real time with a position uncertainty of 1.3 times the zero point fluctuation. Optimal feedback allows us to stabilize the quantum harmonic oscillator to a mean occupation of $n=0.56\pm0.02$ quanta, realizing quantum ground state cooling from room temperature. Our work establishes quantum Kalman filtering as a method to achieve quantum control of mechanical motion, with potential implications for sensing on all scales. In combination with levitation, this paves the way to full-scale control over the wavepacket dynamics of solid-state macroscopic quantum objects in linear and nonlinear systems."
https://openalex.org/W3180679829,"Gut microorganisms modulate host phenotypes and are associated with numerous health effects in humans, ranging from host responses to cancer immunotherapy to metabolic disease and obesity. However, difficulty in accurate and high-throughput functional analysis of human gut microorganisms has hindered efforts to define mechanistic connections between individual microbial strains and host phenotypes. One key way in which the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules1-3, yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect the products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microorganism strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Using this metabolomics resource, we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover a previously undescribed type of metabolism in Bacteroides, and reveal candidate biochemical pathways using comparative genomics. Microbiota-dependent metabolites can be detected in diverse biological fluids from gnotobiotic and conventionally colonized mice and traced back to the corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microorganisms and interactions between microorganisms and their host."
https://openalex.org/W3180919642,"Tests of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale require extreme control over mechanical motion and its decoherence1-3. Quantum control of mechanical motion has been achieved by engineering the radiation-pressure coupling between a micromechanical oscillator and the electromagnetic field in a resonator4-7. Furthermore, measurement-based feedback control relying on cavity-enhanced detection schemes has been used to cool micromechanical oscillators to their quantum ground states8. In contrast to mechanically tethered systems, optically levitated nanoparticles are particularly promising candidates for matter-wave experiments with massive objects9,10, since their trapping potential is fully controllable. Here we optically levitate a femtogram (10-15 grams) dielectric particle in cryogenic free space, which suppresses thermal effects sufficiently to make the measurement backaction the dominant decoherence mechanism. With an efficient quantum measurement, we exert quantum control over the dynamics of the particle. We cool its centre-of-mass motion by measurement-based feedback to an average occupancy of 0.65 motional quanta, corresponding to a state purity of 0.43. The absence of an optical resonator and its bandwidth limitations holds promise to transfer the full quantum control available for electromagnetic fields to a mechanical system. Together with the fact that the optical trapping potential is highly controllable, our experimental platform offers a route to investigating quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales11."
https://openalex.org/W3178633198,"Abstract Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires sufficiently low logical error rates 1 . Many applications call for error rates as low as 10 −15 (refs. 2–9 ), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10 −3 (refs. 10–14 ). Quantum error correction 15–17 promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device 18,19 and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits."
https://openalex.org/W3182356919,"Communication within the glial cell ecosystem is essential for neuronal and brain health1-3. The influence of glial cells on the accumulation and clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tau in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood, despite growing awareness that these are therapeutically important interactions4,5. Here we show, in humans and mice, that astrocyte-sourced interleukin-3 (IL-3) programs microglia to ameliorate the pathology of AD. Upon recognition of Aβ deposits, microglia increase their expression of IL-3Rα-the specific receptor for IL-3 (also known as CD123)-making them responsive to IL-3. Astrocytes constitutively produce IL-3, which elicits transcriptional, morphological, and functional programming of microglia to endow them with an acute immune response program, enhanced motility, and the capacity to cluster and clear aggregates of Aβ and tau. These changes restrict AD pathology and cognitive decline. Our findings identify IL-3 as a key mediator of astrocyte-microglia cross-talk and a node for therapeutic intervention in AD."

https://openalex.org/W3180572190,"Pathogenic fungi reside in the intestinal microbiota but rarely cause disease. Little is known about the interactions between fungi and the immune system that promote commensalism. Here we investigate the role of adaptive immunity in promoting mutual interactions between fungi and host. We find that potentially pathogenic Candida species induce and are targeted by intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Focused studies on Candida albicans reveal that the pathogenic hyphal morphotype, which is specialized for adhesion and invasion, is preferentially targeted and suppressed by intestinal IgA responses. IgA from mice and humans directly targets hyphal-enriched cell-surface adhesins. Although typically required for pathogenesis, C. albicans hyphae are less fit for gut colonization1,2 and we show that immune selection against hyphae improves the competitive fitness of C. albicans. C. albicans exacerbates intestinal colitis3 and we demonstrate that hyphae and an IgA-targeted adhesin exacerbate intestinal damage. Finally, using a clinically relevant vaccine to induce an adhesin-specific immune response protects mice from C. albicans-associated damage during colitis. Together, our findings show that adaptive immunity suppresses harmful fungal effectors, with benefits to both C. albicans and its host. Thus, IgA uniquely uncouples colonization from pathogenesis in commensal fungi to promote homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3182526970,"Abstract Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that produces the second messenger cG[2′–5′]pA[3′–5′]p (2′3′-cGAMP) and controls activation of innate immunity in mammalian cells 1–5 . Animal genomes typically encode multiple proteins with predicted homology to cGAS 6–10 , but the function of these uncharacterized enzymes is unknown. Here we show that cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) are innate immune sensors that are capable of recognizing divergent molecular patterns and catalysing synthesis of distinct nucleotide second messenger signals. Crystal structures of human and insect cGLRs reveal a nucleotidyltransferase signalling core shared with cGAS and a diversified primary ligand-binding surface modified with notable insertions and deletions. We demonstrate that surface remodelling of cGLRs enables altered ligand specificity and used a forward biochemical screen to identify cGLR1 as a double-stranded RNA sensor in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . We show that RNA recognition activates Drosophila cGLR1 to synthesize the novel product cG[3′–5′]pA[2′–5′]p (3′2′-cGAMP). A crystal structure of Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes (dSTING) in complex with 3′2′-cGAMP explains selective isomer recognition, and 3′2′-cGAMP induces an enhanced antiviral state in vivo that protects from viral infection. Similar to radiation of Toll-like receptors in pathogen immunity, our results establish cGLRs as a diverse family of metazoan pattern recognition receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3183113991,"In mammals, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cGAMP in response to cytosolic DNA and this triggers an antiviral immune response. cGAS belongs to a large family of cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases that is present in both prokaryotes1 and eukaryotes2-5. In bacteria, these enzymes synthesize a range of cyclic oligonucleotides and have recently emerged as important regulators of phage infections6-8. Here we identify two cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) in the insect Drosophila melanogaster. We show that cGLR1 and cGLR2 activate Sting- and NF-κB-dependent antiviral immunity in response to infection with RNA or DNA viruses. cGLR1 is activated by double-stranded RNA to produce the cyclic dinucleotide 3'2'-cGAMP, whereas cGLR2 produces a combination of 2'3'-cGAMP and 3'2'-cGAMP in response to an as-yet-unidentified stimulus. Our data establish cGAS as the founding member of a family of receptors that sense different types of nucleic acids and trigger immunity through the production of cyclic dinucleotides beyond 2'3'-cGAMP."

The combination of the pulsar's youth and nearby location makes the nebula the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky. The LHAASO Collaboration report observations of this source at energies of tera– to peta–electron volts, extending the spectrum of this prototypical object. They combine these data with observations at lower energies to model the physics of the emission process. The multiwave-length data can be explained by a combination of synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering. Science , abg5137, this issue p. 425"
https://openalex.org/W3180126409,"Agouti-related peptide (AGRP)-expressing neurons are activated by fasting—this causes hunger1–4, an aversive state that motivates the seeking and consumption of food5,6. Eating returns AGRP neuron activity towards baseline on three distinct timescales: rapidly and transiently following sensory detection of food cues6–8, slowly and longer-lasting in response to nutrients in the gut9,10, and even more slowly and permanently with restoration of energy balance9,11. The rapid regulation by food cues is of particular interest as its neurobiological basis and purpose are unknown. Given that AGRP neuron activity is aversive6, the sensory cue-linked reductions in activity could function to guide behaviour. To evaluate this, we first identified the circuit mediating sensory cue inhibition and then selectively perturbed it to determine function. Here, we show that a lateral hypothalamic glutamatergic → dorsomedial hypothalamic GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing)12 → AGRP neuron circuit mediates this regulation. Interference with this circuit impairs food cue inhibition of AGRP neurons and, notably, greatly impairs learning of a sensory cue-initiated food-acquisition task. This is specific for food, as learning of an identical water-acquisition task is unaffected. We propose that decreases in aversive AGRP neuron activity6 mediated by this food-specific circuit increases the incentive salience13 of food cues, and thus facilitates the learning of food-acquisition tasks. In response to food cues, a hypothalamic circuit in the mouse brain transiently inhibits neurons expressing agouti-related peptide, and this promotes learning of cue-initiated food-seeking tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3180691942,"The evolution of the global carbon and silicon cycles is thought to have contributed to the long-term stability of Earth's climate1-3. Many questions remain, however, regarding the feedback mechanisms at play, and there are limited quantitative constraints on the sources and sinks of these elements in Earth's surface environments4-12. Here we argue that the lithium-isotope record can be used to track the processes controlling the long-term carbon and silicon cycles. By analysing more than 600 shallow-water marine carbonate samples from more than 100 stratigraphic units, we construct a new carbonate-based lithium-isotope record spanning the past 3 billion years. The data suggest an increase in the carbonate lithium-isotope values over time, which we propose was driven by long-term changes in the lithium-isotopic conditions of sea water, rather than by changes in the sedimentary alterations of older samples. Using a mass-balance modelling approach, we propose that the observed trend in lithium-isotope values reflects a transition from Precambrian carbon and silicon cycles to those characteristic of the modern. We speculate that this transition was linked to a gradual shift to a biologically controlled marine silicon cycle and the evolutionary radiation of land plants13,14."
https://openalex.org/W3178265822,"The primary purpose of this study is to eliminate Basic Red 46 dye from aqueous solutions utilizing batch experiments by adsorption on biochars prepared from bamboo and rice straw biomass. Biochars prepared from bamboo (B), and rice straw (R) was pyrolyzed at 500°C (B500 and R500). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and surface area and porosity analyzers were used to characterize the B500 and R500 samples. The characterization results indicated that the biochars possessed an amorphous porous structure with many functional groups consisting primarily of silicates. The adsorption rate of BR46 was evaluated using two kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order), and the results indicated that the pseudo-second-order model fitted to the experimental data well (R2>0.99). Nearly 24 h was sufficient to achieve equilibrium with the dye adsorption for the two biochars. R500 had a greater adsorption efficiency than B500. As pH levels increased, the dye's adsorption capability increased as well. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to investigate the equilibrium behavior of BR46 adsorption, and the equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir model (R2>0.99) compared to the Freundlich model (R2>0.89). The maximum adsorption capacities of BR46 are 9.06 mg/g for B500 and 22.12 mg/g for R500, respectively. Additionally, adsorption capacity increased as temperature increased, indicating that adsorption is favored at higher temperatures. The electrostatic interaction is shown to be the dominant mechanism of BR46 adsorption, and BR46 acts as an electron-acceptor, contributing to n-π EDA (Electron Donor-Acceptor) interaction. Thermodynamic parameters for the dye-adsorbent system revealed that the adsorption process is spontaneous and feasible. The values of the adsorption coefficient (Kd) were on the order of 102-103. Kd of R500 was greater than that of B500, indicating that R500 had a greater adsorption capacity. The results showed that R500 could be used as a low-cost alternative adsorbent for removing BR46 from effluents."
https://openalex.org/W3181918639,"Background COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which is a major public health problem worldwide. Given the serious threats imposed by COVID-19 and the absence of vaccines until August 2020, preventive measures play an essential role in reducing infection rates and controlling its spread. This shows the necessity of public adherence for preventive and control measures, which is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Objective This study aimed to determine knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 and associated factors among outpatient service visitors, Debre Markos compressive specialized hospital, north-west,Ethiopia. Method Institutional-based cross-sectional study design with a systematic random sampling technique was conducted from July to August 2020. Among a total of 404 participants, 398 were recruited. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was edited, coded, and entered into Epi data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS-25 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to identify factors associated with KAP. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result The prevalence of poor knowledge, attitude and practice among the outpatient service visitors were 27.1%, 30.7% and 44%, respectively. The mean age of the participants was 33.4 ±10.9 years. Variables like; educational status, ‘‘can’t read and write” [AOR = 3.76, 95% CI (1.36–10.42), P = 0.01], read and write [AOR = 5.90, 95% CI (2.39–14.98), P = 0.01], rural residence [AOR = 3.04, 95% CI (1.43–6.46), P = 0.01] and having no television [AOR = 0.8, 95% CI (0.79–0.89), P = 0.03] were significantly associated with poor knowledge. While, educational status of “can’t read and write”, [AOR = 6.71, 95% CI (2.78–16.16), P = 0.01] and rural residence [AOR = 2.03, 95% CI (1.14–3.61), P = 0.02] were significantly associated with poor attitude. Additionally, poor knowledge, [AOR = 22.73, 95% CI (10.5–49.21), P = 0.01], rural residence [AOR = 2.08, 95% CI (1.08–4.88), P = 0.04] and having no television [AOR = 2.24, 95% CI (1.05–4.79), P = 0.01] were significantly associated with poor practice. Conclusion In this study, knowledge, attitude, and practice among outpatient service visitors was poor which needs targeted health education and interventions from the health professional to enhance their knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19. In parallel with this, special attention should be given for the rural community and for those with an educational status of can’t read and write."
https://openalex.org/W3182026943,"Genetic recombination generates novel trait combinations, and understanding how recombination is distributed across the genome is key to modern genetics. The PRDM9 protein defines recombination hotspots; however, megabase-scale recombination patterning is independent of PRDM9. The single round of DNA replication, which precedes recombination in meiosis, may establish these patterns; therefore, we devised an approach to study meiotic replication that includes robust and sensitive mapping of replication origins. We find that meiotic DNA replication is distinct; reduced origin firing slows replication in meiosis, and a distinctive replication pattern in human males underlies the subtelomeric increase in recombination. We detected a robust correlation between replication and both contemporary and historical recombination and found that replication origin density coupled with chromosome size determines the recombination potential of individual chromosomes. Our findings and methods have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying DNA replication, genetic recombination, and the landscape of mammalian germline variation."

In contrast to deuterium/hydrogen ratios, carbon isotope ratios are found to be roughly constant (~89) in the Solar System, but do vary on galactic scales with 12C/13C~68 in the current local interstellar medium. In molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, 12CO/13CO isotopologue ratios can be altered by ice and gas partitioning, low-temperature isotopic ion exchange reactions, and isotope-selective photodissociation. Here we report on the detection of 13CO in the atmosphere of the young, accreting giant planet TYC 8998-760-1 b at a statistical significance of >6 sigma. Marginalizing over the planet's atmospheric temperature structure, chemical composition, and spectral calibration uncertainties, suggests a 12CO/13CO ratio of 31 [+17,-10] (90% confidence), a significant enrichment in 13C with respect to the terrestrial standard and the local interstellar value. Since the current location of TYC 8998 b at >160 au is far beyond the CO snowline, we postulate that it accreted a significant fraction of its carbon from ices enriched in 13C through fractionation. Future isotopologue measurements in exoplanet atmospheres can provide unique constraints on where, when and how planets are formed."
https://openalex.org/W3181663596,"This study was the first to compare the neuroprotective activity of Cerebrolysin®, Actovegin® and Cortexin® in rodent models of acute and chronic brain ischemia. The neuroprotective action was evaluated in animals with acute (middle cerebral artery occlusion) or chronic (common carotid artery stenosis) brain ischemia models in male rats. Cortexin® (1 or 3 mg/kg/day), Cerebrolysin® (538 or 1614 mg/kg/day) and Actovegin® (200 mg/kg/day) were administered for 10 days. To assess the neurological and motor impairments, open field test, adhesive removal test, rotarod performance test and Morris water maze test were performed. Brain damage was assessed macro- and microscopically, and antioxidant system activity was measured in brain homogenates. In separate experiments in vitro binding of Cortexin® to a wide panel of receptors was assessed, and blood-brain barrier permeability of Cortexin® was assessed in mice in vivo. Cortexin® or Cerebrolysin® and, to a lesser extent, Actovegin® improved the recovery of neurological functions, reduced the severity of sensorimotor and cognitive impairments in rats. Cortexin® reduced the size of necrosis of brain tissue in acute ischemia, improved functioning of the antioxidant system and prevented the development of severe neurodegenerative changes in chronic ischemia model. Radioactively labeled Cortexin® crossed the blood-brain barrier in mice in vivo with concentrations equal to 6-8% of concentrations found in whole blood. During in vitro binding assay Cortexin® (10 μg/ml) demonstrated high or moderate binding to AMPA-receptors (80.1%), kainate receptors (73.5%), mGluR1 (49.0%), GABAA1 (44.0%) and mGluR5 (39.7%), which means that effects observed in vivo could be related on the glutamatergic and GABAergic actions of Cortexin®. Thus, Cortexin, 1 or 3 mg/kg, or Cerebrolysin®, 538 or 1614 mg/kg, were effective in models acute and chronic brain ischemia in rats. Cortexin® contains compounds acting on AMPA, kainate, mGluR1, GABAA1 and mGluR5 receptors in vitro, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3182847262,"Homologous recombination (HR) repair is an important determinant of chemosensitivity. However, the mechanisms underlying HR regulation remain largely unknown. Cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1) is a member of the LIM/double-zinc finger protein family and is overexpressed and associated with prognosis in several tumor types. However, to date, the functional role of CRIP1 in cancer biology is poorly understood. Here we found that CRIP1 downregulation causes HR repair deficiency with concomitant increase in cell sensitivity to cisplatin, epirubicin, and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, upon DNA damage, CRIP1 is deubiquitinated and upregulated by activated AKT signaling. CRIP1, in turn, promotes nuclear enrichment of RAD51, which is a prerequisite step for HR commencement, by stabilizing BRCA2 to counteract FBXO5-targeted RAD51 degradation and by binding to the core domain of RAD51 (RAD51184-257) in coordination with BRCA2, to facilitate nuclear export signal masking interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. Moreover, through mass spectrometry screening, we found that KPNA4 is at least one of the carriers controlling the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of the CRIP1-BRCA2-RAD51 complex in response to chemotherapy. Consistent with these findings, RAD51 inhibitors block the CRIP1-mediated HR process, thereby restoring chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer cells with high CRIP1 expression. Analysis of patient specimens revealed an abnormally high level of CRIP1 expression in GC tissues compared to that in the adjacent normal mucosa and a significant negative association between CRIP1 expression and survival time in patient cohorts with different types of solid tumors undergoing genotoxic treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests an essential function of CRIP1 in promoting HR repair and facilitating gastric cancer cell adaptation to genotoxic therapy."

There are no FDA approved therapies for these tumors and their relentless progression results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Through a combination of high throughput screens, preclinical in vivo modeling, and evaluation of the kinome en masse , we identified actionable drug targets and efficacious experimental therapeutics for the treatment of NF2 related schwannomas and meningiomas. These efforts identified brigatinib (ALUNBRIG ® ), an FDA-approved inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including ALK, to be a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in established NF2 deficient xenograft meningiomas and a genetically engineered murine model of spontaneous NF2 schwannomas. Surprisingly, neither meningioma nor schwannoma cells express ALK. Instead, we demonstrate that brigatinib inhibited multiple tyrosine kinases, including EphA2, Fer and focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1). These data demonstrate the power of the de novo unbiased approach for drug discovery and represents a major step forward in the advancement of therapeutics for the treatment of NF2 related malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W3181235316,"In Dec 2020 Brazil became one of the worldwide epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 7.2M reported cases. Brazil has a large territory with unequal distribution of healthcare resources including physicians. Resource limitation has been one of the main factors hampering Brazil’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. Telemedicine has been an effective approach for COVID-19 management as it allows to reduce the risk of cross-contamination and provides support to remote rural locations. Here we present the analyses of teleconsultations from a countrywide telemedicine service (TelessáudeRS-UFRGS, TRS), that provides physician-to-physician remote support during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We performed a descriptive analysis of the teleconsultation incoming calls and a text analysis from the call transcripts. Our findings indicate that TRS teleconsultations in Brazil experienced an exponential increment of 802.% during a period of 6 days, after the first death due to COVID-19 was reported. However, the number of teleconsultations cases decreased over time, despite the number of reported COVID-19 cases continuously increasing. The results also showed that physicians in low-income municipalities, based on GDP per capita, are less likely to consult the telemedicine service despite facing higher rates of COVID-19 cases. The text analysis of call transcripts from medical teleconsultations showed that the main concern of physicians were “asymptomatic” patients. We suggest an immediate reinforcement of telehealth services in the regions of lower income as a strategy to support COVID-19 management."
https://openalex.org/W3181790886,"Thionins are antimicrobial peptides found only in plants. They are first produced as preproproteins and then processed to yield the usually 5 kDa, basic thionin peptide with three or four disulfide bridges. So far, thionins had only been found in some plant families of angiosperms. The One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative (1KP project) has sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 1000 plant species. We have used these data to search for new thionin sequences which gave 225 hits. After removing doublets these resulted in 133 new thionins. No sequences were found in algae and mosses. The phylogenetically earliest hits were from Selaginella species and from conifers. Many hits were from angiosperm plant families which were previously not known to contain thionins. A large gene family for thionins was found in Papaver . We isolated a genomic clone from Papaver somniferum which confirmed the general genomic structure with two small introns within the acidic domain. We also expressed the thionin encoded by the genomic clone and found that it had antimicrobial activity in vitro , especially against fungi. Previously, we had grouped thionins into four classes. The new data reported here led us to revise this classification. We now recognize only class 1 thionins with eight cysteine residues and class 2 thionins with six cysteine residues. The different variants that we found (and also previously known variants) can all be traced back to one of these two classes. Some of the variants had an uneven number of cysteine residues and it is not clear at the moment what that means for their threedimensional structure."
https://openalex.org/W3178192931,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of viruses that are best known as the causative agents of human diseases like the common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. CoVs spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. There is, however, concern about potential waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, as it has been found in wastewater facilities and rivers. To date, little is known about the stability of SARS-CoV-2 or any other free coronavirus in aquatic environments. The inactivation of terrestrial CoVs in seawater is rarely studied. Here, we use a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) that is commonly found in animal husbandry as a surrogate to study the stability of CoVs in natural water. A series of experiments were conducted in which PRCV (strain 91V44) was added to filtered and unfiltered fresh- and saltwater taken from the river Scheldt and the North Sea. Virus titres were then measured by TCID 50 -assays using swine testicle cell cultures after various incubation times. The results show that viral inactivation of PRCV in filtered seawater can be rapid, with an observed 99% decline in the viral load after just two days, which may depend on temperature and the total suspended matter concentration. PRCV degraded much slower in filtered water from the river Scheldt, taking over 15 days to decline by 99%, which was somewhat faster than the PBS control treatment (T 99 = 19.2 days). Overall, the results suggest that terrestrial CoVs are not likely to accumulate in marine environments. Studies into potential interactions with exudates (proteases, nucleases) from the microbial food web are, however, recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3182710806,"Light spectra of sunlight transmittance can generate an interactive effect with deposited nitrogen (N) on regenerated plants across varied shading conditions. Total N content in understory plants can be accounted for by both exogeneous and endogenous sources of derived N, but knowledge about the response of inner N cycling to interactive light and N input effects is unclear. We conducted a bioassay on Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis Blume) seedlings subjected to five-month N pulsing with 15NH4Cl (10.39 atom %) at 120 mg 15N plant-1 under the blue (48.5% blue, 33.7% green, and 17.8% red), red (14.6% blue, 71.7% red, 13.7% green), and green (17.4% blue, 26.2% red, 56.4% green) lighting-spectra. Half of the seedlings were fed twice a week using a 250 ppm N solution with micro-nutrients, while the other half just received distilled water. Two factors showed no interaction and neither affected growth and morphology. Compared to the red-light spectrum, that in blue light increased chlorophyll and soluble protein contents and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, root N concentration, and N derived from the pulses. The green-light spectrum induced more biomass allocation to roots and a higher percentage of N derived from internal reserves compared to the red-light spectrum. The 15N pulses reduced the reliance on N remobilization from acorns but strengthened shoot biomass, chlorophyll content, GS activity, and N concentration. In conclusion, light spectrum imposed an independent force from external N pulse to modify the proportion of N derived from internal sources in total N content in juvenile Q. variabilis."
https://openalex.org/W3180265912,"Background Although COVID-19 is an acute disease that usually resolves rapidly in most cases, the disease can be fatal and has a mortality rate of about 1% to 56%. Alveolar injury and respiratory failure are the main causes of death in patients with COVID 19. In addition, the effect of the disease on other organs is not fully understood. Renal system affection has been reported in patients with COVID 19 and is associated with a higher rate of diverse outcomes, including mortality. Therefore, in the present work, we reported the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed the manifestations that indicated renal system involvement and their impact on clinical outcomes. Materials and methods This was an observational retrospective study conducted at King Fahd Specialist Hospital, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. All patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to this Hospital from April to December 2020 were included in the study. The patients’ findings at presentation were recorded. Demographic data and laboratory results (hematuria, proteinuria, urinary sediment cast and pus cell presence, and kidney function tests) were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results One hundred and ninety-three patients with confirmed COVID 19 were included in the study. Dipstick examinations of all urine samples showed proteinuria and hematuria in 53.9% and 22.3% of patients, respectively, whereas microscopic examination revealed the presence of pus and brown muddy granular casts in 33.7% and 12.4% of samples, respectively. Acute kidney injury was reported in 23.3% of patients. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that hematuria was associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.9; P = 0.001), ICU admission (OR, 3.789; 95% CI, 1.913–7.505; P = 0.003), and mortality (OR, 8.084; 95% CI, 3.756–17.397; P = 0.002). Conversely, proteinuria was less significantly associated with the risk of AKI (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.91–7.50; P = 0.003), ICU admission (OR, 2.493; 95% CI, 1.25–4.72; P = 0.001), and mortality (OR, 2.764; 95% CI, 1.368–5.121; P = 0.003). Patients with AKI had a higher probability for mortality than did those without AKI (OR, 14.208; 95% CI, 6.434–31.375; P = 0.003). Conclusion The manifestations of the involvement of the renal system are not uncommon in COVID-19. These manifestations included proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI and were usually associated with a poor prognosis, including high incidences of both ICU admission and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3180809389,"Myocardial slow conduction is a cornerstone of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Prolonged electrogram (EGM) duration is a useful surrogate parameter and manual annotation of EGM characteristics are widely used during catheter-based ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate. However, this remains time-consuming and prone to inter-operator variability. We aimed to develop an algorithm for 3-D visualization of EGM duration relative to the 17-segment American Heart Association model.To calculate and visualize EGM duration, in sinus rhythm acquired high-density maps of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing substrate-based VT ablation using a 64-mini polar basket-catheter with low noise of 0.01 mV were analyzed. Using a custom developed algorithm based on standard deviation and threshold, the relationship between EGM duration, endocardial voltage and ablation areas was studied by creating 17-segment 3-D models and 2-D polar plots.140,508 EGMs from 272 segments (n = 16 patients, 94% male, age: 66±2.4, ejection fraction: 31±2%) were studied and 3-D visualization of EGM duration was performed. Analysis of signal processing parameters revealed that a 40 ms sliding SD-window, 15% SD-threshold and >70 ms EGM duration cutoff was chosen based on diagnostic odds ratio of 12.77 to visualize rapidly prolonged EGM durations. EGMs > 70 ms matched to 99% of areas within dense scar (<0.2 mV), in 95% of zones within scar border zone (0.2-1.0 mV) and detected ablated areas having resulted in non-inducibility at the end of the procedure. Ablation targets were identified with a sensitivity of 65.6% and a specificity of 94.6% avoiding false positive labeling of prolonged EGMs in segments with healthy myocardium.The novel algorithm allows rapid visualization of prolonged EGM durations. This may facilitate more objective characterization of arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3177830211,"Current approaches to understanding medication ordering errors rely on relatively small manually captured error samples. These approaches are resource-intensive, do not scale for computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, and are likely to miss important risk factors associated with medication ordering errors. Previously, we described a dataset of CPOE-based medication voiding accompanied by univariable and multivariable regression analyses. However, these traditional techniques require expert guidance and may perform poorly compared to newer approaches. In this paper, we update that analysis using machine learning (ML) models to predict erroneous medication orders and identify its contributing factors. We retrieved patient demographics (race/ethnicity, sex, age), clinician characteristics, type of medication order (inpatient, prescription, home medication by history), and order content. We compared logistic regression, random forest, boosted decision trees, and artificial neural network models. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The dataset included 5,804,192 medication orders, of which 28,695 (0.5%) were voided. ML correctly classified voids at reasonable accuracy; with a positive predictive value of 10%, ~20% of errors were included. Gradient boosted decision trees achieved the highest AUROC (0.7968) and AUPRC (0.0647) among all models. Logistic regression had the poorest performance. Models identified predictive factors with high face validity (e.g., student orders), and a decision tree revealed interacting contexts with high rates of errors not identified by previous regression models. Prediction models using order-entry information offers promise for error surveillance, patient safety improvements, and targeted clinical review. The improved performance of models with complex interactions points to the importance of contextual medication ordering information for understanding contributors to medication errors."
https://openalex.org/W3178552430,"This study aimed to describe professional soccer players' training responses during a competitive season and to investigate the relationship between these responses with wellbeing and recovery indices. Thirteen professional soccer players from the same Spanish Second Division team were monitored during a sixteen-week in-season period. Players' external loads were analyzed using global positioning measurement units (GPS). Additionally, subjective reporting of sleep quality, sleep duration, fatigue, muscle soreness, and stress were assessed with a customized wellness questionnaire at the beginning of each training session. A two-step cluster analysis identified profiles of different training responses generally described as lower-demand sessions, intermediate-demand sessions, running-based sessions, and sprint-based sessions; which were discriminated by different total distance covered and high-intensity actions. Interestingly, no probabilistic interactions were found between these training responses with wellbeing and recovery markers (i.e., Bayes factor < 1 suggesting no evidence, for all the variables). These findings may raise concerns about using self-reporting tools, as they show that players' wellness data is probably not accounted for when coaching staff plan and optimize the training process. However, results should be interpreted with caution, due to representing a single team and coaching staff."

Here we investigated rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, USA metropolitan area from August 13 to December 8, 2020, just prior to initiation of the national vaccination program. Examination of 9,550 adult blood donor volunteers for serum IgG antibody positivity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein showed an overall prevalence of 8.40%, measured as 7.56% in the first 58 days and 9.24% in the last 58 days, and 12.86% in December 2020, which we extrapolated to ~20% as of March, 2021. Males and females showed similar rates of past infection, and rates among Hispanic or Latinos, African Americans and Whites were also investigated. Donors under 30 years of age had the highest rates of past infection, while those over 60 had the lowest. Geographic analysis showed higher rates of infectivity on the West side of Cincinnati compared with the East side (split by I-75) and the lowest rates in the adjoining region of Kentucky (across the Ohio river). These results in regional seroprevalence will help inform efforts to best achieve herd immunity in conjunction with the national vaccination campaign."
https://openalex.org/W3182230448,"In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, personal hygiene behaviours such as proper handwashing have gained significantly more attention and interpersonal contact is performed with great care. Disgust, as a disease-avoidance mechanism, can play an important role in the promotion of hygiene behaviour. We know from previous research that pathogen disgust can be a predictor of an individual's behaviour in the pandemic. Given that the pandemic greatly affects our food and eating behaviour, the current study aims to add to the existing evidence and to complement it by investigating the role of food-specific disgust in the pandemic. For that, we conducted an online survey in Germany in April 2020, while the pandemic was spreading in Europe. A total of 519 participants completed the survey and provided information about their COVID-19-related attitudes and behaviours and about their food disgust sensitivity. The results show that food disgust sensitivity is an important predictor for an individual's feelings, shopping behaviour, and disease-preventive behaviour related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the success of political measures to fight the pandemic critically depends on the population to support and follow the proposed measures, a better understanding of the factors driving individual behaviour is key. Implications for pandemic management are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3178065736,"Previous research has identified a predictive model of how a nation's distribution of gross domestic product (GDP) among agriculture (a), industry (i), and services (s) changes as a country develops. Here we use this national model to analyze the composition of GDP for US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) over time. To characterize the transfer of GDP shares between the sectors in the course of economic development we explore a simple system of differential equations proposed in the country-level model. Fitting the model to more than 120 MSAs we find that according to the obtained parameters MSAs can be classified into 6 groups (consecutive, high industry, re-industrializing; each of them also with reversed development direction). The consecutive transfer (a → i → s) is common but does not represent all MSAs examined. At the 95% confidence level, 40% of MSAs belong to types exhibiting an increasing share of GDP from agriculture. In California, such MSAs, which we classify as part of an agriculture renaissance, are found in the Central Valley."
https://openalex.org/W3179308664,"Empirical research on human mortality and extreme longevity suggests that the risk of death among the oldest-old ceases to increase and levels off at age 110. The universality of this finding remains in dispute because of two main reasons: i) high uncertainty around statistical estimates generated from scarce data, and ii) the lack of country-specific comparisons. In this article, we estimate age patterns of mortality above age 105 using data from the International Database on Longevity, an exceptionally large and recently updated database comprising more than 13,000 validated records of long-lived individuals from eight populations. We show that, in all of them, similar mortality trajectories arise, suggesting that the risk of dying levels off after age 105. As more high-quality data become available, there is more evidence in support of a levelling-off of the risk of dying as a regularity of longevous populations."
https://openalex.org/W3180529492,"The issues of personality and its relations with the level of empathetic sensibility of medical doctors are broadly discussed in the literature. The aim of this study was an assessment of personality related predictors of empathy indicators in female and male students of medicine with consideration of gender differences. Methods applied were Empathic Sensitiveness Scale (ESS) and Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). The study included 153 participants, who were students of the fifth year of medical studies. Students filled in questionnaires during workshops in clinical psychological skills. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. The statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 13 PL and PS IMAGO PRO (SPSS). Linear regression analysis with the interaction component was performed to explore the relationship between personality factors and gender and their interaction with the variable dependent level of empathy. The analysis showed that Extraversion, Openness and Agreeableness are associated with the level of Empathic Concern. Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are associated with the level of Personal Distress. Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are associated with the level of Perspective-taking. The regression analysis with the interactive component showed that there is no relationship between gender and the level of empathy, therefore the interactions were insignificant. Empathetic sensibility is related to personality dimensions of the students of medicine. Although there has been no interaction among chief personality dimensions, empathy indicators and gender, detailed analysis of personality dimensions' components has shown differences between men and women."
https://openalex.org/W3181733952,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues. Cellular hypoxia is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction which increases oxidative stress and hyperglycaemia. Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy, which was shown to improve insulin sensitivity, is impractical for regular use. We evaluated the effects of water which is stably-enriched with oxygen (ELO water) to increase arterial blood oxygen levels, on mitochondrial function in the presence of normal- or high-glucose environments, and as glucose-lowering therapy in humans.We compared arterial blood oxygen levels in Sprague-Dawley rats after 7 days of ad libitum ELO or tap water consumption. Mitochondrial stress testing, and flow cytometry analysis of mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, were performed on human HepG2 cells cultured in four Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium media, made with ELO water or regular (control) water, at normal (5.5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose concentrations. We also randomized 150 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 53 years, glycated haemoglobin HbA1c 8.9% [74 mmol/mol], average duration of diabetes 12 years) to drink 1.5 litres daily of bottled ELO water or drinking water.ELO water raised arterial oxygen tension pO2 significantly (335 ± 26 vs. 188 ± 18 mmHg, p = 0.006) compared with tap water. In cells cultured in control water, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential were both significantly lower at 25 mM glucose compared with 5.5 mM glucose; in contrast, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential did not differ significantly at normal or high glucose concentrations in cells cultured in ELO water. The high-glucose environment induced a greater mitochondrial proton leak in cells cultured in ELO water compared to cells cultured in control medium at similar glucose concentration. In type 2 diabetic adults, HbA1c decreased significantly (p = 0.002) by 0.3 ± 0.7% (4 ± 8 mmol/mol), with ELO water after 12 weeks of treatment but was unchanged with placebo.ELO water raises arterial blood oxygen levels, appears to have a protective effect on hyperglycaemia-induced reduction in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial dysfunction, and may be effective adjuvant therapy for type 2 diabetes."

However, the associations between epicardial adipose tissue and hemodynamics and cardiorespiratory fitness remain unclear. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association between epicardial adipose tissue volume and hemodynamics, and cardiorespiratory fitness among Japanese individuals of various ages and of both sexes. Epicardial adipose tissue volume was measured in 120 participants (age, 21–85 years) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. To evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness, peak oxygen uptake was measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Peak cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference were calculated by impedance cardiography. The epicardial adipose tissue volume was significantly increased in middle-aged and older women. The epicardial adipose tissue volume was significantly and negatively correlated to peak cardiac output and peak oxygen uptake, regardless of age and sex; furthermore, epicardial adipose tissue showed a strong negative correlation with peak heart rate. Epicardial adipose tissue and peak cardiac output were significantly associated (β = -0.359, 95% confidence interval, -0.119 to -0.049, p &lt; 0.001), even after multivariate adjustment ( R 2 = 0.778). However, in the multiple regression analysis with peak oxygen uptake as a dependent variable, the epicardial adipose tissue volume was not an independent predictor. These data suggest that increased epicardial adipose tissue volume may be correlated with decreased peak oxygen uptake, which might have mediated the abnormal hemodynamics among Japanese people of various ages and of both sexes. Interventions targeting epicardial adipose tissue could potentially improve hemodynamics and cardiorespiratory fitness."

We investigated the determinants of spending time at home within the six months preceding death.Population-based, retrospective analysis of administrative databases of the Catalan government. The analysis included adult (≥18 years) individuals who died in Catalonia (North-east Spain) in 2017 and met the McNamara criteria for palliative care. The primary outcome was the number of days spent at home within the last 180 days of life. Other variables included the cause of death, demographic characteristics, and socioeconomic status, stratified as very low, low, mid, and high level.The analysis included 40,137 individuals (19,510 women; 20,627 men), who spent a median of 140 days (IQR 16-171) at home within the six months preceding death (women 140 [16-171]; men 150 [100-171]). Female gender was an independent factor of staying fewer days at home (OR 0.80 [95% CI 0.77-0.82]; p<0.001). Higher socioeconomic levels were significantly associated with an increasing number of days at home in both genders: among women, ORs of the low, middle, and high levels were 1.09 (0.97-1.22), 1.54 (1.36-1.75), and 2.52 (1.69-3.75) (p<0.001), respectively; the corresponding ORs among men were 1.27 (1.12-1.43), 1.56 (1.38-1.77), 2.82 (2.04-3.88) (p<0.001). The presence of dementia was a strong predictor of spending less time at home in women (0.41 (0.38-0.43); p<0.001) and men (0.45 (0.41-0.48); p<0.001).Our results suggest that end-of-life care is associated with gender and socioeconomic inequalities; women and individuals with lower socioeconomic status spend less time at home within the last 180 days of life."

The diverse functions and gene expression profiles of TGCs have been studied well, but their nuclear structures remain unknown. In this study, we focus on Lamin B1, a nuclear lamina, and clarify its expression dynamics, regulation and roles in TGC functions. TGCs that differentiated from trophoblast stem cells were used. From days 0 to 9 after differentiation, the number of TGCs gradually increased, but the amount of LMNB1 peaked at day 3 and then slightly decreased. An immunostaining experiment showed that LMNB1-depleted TGCs increased after day 6 of differentiation. These LMNB1-depleted TGCs diffused peripheral localization of the heterochromatin marker H3K9me2 in the nuclei. However, LMINB1-knock down was not affected TGCs specific gene expression. We found that the death of TGCs also increased after day 6 of differentiation. Moreover, Lamin B1 loss and the cell death in TGCs were protected by 10-6 M progesterone. Our results conclude that progesterone protects against Lamin B1 loss and prolongs the life and function of TGCs."

This study aimed to clarify the risk factors for Grade 3/4 neutropenia during GnP therapy.Clinical data of pancreatic cancer patients who underwent GnP therapy at the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research from December 2014 to December 2016 were retrospectively collected. The relationship of Grade 3/4 neutropenia onset to laboratory values and patient background factors was investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Clinical data of 222 patients were analyzed. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 118 patients (53.2%) in the first cycle of GnP therapy. Multivariate analysis identified low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), high total bilirubin (T-Bil), and low C-reactive protein (CRP) as risk factors for Grade 3/4 neutropenia. Age was not a risk factor. The incidence of neutropenia was 85.7% in patients with all three risk factors, but only 27.7% in patients with none of them.Low ANC, high T-Bil, and low CRP may be risk factors for Grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients receiving GnP therapy, even if these laboratory values are within normal reference ranges. Patients with these risk factors should be carefully monitored for adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W3181215285,"Root lifespan, often is estimated in landscape- and ecosystem-level carbon models using linear approximations. In water manipulation experiments, fine root lifespan can vary with soil water content. Soil water content is generally structured by complex topography, which is largely unaccounted for in landscape- and ecosystem-scale carbon models. Topography governs the range of soil water content experienced by roots which may impact their lifespan. We hypothesized that root lifespan varied nonlinearly across a temperate, mesic, forested catchment due to differences in soil water content associated with topographic position. We expected regions of the landscape that were too wet or too dry would have soils that were not optimal for roots and thus result in shorter root lifespans. Specifically, we hypothesized that root lifespan would be longest in areas that consistently had soil water content in the middle of the soil water content spectrum, while in soils at either very low or very high soil water content, root lifespan would be relatively short. We tested this hypothesis by collecting and analyzing two years of minirhizotron and soil moisture data in plots widely distributed in the Shale Hills catchment of the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in Pennsylvania. We found that fine root lifespans were longer in traditionally wetter topographic regions, but detected no short term (biweekly) effect of soil moisture on root lifespan. Additionally, depth in soil, soil series, slope face orientation, and season of birth strongly affected root lifespans across the catchment. In contrast, lifespan was unaffected by root diameter or mycorrhizal association. Failure to account for these variables could result in erroneous estimates of fine root lifespan and, consequentially, carbon flux in temperate forested regions."
https://openalex.org/W3182058508,"One of the central goals of ecology is to determine the mechanisms that enable coexistence among species. Evidence is accruing that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), the process by which plant seedlings are unable to survive in the area surrounding adults of their same species, is a major contributor to tree species coexistence. However, for CNDD to maintain community-level diversity, three conditions must be met. First, CNDD must maintain diversity for the majority of the woody plant community (rather than merely specific groups). Second, the pattern of repelled recruitment must increase in with plant size. Third, CNDD should extend to the majority of plant life history strategies. These three conditions are rarely tested simultaneously. In this study, we simultaneously test all three conditions in a woody plant community in a North American temperate forest. We examined whether understory and canopy woody species across height categories and dispersal syndromes were overdispersed–a spatial pattern indicative of CNDD–using spatial point pattern analysis across life history stages and strategies. We found that there was a strong signal of overdispersal at the community level. Across the whole community, larger individuals were more overdispersed than smaller individuals. The overdispersion of large individuals, however, was driven by canopy trees. By contrast, understory woody species were not overdispersed as adults. This finding indicates that the focus on trees for the vast majority of CNDD studies may have biased the perception of the prevalence of CNDD as a dominant mechanism that maintains community-level diversity when, according to our data, CNDD may be restricted largely to trees."

PEP procedures are expounded in the Uganda Clinical Guidelines (UCG) of 2016. We assessed adherence by health workers to UCG while managing dog bites in two PEP centers and obtained insights into motivations of their practices. Using qualitative methods, we observed the health worker-patient encounters, reviewed medical records, and interviewed 14 health workers that were involved in managing dog bite injuries. We used deductive thematic analysis to identify codes in themes developed from UCG. We found that much of the history of the bites was taken, but it was neither verified nor written down on the patient’s file. Classification of wounds was inaccurate and ancillary laboratory assessments like culture and sensitivity tests were not conducted in all cases. Although antibiotics were given for both treatment and prophylactic purposes, the prescription was based on availability and affordability, not UCG recommendations. Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) was not administered to deserving patients due to unavailability and high costs to the patient. Anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) was prescribed indiscriminately and some health workers attributed this to pressure from patients. Health education regarding prevention of dog bites was not given to patients due to time constraints on the side of the providers as a result of high caseloads at the emergency departments. Challenges to adherence to guidelines were identified as frequent ARV stock outs; inadequate cooperation among health facilities; and insufficient knowledge and skills on how injuries and rabies should be managed. We conclude that clinical management of dog bites is not fully in line with UCG. We argue that adoption of an integrated bite case management and cost-saving strategies as well as continuing medical education programs on rabies control and management could improve the clinical management of dog bites."

However, disgust seems resistant to exposure with response prevention partly due to the fact that disgust is acquired through evaluative conditioning.The present research investigates a counter-conditioning intervention in treating disgust-related emotional responses in two groups of individuals with high (High contamination concerns, HCC, n = 24) and low (Low contamination concerns LCC, n = 23) contamination concerns.The two groups completed a differential associative learning task in which neutral images were followed by disgusting images (conditioned stimulus; CS+), or not (CS-). Following this acquisition phase, there was a counter-conditioning procedure in which CS+ was followed by a very pleasant unconditional stimulus while CS- remained unreinforced.Following counter-conditioning, both groups reported significant reduction in their expectancy of US occurrence and reported less disgust with CS+. For both expectancy and disgust, reduction was lower in the HCC group than in the LCC group. Disgust sensitivity was highly correlated with both acquisition and maintenance of the response acquired, while US expectation was predicted by anxiety.Counter-conditioning procedure reduces both expectations and conditioned disgust."

Given the lack of information on anemia design effects (DEFF) observed in surveys in these settings, the goal of this paper is to better understand the magnitude and distribution of DEFFs and intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) in order to inform future survey design.Two-stage cluster surveys conducted during 2013-2016 were included if they measured hemoglobin in refugee children aged 6-59 months and/or non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years. Prevalence of anemia, anemia DEFFs and ICCs, mean cluster size, number of clusters, and total sample size were calculated per-survey for non-pregnant women and children. Non-parametric tests were used to assess differences and correlations of ICC and DEFF between women and children and inter-regional differences.Eighty-seven unique cluster surveys from nine countries were included in this analysis. More than 90% of all surveys had ICC values for anemia below 0.10. Median ICC for children was 0.032 (IQR: 0.015-0.048), not significantly different from that observed for non-pregnant women for whom the median was 0.024 (IQR: -0.002-0.055). DEFFs were significantly higher for children [1.54 (IQR: 1.21-1.82)] versus women [1.20 (IQR: 0.99-1.46)]. Regional differences in DEFFs and ICCs were observed.Both ICCs and DEFF were relatively small for both non-pregnant women and preschool children and fall in a narrow range. Differences in ICCs between women and children were non-significant, suggesting similar inter-cluster distributions of anemia; significant differences in DEFF were likely attributable to differing cluster sizes. Given regional differences in both ICCs and DEFFs, location-specific values are preferred. However, in the absence of other context-specific information, we suggest using DEFFs of 1.4-1.8 if mean cluster size is around 20, and DEFFs of 1.2-1.4 if mean cluster size is around 10."
