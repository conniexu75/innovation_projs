https://openalex.org/W2012960603,"Streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling, filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. Here we report the 8,667,507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism, containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium. The 7,825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites. The genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes, predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses, and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development, a unique situation for a bacterium. An ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2056228772,"Postabsorptive elimination of the various forms of vitamin E appears to play a key role in regulation of tissue tocopherol concentrations, but mechanisms of tocopherol metabolism have not been elucidated. Here we describe a pathway involving cytochrome P450-mediated ω-hydroxylation of the tocopherol phytyl side chain followed by stepwise removal of two- or three-carbon moieties, ultimately yielding the 3′-carboxychromanol metabolite that is excreted in urine. All key intermediates of γ-tocopherol metabolism via this pathway were identified in hepatocyte cultures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. NADPH-dependent synthesis of the initial γ- and α-tocopherol 13′-hydroxy and -carboxy metabolites was demonstrated in rat and human liver microsomes. Functional analysis of several recombinant human liver P450 enzymes revealed that tocopherol-ω-hydroxylase activity was associated only with CYP4F2, which also catalyzes ω-hydroxylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> and arachidonic acid. Tocopherol-ω-hydroxylase exhibited similar binding affinities but markedly higher catalytic activities for γ-tocopherol than α-tocopherol, suggesting a role for this pathway in the preferential physiological retention of α-tocopherol and elimination of γ-tocopherol. Sesamin potently inhibited tocopherol-ω-hydroxylase activity exhibited by CYP4F2 and rat or human liver microsomes. Since dietary sesamin also results in elevated tocopherol levels <i>in vivo</i>, this pathway appears to represent a functionally significant means of regulating vitamin E status."
https://openalex.org/W2050606241,"This ancient and hostile ecosystem hosts a surprising variety of microbial organisms. The Rio Tinto, known by the Phoenicians as 'Ur-yero', or 'River of Fire', because of its deep red colour and high acidity, flows through the world's largest pyritic belt in southwestern Spain. Surprisingly, eukaryotic microbes are the principal contributors of biomass in this hostile river, which has a pH of 2 and contains much higher concentrations of heavy metals than are typically found in fresh waters. Here we show that the Rio Tinto shows an unexpected degree of eukaryotic diversity and includes new lineages that we have identified by sequence analysis of genes encoding small-subunit ribosomal RNAs. The diversity of these eukaryotes is much greater than that of prokaryotes, whose metabolism is responsible for the extreme environment."

https://openalex.org/W2000736584,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues in a hormone-dependent manner, yet progress on elucidating the function of GR phosphorylation has been hindered by the lack of a simple assay to detect receptor phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i>. We have produced antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylation sites within human GR at Ser<sup>203</sup> and Ser<sup>211</sup>. In the absence of hormone, the level of GR phosphorylation at Ser<sup>211</sup> was low compared with phosphorylation at Ser<sup>203</sup>. Phosphorylation of both residues increased upon treatment with the GR agonist dexamethasone. Using a battery of agonists and antagonists, we found that the transcriptional activity of GR correlated with the amount of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>211</sup>, suggesting that Ser<sup>211</sup> phosphorylation is a biomarker for activated GR <i>in vivo</i>. Mechanistically, the kinetics of Ser<sup>203</sup> and Ser<sup>211</sup> phosphorylation in response to hormone differed, with Ser<sup>211</sup> displaying a more robust and sustained phosphorylation relative to Ser<sup>203</sup>. Analysis of GR immunoprecipitates with phospho-GR-specific antibodies indicated that the receptor was phosphorylated heterogeneously at Ser<sup>203</sup> in the absence of hormone, whereas in the presence of hormone, a subpopulation of receptors was phosphorylated at both Ser<sup>203</sup> and Ser<sup>211</sup>. Interestingly, biochemical fractionation studies following hormone treatment indicated that the Ser<sup>203</sup>-phosphorylated form of the receptor was predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas Ser<sup>211</sup>-phosphorylated GR was found in the nucleus. Likewise, by immunofluorescence, Ser<sup>203</sup>-phosphorylated GR was located in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions of the cell, but not in the nucleoplasm, whereas strong phospho-Ser<sup>211</sup> staining was evident in the nucleoplasm of hormone-treated cells. Our results suggest that differentially phosphorylated receptor species are located in unique subcellular compartments, likely modulating distinct aspects of receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2082812256,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, are powerful antineoplastic agents that exert their antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on cancer cells by COX-dependent and/or COX-independent pathways. Celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the number of adenomatous colorectal polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Here, we show that celecoxib induces apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HT-29 by inhibiting the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) activity. This effect was correlated with inhibition of the phosphorylation of the PDK1 downstream substrate Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) on two regulatory sites, Thr308 and Ser473. However, expression of a constitutive active form of Akt/PKB (myristoylated PKB) has a low protective effect toward celecoxib-induced cell death. In contrast, overexpression of constitutive active mutant of PDK1 (PDK1A280V) was as potent as the pancaspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, to impair celecoxib-induced apoptosis. By contrast, cells expressing a kinase-defective mutant of PDK1 (PDK1K114G) remained sensitive to celecoxib. Furthermore, in vitro measurement reveals that celecoxib was a potential inhibitor of PDK1 activity with an IC50 = 3.5 μm. These data indicate that inhibition of PDK1 signaling is involved in the proapoptotic effect of celecoxib in HT-29 cells.

Heath C.W., Jr. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1322-1327PubMed Google Scholar) cancers. Although the precise mechanisms for the chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs are not yet known, the ability of these drugs to induce inhibition of cell proliferation, potentiation of immune response, inhibition of angiogenesis, and induction of apoptosis has been reported in recent years (7Shiff S.J. Rigas B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Elder D.J.E. Paraskeva C. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The most characterized target for NSAIDs is cyclooxygenase (COX), which catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid (9Williams C.S. Smalley W. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). There are two known COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, with distinct expression patterns and biological activities (1Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar, 7Shiff S.J. Rigas B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). COX-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme found in most tissues and remains unaltered in colorectal cancer, while COX-2 expression can be up-regulated by a variety of cytokines, hormones, phorbol esters, and oncogenes in colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas (10Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs for colon cancer has been attributed mainly to inhibition of COX-2 by induction of the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptosis (11Rigas B. Shiff S.J. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, null mutation of COX-2 in APCΔ716 knockout mice, a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis, restored apoptosis and reduced the size and the number of colorectal adenomas (12Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Similar regression of adenomas has been observed by treatment of Min mouse with the NSAID sulindac (13Labayle D. Fischer D. Vielh P. Drouhin F. Pariente A. Bories C. Duhamel O. Trousset M. Attali P. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 635-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, observations relating to the proapoptotic effect of NSAIDs lead to contradictory conclusions and demonstrate that they act via COX-dependent and COX-independent mechanisms (for a review, see Ref. 11Rigas B. Shiff S.J. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, the addition of exogenous prostaglandins to a colon cancer cell line that lacks COX activity cannot reverse the proapoptotic effect of sulindac sulfide, a metabolite derived from sulindac (14Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. Staiano-Coico L. Shiff S.I. Rigas B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In the same way, sulindac sulfone, another sulindac metabolite that does not inhibit COXs, affects tumor growth in animal models (15Piazza G.A. Alberts D.S. Hixson L.J. Paranka N.S., Li, H. Finn T. Bogert C. Guillen J.M. Brendel K. Gross P.H. Sperl G. Ritchie J. Burt R.W. Ellsworth L. Ahnen D.J. Pamukcu R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2909-2915PubMed Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in cultured cancer cells expressing or not expressing COXs (16Piazza G.A. Rahm A.L. Krutzsch M. Sperl G. Paranka N.S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). These results suggest that molecular targets of NSAIDs other than COXs might exist and thereby would provide a link between the chemoprotective effect of NSAIDs on cancer cells and their level of COX expression. Recent studies have identified a series of new molecular targets for NSAIDs mainly involved in signaling pathways including 15-lipoxygenase-1 (18Shureiqi I. Chen D. Lotan R. Yang P. Newman R.A.

Recently, specific COX-2 inhibitors (coxib) have been generated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (reviewed in Ref.24Everts B. Währborg P. Hedner T. Clin.

However, the proapoptotic effect of celecoxib was independent of inhibition of COX-2 in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from COX-2 (+/−) and COX-2 (−/−) mice (26Williams C.S. Watson A.J. Sheng H. Helou R. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsu et al. (5Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Wang D.S. Song X. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11397-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that celecoxib induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by reducing phosphorylation of Akt/PKB kinase. Here, we report the first evidence that celecoxib potently induces apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HT-29, which lacks COX-2 catalytic activity (29Hsi L.C. Baek S.J. Eling T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and specifically inhibits the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 activity, the Akt/PKB upstream kinase. These data suggest that celecoxib induces apoptosis through a target other than COX-2 by controlling the major antiapoptotic PDK1/Akt/PKB pathway. Celecoxib was kindly provided by Pharmacia. Nitrocellulose membranes and BCA kit were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell and Pierce, respectively. Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Invitrogen. The SuperfectTMtransfection kit was from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). Monoclonal antibody directed against polyhistidine tag (C terminus), ampicillin, and pcDNA3.0/myc-His A, B, C vectors were from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody against HA epitope was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit anti-COX-2 (PG27) was from Oxford Biochemical Research, and rabbit anti-Bcl-2 was from Calbiochem. PDK1 and Akt/PKB immunoprecipitation kinase assay® kits, rabbit anti-actin, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt/PKB (Thr308 and Ser473), sheep anti-Akt/PKB, sheep anti-phospho-GSK-3β, and sheep anti-GSK-3β were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. IL-13 and cDNA encoding for the myristoylated and dead forms of HA-tagged Akt/PKB were kindly provided by Dr. A. Minty (Sanofi Elf Biorecherche), Dr. T. F. Franke (Columbia University, New York), and Dr. P. N. Tsichlis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA), respectively. cDNA encoding for wild-type PDK1, constitutively active form PDK1A280V, and kinase-defective PDK1K114G were a generous gift from Dr. F. Liu (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). The enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was from Amersham Biosciences. HT-29 cells were cultured as previously described (30Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C., De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 1 day after seeding, media were changed, and cells were treated with different concentrations of celecoxib (50–100 μm). An equivalent amount of the carrier (Me2SO) was added to untreated cells. In order to eliminate a putative interaction between G418 antibiotic and celecoxib, stable transfected cells were cultured in the absence of G418 during the drug treatment. When required, celecoxib at 50–100 μm and IL-13 (30 ng/ml) were added from 4 to 24 h. The expression constructs (pCMV6/HA-tagged MyrPKB, pcDNA3.0/His-tagged WT PDK1, pcDNA3.0/His-tagged PDK1A280V, and pcDNA3.0/His-tagged PDK1K114G) and control pCMV6 and pcDNA3.0 vectors were introduced into exponential growing HT-29 cells using the SuperfectTM transfection kit. Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 48 h and then selected for 3 weeks in a medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Finally, G418-resistant cells were routinely maintained in a medium containing 250 μg of G418. Expression levels of each constructs were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-HA and anti-His antibodies. Parental and transfected HT-29 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered NaCl solution and lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); 150 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 5 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin; 1 mm Na3VO4; 2 mm NaF; and 2 mmNa4PO7) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by BCA reagent. 100 μg of proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The polyclonal anti-COX-2, anti-actin, anti-phospho-Akt/PKB (Thr308 and Ser473), anti-Akt/PKB, anti-phospho-GSK-3β, and anti-GSK-3β were used at 1:1000 dilution. The polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 was used at 1:100 dilution. The monoclonal anti-His and anti-HA were used at 1:2500 and 1:3000 dilution, respectively. Cells were seeded for 24 h onto 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/plate and then were exposed to various concentrations of celecoxib for different times. When used, 100 μm caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Cliniscience S.A.) was added 1 h before celecoxib. During the treatment, the percentage of cells floating in the medium increased over time. Adherent cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and were harvested by trypsinization. At each time of celecoxib treatment, floating cells were recovered by centrifugation of medium at 3200 × g for 5 min. Both adherent and floating cells were combined for the assessment of cell viability, which was determined by trypan blue exclusion. All data points shown are mean values ± S.E. of four independent experiments. The data points from triplicates of an individual experiment were averaged, and the data points shown are the mean of these averages from four experiments. Statistical calculation was done using Student's t test. HT-29 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 μm celecoxib for various times. Floating and adherent cells were collected, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were treated with 5 μg/ml of ribonuclease A at 37 °C for 1 h, and then proteinase K was added at 2.5 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was precipitated by 75% ethanol and 3 m sodium acetate at −80 °C for 2 h, and pellet was resuspended in TE buffer. Each sample was electrophoresed on a 1.6% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In all experiments, floating and freshly trypsinized attached cells were pooled. Thereafter, apoptotic, necrotic, and damaged cells were separated by flow cytometry. Samples were then run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with an argon laser and filter configuration for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) dye combination. Light scatter and fluorescence signals were subjected to linear and logarithmic amplification, respectively. At least 10,000 events were acquired and analyzed with CellQuest software. The quantitative determination of the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was performed using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Cliniscience S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 × 105 washed cells resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer were simultaneously incubated with 5 μl of FITC-conjugated annexin V and 5 μl of PI for 15 min at room temperature. Before cytometric analysis, the cell suspension was supplemented with 500 μl of annexin V binding buffer. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on cells treated or not with 100 μm celecoxib for 24 h. Samples were embedded in Epon as previously reported (31Lesuffleur T. Violette S. Vasile-Pandrea I. Dussaulx E. Barbat A. Muleris M. Zweibaum A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were examined in a Jeol JEM-100 CX11 electron microscope operated at 100 kV. The assay was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, active PDK1 was immunoprecipitated from HT-29 cells transfected with the empty vector, WT PDK1, PDK1A280V, or PDK1K114G constructs. Cells were treated or not with 100 μm celecoxib for 24 h and lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm microcystin at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min, and supernatants were precleared with 50% protein G-agarose beads diluted in buffer A. In the same time, 4 μg of anti-PDK1 or normal sheep IgG were incubated with 100 μl of 50% protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. One mg of each precleared cell lysate was incubated for 2 h with protein G-agarose beads bearing anti-PDK1 on a rotator at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate active PDK1. In the second stage, inactive serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) was incubated with immunoprecipitated PDK1 and Mg2+/ATP to activate the SGK before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and Akt/SGK-specific substrate peptide (RPRAATF). The activated SGK used Mg2+/[γ-32P]ATP to phosphorylate the Akt-specific substrate peptide. Immunoprecipitates were preincubated with inactive SGK enzyme (500 ng) for 30 min at 30 °C and incubated with 66 μm Akt/SGK substrate peptide in a shaking incubator for another 30 min, and 1 μCi/ml of [γ-32P]ATP was added to start the reaction. The phosphorylated peptide substrate was then separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper and quantitated by using a scintillation counter after three washes with 0.75% phosphoric acid and two washes with acetone. Values are from three separate experiments. HT-29 cells were treated or not with 100 μm celecoxib for different times in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml IL-13 and then lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in buffer A containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5); 1% Triton X-100; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 50 mm sodium fluoride; 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate; 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were precleared with 50% protein G-agarose beads diluted in buffer A. In the same time, 4 μg of anti-Akt/PKB or normal rabbit IgG were incubated with 100 μl of 50% protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 90 min. 1 mg of each precleared cell lysates was incubated for 2 h with protein G-agarose beads bearing anti-Akt/PKB on a rotator at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate Akt/PKB. This precipitate was next used to phosphorylate a specific substrate, the recombinant murine BAD protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Briefly, 3 μg of recombinant BAD were incubated with Akt/PKB-antibody-protein G-agarose complexes in the presence of magnesium/ATP mixture for 10 min at 37 °C. After three washes with buffer A, samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of anti-phospho-BAD (Ser136) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was revealed using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 1 h at room temperature. After revelation, the Akt/PKB activity was determined after gel scanning. Since evidence indicates that celecoxib induced apoptosis and inhibited cell cycle progression in colorectal carcinoma cells in culture by mechanisms independent of COX-2 inhibition (26Williams C.S. Watson A.J. Sheng H. Helou R. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar), we have examined the dose- and time-dependent effects of celecoxib on the viability of HT-29 cells, a cell line that lacks COX-2 activity (29Hsi L.C. Baek S.J. Eling T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, celecoxib significantly induced the cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 100 μmcelecoxib for 24 h caused a loss of viability up to 65%. This effect has been previously observed in many cell lines including prostate cancer PC3 cells (5Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Wang D.S. Song X. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11397-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), lung carcinoma LLC cells (26Williams C.S. Watson A.J. Sheng H. Helou R. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar), and colon cancer HCT-15 and HCT-116 cells (26Williams C.S. Watson A.J. Sheng H. Helou R. Shao J. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the cytotoxic effect of celecoxib was due to apoptosis, HT-29 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of this drug in the presence of the large spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of zVAD-fmk, a reduction in cell death was observed, whatever the concentrations of celecoxib used. Celecoxib-dependent apoptosis was also confirmed by detection of oligonucleosomal cleavage of DNA in HT-29 cells after treatment with 100 μm celecoxib for 16 and 24 h (Fig. 2 A). However, as depicted in Fig. 1 B, a portion of HT-29 cells was always sensitive to celecoxib despite the presence of zVAD-fmk inhibitor, suggesting that a caspase-independent cell death may also occur in celecoxib-treated HT-29 cells. A better understanding of this caspase-independent cell death induced by celecoxib will require further investigations. Examination of the celecoxib-treated cells by electron microscopy revealed morphological alterations of apoptosis after being treated with 100 μm celecoxib for 24 h including chromatin condensation (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, an early event of apoptotic process, was analyzed by flow cytometry with the annexin V-binding assay after treatment of HT-29 cells with 100 μmcelecoxib for the indicated times (Fig. 2 C). Apoptotic (annexin V+/PI−), necrotic (annexin V+/PI+), and viable cells (annexin V−/PI−) were separated on the basis of a double labeling for annexin V-FITC and PI, a membrane DNA stain. Treatment with 100 μm celecoxib caused a significant increase of apoptotic cells (annexin V+/PI−) with 12, 20, and 29% for 8, 16, and 24 h of treatment, respectively. In parallel, necrotic cells (annexin V+/PI+) were detected, whatever the time of treatment, to reach 37% after 24 h of treatment (Fig.2 C). This latter effect is consistent with the secondary necrosis process, which usually comes after apoptosis in cells growing in culture. In contrast to several reports that linked COX-2 inhibitor-induced apoptosis to Bcl-2 down-regulation (32Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated by Western blot analysis that celecoxib did not affect Bcl-2 expression in HT-29 cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, COX-2 expression level was unaffected throughout the time of celecoxib treatment (Fig. 2 D). Recent studies have reported that celecoxib induced apoptosis by inhibiting Akt/PKB activity in prostate cancer cells (5Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Wang D.S. Song X. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11397-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Since celecoxib caused programmed cell death in HT-29 cells that lack COX-2 activity (29Hsi L.C. Baek S.J. Eling T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we checked whether the observed cytotoxic effect of celecoxib was mediated by a modulation of Akt/PKB activity. Akt/PKB, the major downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that has been shown to exert a crucial role in the regulation of several cellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 34Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). By stimulation of PI 3-kinase with growth factors and cytokines, Akt/PKB is recruited from the cytosol to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain and is phosphorylated at two regulatory sites, Thr308 and Ser473, essential for its activation (34Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Activated Akt/PKB, that has been involved in protecting cells from apoptosis, can phosphorylate BAD (35Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

To evaluate the effect of celecoxib on Akt/PKB activity, HT-29 cells were treated with 100 μm celecoxib for 24 h, and phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 was examined using specific phosphoantibodies (Fig.3 A). Despite the slight basal phosphorylation level of Akt/PKB in the control condition, celecoxib significantly reduced Akt/PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. The effect of celecoxib was confirmed in two independent ways: first, by measuring the Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation level of GSK-3β, a direct in vivodownstream substrate of Akt/PKB (40Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A), and second, by determining kinase activity of Akt/PKB after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 B). The loss of Akt/PKB phosphorylation mediated by celecoxib was correlated with an equivalent decrease of GSK-3β phosphorylation and an inhibition of its activity. In order to confirm the inhibitory effect of celecoxib, we increased Akt/PKB phosphorylation by using IL-13, a pleiotropic cytokine that is known to activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt/PKB pathway in HT-29 cells (41Petiot A.

We show that the mRNA levels of the differentiation-inhibiting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors ID1,ID2, and ID3 are down-regulated during RA-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. The levels of ID proteins decreased in parallel to the observed transcriptional repression. The expression of other basic helix-loop-helix genes changed during RA-induced differentiation: expression of neuroblast-specificASCL1 (HASH-1) gene was promptly reduced after RA treatment, whereas expression of differentiation-promoting genes NEUROD6 (NEX-1, HATH-2) andNEUROD1 was increased. Treatments with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, another inducer of neuroblastoma cell differentiation, also resulted in coordinated down-regulation of ID gene expression, underscoring the role of ID genes in differentiation. Down-regulation ofID gene expression by RA involves a complex mechanism because full transcriptional repression required newly synthesized proteins and signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). RA treatment activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, resulting in increased PI3K activity in extracts from RA-treated cells and a rapid increase in phosphorylation of Akt in Ser-473. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 impaired RA-induced differentiation, as assessed by morphological and biochemical criteria.

Retinoic acid (RA),1 the biologically active form of vitamin A, plays an important role in early embryonic development and in the generation of several organs and systems, as is the case with the nervous system (for review, see Refs. 1Means A.L.

In vitro, RA also plays a prominent role in regulating the transition from the proliferating precursor cell to the postmitotic differentiated cell, and there are many examples in the literature of distinct cell types whose differentiation is under the control of RA (4Strickland S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), mediate RA signaling. These receptors belong to the superfamily of the nuclear hormone receptors, which function as ligand-regulated transcription factors and act in modifying the transcriptional activity of specific genes (for review, see Refs. 12Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 13Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which RA induces differentiation of neural cells, we have analyzed the changes in gene expression associated with RA-induced differentiation using human neuroblastoma cells as a model system. Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor that arises from neural crest neuroectodermal cells (for review, see Refs. 14Schor N.F. J. Neurooncol. 1999; 41: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 15Alexander F. Urol. Clin. North Am. 2000; 27 (, vii): 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite their tumoral origin, neuroblastoma cell lines can be induced to differentiate in vitro by several agents, including RA (7Sidell N. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar,16Påhlman S. Odelstad L. Larsson E. Grotte G. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Påhlman S.

Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vitro differentiated neuroblastoma cells have a neuronal phenotype, as judged by their morphology and the expression of biochemical and functional neuronal markers. Therefore, neuroblastoma cells could be considered a useful model system to study the initial phases of neuronal differentiation (19Påhlman S. Hoehner J.C. Nånberg E. Hedborg F. Fagerström S. Gestblom C. Johansson I. Larsson U. Lavenius E. Ortoft E. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RA derivatives are being employed in the therapy of neuroblastoma, and neuroblastoma patients treated with RA have increased survival rates (20Matthay K.K. Villablanca J.G. Seeger R.C. Stram D.O. Harris R.E. Ramsay N.K. Swift P. Shimada H. Black C.T. Brodeur G.M. Gerbing R.B. Reynolds C.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 21Reynolds C.P. Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2000; 2: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular basis of the therapeutic effects of RA on neuroblastoma tumors. Here we show that RA treatment of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells leads to changes in the expression levels of bHLH transcription factors, a gene family involved in the regulation of lineage commitment and cell differentiation in many cell types (for review, see Ref. 22Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). The products of ID genes act as dominant-negative inhibitors of differentiation by avoiding the binding of other bHLH transcription factors to their cognate DNA elements named E-boxes. RA treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells leads to a coordinated down-regulation of the differentiation-inhibiting ID1, ID2, andID3 genes. In addition, the expression of the neuroblast-specific bHLH transcription factor ASCL1(HASH-1) is rapidly reduced, and the mRNA levels of the differentiation-promoting bHLH factors NEUROD6 andNEUROD1 are increased. These results support the idea that RA treatment may induce differentiation by altering the balance between differentiation-inhibiting and differentiation-promoting bHLH factors. The mechanism through which RA down-regulates ID gene expression appears to be complex because repression required newly synthesized proteins and the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). RA treatment rapidly activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is a requisite for neuroblastoma cell differentiation, because treatment with PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 impaired RA-induced differentiation. The results described here show evidence of novel actions of RA contributing to the induction of neural cell differentiation. In addition, the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by RA gives support for a heretofore unrecognized role of RA in the regulation of survival in neural cells, which provides a link between cell differentiation and cell survival. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.15 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The medium was replaced every 3 days, and the cells were split before they reached confluence. RA (all-trans retinoic acid), TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), cycloheximide, and LY294002 (all from Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the culture medium at the indicated concentrations. Most of the DNA probes were inserts from expressed sequence tag-containing plasmids obtained from IMAGE Consortium (LLNL) (23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The IMAGE ID numbers for the different probes are 148057 (ID3), 235131 (ID1), 203370 (ID2), 1032880 (ID4), 1569301 (ASCL1), 171864 (NEUROD6), 2518343 (NEUROD1), 610197 (GAP43), and 232714 (BCL2). The RARBprobe consisted of a 1.4-kb DNA fragment containing the human RARβ2 cDNA (24de The H. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Nature. 1987; 330: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The MYC probe consisted of a 1.3-kb genomic fragment containing the human MYC exon 3 (25Dalla-Favera R. Martinotti S. Gallo R.C. Erikson J. Croce C.M. Science. 1983; 219: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Probes forNPY, ACTB, and PPIA were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA from SH-SY5Y cells. NPYprobe was a 403-bp fragment, including nucleotides 5–407 ofNPY cDNA (26Takeuchi T. Gumucio D.L. Yamada T. Meisler M.H. Minth C.D. Dixon J.E. Eddy R.E. Shows T.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ACTB (actin β) probe was a 183-bp fragment, encompassing nucleotides 287–470 of theACTB cDNA (27Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1106-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The PPIA probe was a 415-bp fragment, including nucleotides 101–516 of the PPIAcDNA (28Haendler B. Hofer-Warbinek R. Hofer E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Total RNA was obtained from PBS-washed cell monolayers by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). RNA (15–20 μg/lane) was denatured, electrophoresed through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran N45, Schleicher & Schuell) following standard techniques. DNA probes were labeled at high specific activity with [α-32P]dCTP (AmershamBiosciences, specific activity >3,000 Ci/mmol) by multiprime (RadPrime labeling system, Invitrogen). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C according to Church and Gilbert (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). Filters were washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, first at room temperature for 10 min and then for 30 min at 65 °C. Membranes were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C with intensifying screens. About 1–5 × 106cells were lysated at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After washing with cold buffer B (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25% glycerol), nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and carefully resuspended in the same buffer B. Aliquots of 50 μl containing 2–10 × 106 nuclei were made, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. 5 μg of linearized plasmids containing cDNA probe fragments (ID3, BCL2, and pBS-KS) or 1 μg of purified PCR fragments (ACTB,PPIA) was denatured with NaOH and neutralized by adding 10 × SSC. Samples were applied to Nytran N45 membranes with the aid of a slot-blot apparatus (Minifold II, Schleicher & Schuell), and the DNA was fixed to the membrane by UV radiation. Transcription reactions were set with 50 μl of transcription mix (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 300 mm NH4Cl); 5 μl of 10 mm CTP, ATP, GTP mix; 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity 800 Ci/mmol); 40 units of RNasin (Promega); and 50 μl of nuclei (2–10 × 106) in buffer B. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, nuclear DNA was digested with 10 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega), and the labeled RNA was purified according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). The RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated twice with isopropyl alcohol to eliminate the unincorporated nucleotide, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The incorporated radioactivity was estimated by measuring an aliquot in a scintillation counter (32P-Cerenkov). Normally, 1–5 × 106cpm/reaction are obtained. Filters were prehybridized in 2 ml of 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 45% formamide, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA for 2–3 h at 42 °C, in a rotary oven. Equal amounts of labeled RNA probe obtained for each condition in 100 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water were mixed with 1 volume of 99% formamide, denatured at 65 °C, and chilled out on ice. The denatured probe was mixed with 2 ml of fresh hybridization solution and added to the filters. Filters were hybridized for at least 40 h at 42 °C and washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at the hybridization temperature. Membranes were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysated in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined with a detergent-compatible Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Equal amounts of extracts were loaded to acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar), and the electrophoresed proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membrane was blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% non-fat dry milk for at least 1 h. Membrane was incubated with the primary antibody in the above solution at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Luminescent signal development with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Filters were exposed to x-ray films in the dark. Antibodies against the p110β subunit of PI3K, Akt, α-tubulin, ID1, ID2, and ID3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against phosphorylated Akt was obtained from Cell Signal Technologies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Jackson ImmunoResearch, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and cells lysated in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the protein content was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. A double-stranded oligonucleotide E-box probe corresponding to the sequence present in the muscle creatine kinase enhancer was used for electric mobility shift assay (5′- TCGACCCAACACCTGCTGCCGTACCAGCT-3′; the E-box sequence is shown in bold characters). The DNA probe was labeled by filling the protruding ends with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. The protein extracts (5 μg) were incubated in 12 μl of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, containing 200 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 × 103 cpm of the labeled muscle creatine kinase enhancer probe. After a 10-min incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE, and the gel was run at 300 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the dried gel was exposed to x-ray films. Cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cells were scraped off in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysated by sonication. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein was measured (Bio-Rad protein assay). Kinase reactions were set by mixing 20 μl of cell extract in lysis buffer (containing up to 40 μg of total protein), 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) in 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 μl of 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences, specific activity, 3,000 Ci/mmol). When required, negative control reactions included 30 μm LY294002. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and were finished by adding 60 μl of 2 m HCl. Lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:1), and the organic phase was loaded onto a thin layer chromatography plate (Merck silica gel 60) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate in water. Chromatography was run in chloroform, methanol and 4 m ammonia (9:7:2) until the front reached 80% of the plate. After drying, plates were exposed to x-ray films at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Quantification of the spots was made with FUJI BAS phosphorimaging. To characterize the molecular mechanisms through which RA triggers differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells, we analyzed differentially expressed genes using the ordered differential display-PCR technique (32Matz M. Usman N. Shagin D. Bogdanova E. Lukyanov S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2541-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among several differentially expressed sequences obtained, one was identical to the 3′-end of human ID3 mRNA. The profile obtained in the differential display gel showed elevated expression of ID3 in untreated cells which was sustained after 8 h of treatment with 1 μm RA but dropped sharply after 24 h of RA treatment (data not shown). Northern blot experiments confirmed the down-regulation of ID3 mRNA during RA-induced differentiation (Fig.1 A), and nuclear run-on transcription experiments demonstrated a severe reduction of the transcription rate of the ID3 gene accounting for the observed RA-induced down-regulation (Fig. 1 B). Because different members of the ID gene subfamily of bHLH factors have been involved in the regulation of differentiation in many cell types (33Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Norton J.D. Atherton G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2371-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we investigated whether other ID genes are expressed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and how RA treatment could modify their expression levels. As shown in Fig. 1 C,ID1 was expressed in SH-SY5Y cells at levels comparable with those of ID3. ID2 mRNA levels appeared to be lower because it was detected after longer exposures of the blots.ID4 mRNA was not detected in SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 1 μm RA resulted in down-regulation ofID1 and ID2 expression, in parallel to the observed for ID3. Thus, RA treatment led to a coordinated down-regulation of ID genes. The levels of ID1, ID2, and ID3 proteins in SH-SY5Y cells were severely reduced during RA treatment, in parallel to the observed changes in mRNA expression, as shown by Western blot with specific antibodies (Fig. 1 D). ID proteins bind to and sequester ubiquitous E-proteins, avoiding complex formation with tissue-specific bHLH proteins and precluding heterodimer binding to E-box DNA elements. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with RA resulted in an increase of the protein complexes bound to an E-box element in gel shift experiments (Fig. 2 A), compatible with the observed decrease in the amounts of inhibitory ID proteins. We have analyzed the expression of bHLH genes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation during the course of RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig.2 B, the mRNA levels of ASCL1, a gene involved in determination of the neuronal fate expressed in proliferating neuroblasts (35Gestblom C. Grynfeld A. Ora I. Ortoft E. Larsson C. Axelson H. Sandstedt B. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Påhlman S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 67-79PubMed Google Scholar), were reduced rapidly after RA treatment. On the other hand, expression of two members of the atonal subfamily of neurogenic bHLH factors was detected. The mRNA levels ofNEUROD6 (NEX-1, HATH-2) are very abundant and increased rapidly after RA administration. Small amounts of NEUROD1 transcript were detected induced by RA. The mRNAs for other bHLH factors like neurogenin and ATOH1were not detected (data not shown). As a marker for neuronal differentiation and E-box-regulated gene we have assayed the expression of GAP43. Levels of GAP43 transcript were very low in untreated cells and increased during RA-induced differentiation, reaching maximal expression after 24 h of treatment. In summary, differentiation induced by RA led to dramatic changes in the expression patterns of bHLH transcription factors in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition to down-regulation of ID genes, RA treatment repressed the transcription of ASCL1, a neuroblast-specific gene, and activated the expression of at least two proneural genes from theatonal subfamily, NEUROD6 and NEUROD1. In parallel, the transcription of a bHLH-regulated, neuron-specific gene such as GAP43 is up-regulated. Phorbol esters are protein kinase C activators that have been reported to induce neural differentiation in several neuroblastoma cell lines (16Påhlman S. Odelstad L. Larsson E. Grotte G. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether the expression levels of the ID genes are modified during TPA-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig.3, the levels of ID3,ID1, and ID2 mRNAs are maintained after 6 h of treatment with 100 nm TPA but sharply reduced between 6 and 24 h of differentiation, with kinetics similar to that observed with RA treatment. In addition, TPA induced transientlyID4 expression. Low levels of ID4 mRNAs could be detected after 6 h of treatment but were reduced later during TPA-induced differentiation. The expression of the major IDgenes is thus coordinately down-regulated during differentiation induced by two disparate compounds such as RA, a signal acting through a nuclear hormone receptor, and TPA, an activator of protein kinase C, underscoring the relevance of the down-regulation of IDgenes for terminal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Next we investigated the molecular mechanisms of RA-induced coordinated down-regulation of theID genes. The fact that down-regulation of the IDgenes expression takes place between 6 and 24 h after administration of RA, with a considerable delay with respect to other down-regulated genes such as MYC (see Fig. 1 A), does not argue in favor of a direct regulation of the transcription ofID genes by ligand-activated RAR·RXR heterodimers. In addition, RA and TPA, two agents that normally have opposite effects on gene transcription, have similar effects on the expression of the major ID genes, supporting an indirect transcriptional regulation mechanism. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, prevented down-regulation ofID1 and ID3 expression by RA, without affecting transcriptional activation of genes directly activated by RA, such asRARB (Fig. 4 A), supporting the idea that newly synthesized proteins are required for repression of ID genes by RA. Because the PI3K signaling pathway has been involved in differentiation of many cell types, we have studied the effect of LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, on RA-induced repression of ID gene expression. As shown in Fig. 4 B, treatment with LY294002 prevented RA-induced full down-regulation of ID3 andID1 gene expression in SH-SY5Y cells, without affecting the induction of other genes directly activated by RA (data not shown). These results indicate that repression of ID genes by RA requires a signaling pathway involving PI3K. RA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells resulted in sustained activation of PI3K as demonstrated by the corresponding in vitro kinase assay performed with total cellular extracts (Fig. 5 A). Treatment with RA for 24 h resulted in a 4-fold increase in PI3K activity, which lasted up to 48 h. This increase was abrogated when the assay was performed in the presence of LY294002 (Fig.5 B). This sustained increase of PI3K activity correlated with an increase in the levels of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, p110β, as shown by Western blot with specific antibodies (Fig.5 C). This increase appears to be a consequence of an effect of RA on the stability of the protein because a parallel increase in p110β mRNA was not detected (data not shown). Akt kinase is one of the major targets of PI3K. Treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with RA resulted in rapid phosphorylation of the Akt kinase in Ser-473 (Fig. 5 D). Increased phosphorylated Akt immunoreactivity was detected as soon as after 30 min of RA treatment and increased further to reach a maximum after 2–3 h of RA treatment. The level of Ser-473-Akt phosphorylation obtained by RA treatment was comparable with that observed by heat-shock treatment (45 °C, 30 min), a known inducer of Akt phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells (36Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Next we addressed whether the inhibition of PI3K by its specific inhibitor LY294002 would impair RA-induced differentiation. This was evaluated both morphologically, by estimating the percentage of cells bearing long neurites, and biochemically, by analyzing the transcriptional activation of the neuron-specific geneGAP43. RA-induced morphological differentiation, shown by an increase in the percentage of cells bearing long neurites, was inhibited by the addition of LY294002 (Fig.6 A). Treatment of the cells with the PI3K inhibitor resulted in a moderate increase in theGAP43 mRNA basal level. However, further transcriptional activation of GAP43 by RA was prevented by treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 6 B). Transcriptional activation of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 was also impaired by treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 6 C). Transcription of BCL2 is strongly activated during RA-induced differentiation. Again, a moderate increase of BCL2 mRNA basal level could be observed in LY294002-treated cells. However, the inhibitor prevented RA-induced up-regulation of BCL2. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by RA is required for RA-induced cellular differentiation and for the transcription genes involved in the regulation of cell survival. The members of the bHLH family of transcription factors are involved in the control of commitment, differentiation, and development of many different tissues and organs, including the nervous system (for review, see Refs. 22Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 37Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This control is often the result of the balance between differentiation-promoting and differentiation-inhibiting bHLH factors. ID genes encode dominant-negative bHLH proteins that are supposed to inhibit differentiation by counteracting the actions of differentiation-promoting bHLH"

Three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that human MIF exists as a homotrimer and is structurally related to the bacterial enzymes 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase and 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (25Sun H.W.

MIF possesses the unusual ability to catalyze the tautomerization of the non-physiological substrates d-dopachrome andl-dopachrome methyl ester into their corresponding indole derivatives (27Rosengren E.

More recently, phenylpyruvic acid,p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (HPP), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaminechrome, and norepinephrinechrome also have been found to be MIF substrates, but high Michaelis constant (K m ) values suggest that these also are unlikely natural substrates for MIF (28Rosengren E.

Human MIF·HPP and murine MIF·inhibitor crystal structures have identified a substrate-binding hydrophobic cavity that lies between two adjacent subunits of the homotrimer (31Lubetsky J.B. Swope M.

Pro-1 appears to be a critical residue for enzymatic activity, as site-directed mutagenesis that substitutes a serine for this proline (P1S) is devoid of d-dopachrome tautomerase activity (33Bendrat K., Al- Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similarly, a proline to glycine (P1G) MIF mutant is also catalytically reduced for bothd-dopachrome and HPP tautomerase activity (31Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E.

The physiological role of these or other catalytic activities remains in question, however, because the P1S mutant is reported to retain wild-type glucocorticoid counter-regulation activity and monocyte chemotaxis inhibition, respectively (33Bendrat K., Al- Abed Y.

However, the P1G mutant is greatly impaired in its ability to stimulate superoxide generation in activated neutrophils (34Swope M.D. Sun H.W. Klockow B. Blake P. Lolis E. J. Biol.

In addition, a proline to alanine mutant of MIF loses its ability to enhance matrix metalloproteinase mRNA levels (36Onodera S. Kaneda K. Mizue Y. Koyama Y. Fujinaga M. Nishihira J. J. Biol.

The catalytic activity provides a useful tool for screening potential MIF inhibitors to study the role of the catalytic site in vitro and in vivo. We have generated a series of pharmacological inhibitors of MIF based on structure-activity studies of other inhibitors and a non-physiological substrate. An acetaminophen metabolite, N-acetylbenzoquinone imine, forms a covalent bond with MIF and inhibits MIF catalytic activity (37Senter P.D., Al- Abed Y. Metz C.N. Benigni F. Mitchell R.A. Chesney J.

We recently used rational design and synthesis ofp-hydroxyphenyl Schiff bases as inhibitors of MIF enzymatic activity (38Dios A. Mitchell R.A. Aljabari B. Lubetsky J. O'Connor K. Liao H. Senter P.D.

These data suggest a potentially powerful approach to the rational design of small molecule pharmacological inhibitors of MIF. To further investigate the link between cytokine activities and the catalytic activity of MIF, we have first turned to the study of a catalytically inactive mutant. Although the physiological substrate of MIF is not known, a mutant that blocks the binding site would inhibit catalytic activity at the Pro-1 active site. In this mutant an alanine is inserted between Pro-1 and Met-2 (PAM). Crystallographic studies of the PAM mutant indicate that this modification of the sequence results in the movement of the proline into the substrate-binding site, blocking the binding of any substrate (31Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In a second approach, synthesis and analysis of phenylimine scaffolds as potential MIF antagonists have revealed that isoxazolines, which are more stable in aqueous solution, may serve as an attractive scaffold for further drug design. We have assessed the MIF antagonistic capacity of (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) and related derivatives in several bioassays, including MIF stimulation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2and modulation of glucocorticoids on TNFα, PGE2, and Cox-2 production. The structure of ISO-1 complexed to MIF provides insights into the design of the next generation of MIF inhibitors. Expression and purification of the proteins were performed as previously described (31Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of wild-type and mutant proteins involves growing human pET11b-MIF or murine pET24a-MIF-transformed BL21(DE3) cells to an A 600 of 0.7–1.0 and inducing with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After a 5-h growth, the cells are harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 20 mmNaCl, pH 7.5, at 7–14% of the original volume of growth medium. Cells are lysed using a French press. After addition of protamine sulfate to a final concentration of 0.006%, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter and then applied to Mono S and Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) anion-exchange columns. Under the buffer conditions used, most contaminating proteins adsorb to one of the chromatographic media, whereas wild-type and mutant MIF do not. The fractions containing MIF were pooled and concentrated using ultrafiltration and microconcentrators. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 1.22 m−1cm−1). The resulting MIF sample is >95% pure and suitable for catalytic characterization and x-ray crystallography. MIF has an unusually high affinity for endotoxin that must be removed to ensure that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) does not interfere with the results of the biological assays. The initial steps of purification remain as stated previously. The pooled protein fractions were applied to a Sep-Pak C8 column (Waters) as follows. Columns were attached to a vacuum manifold to assist in the endotoxin purification. The columns were wet with methanol and then washed with low endotoxin water. Approximately 1 mg of protein was applied to each column and run though the column slowly. The resin was washed with pure water and 30% acetonitrile. The protein was eluted with 5 ml of 60% acetonitrile into polystyrene tubes. The samples were kept in the −80 °C freezer until lyophilization. For refolding, all buffers were prepared with low endotoxin water in LPS-free containers. Several lyophilized pellets of MIF were dissolved in 350 μl of 8 m urea in an Eppendorf tube and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Four μl of 1 mdithiothreitol solution was added and the solution was incubated for an additional hour. Three consecutive times, 350 μl of 10 mmdithiothreitol were added, the contents were swirled, and the tube was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was then incubated at 4 °C for ∼30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The solution was then dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm dithiothreitol in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (human) or pH 6.8 (murine), using a dialysis Slidealyzer cassette (Pierce) MWCO 7,000 overnight followed by dialysis against Tris-buffered saline over the next several days. The sample was collected from the cassette and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm.d-Dopachrome tautomerase activity was assessed and the final endotoxin concentration was determined using a quantitative chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysis test kit (BioWhittaker). ISO-1 was synthesized in three steps as described previously (39Xue C.B. Wityak J. Sielecki T.M. Pinto D.J. Batt D.G. Cain G.A. Sworin M. Rockwell A.L. Roderick J.J. Wang S. Orwat M.J. Frietze W.E.

Olson R.E. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several derivatives of ISO-1 were prepared as follows. Compound 2was synthesized as described previously (39Xue C.B. Wityak J. Sielecki T.M. Pinto D.J. Batt D.G. Cain G.A. Sworin M. Rockwell A.L. Roderick J.J. Wang S. Orwat M.J. Frietze W.E. Bostrom L.L.

For compound3, ISO-1 (0.5 mmol) was dissolved in acetone and treated with K2CO3 (0.7 mmol) followed by MeI (0.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 5 h and quenched after completion by aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The crude mixture was purified by flash chromatography. Compound 3 was obtained in 78% yield. Compound 4 was produced by standard acylation of ISO-1 followed by oxidation usingN-bromosuccinimide and azobisisobutyronitrile as described previously (39Xue C.B. Wityak J. Sielecki T.M. Pinto D.J. Batt D.G. Cain G.A. Sworin M. Rockwell A.L. Roderick J.J. Wang S. Orwat M.J. Frietze W.E. Bostrom L.L. Liu J. Higley C.A. Rankin F.W. Tobin A.E. Emmett G. Lalka G.K. Sze J.Y., Di Meo S.V. Mousa S.A.

The crude mixture was treated with sodium methoxide in methanol to free the hydroxyl group and the final compound was recovered in 65% yield after flash chromatography. Last, for compound 5, a solution of ISO-1 (0.45 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran at 0 °C was treated with LiAlH4. After complete consumption of the ester and the formation of a new product, the reaction was quenched and the crude product was purified using flash chromatography to furnish compound 5 in 95% yield. l-Dopachrome methyl ester was prepared at 2.4 mm through oxidation ofl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester with sodium periodate as previously described (38Dios A. Mitchell R.A. Aljabari B. Lubetsky J. O'Connor K. Liao H. Senter P.D. Manogue K.R. Lolis E. Metz C. Bucala R. Al-Abed Y. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Activity was determined at room temperature by adding dopachrome methyl ester (0.3 ml) to a cuvette containing 50 nm MIF in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, 0.5 mm EDTA and measuring the decrease in absorbance from 2 to 20 s at 475 nm spectrophotometrically. The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at various concentrations and added to the cuvette with the MIF prior to the addition of the dopachrome. Human or murine (for the mutant study) mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and monocytes were purified by adherence. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing each well twice in 24 h with RPMI, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. 1 × 106 cells/well were preincubated for 1 h with dexamethasone (10−8m), dexamethasone plus MIF (100 ng/ml wild-type or mutant MIF), or dexamethasone plus MIF and ISO-1 (0.1–20 μm) before the addition of 0.5 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma). After 16 h, cell culture supernatants were collected for determination of TNFα and prostaglandin (PGE2) concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems). Western blot analysis of Cox-2 was carried out as described previously (41Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 1 × 106 human mononuclear cells were lysed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mm EDTA. Cellular debris was pelleted and the supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Ten μl of lysate was electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis using polyclonal goat anti-Cox-2 IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MIF plasmid construction and transfection were performed as described previously (41Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 nm[14C]arachidonic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After overnight culture, the cells were washed extensively with RPMI followed by re-addition of RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were subsequently transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and pcDNA/GS (Invitrogen) empty vector or FuGENE 6 and pcDNA/GS/MIF in the absence or presence of vehicle (Me2SO) or inhibitors. After 16 h cell supernatants were collected and14C-labeled arachidonic acid was assessed by scintillation counting. Human wild-type MIF was concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml before crystallization. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For MIF·ISO-1 crystals, equal volumes (1 μl) of protein and 2 mm inhibitor dissolved in reservoir solution (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 4% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0) were mixed. Crystals belong to the space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 95.80 Å, b = 95.80 Å, andc = 104.12 Å. All crystals were equilibrated with cryoprotectant (25% glycerol in mother liquor) for 10–15 min and were frozen rapidly in a stream of N2 at −140 °C for data collection. Diffraction data were collected on an RAXIS-IIC image plate detector (Rigaku, Tokyo) with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator. Data were processed by the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure of the trigonal crystal form of wild-type MIF complexed with ISO-1 was solved by Fourier differences using phases from uncomplexed MIF (25Sun H.W. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed with X-PLOR 3.851 (43Brünger A.T. X-PLOR 3.851 Edition. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1997Google Scholar). The R free was implemented in the beginning of refinement and used throughout the refinement process as a guide for model improvement (44Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). The graphics program O (45Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used for the display of electron density maps. After rigid body refinement, a series of positional refinement rounds were performed in which strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were implemented. ISO-1 was built into the electron density of an omit map calculated with non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The coordinates, topology, and parameter files for the inhibitor were constructed with INSIGHTII (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) and XPLOR2D (46Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Group B-factor refinement, individual B-factor refinement, and bulk solvent correction, which enabled the use of lower resolution data throughout the subsequent rounds of refinement, were implemented. The trimer was generated, and further rounds of non-crystallographic symmetry-restrained refinement and model building were performed to obtain the final structure. Root mean square deviation calculations were performed with LSQMAN (Uppsala Software Factory, Uppsala, Sweden).

LPS, a bacterial cell wall component, is an inflammatory product that induces the release of TNF from macrophage cell lines or primary monocytes. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF release. Exogenously applied MIF counteracts this anti-inflammatory activity, providing a convenient in vitro bioassay (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). We have previously designed a catalytically inactive alanine insertion mutant between Pro-1 and Met-2 (PAM) and determined its three-dimensional structure. Both murine wild-type MIF and the PAM mutant were tested in this assay to determine whether the disruption of the catalytic active site of MIF inhibits its glucocorticoid override activity. Wild-type MIF inhibits glucocorticoid inhibition of cytokine production and leads to higher TNFα production in dexamethasone-treated, LPS-activated monocytes, whereas PAM does not (Fig. 1). Moreover, PAM shows slight antagonist activity, as the production of TNF-α is decreased relative to the sample containing LPS and dexamethasone. The synthesis and analysis of additional phenylimine scaffolds as potential MIF antagonists have revealed that isoxazolines may serve as an attractive scaffold for drug design. ISO-1 contains the structural elements that appear to be important for binding to the MIF catalytic active site based on our analysis of MIF·HPP complex and structure-activity relationships with the amino acid Schiff base compounds (31Lubetsky J.B.

The humanZNT6 gene was mapped at 2p21–22, while the mouseZnt6 was localized to chromosome 17. Overexpression of ZnT6 in both wild-type yeast and mutants that are deficient in cytoplasmic zinc causes growth inhibition, but this inhibition is abolished in mutant cells with high cytoplasmic zinc. ZnT6 may function in transporting the cytoplasmic zinc into the Golgi apparatus as well as the vesicular compartment, as evidenced by its overlapping intracellular localization with TGN38 and transferrin receptor in the normal rat kidney cells. We also demonstrate that the intracellular distributions of ZnT6 as well as ZnT4 are regulated by zinc in the normal rat kidney cells. The results from this report, combined with those from other studies, suggest that the intracellular zinc homeostasis is mediated by many ZnT proteins, which act in tissue-, cell-, and organelle-specific manners.

In mammals, zinc is absorbed through the brush border of small intestinal mucosa from diet and transported through blood to the tissues and cells where zinc is needed (2Reyes J.G. Am. J.

In general, the ZnT proteins are predicted to have similar protein structures with features including six transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domain IV and V. Znt1 is expressed in many tissues, and the protein resides on the plasma membrane. Overexpression of ZnT1 in zinc-sensitive cells confers zinc resistance probably by direct export of zinc out cells (3Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). ZnT2 and ZnT3 are more similar to each other than they are to ZnT1. They are located on the vesicular membranes and involved in transporting zinc from the cytoplasm into vesicles. The expression of Znt2 has been demonstrated in tissues including small intestine, kidney, seminal vesicles, testis, and placenta. However, the expression ofZnt3 was detected only in brain and testis (4Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D.

ZnT4 is more related to ZnT2 and ZnT3 than ZnT1, and it appears to be expressed ubiquitously with abundant expression in brain, mammary gland, and small intestine. ZnT4 confers zinc resistance to Δzrc1, a yeast strain that has a defect in a vacuolar zinc transporter (ZRC1) (zinc resistance conferring), suggesting that it is involved in sequestration of cytoplasmic zinc into vacuoles when expressed in yeast (6Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, ZnT4 is deficient in the lethal milk mouse mutant in which pups of any genotype suckled on homozygous lethal milk mothers die of zinc deficiency before weaning (12Dichie M.M. Mouse News Lett. 1969; 41: 30-31Google Scholar, 13Green M.C. Sweet H.O. Mouse News Lett. 1973; 48: 35Google Scholar). The zinc level in the milk of homozygous lethal milkanimals is about 50% that of normal animals (14Piletz J.E. Ganschow R.E. Science. 1978; 199: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Burgunder J.M. Prud'homme J.F. Brice A. Fontaine B., B., H. Weissenbach J. Erway L.C. Grider A.J. J. Hered. 1984; 75: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrating that ZnT4 plays a crucial role in depositing the cytoplasmic zinc into the secretory vesicles in the lactating mammary glands. Yeast mutants of zinc metabolism have provided useful tools to analyze the function of mammalian zinc transporters. Recent studies have been shown that at least five zinc transporters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are involved in yeast zinc homeostasis. TheZRT1 and ZRT2 genes encode the high and low affinity zinc importers, respectively (16Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The ZRC1 andZRT3 genes encode the zinc transporters responsible for zinc movement from the cytoplasm to vacuoles and from vacuoles to the cytoplasm, respectively (18Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). And the MSC2 (meiotic sister-chromatid recombination) gene encodes a zinc transporter that may act in transporting zinc out of the endoplasmic reticulum/nucleus (20Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 176: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification and characterization of a sixth member of the ZnT family, which we designate as ZnT6. We provide evidence that ZnT6 functions as a zinc transporter responsible for relocating the cytoplasmic zinc into the trans Golgi network (TGN) as well as the vesicular compartment. We also show that the intracellular localizations of ZnT6 and ZnT4 in the normal rat kidney (NRK) cells are regulated by zinc. NRK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). CHO cells were maintained in 1:1 DMEM:F12 (Ham) medium with 15 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 2 mg/ml pyridoxine hydrochloride, and 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The pcDNA5/FRT or pcDNA5/ZnT6-Myc-transfected CHO cells were cultured in the same medium as described above plus 100 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Expressed sequence tag (EST) clones were purchased from ResGen (Invitrogen). The yeast null-mutant of Δzrt1 was a gift from Dr. David Eide at University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO. The yeast deletion strains Δzrt3 and Δmsc2 were purchased from ResGen (Invitrogen). Δzrc1 was kindly provided by D. Conklin (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories). Wild-type yeast BY4741 (MATa his3D1 leu2D0 met15D0 ura3D0) was purchased from ResGen. Yeast strains were grown in synthetic defined medium supplemented with auxotrophic requirements and either 2% glucose or 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. The entire open reading frame (ORF) sequence of mouse Znt6 was PCR-amplified using primers with a HindIII site incorporated immediately before the methionine codon and an XbaI site immediately after the stop codon. The mouse EST clone AA386648 was used as the template for the PCR amplification. The plasmid pY-ZnT6 was generated by digestion and insertion of the amplified sequence into the HindIII andXbaI sites of a yeast expression vector, pYES2 (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid, pcDNA5/ZnT6-Myc, which was used to transfect CHO cells, was made by several cloning steps. First, theZnt6 ORF sequence lacking a stop codon was generated by PCR using the primers with a HindIII site incorporated immediately before the methionine codon and a SacII site incorporated into the stop codon. The resulting PCR fragments were digested with respective restriction enzymes designed in the primer pair and inserted into the HindIII and SacII sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to create pEGFP/ZnT6. Second, the HindIII and SmalI fragment containing the Znt6 ORF was excised from pEGFP/ZnT6 and cloned into theHindIII and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen). Finally, the HindIII andAgeI (blunted with Klenow fragment) fragment in which the Myc epitope was fused in frame to the C-terminal of theZnt6 ORF was isolated from the resulting plasmid, pcDNA3.1/ZnT6-Myc, and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen). The final construct, pcDNA5/ZnT6-Myc, was sequenced and transfected into CHO cells alone with pOG44 (Flp recombinase) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The stable clones were selected by culturing the transfected cells in the medium containing 100 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Invitrogen). A negative control CHO cell line was also obtained by transfecting the vector, pcDNA5/FRT, into CHO cells. Northern blot with mRNAs derived from different tissues of C57BL/6J was prepared as described in Huang and Gitschier (6Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The blot was probed with a 32P-labeled full-length ORF DNA fragment of Znt6 in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit anti-ZnT6 and anti-ZnT4 polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides (amino acids 446–460 of ZnT6 and amino acids 93–110 of ZnT4) and affinity-purified (Pierce). The epitopes used in generation of rabbit anti-ZnT6 and anti-ZnT4 polyclonal antibodies were found to be unique to the respective proteins in a BLAST search of the SWISSPROT data base. A monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibody was purchased from Stressgen. A monoclonal anti-TGN38 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. A peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Pierce. An Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and an Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were purchased from Molecular Probes. The brain, lung, liver, kidney, heart, and small intestine tissues were isolated from a C57BL/6J mouse and homogenized in the lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate. One mini proteinase inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added into 10 ml of the lysis buffer just before use. The homogenized tissues were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and quantitated using Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Proteins of 100 μg of the brain, lung, liver, kidney, heart, and small intestine extracts were separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). ZnT6 was detected as described previously (21Huang L. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 329-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using an affinity-purified anti-ZnT6 antibody (1:250 dilution) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2500). ZnT6 was visualized by using ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cell lysate from the vector- and pcDNA5/ZnT6-Myc stably transfected CHO cells were prepared as follows. The CHO cell lines were cultured in the 150-mm Petri dishes for 48 h, washed with 1× PBS twice and collected in 1× PBS. Cells were pelleted, resuspended, and swelled in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% deoxycholate) for 5 min. 70 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), 2 μl of 2 mg/ml pepstatin A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and one mini-proteinase inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added into 7 ml of the lysis buffer just before use. Cells were then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with a B-pestle, and the cell lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell lysate was then put through a syringe with a 21-guage needle attached for four times. The SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the cell lysate, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The DNA and insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay. 50 μg of proteins were separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). ZnT6-Myc fusion protein was detected using an anti-Myc antibody (2 mg/ml, Stressgen) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000). ZnT6-Myc fusion protein was visualized by using ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed essentially as described (21Huang L. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 329-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRK cells were cultured in slide chambers for 24 or 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.4% saponin (Sigma). Where indicated, the cells were treated with ZnSO4 for 2 h prior to the fixation. The cells were subsequently stained with an affinity-purified anti-ZnT6 (1:20 dilution) or anti-ZnT4 (1:25 dilution) antibody followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:250 dilution). In the brefeldin A treatment and colocalization studies, the NRK cells were costained with an anti-ZnT6 and an anti-TGN38 (1:200 dilution) antibodies followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and an Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:250 dilution), respectively. Photomicrographs were obtained by Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with a digital camera. Search of the EST data bases with the amino acid sequence of mouse ZnT4 uncovered several mouse and human EST clones predicted to encode a protein similar to the members of the ZnT family. The mouse EST clone AA386648 was purchased from ResGen (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. This clone contains a single open reading frame encoding a 460-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 51 kDa. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence similarity to the members of the ZnT family (32%, 33%, and 33% amino acid identities to rat ZnT2, mouse ZnT3, and mouse ZnT4, respectively), we designated this novel gene as Znt6(Slc30a6) and the gene product as ZnT6. ZnT6 shares many features described previously for the ZnT family, including six predicted transmembrane domains, cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains as well as a loop region between transmembrane domain IV and V (Fig.1). However, in contrast to other ZnT proteins, the ZnT6 loop lacks multiple histidine residues, the potential ligands for zinc, while retaining serine residues, a finding reminiscent of CZCD, a prokaryotic transporter of zinc, cadmium, and cobalt (22Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8102-8110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Another distinguishing feature of ZnT6 is its longer C terminus. The human ZNT6 gene encodes the same size protein (460 amino acids) as that of mice and has 92% amino acid identity to it. Data base analysis revealed that two BAC clones (accession nos. AL121653 andAL121658) from human chromosome 2p21–22 contain the ZNT6gene. The ZNT6 gene has at least 14 exons, and the genomic sequence spans about 56 kb. The locus of the mouse ZnT6sequence is on chromosome 17, a region with homology by synteny (The Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium). No human or mouse disease of suspected zinc metabolism maps to these loci. By Northern blot analysis, two ZnT6 transcripts of 2.4- and 1.7-kb are revealed in mouse tissues, with relatively abundant expression in liver and brain (Fig.2 a). The expression of the 1.7-kb transcript is higher than that of the 2.4-kb in all tissues examined. The two sizes are reflected in two groups of EST clones, derived from mammary gland, skin, and embryo and differing only in their 3′-untranslated region. Comparison to the genomic sequence showed that two different polyadenylation signals are utilized. The Western blot analysis confirmed that a single ZnT6 protein of the predicted size (51 kDa) is produced in mouse brain and a much fainter signal is detected in small intestine and kidney (Fig. 2 b), which are consistent with the levels of transcription observed on the Northern blot (Fig. 2 a). A single protein band of slightly higher molecular mass (∼55 kDa) was detected in lung, indicating that ZnT6 may be posttranslationally modified in lung tissue (Fig.2 b). No ZnT6 protein band was detected in liver and heart on the Western blot although high level of the ZnT6 mRNA was found in liver on the Northern blot (Fig. 2). The discrepancy between the levels of ZnT6 mRNA and protein expression in lung (less mRNA detected but more protein expressed) and liver (abundant mRNA detected but no protein detected) suggests that a posttranscriptional mechanism may play a role in tissue-specific expression of the ZnT6 protein. The specificity of the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ZnT6 antibody was assessed by Western blots of the protein extract from a mouse brain probed with a preimmune serum, and the total protein extract from the CHO cells that were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing ZnT6-Myc fusion protein probed with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Stressgen). No protein of the predicted size (∼51 kDa) was detected in brain when the preimmune serum was used (Fig. 2 b). A protein band of the predicted size (∼55 kDa) was detected in the CHO cells expressing ZnT6-Myc fusion protein, whereas no protein was detected in the CHO cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.2 b). Taking together, the results indicate that the affinity-purified anti-ZnT6 antibody specifically reacts with the endogenous ZnT6 protein in the mouse tissues. We asked whether ZnT6 has the ability to transport zinc indirectly by looking at the effect of ZnT6 expression in a series of yeast mutants that are defective in zinc metabolism. First, we tested whether ZnT6 can relieve the sensitivity to zinc found in the yeast mutant Δzrc1, in which zinc accumulates in the cytoplasm due to a defect in a vacuolar zinc transporter ZRC1 (Fig. 1). Whereas ZnT4 was previously shown to rescue the growth of the yeast mutant in high zinc medium (6Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), ZnT6 failed to complement the Δzrc1 defect under similar conditions (data not shown). This finding suggests that ZnT6 may not be involved in the transport of the cytoplasmic zinc into the vacuoles, which largely reduces the cytoplasmic zinc concentration in cells. We then asked whether expression of ZnT6 might exacerbate the cytoplasmic zinc deficiency seen in three yeast mutants:Δzrt1, which is defective in the yeast high affinity zinc uptake protein, and Δzrt3 and Δmcs2, which have defects in relocation of zinc from the vacuoles and endoplasmic reticulum/nucleus to the cytoplasm, respectively (16Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 19MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 176: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In each mutant, overexpression of ZnT6 resulted in poor to no growth in the inducible media, whereas the mutants transformed with vector alone grew well (Fig. 3 a). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of ZnT6 on yeast growth was observed in the wild-type yeast strain (BY 4741) (Fig. 3 b). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ZnT6 transports zinc out of the cytoplasm into either an intracellular pool or out of the cell, leading to a severe diminution in the cytoplasmic zinc and concomitant growth retardation. Indeed, under inducible media, ZnT6 did not inhibit the growth of Δzrc1 mutant cells (Fig. 3 a). To further test this hypothesis, we asked whether addition of zinc might counter the inhibitory effect of ZnT6 on cell growth. Looking at both wild-type and Δzrt1 strains, growth inhibition can be partially alleviated by adding 1.0 mm ZnCl2 in the inducible media (Fig. 3 b and data not shown). However, higher zinc concentrations were no more effective (data not shown). The effect of zinc was specific: addition of iron (0.35 mmFeSO4), copper (0.1 mm CuSO4), cobalt (0.5 mm CoSO4), or manganese (1.0 mm MnCl2) did not help to restore growth in either wild-type or Δzrt1 strains expressing ZnT6 (data not shown). As each of the previously described ZnT proteins appears to serve a specific cellular zinc transport need, we asked by immunofluorescence analysis whether ZnT6 lies in a particular subcellular compartment in mammalian cells. In the cultured rat NRK cells, ZnT6 displayed a perinuclear location as well as a punctate/tubular pattern throughout the cytoplasm of the cells and underlying the plasma membrane. Localization of ZnT6 was compared with that of TGN38, a known TGN protein and to the TfR, a plasma membrane protein that recycles to the TGN shortly after internalization via recycling endosomes. As shown in Fig.4, A, D, andG, the perinuclear staining of ZnT6 is completely coincident with that of TGN38, strongly suggesting that ZnT6 is associated with TGN. The tubular/punctuate staining of ZnT6 partially overlaps with that of transferrin receptor, whereas the perinuclear staining of both proteins completely overlaps, indicating that ZnT6 may reside in the vesicles in addition to the recycling endosomes in the NRK cells (data not shown). Fig. 4, B–I confirms that ZnT6 localizes to the TGN, as an addition of a fungal macrocyclic lactone, brefeldin A (BFA), known to disrupt the Golgi compartment, also disrupts ZnT6 with the same time course as that of TGN38. After 30 min of BFA treatment, the fluorescence perinuclear staining of ZnT6 completely disappears and the signal has diffused into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B). Meanwhile, BFA treatment causes the fluorescence signal of TGN38 to diffuse into the cytoplasm and form a strong juxtanuclear spot (Fig. 4 E). Incubation of BFA-treated cells in BFA-free media for 60 min resulted in nearly complete restoration of the normal localization of both ZnT6 and TGN38 (Fig 4, C, F, and I). These BFA-induced changes and the recovery of the changes by the fresh medium are characteristic features for the proteins that associate with Golgi compartment. We next asked whether the expression or distribution of ZnT6 was influenced by zinc. No changes in mRNA or protein abundance were elicited in the NRK cells cultured in the medium containing 200 μm ZnSO4 for 24 h (data not shown). However, by immunofluorescence analysis, we detected zinc-induced trafficking of ZnT6 at 2 and 24 h after ZnSO4treatment in the NRK cells. The panels on the left (A–D) in Fig. 5 show the staining for ZnT6 in the NRK cells exposed to various ZnSO4 concentrations. After 2 h, the perinuclear capping started to diffuse into the cytoplasm and the punctate/tubular signals were enhanced and distributed toward the periphery of the cells with the addition of an increased amount of zinc (Fig. 5, B–D). We were unable to detect a clear delineation of the plasma membrane staining with the increased zinc concentration in the media. To investigate whether this zinc-induced protein trafficking is a common phenomenon for the ZnT proteins, we studied the localization of ZnT4 under the same conditions. ZnT4 has been shown to reside in the TGN as well as in the endosomal compartment (Fig. 5 E) (10Murgia C. Vespignani I. Cerase J. Nobili F. Perozzi G. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1231-G1239Google Scholar). 2L. Huang, C. P. Kirschke, and J. Gitschier,unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 5, although ZnT4 does redistribute from its perinuclear location to the cytoplasm, it is less sensitive to zinc than ZnT6, with dramatic effects seen only at 200 μm ZnSO4. Our data demonstrate that although the punctate staining patterns differ between ZnT6 and ZnT4, indicating they may reside in two different vesicular compartments, both proteins are localized in the TGN (Fig. 5,A and E and data not shown), and their intracellular localizations are regulated by extracellular zinc concentration. In this paper, we have functionally characterized the sixth member of the ZnT family. We conclude that ZnT6 is a zinc transporter that translocates the cytoplasmic zinc into the TGN as well as the vesicular compartments based on the evidences from our studies. First, ZnT6 is closely related to several previously characterized ZnT members from mammals, yeast, and bacteria (Fig. 1). Second, ZnT6 was able to suppress the growth of several yeast mutants that are defective in accumulation of the cytoplasmic zinc. Third, the higher cytoplasmic zinc content was able to alleviate ZnT6-transformed Δzrc1from growth inhibition by ZnT6, and the extracellular zinc was able to partially rescue the growth inhibition by ZnT6 in wild-type,Δzrt1, and Δzrt1/Δzrt2 yeast strains (Fig.3. and data not shown). Last, ZnT6 is localized predominantly in the TGN compartment in NRK cells in the normal culture condition. However, its distribution from the TGN to the vesicular compartment in NRK cells is regulated by extracellular zinc ions in the culture medium. The zinc-induced redistribution of ZnT proteins is reminiscent of the findings with a copper export protein described for the Menkes disease protein (MNK), whose relocation from the TGN to the plasma membrane is induced by elevated copper, which in turn exports excess intracellular copper (23Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The zinc-induced protein trafficking of ZnT4 is consistent with a functional role of ZnT4 in the lactating mammary gland as zinc is deficient in the milk of homozygous lethal milk mothers. ZnT4 may transport zinc into the TGN vesicles, and zinc may leave the cells through the secretory pathway. We speculate that ZnT6 functions in two major aspects of intracellular zinc homeostasis. First, ZnT6 may be involved in transporting the cytoplasmic zinc into the TGN vesicles, where it may be incorporated into zinc-requiring proteins. In this situation, the function of ZnT6 overlaps with that of ZnT4. The partial overlap of cellular localization of ZnT6 and ZnT4 may explain the lack of phenotypes in the other organs in the lethal milk mutant. Second, ZnT6 may play a role in zinc export based on its intracellular distribution, its zinc-induced intracellular redistribution, and its ability to diminish the cytoplasmic zinc when overexpressed in yeast cells. ZnT6 may cycle between the TGN and the plasma membrane both in basal and elevated cytoplasmic zinc concentration. Perhaps we did not detect a clear delineation of the plasma membrane staining because ZnT6 may be constantly recycled. Alternatively, ZnT6 may transport zinc into the TGN and the cytoplasmic vesicles, which could leave the cell through the secretory pathway. A key aspect of the function of ZnT6 in regulating the cytoplasmic zinc levels in cells may be its zinc-induced relocalization from the TGN to the cytoplasmic vesicles and then removal of zinc from cells either by the export function of ZnT6 on plasma membrane or by the secretory pathway because the expression of ZnT6 is not regulated by zinc at the transcriptional level or at the translational level in vitro. The molecular basis for the internalization of ZnT6 from the plasma membrane might be the di-leucine motifs at amino acid positions 363 and 364 as well as 401 and 402 of ZnT6 (23Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Francis M.J. Jones E.E. Levy E.R. Marti R.L. Ponnambalam S. Monaco A.P. J. Cell Science. 1999; 112: 1721-1732PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal di-leucine motif has been demonstrated to mediate copper-induced trafficking of the MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane, followed by return to the TGN via clathrin-coated vesicles. Further mutagenesis studies are required to demonstrate the importance of these motifs in the intracellular distribution and zinc-induced redistribution of ZnT6 (23Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Petris M.J. Camakaris J. Greenough M. LaFontaine S. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The multiple histidine residues in the loop region between transmembrane IV and V in the ZnT proteins have been hypothesized to act for a zinc binding domain. Our preliminary data indicate that the multiple serine residues in the loop region of ZnT6, which lacks multiple histidine residues in that region, are critical for the function of ZnT6 in vivo. The serine residues may coordinate the zinc binding with the histidine residue at the C-terminal end of the ZnT proteins (His-300 in ZnT6) to facilitate zinc cross-membrane trafficking. Further studies are under way to elucidate the mechanism of how zinc transporters relay zinc across membranes and where the energy comes from. The presence of translationally inactive ZnT6 mRNA in liver is reminiscent of the expression pattern of ZnT3 (5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). ZnT3 mRNA is abundantly expressed in adult testis of mice, as detected by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR, while the ZnT3 protein is undetectable by Western blot analysis. It has been shown that the ZnT3 transcripts in testis are predominantly associated with monoribosomes, suggesting that this mRNA may not be translated efficiently (5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). A modified ZnT6 protein with slightly higher molecular mass was observed in lung. In addition, the amount of the ZnT6 protein detected in lung is substantial as compared with its low level of transcripts. Many potential protein kinase C and CK2 phosphorylation andN-glycosylation sites are predicted in the ZnT6 protein using the ProfileScan Server (hits.isb-sib.ch). Phosphorylation and/or glycosylation of ZnT6 may increase the stability of the ZnT6 protein in lung. The functional difference between the native ZnT6 and modified ZnT6 proteins in intracellular zinc transportation remains unknown. It has become clear from our studies and others that zinc is transported into and out of a variety of intracellular compartments, and there appear to be dedicated zinc transporters for each event. The findings of the present study extend our understanding of what zinc transporters do in cells, how the expression of zinc transporters regulate, and how the transporters get to their various compartments. As this manuscript is under review a paper describing the finding of a fifth member of the ZnT family, ZnT5, was published (Kambe, T., Narita, H., Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y., Hirose, J., Amano, T., Sugiura, N., Sasaki, R., Mori, K., Iwanaga, T., and Nagao, M.

We detected hallmarks of apoptosis such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, DNA ladder formation, caspase activation, and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage.

Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is beneficial during embryonic development and adult life but its dysregulation accompanies the pathogenesis of many diseases (reviewed in Ref. 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Inappropriate increase in apoptotic cell death has been reported in wasting diseases such as AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders, and ischemic injury, whereas decreases in cell death contribute to proliferative autoimmune diseases and tumorigenesis. A precise description of cell death pathways and their regulation is therefore critical to understand cell death-associated diseases and to develop therapeutic strategies. Proteolytic enzymes of the caspase family play a central role in initiating and sustaining the biochemical events that result in apoptotic cell death (3Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some forms of apoptosis, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by activation of the apical caspase-8 following death receptor ligation (4Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). In other forms, cellular stress leads to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway initiated by the apical caspase-9 (5Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These pathways converge upon activation of the executioner caspases-3 and -7. Superimposed on this minimal scheme is an “integration model” in which both upstream and downstream caspases as well as other proteases cooperate to regulate apoptosis in a cell-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 6Leist M. Jäättelä M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is triggered by cytochrome c release from mitochondria (7Liu X. Kim C.N.

The mechanism by which cytochrome ccrosses the mitochondrial outer membrane is not yet known, but the opposing actions of a group of intracellular proteins, the Bcl-2 family proteins, critically regulate this process (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family has been divided into three groups based on structural similarities and functional criteria (reviewed in Ref. 9Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6235) Google Scholar). Group I consists of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which possess four short conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains (BH1–BH4). Group II members, exemplified by the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, have a similar overall structure, containing all but the BH4 domains. Group III proteins consist of a large and diverse collection of proteins, exemplified by the pro-apoptotic Bid and Bik, whose common feature is the presence of the BH3 domain. The function of calcium in apoptosis is a complex subject involving interplay between many systems, such as the sphingomyelin signaling pathway, the redox system, the stress-activated protein kinase cascade, and the calcium signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 10Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). Regarding this, it has been reported that Bcl-2 family proteins may exert some of their actions by interfering with calcium dynamics of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (10Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). Increase of intracellular Ca2+ level induces apoptosis in thymocytes (11Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), hypocampal neurons (12Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), and various cancer cells via activation of calcium-dependent enzymes (e.g.Ref. 13Furuya Y. Lundmo P. Short A.D. Gill D.L. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6167-6175PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of a calcium ionophore such as A23187 rapidly leads to activation of the ubiquitous calpains (14Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27992-27995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpains are intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine endopeptidases but are otherwise structurally unrelated to caspases. The calpain family members can be classified as typical calpains, which are further divided into ubiquitous and tissue-specific calpains, and atypical calpains (reviewed in Ref. 15Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Ubiquitous calpains occur in two isoforms, μ-calpain (μCP) and m-calpain (mCP) requiring micromolar or millimolar calcium concentrations for their activation in vitro, respectively. These heterodimeric enzymes consist of a small regulatory subunit (30 kDa) and a large catalytic subunit (80 kDa). In this work the term “calpains” refers to endogenous ubiquitous calpains. The physiological roles of calpains are largely unknown, although their ubiquitous and constitutive expression strongly suggests essential and basic functions in vivo. In particular, connections to apoptotic processes have been suggested. For instance, calpains may be involved, in synergy with caspases, in the down-regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor subtypes during tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis of human T lymphoma cells (16Diaz F. Bourguignon L.Y. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between calpains and caspases has been reported in the activation of caspase-12 (17Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), during etoposide-induced apoptosis in T cells (18Varghese J. Radhika G. Sarin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2035-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and during apoptosis of neuronal cells induced by a prion protein fragment (19O'Donovan C.N. Tobin D. Cotter T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43516-43523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Synergistic involvement of calpain and the proteasome in apoptosis of human neutrophils has also been reported (20Knepper-Nicolai B. Savill J. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30530-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Other authors (21Porn-Ares M.I. Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have suggested that calpains are activated via caspase-mediated cleavage of calpastatin during initiation of apoptotic execution. Finally, the transcription factor p53 is cleaved by ubiquitous calpains, suggesting a link between calpain activation and p53-dependent apoptosis (22Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Here we report that the calcium ionophore ionomycin promotes apoptosis in LCLC 103H cells, a cell line derived from a human large cell lung carcinoma (23Bepler G. Koehler A. Kiefer P. Havemann K. Beisenherz K. Jaques G. Gropp C. Haeder M. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These cells represent an excellent system to study the effects of calcium increase induced by ionomycin, helping us to elucidate the pathways responsible for calcium-induced apoptosis. Human μCP was isolated from erythrocytes according to Ref. 24Gabrijelcic-Geiger D. Mentele R. Meisel B. Hinz H. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Möller A. Auerswald E.A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; mCP was supplied by Calbiochem. Recombinant Bcl-2 proteins were purified as described elsewhere. Actin was from ICN Biomedicals. The following antibodies were used: anti-mouse Bax, anti-cytochrome c, anti-human Bid (BD PharMingen), anti-PARP (Biomol), anti-human Bcl-xL (Kamiya Biomedical Co.), anti-human Bcl-2 (Dako), anti-caspase 8 (BD PharMingen), and anti-actin (Sigma). The fluorogenic substrates Ac-DEVD-amc and Suc-LLVY-amc were purchased from Bachem. AC27P was from Sigma; methylated Z-DEVD-fmk was from Alexis; and lactacystin was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. For routine cell culture RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 10% fetal calf sera (Sigma), 0.6%l-glutamine. Transfection was carried out using the FuGENETM 6 Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the general protocol suggested by the manufacturer but applying the following reagent ratios: 1 μg of DNA, 1.5 μl of FuGENETM 6 Reagent, 33 μl of serum-free RMPI 1640. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. LCLC 103H cells (DSMZ ACC 384), a clone stably expressing the chimeric protein histone H2A.i-ECFP, and LCLC 103H cells transiently overexpressing GFP (pNT-GFP, Invitrogen) were used in this study. When being subcultured, cells were lifted using a trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured on inner diameter 4.2-cm coverslips (Langenbrick) and treated with the indicated insult. For fluorescence microscopy, coverslips were mounted on POC chambers (PeCon), kept at 34–36 °C and 5% CO2 in the microscope (Axiovert S100 TV, Zeiss) equipped with objectives, Fluor 40/1.3 oil Ph2 and Neofluar 63/1.25 oil Ph3, filter wheels, and shutters (Ludl), Orca 4742-95 CCD camera (Hamamatsu), and controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision). Filter systems were from Chroma Technologies; GFP excitation 490/20 nm, beam splitter 505 nm, emission 535/40 nm; ECFP excitation 470/30 nm, beam splitter 470/50 nm + 565/80 nm, emission 560/30 nm. For presentation, images were contrast-enhanced and “false-colorized” with the OpenLab software. Total DNA was isolated (25McGahon A.J. Nishioka W.K. Martin S.J. Mahboubi A. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22625-22631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), separated on 2% agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation as described previously (26Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with sample buffer, heated for 2–5 min at 95 °C, and electrophoretically resolved on SDS-Tricine (16%) gels. Finally, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleichler & Schuell) and probed against the indicated antibodies. Antibody complexes were detected with anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG from New England Biolabs using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein content was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cytosolic proteins were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μm biotin-VAD-fmk (Enzyme System Products). After incubation, extracts were diluted to 0.5 μg/μl in 4-fold concentrated SDS-Tricine sample buffer. Electrophoresed samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin, and visualized by Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Recombinant Bcl-2 (4.2 μm), Bcl-xL (4.5 μm), Bid (4.8 μm), and actin (2.4 μm) were incubated with purified μCP or mCP for 1 h at room temperature at a 1:100 enzyme/substrate molar ratio in calpain assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmCaCl2). Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and iodoacetamide, separated on SDS-Tricine (16%) gels, and either visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Samples for Biacore experiments were prepared with a 1:10 molar calpain/protein ratio. The purified recombinant proteins and calpainolytic products were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing on a PROCISETM protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Mitochondria were isolated from rat heart according to the procedure described previously (28Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein content was estimated by preincubating an aliquot of this preparation with 5% Triton X-100, and thereby the released cytochrome c was assumed to represent the total mitochondrial cytochrome c content. To analyze cytochromec-releasing activity of intact and calpain-cleaved Bcl-2 proteins, aliquots of rat mitochondria corresponding to 15 μg of protein were incubated with 10 μl of the following samples prepared according to the calpainolysis protocol explained above: (i) Bcl-2 protein preincubated with Ca2+, (ii) μCP preincubated with Ca2+, and (iii) Bcl-2 protein preincubated with μCP and Ca2+, according to Ref. 29Stoka V.V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Bromme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V.V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3149-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar. The final protein concentrations are as follows: Bcl-2, 1.0 nm; Bcl-xL, 1.8 nm; and Bid, 10.1 nm. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with anti-cytochrome c antibody, and analyzed by densitometry (Scion Image). Interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins and their calpainolytic products were analyzed in a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB) essentially as described previously (30Xie Z. Reed J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 266-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-xL, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bid were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips via amine coupling (2000–4000 resonance units). Calpainolytic reaction mixtures of Bid, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were prepared as described above, except that after addition of EDTA the pH was adjusted to 6.0 (Bcl-2) or 7.5 (Bid, Bcl-xL) and diluted 8-fold with running buffer (50 mm acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 4.0 for Bcl-xL and Bid, 50 mm phosphate, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 6.4 for Bcl-2). Analytes (70 μl at 0.5–2.0 μm) were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Sensorgrams of ethanolamine blanks were used for subtraction of changes in the bulk refractive index. Between sample injections, the sensor chips were regenerated with 50 mm phosphate (pH 6.8) and 4 mguanidine HCl. The sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Calpain- or caspase-like activities in whole cells were measured with the fluorogenic substrates Suc-LLVY-amc (160 μm) or Ac-DEVD-amc (200 μm), respectively. The substrates ionomycin, etoposide, and AC27P were mixed in the appropriate HEPES-buffered serum-free growth media. LCLC 103H cells were plated on 24-well plates (105 cells/well) and preincubated with the substrate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Substrate hydrolysis at 37 °C was monitored using a fluorescence reading system (Fluoroskan ascent) set to 355 ± 20 nm for excitation and 460 ± 20 nm for emission. Fluorescence readings were collected every 5 min (up to 400 min), before and after addition of ionomycin, and after preincubation of the cells for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μm AC27P or 20 μm of Z-DEVD-fmk. Cell viability was assessed by flow cytometry simultaneously monitoring annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake. LCLC 103H cells were plated on inner diameter 10-cm culture plates and treated at 37 °C with the indicated inhibitor/insult, resuspended in 2 ml of annexin V binding buffer, and finally treated with annexin V-fluorescein and propidium iodide (9:1) for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescence of 20000 cells was measured with a FACS-Calibur Sort (BD PharMingen) through a 530/30 bandpass filter to monitor annexin-fluorescein-phosphatidylserine binding and through a 585/42 filter to monitor propidium iodide uptake. Free calcium concentrations in LCLC 103H cells were determined before and after adding 2 μm ionomycin. These measurements and the calibration of Fura-2 fluorescence was performed according to standard protocols (31Hafner M. Petzelt C. Nobiling R. Pawley J.B. Kramp D. Schatten G. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 9: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded for 1 h with 5 μm Fura-2 AM diluted in FluoronicR F-127. Coverslips were rinsed with a solution containing 20 mmHEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, placed in an imaging chamber, and mounted in a platform at 37 °C on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot. Fura-2 was excited at alternating wavelengths of 340- and 380-nm using a 75-watt xenon light source and a filter wheel (Ludl). Emitted wavelengths passed through a 510-nm filter cube set before detection by an enhanced CCD camera. Saturating calcium concentrations were measured after rinsing and preincubation of the cells with a solution of 10 mm CaCl2 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5.6 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and two subsequent additions of 2 μm ionomycin with 5-min interval between them. After that, absence of calcium was measured by adding 2 ml of 80 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. Data were stored and processed using the IonWizard software. In the course of calpain localization studies, we observed that LCLC 103H cells overexpressing the catalytic subunit of μ-calpain rapidly underwent cell death after treatment with ionomycin (not shown). To monitor this process in cells not overexpressing calpain, we labeled LCLC 103H cells transiently with GFP or stably with a histone-ECFP chimera. The first signs of ionomycin-induced cell death were detected 3 h after addition of the ionophore. We observed typical hallmarks of apoptosis, including cell blebbing and fragmentation, which were prevented for 24 h by preincubation with the selective calpain inhibitor AC27P (Fig. 1, A and B). Untreated cells overexpressing GFP (Fig. 1C) or the chimeric-ECFP protein (not shown) were not impaired in their vitality, ruling out that ectopic expression of either protein is cytotoxic for this cell line. Addition of 2 μm ionomycin to LCLC 103H cells caused an instantaneous increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration from 50 to 180 nm (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, calcium concentrations were raised transiently to 0.8–1.5 μm. Concomitantly, calpains were activated, as reflected by almost a double increase of Suc-LLVY-amc cleavage inhibited by AC27P (Fig.1E). In addition, nuclear condensation was detected in the histone-ECFP-labeled cells 3 h after addition of ionomycin (Fig.2A), and it was inhibited by preincubation with AC27P (Fig. 2C). DNA and protein analysis in ionomycin-treated cultures revealed DNA fragmentation (Fig.2D) and PARP cleavage to an 85-kDa fragment typical of caspase-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2F). The same observations were made in etoposide-treated LCLC 103H cells (Fig. 2B) and in COS 7 cells after ionomycin addition (Fig. 2E), suggesting an apoptotic process, although its onset was delayed in comparison to ionomycin-treated LCLC 103H cells. These findings demonstrate that ionomycin induces apoptosis in these cells in a calpain-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis of fluorescein-labeled annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake were used to quantify early apoptotic cells. Three hours after addition of ionomycin, the percentage of early apoptotic cells approximately doubles (Fig.3A). Necrosis could be detected in ∼1–5% of the ionomycin-treated cells (not shown) as supported by simultaneously positive fluorescein labeling and propidium iodide uptake. Apoptosis of LCLC 103H cells was inhibited by preincubation with AC27P or the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk. In contrast, apoptosis could not be prevented by preincubation of cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Caspase activation in whole cells was followed by monitoring the increase in activity against Ac-DEVD-amc following ionomycin treatment. In addition, we evaluated the effect of preincubating the cells with either AC27P or Z-DEVD-fmk (Fig. 3B). Cleavage of Ac-DEVD-amc predominantly reflects the activity of executioner caspase-3, although other caspases may also contribute to the increase in activity (32Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase activation occurs 3 h after ionomycin treatment and is inhibited to a similar extent by AC27P and by Z-DEVD-fmk. To delineate more completely the spectrum of caspases activated in LCLC 103H cells, cytosolic extracts were incubated with the affinity label biotin-VAD-fmk. Three discrete bands termed I (∼35 kDa), II (∼25 kDa), and III (∼17 kDa) were detected 3 h after the addition of 2 μm ionomycin (Fig. 3C). The use of antisera to detect cleavage of caspases-3, -7, and -9 is indicative of activation but is not definitive because all of the active enzymes are expected to be complexed in vivo by members of the IAP family of caspase inhibitors (33Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 34Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to use a more direct assay for the activity of individual caspases. The mobility of the large subunits of active caspases detected via biotin labeling was compared with the mobility of the corresponding subunits of recombinant human caspases (Fig. 3C). In SDS-Tricine gels, the lower band III migrates as the large subunit of the executioner caspase-3, with band II migrating similar to both recombinant caspases-7 and -8. Finally, band I is consistent with alternatively processed caspase-9 (equivalent to the 35-kDa band seen in Ref. 35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). No active caspases were detected in cytosol from either untreated or AC27P-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Faint bands of higher molecular masses were also observed and either represent zymogens with slight activity (36Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and/or the 37-kDa band seen for processed caspase-9 in Ref. 35Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar. We could not detect caspase-8 processing and therefore no mature enzyme in any of the lysates (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate that ionomycin treatment is associated with activation of multiple caspases via the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and furthermore strongly suggest that caspases-3, -7, and -9 are activated downstream of calpain after ionomycin treatment. During ionomycin-induced cell death we observed a marked release of cytochrome c from mitochondria 3 h after addition of the ionophore (Fig.4A). Similar amounts of cytochrome c were released upon treatment of the cells with 68 μm etoposide. In contrast, no cytoplasmic cytochromec was detected either in lysates from wild type LCLC 103H cells or in cells preincubated with AC27P before addition of ionomycin. Next, we aimed to identify calpain substrates associated with the observed cell death processes. We had described previously (37Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that caspases-3 and -9 are not directly activated by calpain, yet another report (38Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez de Buitrago G. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) concluded that calpains are able to activate procaspase-7 in apoptosis during clonal expansion of B cells. In our hands, low μ-calpain concentrations produced limited cleavage of recombinant procaspase-7, truncating its N terminus at positions Phe-36 and Met-45 (Phe-129 and Met-138 in the caspase-1 numbering system). However, these cleavages are irrelevant for generation of an active caspase, as revealed in the recent structures of human procaspase-7 (39Chai J., Wu, Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Cell. 2001; 107: 399-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Riedl S.J. Fuentes-Prior P. Renatus M. Kairies N. Krapp S. Huber R. Salvensen G.S. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14790-14795Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); and accordingly no activity against the caspase-7 substrate Ac-DEVD-amc was observed (not shown). At higher calpain concentrations both caspase-3 and -7 zymogens were completely degraded, and at no time was caspase activity detected (not shown). In the absence of evidence for direct caspase processing, we explored whether calpains could cleave mitochondrial regulators of cytochromec release, particularly members of the Bcl-2 family. Indeed, we noted differences in the concentrations of endogenous Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bid, and Bax during ionomycin-induced cell death in LCLC 103H cells (Fig. 4B). Two hours after ionomycin treatment, the cytosolic amounts of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLdecreased remarkably. Only 1 h later intact Bcl-2 could no longer be detected, and intact Bcl-xL as well as Bid were diminished, whereas no Bax was degraded up to 3 h. Ionomycin-induced Bcl-2 and Bid decrease was prevented by preincubation with AC27P. Curiously, the intensity of the Bcl-2 band was highest in cells pretreated with AC27P, suggesting that this calpain inhibitor stimulates Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous reports (41Ray S.K.

In this study, we have used fluorescence microscopy to probe the intracellular targeting of Epac during different stages of the cell division cycle and the structural features that are important for Epac localization. Our results suggest Epac, endogenous or expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein, is mainly localized to the nuclear membrane and mitochondria during interphase in COS-7 cells. Deletion mutagenesis analysis reveals that whereas the DEP domain is responsible for membrane association, the mitochondrial-targeting sequence is located at the N terminus. Although Epac predominantly exhibits perinuclear localization in interphase, the subcellular localization of Epac is cell cycle-dependent. Epac disassociates from the nuclear membrane and localizes to the mitotic spindle and centrosomes in metaphase. At the end of the cell cycle, Epac is observed to reassociate with the nuclear envelope and concentrate around the contractile ring. Furthermore, overexpression of Epac in COS-7 cells leads to an increase in multinuclear cell populations. These results suggest that Epac may play an important role in mitosis.

These results suggest that Epac may play an important role in mitosis. cAMP-dependent protein kinase exchange protein directly activated by cAMP cAMP-binding domain guanine nucleotide exchange factors Ras-proximate green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP phosphate-buffered saline Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin domain fluorescein isothiocyanate Cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) is the first intracellular second messenger to be discovered and plays an important role in mediating the actions of extracellular signals (1Rall T.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP has been implicated in regulating a myriad of cellular functions such as metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, secretion, and gene expression. For many years, the consensus was that cAMP-mediated signaling in eukaryotic cells existed as a linear pathway that involves the sequential activation of a series of signaling molecules. The cAMP signaling pathway consists of both plasma membrane and intracellular components. Upon binding of ligand, the membrane receptor at the cell surface transduces an extracellular signal across the cell membrane via stimulatory or inhibitory heterotrimeric G-proteins that interact with the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase to regulate cAMP production inside the cell. It was believed until recently that all known effects of cAMP in mammalian cells, with the exception of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in photoreceptor cells and olfactory sensory neurons (2Zufall F. Shepherd G.M. Barnstable C.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were mediated intracellularly by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).1The effects of cAMP on different cellular functions are often described as cell type-specific and dependent on biological response (3Grave L.M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These differential effects of cAMP on various cell functions suggest that more than one cAMP receptor may exist in mammalian cells. The search for a new cAMP receptor has recently revealed a novel class of signaling molecules, Epacs (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP) or cAMP-GEFs (cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors), which can directly mediate the effects of cAMP intracellularly (11de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Like PKA, Epacs contain a regulatory cAMP-binding domain (CBD) that is homologous to the evolutionarily conserved CBD of Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein. However, unlike PKA, in which regulatory and catalytic components are encoded by two separate genes, the CBD of Epac is directly fused with the catalytic component, the GEF domain as a single polypeptide chain, in a manner similar to that of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. It is most likely that the CBD folds upon the GEF domain and prevents its interaction with downstream effectors. Binding of cAMP to Epac leads to a conformational change exposing the GEF domain, which in turn activates downstream targets. Although activated by the common second messenger cAMP, Epac and PKA have been shown to mediate opposing effects on protein kinase B (PKB) activation. The net outcome of cAMP signaling on PKB activation may be dependent upon the dynamic abundance and distribution of intracellular Epac and PKA (13Mei F.C. Qiao J. Taygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These results suggest the observed cell type-specific effects of cAMP can be partially explained by differential expression/distribution of Epac and PKA in different tissues/cells.Epac/cAMP-GEF was initially cloned as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 (Ras-proximate), a small GTPase that shares greater than 50% identity with Ras (11de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N.

Oncogene. 1998; 3: 201-204Google Scholar). Rap1 and Ras are identical in the regions of the GTP-binding domain and the putative “effector” domain, suggesting Rap1 can interact with the same set of downstream effectors as Ras (15Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rap1 can act as a suppressor of the Ras oncogene (16Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that Rap1 functionsin vivo as a Ras antagonist (17Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, more recent evidence points to an alternative situation in which Rap1 assumes distinct intracellular localizations and affects different signaling pathways (10Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 19Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5909-5912Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of Epac are not clear at present, as one of the upstream regulators of Rap1 Epac may also be targeted to specific subcellular locations for its biological functions. Therefore, one of the keys to unlocking the mystery of Epac functions may lie in its specific cellular localization. In this study, we have probed the subcellular localization of Epac using fluorescence microscopy to address several fundamental questions regarding the physiological functions of Epac. These include the following. Where is Epac localized inside the cell for its cellular functions? What structural elements are responsible for the specific subcellular targeting of Epac? What are the roles of Epac in mediating the diverse cellular functions of cAMP in vivo?DISCUSSIONIntracellular signal transduction pathways consist of a complex network of interacting molecular switches, such as protein kinases and small GTPases. Many of these molecular switches belong to structurally and evolutionarily related protein superfamilies and share common upstream activators or downstream effectors. A fundamental question regarding intracellular signal transduction is how these seemingly similar signaling molecules maintain their specificity and exert their distinct physiological functions in vivo. Subcellular targeting has been proposed as a potential mechanism by which signaling molecules can maintain biological specificity, in part through assuming distinct cellular localization/co-localization inside the cells. There they can be accessed in an orderly fashion by upstream activators and, in turn, gain access to specific downstream targets. This specific targeting mechanism of intracellular signaling molecules allows optimal control of the flow of intracellular signal transduction in a temporal and spatial manner (24Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Modulation of in vivofunctions of PKA by a class of structurally diverse protein kinase A anchoring proteins exemplified the importance of this targeting mechanism in controlling the function and specificity of signaling molecules (25Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the subcellular targeting mechanism of Epac may be critical for elucidating its biological functions.Using C-terminal, GFP-tagged Epac fusion proteins, we have shown that Epac proteins are associated with the nuclear envelope and mitochondria in COS-7 cells in interphase. These observations were further confirmed by an independent approach, i.e. an immunofluorescent technique probing the localization of endogenous Epac using affinity-purified, Epac-specific antibodies. The results suggest that tagging of GFP at the C terminus did not affect the specific cellular targeting of Epac, which validated our strategy of using GFP fusion proteins to probe the subcellular localization of Epac. There are several advantages in using GFP-based fluorescent assays for monitoring subcellular localization of Epac. The exact subcellular localization of the Epac can be followed continuously in living cells. Potential translocalization of Epac in response to cAMP stimulation can also be examined. Furthermore, this technique does not require additional manipulations. This simplicity eliminates the chance of introducing possible artifacts associated with fixation and staining.Deletion of the first 148 N-terminal amino acids completely abolishes Epac's nuclear membrane and mitochondrial localization whereas Δ(72–148)Epac-GFP, which lacks the DEP domain, only affects the Epac nuclear membrane association. These results suggest the DEP domain is responsible for the Epac membrane association as implicated previously (20de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) while the mitochondrial targeting sequence is located at the N-terminal. The association of Epac with mitochondria is of particular interest, because PSORT analysis predicted Epac as a mitochondrion-associated protein with a mitochondrial presequence at its N-terminal (26Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Although mitochondrial targeting signals share no apparent sequence homology, the precursors of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, in general, have distinct N-terminal presequences rich in positively charged residues, especially arginine and hydroxylated amino acids. In addition, these presequences also tend to form amphipathic α-helices or β-sheets (27Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 C, there are six Arg and six Ser/Thr residues within the first 37 amino acids at the N-terminal of Epac, while there is only one acidic residue (Glu) in this segment. A mitochondrial presequence cleavage site at position 32 is also predicted, based on Gavel analysis, because the N-terminal Epac amino acid sequence contains a well characterized mitochondrial targeting peptide cleavage site motif with conserved arginines at −2 and −10 positions (28Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Although the physiological significance of the association of Epac with mitochondria requires further investigation, the connection between cAMP and mitochondria has been established for decades. Adenylate cyclase has been reported to localize in mitochondria (29Sulimovivi S. Lunenfeld B. FEBS Lett. 1974; 41: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Fine A.S. Egnor R.W. Forrester E. Stahl S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that cAMP can be transported into mitochondria and accumulated in the matrix (31Kulinskii V.I. Zobova N.V. Biokhimiya. 1985; 50: 1546-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Both PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and enzymatic activity have also been detected in mitochondria (32Dimino M.J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, several A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) have been cloned and identified to target PKA specifically to mitochondrial subcompartments (36Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 37Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochim. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These results suggest cAMP plays an intimate role in mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, GTP-binding proteins, including Rap1, have been reported in mitochondria (40Kim S. Mizoguchi A. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Thomson M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial localization of Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor directly regulated by cAMP, suggests Epac can potentially facilitate cAMP functions by directly connecting cAMP signaling with downstream GTPases in mitochondria.Although Epac was originally cloned as an upstream activator for Rap1, experimental evidence is beginning to emerge that Epac may process cellular functions in addition to activating Rap1 (42Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Our studies further suggest that Epac is localized to the mitotic spindle in metaphase and associated with the nuclear membrane in interphase. In addition, cAMP likely play a role in regulating the subcellular targeting of Epac, because high intracellular cAMP concentrations promote membrane association of Epac and low cAMP levels favor interaction with microtubules. These observations are consistent with the theory that cAMP concentration is lowest in metaphase where Epac is associated with the mitotic spindle and increases at the transition between mitosis and interphase where Epac is mainly located on the nuclear and cell membranes. Recent studies by Beaudouin et al. (43Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and Salina et al. (44Salina D. Bodoor K. Eckley D.M. Schroer T.A. Rattner J.B. Burke B. Cell. 2002; 108: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) suggest that microtubules in conjunction with dynein, a cytoplasmic motor protein, are responsible for the nuclear envelope disassembly/assembly during cell division. In light of these findings, our observation that Epac is associated with the mitotic spindle and nuclear membrane in a cell cycle-dependent manner suggests Epac may play an important role in coordinating the fundamental cellular processes of microtubule/motor-driven transport and organelle partition into daughter cells during mitosis. Cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) is the first intracellular second messenger to be discovered and plays an important role in mediating the actions of extracellular signals (1Rall T.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol.

Adenylate cyclase has been reported to localize in mitochondria (29Sulimovivi S. Lunenfeld B. FEBS Lett. 1974; 41: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Fine A.S. Egnor R.W. Forrester E. Stahl S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that cAMP can be transported into mitochondria and accumulated in the matrix (31Kulinskii V.I. Zobova N.V. Biokhimiya. 1985; 50: 1546-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Both PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and enzymatic activity have also been detected in mitochondria (32Dimino M.J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, several A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) have been cloned and identified to target PKA specifically to mitochondrial subcompartments (36Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These results suggest cAMP plays an intimate role in mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, GTP-binding proteins, including Rap1, have been reported in mitochondria (40Kim S. Mizoguchi A. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Thomson M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial localization of Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor directly regulated by cAMP, suggests Epac can potentially facilitate cAMP functions by directly connecting cAMP signaling with downstream GTPases in mitochondria.Although Epac was originally cloned as an upstream activator for Rap1, experimental evidence is beginning to emerge that Epac may process cellular functions in addition to activating Rap1 (42Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Our studies further suggest that Epac is localized to the mitotic spindle in metaphase and associated with the nuclear membrane in interphase. In addition, cAMP likely play a role in regulating the subcellular targeting of Epac, because high intracellular cAMP concentrations promote membrane association of Epac and low cAMP levels favor interaction with microtubules. These observations are consistent with the theory that cAMP concentration is lowest in metaphase where Epac is associated with the mitotic spindle and increases at the transition between mitosis and interphase where Epac is mainly located on the nuclear and cell membranes. Recent studies by Beaudouin et al. (43Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and Salina et al. (44Salina D. Bodoor K. Eckley D.M. Schroer T.A. Rattner J.B. Burke B. Cell. 2002; 108: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) suggest that microtubules in conjunction with dynein, a cytoplasmic motor protein, are responsible for the nuclear envelope disassembly/assembly during cell division. In light of these findings, our observation that Epac is associated with the mitotic spindle and nuclear membrane in a cell cycle-dependent manner suggests Epac may play an important role in coordinating the fundamental cellular processes of microtubule/motor-driven transport and organelle partition into daughter cells during mitosis. Intracellular signal transduction pathways consist of a complex network of interacting molecular switches, such as protein kinases and small GTPases. Many of these molecular switches belong to structurally and evolutionarily related protein superfamilies and share common upstream activators or downstream effectors. A fundamental question regarding intracellular signal transduction is how these seemingly similar signaling molecules maintain their specificity and exert their distinct physiological functions in vivo. Subcellular targeting has been proposed as a potential mechanism by which signaling molecules can maintain biological specificity, in part through assuming distinct cellular localization/co-localization inside the cells. There they can be accessed in an orderly fashion by upstream activators and, in turn, gain access to specific downstream targets. This specific targeting mechanism of intracellular signaling molecules allows optimal control of the flow of intracellular signal transduction in a temporal and spatial manner (24Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Modulation of in vivofunctions of PKA by a class of structurally diverse protein kinase A anchoring proteins exemplified the importance of this targeting mechanism in controlling the function and specificity of signaling molecules (25Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the subcellular targeting mechanism of Epac may be critical for elucidating its biological functions. Using C-terminal, GFP-tagged Epac fusion proteins, we have shown that Epac proteins are associated with the nuclear envelope and mitochondria in COS-7 cells in interphase. These observations were further confirmed by an independent approach, i.e. an immunofluorescent technique probing the localization of endogenous Epac using affinity-purified, Epac-specific antibodies. The results suggest that tagging of GFP at the C terminus did not affect the specific cellular targeting of Epac, which validated our strategy of using GFP fusion proteins to probe the subcellular localization of Epac. There are several advantages in using GFP-based fluorescent assays for monitoring subcellular localization of Epac. The exact subcellular localization of the Epac can be followed continuously in living cells. Potential translocalization of Epac in response to cAMP stimulation can also be examined. Furthermore, this technique does not require additional manipulations. This simplicity eliminates the chance of introducing possible artifacts associated with fixation and staining. Deletion of the first 148 N-terminal amino acids completely abolishes Epac's nuclear membrane and mitochondrial localization whereas Δ(72–148)Epac-GFP, which lacks the DEP domain, only affects the Epac nuclear membrane association. These results suggest the DEP domain is responsible for the Epac membrane association as implicated previously (20de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) while the mitochondrial targeting sequence is located at the N-terminal. The association of Epac with mitochondria is of particular interest, because PSORT analysis predicted Epac as a mitochondrion-associated protein with a mitochondrial presequence at its N-terminal (26Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Although mitochondrial targeting signals share no apparent sequence homology, the precursors of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, in general, have distinct N-terminal presequences rich in positively charged residues, especially arginine and hydroxylated amino acids. In addition, these presequences also tend to form amphipathic α-helices or β-sheets (27Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 C, there are six Arg and six Ser/Thr residues within the first 37 amino acids at the N-terminal of Epac, while there is only one acidic residue (Glu) in this segment. A mitochondrial presequence cleavage site at position 32 is also predicted, based on Gavel analysis, because the N-terminal Epac amino acid sequence contains a well characterized mitochondrial targeting peptide cleavage site motif with conserved arginines at −2 and −10 positions (28Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).

Genetic studies in species ranging fromXenopus to human point to a crucial role for T-box genes in controlling development in a gene dose-dependent manner. This is clearly illustrated by two human syndromes that lead to multiple developmental abnormalities and that are characterized by both patterning defects and hypoplasia: Holt-Oram syndrome and Ulnar-Mammary syndrome. These syndromes are associated with haplo-insufficiency ofTBX5 and TBX3, respectively (4Bamshad M. Lin R.C. Law D.J. Watkins W.C. Krakowiak P.A. Moore M.E. Franceschini P. Lala R. Holmes L.B.

Although data on the functions of the steadily growing family of T-box genes are now emerging, relatively little is known about T-box gene targets and the molecular mechanism underlying specific gene regulation by individual T-box genes. In vitro site selection experiments with Brachyury, the founder of the T-box gene family, revealed the preference for a palindromic sequence (6Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure showed that the Brachyury T-box binds this so-called T-site as a dimer (7Müller C.W. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Of all T-box genes only three, TBX2,TBX3 and Xenopus ET, are currently known to be transcriptional repressors, probably acting via a putative repression domain (8Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9He M.I. Wen L. Campbell C.E., Wu, J.Y. Rao Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TBX2 was shown to act on the melanocyte-specific TRP-1 promoter, not by a regular T-site but by two T-half-sites located 200 bp apart (8Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Also for otherin vivo T-box targets a picture is now emerging in which they are controlled by separate T-half-sites. We recently found TBX2 in a genetic senescence bypass screen to potently down-regulate the p19ARF tumor suppressor, thereby causing efficient immortalization of primary fibroblasts (10Jacobs J.J.L.

DePinho R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Both of these cell cycle inhibitors and tumor suppressors are implicated in cancer-relevant pathways; p16INK4a acts to inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, thereby preventing inactivating phosphorylation on the Rb tumor suppressor protein (13Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar,14Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), whereas p19ARF acts in the p53 pathway (reviewed in Refs. 15Sherr C.J.

Induction of p19ARF upon serial passaging of rodent cells leads via MDM2 to a stable and transcriptionally active p53, which by activating its targets can lead to a growth arrest called replicative senescence. P19ARF is also induced upon hyperproliferative signaling by oncogenes such as c-myc and adenoviruses E1A, E2F-1, andRas V12 (17Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J.

In accordance with the important cancer-preventing role of p19ARF , deregulation of many of thesep19ARF transcriptional regulators has been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis. For instance overexpression of Bmi-1, a member of the Polycomb-group of repressor proteins, results in lymphomagenesis and likely contributes to several human malignancies (29Alkema M.J.

Here we have studied the mechanism and cis-requirements for repression ofp14 ARF /p19 ARF as abona fide TBX2 and TBX3 target and found that TBX2 and TBX3 are direct and specific regulators acting via a variant T-site that is present close to the p14 ARF transcriptional start site. We performed cell culturing of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), retroviral infections, growth curves, and 3T3 schedules as described (10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P.

The latter two constructs, the T-box mutants, were generated by PCR and verified by sequencing. For protein expression analysis, cell lysates were separated on 9% (for TBX2 levels) or 13% (for p19ARF levels) SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis was done according to standard methods using enhanced chemiluminesence (AmershamBiosciences). Primary antibodies were R562 (Abcam) for p19ARF, 12CA5 for HA-tagged TBX1A, and rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal α-TBX2 antibodies (10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P.

COS-7 cells were co-transfected at 40% confluency by calcium phosphate precipitation with 20 μg of reporter plasmid and 0–1 μg of expression plasmid. The TBX2 constructs, TBX2, TBX2RD, TBX2TB(R122E, R123E), and TBX2TB(A272E), were expressed from pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), TBX1A-HA from pCMV, Xbra from pEGFP-C1 (32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and E2F1 from pCMV. For the p14 ARF promoter, the original CAT reporter constructs described by Robertson and Jones (28Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6457-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) were used. In addition we used the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) in which we recloned a HindIII/SalI fragment containing the wild-type (−19/+54) p14 ARF promoter insert. To circumvent problems with low reporter activity,p14 ARF reporters with double (−19/+54) inserts were used because these constructs are more active than those with single inserts (data not shown). Mutants of the T-site were generated by PCR and sequence-verified. The HSV tk reporter was constructed as described (32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Into the SmaI site of this construct the same double-stranded oligos as used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)1(see below) were cloned, resulting in a construct with two Brachyury consensus binding sites (B), two variant T-sites (+9/+29), two mutant variant T-sites (+9/+29mut), or one variant T-site including flanking sequences (−14/+35). All transfections contained equal amounts of pCDNA3.1 and included 1 μg of pSV β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) as an internal transfection control. CAT, luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 h after transfection by standard methods. All transfections were performed in duplicate, and at least two independent experiments were done to confirm reproducibility. Whole cell extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with expression vectors (pCDNA3.1) for TBX2, TBX2RD, TBX2TB(R122E, R123E), TBX2TB(A272E), TBX3, L143P TBX3, or Y149S TBX3 or from ARF−/− MEFs infected with LZRS-iresGFP, LZRS-TBX2-iresGFP, or LZRS-TBX2RD-iresGFP retroviruses as described (33Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed with double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes, cell extracts, antibodies, and competitor oligos as described (8Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. Oligonucleotides used (complementary strand not shown) were: +9/+29, 5′-CTGCTCACCTCTGGTGCCAAA-3′; +9/+29mut, 5′-CTGCTTGACTCTAAGTCCAAA-3′; −14/+35, 5′-AGTTAAGGGGGCAGGAGTGGCGCTGCTCACCTCTGGTGCCAAAGGGCGG-3′; B, 5′-GGGAATTTCACACCTAGGTGTGAAATTCCCT-3′; and E2F, 5′-AATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA-3′. T-site mutations for probe –14/+35 are described in Fig. 2 B. Probe −19/+54 was generated by PCR with primers 5′-GAGCTCGGCAGCCGCTGCGCCGCCCTTTGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-TCTGCAGTTAAGGGGGCAGG-3′. To investigate the role of the T-box domain of TBX2 in mediating p19 ARF repression, we made two point mutants, TBX2TB(R122E,R123E) and TBX2TB(A272E). These mutations were designed based on the crystal structure of the T-box domain of Brachyury in complex with a consensus T-site (7Müller C.W. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and were predicted to disrupt DNA binding. In previous work we showed that TBX2 rescues MEFs from senescence and leads to their immortalization (10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition, the high p19ARF levels inBmi−/− MEFs due to abrogation of Polycomb repression of the INK4a/ARF locus is efficiently reduced by even low levels of TBX2, resulting in immortalization of these prematurely senescent fibroblasts (27Jacobs J.J.L. Kieboom K. Marino S. DePinho R.A. van Lohuizen M. Nature. 1999; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). In contrast, mock-infected wild-type and Bmi−/− MEFs as well as cells infected with either one of the T-box mutants enter senescence at the same passage (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis revealed that both T-box mutants are expressed but show the same high levels of p19ARF as senescent cells, in sharp contrast to the severely down-regulated p19ARF levels in TBX2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1 B). Mutants of the T-box of TBX3 were also incapable of rescuing MEFs from senescence, as opposed to the readily immortalizing wild-type protein (11Brummelkamp T.R. Kortlever R.M. Lingbeek M. Trettel F. MacDonald M.E. van Lohuizen M. Bernards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6567-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This indicates an essential role for the conserved T-box domain inp19 ARF repression. In our previous study a deletion mutant of TBX2 lacking the repression domain (TBX2RD) proved to be impaired in repressingp19 ARF , although it still can to some extent down-regulate p19ARF, probably because of relatively higher expression levels (Ref. 10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 D; also see discussion below). Here we show that this residual activity also induces a prolonged life span of Bmi−/− MEFs, which have highp19 ARF levels. However these cells still arrest at later passages. This indicates that TBX2RD is not sufficient to fully bypass senescence (Fig. 1 C) and demonstrates that the repression domain also is a critical contributor top19 ARF repression. Deletion constructs of the human p14 ARF promoter transfected to COS-7 cells revealed that TBX2 and TBX3 act as strong dose-dependent repressors through an element located in the region of –19 to +54 (10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6567-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This repression was found to be dependent on the repression domain of TBX2 (10Jacobs J.J.L. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In agreement with the data described above, TBX2TB(R122E,R123E) is incapable of and TBX2TBA272E is severely impaired in repressingp14 ARF , whereas both proteins could be detected readily by Western blot (Fig. 1, E and F). Although both the repression domain and the T-box domain are involved in mediating p19 ARF or p14 ARF repression, neither of the mutants appears to work as a dominant-negative in transient repression assays, i.e. we observed no competition with wild-type TBX2 or TBX3 forp14 ARF promoter repression (data not shown). To test whether the inactivating mutations of the T-box reflect impaired binding to thep14 ARF promoter we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Incubation of probe −14/+35, spanning part of the repressed region, with either TBX2- or TBX3-overexpressing COS-7 cell extracts resulted in a shifted complex that was not observed using mock-transfected extracts (Fig.2 A, lanes 1,2, 15, and 16). This complex does contain TBX2 because it is not affected by pre-immune serum but can be supershifted by rabbit polyclonal α-TBX2 antibody to a complex barely capable of entering the gel (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4). The same supershifts were observed with an independently generated mouse monoclonal α-TBX2 antibody (data not shown and Fig.2 E). The presence of such large aggregates upon antibody addition was noted before in case of TBX2 (32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The complex is specific because cold –14/+35 probe is able to compete the complex, whereas an unrelated E2F binding site oligo cannot do so (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 7). A probe containing a Brachyury consensus binding site that has been described to bind TBX2 (Ref. 8Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and our own unpublished observations), is also able to compete the complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). When overexpressing the repression domain mutant the complex with probe –14/+35 could still be formed and supershifted with α-TBX2 antibody, although less efficiently (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8–10). In contrast, both T-box mutants of TBX2 and TBX3 were unable to form a complex with probe –14/+35 either in the presence or absence of antibody (Fig.2 A, lanes 11–14 and 17–18). For TBX2TB(R122E, R123E) this is in agreement with the inability of a TBX2R122A mutant to bind a consensus T-site (32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The only elements present in the small promoter fragment ofp14 ARF that is still repressed by TBX2 are an initiator element and an inverse E2F site (28Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6457-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Although no consensus T-site is present, after a closer inspection of region –19 to +54 we identified a variant T-site matching 13 of 20 of the nucleotides of a consensus palindromic T-site (Fig. 2 B). In this variant T-site the T-half-sites are spaced one nucleotide apart but are orientated similarly as in the original consensus site. The possibility that this site is a functional T-site is strengthened by the fact that all four nucleotides marked as important DNA specificity determinants in the crystal structure of Brachyury in complex with a T-site are retained (Ref. 7Müller C.W. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Fig. 2 B), as are most of the nucleotides (9 of 12) that are selected in 85% of the cases of in vitrobinding site selection experiments with Brachyury (Ref. 6Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, Fig.2 B). Using EMSA, a TBX2-specific complex could be seen with probe +9/+29 (spanning this variant T-site) that could be supershifted with the rabbit polyclonal α-TBX2 antibody but was absent from mock-transfected lysates (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–4). The complex with probe +9/+29 appears to be formed less efficiently than with probe –14/+35, indicating that sequences outside of the +9/+29 probe might also contribute to DNA binding. The addition of α-TBX2 antibody appears to stabilize the complex (Fig.2 C, lane 4). Others have seen such a T-protein-DNA complex stabilization by antibodies as well in the case of Brachyury and Xbra (6Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast to probe –14/+35, the supershifted complex with probe +9/+29 migrates faster and yields a sharper band. The complex could be competed with cold +9/+29 oligo and a Brachyury consensus binding site but not with +9/+29mut in which critical nucleotides were mutated (Fig. 2 C, lanes 5–7). Moreover, when +9/+29mut was used (as probe), no complex in TBX2 overexpression extracts could be seen either in the presence or absence of α-TBX2 antibody, indicating that the mutated nucleotides are indeed involved in DNA binding (data not shown). The repression domain mutant was able to bind +9/+29 in the presence of α-TBX2 antibody, again indicating that DNA binding ability of this mutant apparently is weaker and that α-TBX2 antibody stabilizes this complex (Fig. 2 C, lanes 8 and 9). As expected, the T-box mutant proteins are incapable of binding the variant T-site (Fig. 2 C, lanes 10–13). To get a better insight into the requirements for DNA binding by TBX2, we performed a more detailed mutagenesis of the variant T-site. We made a set of four mutants: two (14/+35CC and –14/+35GG) in which we mutated two nucleotides in either T-half-site, thereby leaving the other T-half-site intact; and two (−14/+35CCGG and –14/+35mut) in which we mutated both T-half-sites, respectively, by a four- or seven-nucleotide change (Fig. 2 B). When introduced into probe +9/+29 all mutations including those that disrupt only one half-site disrupted DNA binding (data not shown). However when introduced into the larger –14/+35 probe, only mutations disrupting both T-half-sites completely abolished DNA binding (Fig.2 D). In agreement with TBX2 being able to bind consensus T-half-sites (32Sinha S. Abraham S. Gronostajski R.M. Campbell C.E. Gene. 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we could still detect binding of TBX2 to mutants of either T-half-site, albeit with a lower efficiency. Moreover mutating the left T-half-site appears to disrupt DNA binding more severely than mutating the right T-half-site. Together, these results indicate that the core structure of T-sites is functionally conserved in the variant T-site and that additional sequences in probe –14/+35 contribute to the stability of the complex. In extracts of MEFs infected with TBX2 we were unable to detect a complex with p14 ARF promoter probes (Fig.2 E, lanes 1 and 2, 4and 5). Similar TBX2 binding detection problems have been observed previously (Ref. 8Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The detection problems are most likely due to masking by the multiple complexes that apparently are formed with the probe in these extracts, as in strong support of direct binding we could detect a large supershifted complex in TBX2-infected MEF cell extracts with both the rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal α-TBX2 antibody (Fig. 2 E, lane 3). Likewise, a somewhat faster migrating complex was observed with the repression domain mutant (Fig. 2 E, lane 6). The complex was absent when a probe containing the incomplete T-site was used (probe –12/+23, data not shown) or when non-TBX2-overexpressing MEFs were used (Fig. 2 E, lanes 9 and 10). In conclusion these EMSA experiments prove that TBX2 and TBX3 can directly bind p14 ARF promoter oligos that span a variant T-site. To prove that the variant T-site is the relevant site via which TBX2 and TBX3 mediate repression we mutated the site in (−19/+54) p14 ARF promoter-reporter constructs at exactly the same positions as those used in EMSAs. Because these mutations reside in the core promoter region, it was not surprising that substantial and progressive activity loss was observed. However, in agreement with the binding data obtained in EMSA, T-half-site mutants (−19/+54CC and −19/+54GG) could still be repressed by TBX2, whereas mutants in which both T-half-sites were disrupted (−19/+54CCGG and –19/+54mut) were insensitive to TBX2 even at a very high dose (Fig. 3 A). From this finding we not only conclude that mutating the variant T-site abolishes the repressive effect of TBX2, thereby proving that this is the relevant site, but also that TBX2 is able to bind and repress when only one half-site is intact. To further test whether TBX2 can mediate repression through a variant T-site, we made chimeric promoters consisting of the HSV tk promoter driving the luciferase gene, upstream, of which we cloned both the consensus and variant T-sites (Fig. 3 B). These constructs have been described previously as only being responsive to TBX2 when four"

At least two domains have been identified that mediate nuclear receptor interactions with coregulators. These are activation function 1 (AF1)1in the NH2-terminal region and activation function 2 (AF2) in the ligand binding domain. The AF2 binding surface in the ligand binding domain is comprised of helices 3, 4, and 12 and forms after hormone binding. For many nuclear receptors, transactivation depends on AF2 recruitment of p160 coactivator complexes that have histone acetyl transferase activity to modify chromatin structure (1Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The p160 coactivators are a group of proteins that include steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1), transcriptional intermediary protein 2 (TIF2, GRIP1 or SRC2), and the steroid receptor coactivator 3 subfamily (SRC3). Interaction with AF2 is mediated by the p160 coactivator LXXLL motif that forms an amphipathic α-helix and binds the AF2 hydrophobic binding surface in the nuclear receptor ligand binding domain (2Heery D.M.

Mutagenesis studies and mammalian two-hybrid and GST affinity matrix assays demonstrated that the FXXLF motif interacts in the presence of androgen with AF2 (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J.

However the site of interaction of the WXXLF motif was not determined, nor was it clear whether interaction of the WXXLF motif depends on androgen binding. In addition, previous studies made use of the MMTV luciferase reporter vector, which may direct transcription through mechanisms that differ from other androgen responsive enhancer/promoters. Here we show the functional importance of the AR N/C interaction using androgen responsive enhancer/promoter regions derived from the prostate specific antigen (PSA) and probasin genes. Use of these responsive regions allowed us to demonstrate, in addition, that the WXXLF motif inhibits recruitment of TIF2 by the AF2 region but less than does the FXXLF motif. Using a shorter NH2-terminal fragment than previously described (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we show that the WXXLF motif interacts in the presence of androgen with the AF2 region of the ligand binding domain. The data provide evidence that the AR N/C interaction is required for AR-mediated regulation of two androgen-dependent genes. The relatively high sequence conservation of the FXXLF and WXXLF motifs among species further supports the functional importance of the AR N/C interaction. GAL-peptide fusion proteins were constructed as described (15He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

The role of the WXXLF and FXXLF motifs and effects of TIF2 coactivation on luciferase activity were determined using wild-type AR (AR-FXXLF/WXXLF) or AR in which FXXLF was changed to FXXAA, WXXLF was changed to AXXAA, or both mutations were created in the same protein. AR transactivation of the PSA and probasin enhancer/promoter regions (Fig. 1 A) and the pGCΔ9 and MMTV promoters (Fig. 1 B) was increased 2–3-fold by TIF2 coexpression. Mutation of the FXXLF motif (AR-FXXAA/WXXLF) decreased to low levels transactivation of the PSA and probasin luciferase reporters in the absence of TIF2 coexpression (Fig. 1 A). This decrease in activity was recovered by coexpression of TIF2. In contrast, mutation of the FXXLF motif had no major effect on transactivation of the MMTV-Luc and pGCΔ9-Luc enhancer/promoters in the absence of TIF2 coexpression (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, mutation of the WXXLF motif alone (AR-FXXLF/AXXAA) increased the response of the PSA and probasin enhancer/promoters, which was increased further by TIF2 coexpression (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, mutation of WXXLF had relatively little effect on the response of MMTV-Luc and pGCΔ9-Luc (Fig. 1 B). Mutating both binding motifs (AR-FXXAA/AXXAA) decreased transactivation of the PSA and probasin enhancer/promoters, which was rescued by coexpression of TIF2 (Fig. 1 A), again with relatively little effect on the pGCΔ9 and MMTV promoters. The results indicate that in contrast to the pGCΔ9 and MMTV enhancer/promoters, androgen regulation of the PSA and probasin enhancer/promoter regions depends on the AR N/C interaction mediated by the FXXLF and WXXLF motifs in the presence of androgen. The increase in transactivation by mutating WXXLF alone suggests an inhibitory role of this motif in AR activity, whereas a decrease in transactivation by the FXXAA and FXXAA/AXXAA mutants indicates a strong requirement for the N/C interaction. The results are in agreement with the FXXLF motif primarily mediating the N/C interaction, whereas mutation of the WXXLF motif alone does not abolish the N/C interaction (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The detrimental effect on transactivation of losing the N/C interaction was recovered by TIF2 overexpression. The results support previous evidence from androgen insensitivity syndrome mutations (9Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) where the N/C interaction is critical for AR-mediated transactivation of androgen-dependent genes in vivo. We investigated further the inhibitory effect of the WXXLF motif in AR-mediated transactivation of the PSA enhancer/promoter by mutating the WXXLF and FXXLF binding motifs in an AR mutant in which the NH2-terminal AF1 residues 142–337 were deleted. Deletion of AF1 resulted in nearly background levels of activity in the absence or presence of TIF2 coexpression (Fig.2), indicating an important role for AF1 in AR-mediated transactivation. Introducing mutations into the FXXLF (AR-FXXAAΔ142–337) and FXXLF plus WXXLF motifs (AR-FXXAA/AXXAAΔ142–337) increased AR-mediated transactivation of the PSA61-Luc reporter in the absence and presence of TIF2 coexpression. When the WXXLF motif alone was mutated in the AF1 deletion mutant (AR-FXXLF/AXXAAΔ142–337, Fig.2), there was only a small increase in transactivation by TIF2. Essentially identical results were obtained using the probasin-Luc reporter (data not shown). We conclude that in the absence of AF1, both FXXLF and WXXLF motifs have a small inhibitory effect on AR transactivation in the absence of TIF2 coexpression. There was a synergistic inhibitory effect by both motifs, possibly reflecting inhibition of endogenous TIF2 coactivation through AF2 in the ligand binding domain. The greater level of TIF2-stimulated luciferase activity observed with the FXXLF mutant compared with the WXXLF mutant indicates that FXXLF more effectively inhibits AR-mediated gene activation by TIF2 than does WXXLF. The TIF2-stimulated increase in luciferase activity of the double mutant provides further evidence that the WXXLF motif contributes to inhibiting coactivation by TIF2 even though mutagenesis of the WXXLF motif itself did not effectively increase transactivation by TIF2. Enhancement of PSA and probasin luciferase activity observed with the WXXLF mutant alone (Fig. 1 A) appeared to depend on AF1 because the increase in activity was less apparent when the WXXLF mutant was combined in the AF1 deletion mutant. To evaluate further the requirement for the N/C interaction in transactivation of the PSA enhancer/promoter regionversus the MMTV promoter, we made use of a previously described GR chimera GR(LXXLL)3 in which an artificial N/C interaction was introduced (13He B. Bowen N.T. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42293-42301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GR(LXXLL)3 contains the 3 LXXLL motif region of TIF2 that interacts in the presence of dexamethasone with the GR ligand binding domain AF2 region and results in a 5-fold slower dissociation half-time of [3H]dexamethasone compared with wild-type GR. In the presence of 1 or 10 nm dexamethasone, GR stimulated the PSA (Fig.3 A) and probasin reporters (data not shown), and the MMTV (Fig. 3 B) and pGCΔ9 luciferase reporters (data not shown), with the weakest response from pGCΔ9. GR(LXXLL)3 caused greater ligand-induced transactivation of the PSA61-Luc reporter than did GR, or GR(LXXAA)3 in which the 3 LXXLL motifs were mutated to LXXAA (Fig. 3 A). Similar increases in gene activation by GR(LXXLL)3 were observed using the probasin-Luc and pGCΔ9-Luc reporters (data not shown). In contrast, response of the MMTV-luciferase reporter was similar for GR and the GR chimeras (Fig. 3 B). The results support observations above that transactivation of the androgen responsive enhancer/promoters from PSA and probasin depend on an agonist-induced N/C interaction for optimal transactivation compared with the MMTV enhancer/promoter. The increased response of pGCΔ9-Luc to GR(LXXLL)3 suggests that it shares some properties of PSA and probasin response elements that are sensitive to the effects of an N/C interaction. We next investigated whether the increase in AR transactivation of PSA61-Luc (Fig.4 A) and probasin-Luc by TIF2 required TIF2 binding to the AF2 region of the ligand binding domain. In contrast to TIF2, TIF2m123, a mutant in which the 3 LXXLL motifs were changed to LXXAA, was unable to coactivate AR or the AR N/C interaction mutants using the PSA61-Luc reporter (Fig.4 A). Transactivation in the presence of TIF2m123 was less than the control without TIF2 coexpression. Similar results were observed using the probasin and MMTV-Luc reporters (data not shown). The data suggest that coactivation by TIF2 of each of the enhance/promoters requires interaction of the TIF2 LXXLL motifs with the AR AF2 region and that TIF2m123 acts to a limited extent as a dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous TIF2. The lack of coactivation by TIF2m123 suggests, in addition, that an interaction between other regions of TIF2 and the AR NH2-terminal region (10He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H.

A specific role for AF2 in AR transactivation of the PSA61-Luc reporter by TIF2 was investigated using two AR AF2 mutants. Lysine 720 in helix 3 of the ligand binding domain is critical for TIF2 coactivator LXXLL motif binding, but not for the binding of the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Glutamic acid 897 in helix 12 of the ligand binding domain is required for both TIF2 LXXLL motif binding and the N/C interactions (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). AR-FXXLF/WXXLF-K720A did not decrease AR-mediated transactivation of the PSA61-Luc reporter in the absence of TIF2 expression but blocked coactivation by TIF2 (Fig. 4 B). AR-FXXLF/WXXLF-E897K reduced inherent AR activity and blocked coactivation by TIF2. Furthermore, AR transactivation was not stimulated by TIF2 when AR had either of these AF2 mutations and where the N/C interaction was interrupted by mutations in the FXXLF and WXXLF motifs. The results indicate that TIF2 coactivation of AR requires binding to AF2. Previously we used a GST affinity matrix assay to determine the effect of androgen on the interaction of the FXXLF and WXXLF motifs with the ligand binding domain. We demonstrated an androgen-dependent interaction of the FXXLF motif with AF2, but results with the WXXLF motif were inconclusive (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Extensive binding in the absence of androgen of a 233-amino acid AR·GST fusion peptide containing the WXXLF motif raised the possibility that some of the binding was nonspecific (14He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared a fusion peptide with a shorter sequence containing the WXXLF motif. GST·AR-(412–460) bound 3-fold higher levels of 35S-labeled AR ligand binding domain residues 624–919 in the presence than in the absence of DHT (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and5). In addition, mutation of residues LF to AA in the WXXLF motif in GST·AR-(412–460)WXXAA eliminated the androgen-dependent interaction (Fig.5 A, lanes 6 and 7). The results indicate that the WXXLF motif binds the AR ligand binding domain in an androgen-dependent manner. The predicted amphipathic α-helical structure of the WXXLF sequence and the hormone dependence of its interaction with the ligand binding domain suggested that the WXXLF motif interacts with the AF2 binding surface. We tested a series of AF2 mutants that were shown previously to decrease or eliminate TIF2 LXXLL motif binding (4Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G.

AR AF2 mutations E897K, V716R and K720A introduced into the 35S-labeled ligand binding domain each reduced or eliminated androgen-dependent binding of GST·AR-(412–460) (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9–22). Signal intensity of the wild-type control in the presence of androgen was 2-, 3-, and 4.5-fold greater than that of the E897K, V716R, and K720A mutants, respectively, in the presence of androgen, based on optical scanning of the film. The E897K ligand binding domain fragment mediated a 2-fold increase in binding of the WXXLF peptide in the presence of androgen relative to the no hormone control, but no androgen dependent increase in binding was detectable with the V716R and K720A ligand binding domain. Residues Glu-897, Val-716, and Lys-720 are part of the AF2 binding surface. The Val-716 side chain is in the AF2 hydrophobic cleft. Mutation to arginine (V716R) disrupts the hydrophobic binding surface and, as also shown previously in GST affinity matrix assays for FXXLF motif binding (10He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J.

The data provide evidence that the WXXLF motif binds the AF2 region of the ligand binding domain in an androgen-dependent manner. To further substantiate the androgen-dependent binding of the WXXLF motif to AF2, we used a peptide two-hybrid interaction assay previously described in HeLa cells (15He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W.

Interestingly, β subunit cell adhesive interactions are independent of participation in the ion conduction complex, suggesting that the β subunits may be bifunctional molecules (2Malhotra J.D.

We have proposed that the cell adhesive functions of β subunits play critical roles in the regulation of sodium channel density and localization. What is the molecular basis for the interaction of β1 with the cytoskeleton? We showed previously (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) that β1-mediated homophilic cell adhesion results in recruitment of ankyrin to sites of cell-cell contact in Drosophila S2 cells. Removal of the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of β1 had no obvious effects on homophilic adhesion but completely abolished ankyrin recruitment, demonstrating that the intracellular domain is required for cytoskeletal interactions. The purpose of the present study was to identify residues in the cytoplasmic domain of β1 that are required for ankyrin recruitment. Previous experiments have shown that deletion of a 5-amino acid sequence from the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of the L1-CAM family member neurofascin (FIGQY) abolished ankyrin binding activity (7Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation or deletion of just the tyrosine residue in this sequence abolished ankyrin binding and significantly reduced neurofascin-mediated cell adhesion. Similar experiments were performed to investigate the structural basis for signaling byDrosophila neuroglian, another member of the L1-CAM family (9Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Debreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results of this study identified a conserved intracellular 36-amino acid sequence that is responsible for ankyrin binding. Mutation of the conserved FIGQY tyrosine residue in this region reduced the extent of ankyrin recruitment as well as cell adhesion. A missense mutation of the FIGQY tyrosine in human L1 (Y1229H) results in clinical disease and confirms this residue as critical for the proper function of L1 in neuronal development (10Needram L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an intracellular tyrosine residue in β1 may play a role in ankyrin recruitment similar to that observed for the conserved FIGQY tyrosine residue in members of the L1-CAM family. Interestingly, abolishment of the entire cytoplasmic domain of sodium channel β1 or β2 subunits does not have any significant effects on homophilic cell adhesion (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Like the β subunits, the intracellular domains of L1-CAMs, such as neurofascin and neuroglian, are not essential for cellular aggregation (11Hortsch M. Wang Y.-M., M. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Wong E.V. Cheng G. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, unlike the β subunits, mutations reducing ankyrin binding result in a reduction in both the rate and extent of cellular aggregation (7Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The extracellular Ig domain of β1 is homologous to the Ig loop of the CAM myelin Po (13McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K.

Unlike β1, however, deletion of the intracellular domain of myelin Po results in abolishment of homophilic adhesion (15Wong M.H. Filbin M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the sodium channel β subunits appear to diverge from L1-CAMs and myelin Po in this respect. We tested our hypothesis that an intracellular tyrosine residue is important for ankyrin recruitment by expressing a series of truncated and site-directed β1 subunit mutant constructs inDrosophila S2 cells. Our results show that the sequence Ile166-Tyr181 contains the major ankyrin recruiting activity of β1. Ankyrin recruitment was retained in β1Y181F, but was abolished in β1Y181E and impaired in β1Y181A. The data suggest the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation, mimicked by introduction of a negative charge in β1Y181E, may regulate ankyrin-β1 interactions. β1 subunits are recognized by two different anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, PY20 and PY100, in transfected mammalian cells following treatment with fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Tyr181 mutant β1 subunits are not recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, indicating that Tyr181 is the only intracellular tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated, even though two additional tyrosine residues (Tyr161 and Tyr163) are present near the intracellular end of the transmembrane segment. Tyr161 and Tyr163 are present in β1STOP, a truncation mutant ending with Lys165 that was previously shown to be deficient in ankyrin recruiting activity (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). AnkyrinG and β1 are co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain membranes and from transfected cells expressing β1 and GFP-tagged ankyrinGin the absence of sodium channel α subunits. Treatment of this cell line with FGF abolishes β1-ankyrinG interactions. As predicted by the S2 cell experiments, GFP-ankyrinG and β1Y181E do not associate in transfected cells. Our results suggest that reversible, receptor-mediated changes in tyrosine phosphorylation modulate the association of sodium channels with ankyrin during axonal fasciculation or at specialized domains such as nodes of Ranvier. We conclude that the association of ankyrin and sodium channel β1 subunits is mediated through a 16-amino acid segment of the intracellular domain of β1 containing a tyrosine residue and that this event occurs independently of β1 subunit association with the ion-conducting pore. Drosophila S2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to an extracellular domain of β1 (KRRSETTAETFTEWTFR), β1EX, was described previously (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antiserum to an intracellular domain of β1 (LAITSESKENCTGVQVAE), β1IN, was generated and affinity purified by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Mouse anti-Drosophila ankyrin antibodies were generated as previously described (16Malhotra J.D. Tsiotra P. Karagogeos D. Hortsch M. J. Biol.

(South San Francisco, CA). Anti-GFP antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). α-Amanitin and FGF were obtained from Sigma. Anti-PY100 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). A GFP-tagged rat ankyrinG construct in the vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) was a gift from Dr. V. Bennett, Duke University. Chinese hamster lung 1610 and 1610β1 cells have been described previously (6Xiao Z.-C. Ragsdale D.S. Malhorta J.D. Mattei L.N. Braun P.E. Schachner M. Isom L.L. J. Biol.

Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mutant β1 subunit constructs were each generated from two PCR products (except β1L182STOP which was generated in a single PCR) using the following primers, written 5′ to 3′: β15′-BamHI, CCTTGCGCGGCCATGGGGACGCTG; β13′-XhoI, AGCCCAGAGCCAGCCGTATTCAGC; β1Y181F-F, GAGAATGCTAGCGAATTCCTGGCC; β1Y181F-R, GGCCAGGAATTCGCTAGCATTCTC; β1Y181A-F, GAGAATGCTAGCGAAGCCCTGGCC; β1Y181A-R, GGCCAGGGCTTCGCTAGCATTCTC; β1Y181E-F, GAGAATGCTAGCGAAGAGCTGGCC; β1Y181E-R, GGCCAGCTCTTCGCTAGCATTCTC; and β1L182STOP, CTAGTATTCGCTAGCATTCTC. β1Y181F was constructed in two PCR steps using wild type β1 cDNA as the template and the following primer pairs in separate reactions, β15′-BamHI/β1Y181F-R and β1Y181F-F/β13′-XhoI. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and 0.5-μl aliquots of each were mixed as templates in a second PCR with β15′-BamHI and β13′-XhoI as primers. All PCRs were performed under the following conditions: 500 ng of each primer, 200 pg of template, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, and 0.5 μl of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 10 min, and 4 °C until removed from the thermocycler. β1Y181A was generated in a similar manner using β15′-BamHI/β1Y181A-R and β1Y181A-F/β13′-XhoI as primers in the initial reactions. β1Y181E was generated in a similar manner using β15′-BamHI/β1Y181E-R and β1Y181E-F/β13′-XhoI as primers in the initial reactions. β1L182STOP was generated in a single PCR using β15′-BamHI and β1L182STOP as primers. All final products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). β1Y181F was then liberated with EcoRV and XhoI for subcloning into the SmaI and XhoI sites, respectively, of pRmHa3, containing the Drosophilametallothionein promoter (18Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). β1Y181A and β1Y181E were liberated with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pRmHa3, respectively. β1L182STOP was liberated withXhoI and SacI and subcloned into theSalI and SacI sites, respectively, of pRmHa3. Each construct was sequenced completely (Thermosequenase (AmershamBiosciences)) prior to use. Drosophila Schneiders' line 2 (S2) cells were grown and maintained as previously described (11Hortsch M.

Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). S2 cells were transfected with FuGENE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were co-transfected with pPC4 to confer α-amanitin resistance as a selectable marker as previously described (20Jokerst R.S. Weeks J.R. Zehring W.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cloned using the soft agar method (19Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). Cells were then induced overnight in the presence of 0.7 mm CuSO4 and mechanical shaking, as previously described (11Hortsch M. Wang Y.-M., M. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and analyzed by Western blot for protein expression of the transfected cDNA. For Western blot analysis, β1-transfected S2 cells were solubilized in 5% SDS and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated on 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were probed with anti-β1EX antibody, as indicated, at 1:500 dilution, and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at 1:100,000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with WestDura chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). These and subsequent digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Equal aliquots of wild type or cloned transfected S2 cells were induced in the presence of 0.7 mmCuSO4 followed by mixing at room temperature on a rotary shaker, as previously described (11Hortsch M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 10-μl aliquots of each cell line were removed after 20, 40, 60, and 80 min and analyzed by counting cells with a hemocytometer to quantitate the extent of aggregation by counting non-aggregated cells. The data were analyzed using Prism software. Immunocytochemical analysis of Drosophilaankyrin distribution in S2 cells was performed following the aggregation experiments described above. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Mouse anti-Drosophila ankyrin was used as the primary antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody.

G418 and hygromycin were used to select for ankyrinG and β1Y181 mutant expression, respectively. Expression of β1, β1Y181 mutants, and/or GFP-ankyrinG in each line was monitored by Western blot analysis.

Membranes or transfected cells were solubilized in 1.25% Triton X-100 and the soluble fraction was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-β1EX antibody or anti-GFP antibody, as indicated in the figure legends. Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of a 1:1 suspension) was then added and the incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The Protein A-Sepharose beads were precipitated in a microcentrifuge and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitates were eluted from the Protein A-Sepharose with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 5 or 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels as indicated in the figure legends. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-β1EX or anti-GFP antibodies, as indicated in the figure legend. Chemiluminescent detection of immunoreactive bands was accomplished with WestDura reagent. Immunoprecipitations were performed from solubilized transfected cell pellets following stimulation of cell monolayers with FGF or vehicle (50 ng/ml for 30 min at 37 °C). Membranes or cells were solubilized in 1.25% Triton X-100 containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and the soluble fraction was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-β1IN antibody in the presence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate.

Whereas both anti-PY20 and anti-PY100 recognized β1 subunits equally well, only the experiments with anti-PY20 are shown. Chemiluminescent detection of immunoreactive bands was accomplished with WestDura reagent. Chinese hamster lung 1610 and 1610β1 (6Xiao Z.-C. Ragsdale D.S. Malhorta J.D. Mattei L.N. Braun P.E.

Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Mouse anti-ankyrinB (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as the primary antibody (1:200), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200). Slides were then viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M inverted microscope in the Microscopy and Image Analysis Laboratory Core Facility at the University of Michigan. To test our hypothesis that the single intracellular tyrosine residue downstream of Lys165 in β1, Tyr181, is critical for ankyrin recruitment, we constructed a number of mutant β1 cDNAs in pRmHa3, including β1L182STOP, β1Y181F, β1Y181E, and β1Y181A (Fig.1 A) and co-transfected them with a plasmid conferring α-amanitin resistance intoDrosophila S2 cells. Each cell line was then cloned using the previously described soft agar method (19Bieber A.J. Goldstein L. Fryberg E. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell Biology. 44. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 683-696Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Bdemonstrates that each of these mutant constructs was efficiently expressed. S2 cells transfected with each of the β1Y181 mutants formed aggregates following induction with CuSO4 and mechanical shaking (Fig. 2). Untransfected S2 cells treated similarly did not aggregate. The percent of non-aggregated cells was quantified for each cell line following 20, 40, 60, and 80 min of induction. In contrast to studies with L1 family CAMs, the extent of cellular aggregation after 80 min was similar for wild type β1 and the β1 mutants. These results are consistent with our previous studies showing that the intracellular domain of β1 beyond Ile166 is not necessary for cell adhesion (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there appears to be subtle differences in the rate of aggregation in the Tyr181 mutant constructs compared with wild type.Figure 2Effects of β1Y181 substitution on homophilic adhesion. Equal aliquots of untransfected or mutant β1-transfected S2 cells were induced in the presence of 0.7 mm CuSO4 and rotary shaking. 10-μl aliquots of cells were removed after 20, 40, 60, and 80 min and the extent of aggregation was quantitated by counting the number of non-aggregated cells. Results are expressed as percent of single cells at time 0 for each cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also showed previously that the intracellular domain of β1 from Ile166 to the carboxyl terminus is required for homophilic adhesion-induced ankyrin recruitment (2Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis of β1L182STOP-induced cell aggregates using an antibody to Drosophila ankyrin showed ankyrin recruitment to sites of cell-cell contact similar to wild type β1 (72versus 80% recruitment, TableI), indicating that residues Ile166-Tyr181 contain the major ankyrin recruiting activity for this molecule (Fig.3, A and B). We next tested a series of point mutations to evaluate the importance of Tyr181 in β1-mediated ankyrin recruitment. β1Y181F-induced cell adhesion resulted in ankyrin recruitment to an extent similar to wild type β1 (75 versus 80% recruitment, Table I) (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, ankyrin recruitment induced by β1Y181A was significantly impaired (15 versus 80% recruitment, Table I) (Fig. 3,E and F). These results are similar to those reported for neurofascin (22Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and suggest that the aromatic ring of Tyr181 may be critical for β1-ankyrin interactions, although the hydroxyl group of this tyrosine residue may be less important in ankyrin recruitment.Table ISummary of effects of mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of β1 on ankyrin recruitment in S2 cellsTransfected S2 cells were induced to aggregate and ankyrin was visualized by immunocytochemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 100 cell contact sites for each of the cell lines were evaluated by confocal microscopy for ankyrin recruitment.

Open table in a new tab Transfected S2 cells were induced to aggregate and ankyrin was visualized by immunocytochemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 100 cell contact sites for each of the cell lines were evaluated by confocal microscopy for ankyrin recruitment. The sequence of the cytoplasmic domain for each construct beginning at residue Lys164 is given with Tyr181 or the mutated residue at this position indicated in bold. Previous studies with neurofascin have also shown that phosphorylation of an intracellular tyrosine residue in the conserved FIGQY domain (Tyr1229 in human neurofascin) resulted in the abolishment of ankyrin recruiting activity (8Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Mutation of this tyrosine residue to glutamic acid mimicked phosphorylation by introducing negative charges and greatly impaired both cell adhesion and ankyrin recruitment (22Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We performed a similar experiment using the β1Y181E mutant construct. This substitution completely abolished ankyrin recruitment in S2 cells (0% recruitment, Table I) (Fig. 3, G andH). In contrast to studies using neurofascin or neuroglian, the Y181E mutation had little effect on β1 subunit-induced cell adhesion following 80 min of induction compared with wild type β1 (Fig. 2). Under bright field illumination, cells in Fig. 3,panels G and H, were tightly aggregated (data not shown), yet ankyrin staining was absent from cell-cell contact sites and appeared to be completely cytoplasmic. We conclude that the major ankyrin recruiting activity of β1 is contained in residues Ile166-Tyr181 in the intracellular domain and that Tyr181 is critical for β1-ankyrin interactions. These results are summarized in Table I. The results shown in Fig. 3 suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may be a key regulatory event in β1-mediated ankyrin recruitment inDrosophila S2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993091102,"Knowledge about the O-linked glycan chains of tumor-associated MUC1 is primarily based on enzymatic and immunochemical evidence. To obtain structural information and to overcome limitations by the scarcity of endogenous mucin, we expressed a recombinant glycosylation probe corresponding to six MUC1 tandem repeats in four breast cancer cell lines. Comparative analyses of theO-glycan profiles were performed after hydrazinolysis and normal phase chromatography of 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glycans. Except for a general reduction in the O-glycan chain lengths and a high density glycosylation, no common structural pattern was revealed. T47D fusion protein exhibits an almost complete shift from core 2 to core 1 expression with a preponderance of sialylated glycans. By contrast, MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and ZR75–1 cells glycosylate the MUC1 repeat peptide preferentially with core 2-based glycans terminating mostly with α3-linked sialic acid (MDA-MB231, ZR75–1) or α2/3-linked fucose (MCF-7). Endogenous MUC1 from T47D and MCF-7 cell supernatants revealed almost identicalO-glycosylation profiles compared with the respective recombinant probes, indicating that the fusion proteins reflected the authentic O-glycan profiles of the cells. The structural patterns in the majority of cells under study are in conflict with biosynthetic models of MUC1 O-glycosylation in breast cancer, which claim that the truncation of normal core 2-based polylactosamine structures to short sialylated core 1-based glycans is due to the reduced activity of core 2-forming β6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases and/or to overexpression of competitive α3- sialyltransferase. Knowledge about the O-linked glycan chains of tumor-associated MUC1 is primarily based on enzymatic and immunochemical evidence. To obtain structural information and to overcome limitations by the scarcity of endogenous mucin, we expressed a recombinant glycosylation probe corresponding to six MUC1 tandem repeats in four breast cancer cell lines. Comparative analyses of theO-glycan profiles were performed after hydrazinolysis and normal phase chromatography of 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glycans. Except for a general reduction in the O-glycan chain lengths and a high density glycosylation, no common structural pattern was revealed. T47D fusion protein exhibits an almost complete shift from core 2 to core 1 expression with a preponderance of sialylated glycans. By contrast, MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and ZR75–1 cells glycosylate the MUC1 repeat peptide preferentially with core 2-based glycans terminating mostly with α3-linked sialic acid (MDA-MB231, ZR75–1) or α2/3-linked fucose (MCF-7).

Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 11: 55-101Google Scholar) and some subsets of lymphocytes (2Agrawal B. Krantz M.J. Parker J. Longenecker B.M.

It is overexpressed by many carcinomas, and an altered glycosylation pattern results in tumor-specific exposure of peptide epitopes (4Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C. Taylor-Papdimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 1972-1976Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar), making MUC1 a promising tumor antigen with diagnostic as well as therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer (5Apostolopoulos V.

Mature MUC1 consists of two subunits that are proteolytically derived from a common precursor peptide and form a stable heterodimeric complex. The smaller subunit contains a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, the membrane-spanning domain, and a short extracellular sequence that is noncovalently linked to the larger, extracellular subunit, which contains the extensively O-glycosylated mucin domain (8Ligtenberg M.J.L. Kruishaar L. Buijs F. van Meijer M. Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6171-6177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After its first appearance on the cell membrane, the complex is internalized and recycled several times for follow-up sialylation in the trans-Golgi (9Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21364-21371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature glycoforms of the mucin can remain on the cell surface or become shed by still unknown mechanisms (9Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21364-21371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MUC1 contains five potential N-glycosylation sites, three of which are located in the membrane-associated subunit and two near the C terminus of the extracellular subunit. However, the bulk of glycosylation, which can make up between 50 and 80% of the total mass, is O-linked to numerous threonine and serine residues in the mucin domain. This domain comprises a variable number of tandemly repeated 20-amino acid sequences, each containing five potentialO-glycosylation sites (10Gendler J.S. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 11Hanisch F-G. Müller S. Glycobiology. 2000; 9: 1181-1189Google Scholar). Although each of these sites is an O-glycosylation target in vivo, the average density of glycans may vary considerably among MUC1 glycoforms. As an instructive example, tandem repeat glycopeptides that were prepared from MUC1 expressed in the lactating breast (12Müller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson A.M. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or from the breast cancer cell line T47D (13Müller S. Alving K. Peter-Katalinic J. Zachara N. Gooley A.A. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to contain an average of 2.6 and 4.8 glycans, respectively. The pool of O-glycan structures produced by a single cell is the product of a complex biosynthetic process, which is not template-guided and requires the ordered action of multiple glycosyltransferases. Accordingly, O-glycan patterns are often cell- and tissue-specific and may differ substantially from one cell type to another. The O-glycan profiles of MUC1 glycoforms from breast milk, urine, and two breast carcinoma cell lines have been investigated so far. The O-glycan profile of lactation-associated MUC1 is dominated by core 2-based linear or branched polylactosamine chains, which are substituted with up to three fucose residues (14Hanisch F-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowsky J. Dabrowsky U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 872-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mono- and disialylated structures were also present but accounted for less than 25% of total glycans (15Hanisch F-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowsky U. Glycoconj. J. 1990; 7: 525-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Urinary MUC1, in contrast, exhibits an O-glycan profile with significantly shorter neutral and acidic glycans, which are based on core 1 as well as core 2 structures (16Bhavanandan B.H. Zhu Q. Yamakami K. Dilulio N.A. Nair S. Capon C. Lemoine J. Fournet B. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to three reports, tumor-associated glycoforms, which had been isolated from T47D (17Hanisch F-G. Stadie T.R.E. Deutzmann F. Peter-Katalinic J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and BT 20 (18) breast carcinoma cell line supernatants or from cell lysates (19Lloyd K.L. Burchell J. Kudryashov V. Yin B.W.T. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33325-33334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), were demonstrated to contain truncated precursor structures like core-GalNAc or the core 1 disaccharide Gal(β1–3)GalNAc as well as its mono- and disialylated derivatives. It has been proposed that breast cancer-associated changes in MUC1O-glycosylation reflect a general switch of core 2 to core 1 expression, which leads to a reduction of O-glycan chain length (18Hull S.R. Bright A.S. Carraway K.L. Abe M. Hayes D.F. Kufe D.W. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar) and may be the result of decreased or lacking expression of core 2-specific β6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (20Brockhausen I. Yang J,-M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, an increased α2,3-sialylation of core 1 structures has been claimed to represent a biosynthetic stop signal and to inhibit core 2 formation (21Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Lloyd K. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, due to the limited availability of chemical data, these hypotheses rely mainly on indirect enzymatic and immunochemical evidence, including the analysis of glycosyltransferase expression patterns by in situ hybridizations (22Burchell J. Poulsom R. Hanby A. Whitehouse C. Cooper L. Clausen H. Miles D. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis, or enzyme activity assays (20Brockhausen I. Yang J,-M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Immunochemical analysis of O-glycosylation-inhibited cells (23Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar) revealed an increased binding of tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies like SM3 or HMFG-1, supporting the idea that tumor-associated MUC1 is underglycosylated with regard to the average glycan chain lengths. Increased levels of MUC1 in the sera of cancer patients (24Hilkens J. Kroezen V. Bonfrer J.M., De Jong-Bakker M. Bruning P.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2582-2587PubMed Google Scholar) as well as tumor-associated truncation of O-glycans, render MUC1 tandem repeat peptide epitopes accessible to the immune system. Humoral and cellular responses have been demonstrated in cancer patients (25Kotera Y. Fontenot D.J. Piecher G. Metzgar R.S. Finn O.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2856-2860PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barnd D.L. Lan M.S. Metzgar R.S. Finn O.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) but also in pregnant women (27Agrawal B. Reddish M.A. Krantz M.J. Longenecker M.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2257-2261PubMed Google Scholar) and healthy individuals (24Hilkens J. Kroezen V. Bonfrer J.M., De Jong-Bakker M. Bruning P.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2582-2587PubMed Google Scholar). Although these natural responses are usually insufficient to fight the progress of malignant diseases, MUC1-derived peptides or glycopeptides are used in clinical trials to trigger therapeutically and prophylactically efficient immune reactions in humans (28Karanikas V. Hwang L.A. Pearson J. Ong C.S. Apostolopoulos V. Vaughan H. Xing P.X. Jamieson G. Pietersz G. Tait B. Broadbent R. Thynne G. McKenzie I.F.C. J. Clin.

Res. 1996; 63: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To enable the design of efficient tumor vaccines, the cancer-associated glycosylation profiles on MUC1 repeat peptides need to be analyzed in more detail and with state-of-the-art methodologies. Chemical studies on MUC1 O-glycosylation in cancer that have been reported so far have suffered from severe limitations of sample amounts. To overcome the analytical problems that are associated with low sample amounts and to extend the data on MUC1 O-glycosylation in mammary carcinomas by chemical evidence, we have expressed a MUC1 fusion protein in the breast cancer cell lines ZR75–1, MDA-MB 231, MCF-7, and T47D. O-Glycan pools were released from the purified fusion proteins by hydrazinolysis and the 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glycans were profiled by normal phase HPLC.1 Complementary information on the O-glycan profiles was revealed by an independent approach using nonreductive β-elimination and methylation of the oligosaccharides followed by their mass spectrometric analysis. To confirm that the recombinant probes reflect the authentic glycosylation profiles of the individual cell lines, we analyzed in two cases also the endogenous mucin by applying mass spectrometric profiling. A MUC1 tandem repeat sequence containing terminal restriction sites was constructed by annealing and ligating four 5′-phosphorylated 60-mer oligonucleotides. 5′ overhangs were filled up with Klenow enzyme, and the construct was cloned into the BamHI andHindIII sites of pBluescript SK (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), resulting in pBS TR1. Since there is a single SmaI site in each tandem repeat sequence, limited SmaI digestion of a 3.4-kb HindIII/ApaLI-cleaved MUC1 cDNA resulted in a series of fragments of 2–40 tandem repeat sequences and migrating in the 0.2–3-kb range on a 1.6% agarose gel. Fragments ranging from 0.8 to 1.8 kb were eluted from the gel and ligated intoSmaI/HindIII-cleaved pBS TR1. Out of several clones containing 10–30 tandem repeats and the 3′ sequence of the original construct, a single clone with ∼25 tandem repeats was chosen. BamHI digestion followed by limited SmaI digestion removed the 5′ sequence of the MUC1 cDNA and a random number of tandem repeats and resulted in several fragments, migrating between 3.5 and 5.5 kb on 1.2% agarose gels. Fragments in the 4-kb range were eluted from the gel and ligated to a 300-bpSmaI/NotI fragment that was excised from pBS TR1 and represented the 5′ sequence of pBSTR1. The procedure resulted in several clones that contained 2–16 tandem repeats flanked by the 3′ and 5′ sequences of the original pBS TR1. A clone containing six tandem repeats was chosen and subcloned into the pCEP-PU expression vector (30Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using the 5′ NheI and the 3′ NotI sites. pCEP-PU already contained the signal peptide of the BM40 extracellular matrix protein, followed by a hexahistidine sequence, a Myc tag, and the NheI and NotI restriction sites that were used for in-frame insertion of the MUC1 tandem repeat construct. Restriction enzymes and all other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231, T47D, MCF-7, and ZR75–1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in 80- or 160-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Minimal essential medium, supplemented with Glutamax I, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was used for MDA-MB231, MCF-7, and ZR75–1. T47D cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented as described above and containing 10 μg/ml bovine insulin. After transfection with MFP6, 0.1 μg/ml puromycin was added to all media. Media were exchanged every 3–4 days, and the cells were passaged when they reached 80–90% confluence using 0.1% trypsin and 0.2 mm EDTA. Puromycin and insulin were from Sigma, and all other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. pCEP-PU (30Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) is a mammalian episomal expression vector, containing a puromycin resistance gene and an origin of replication that allows episomal propagation in mammalian cells. Protein expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. All cell lines were transfected using the Superfect (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) lipofection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were allowed to recover in standard media, and 0.1 μg/ml puromycin was added after 24 h. Nontransfected cells died within 5 days, and the transfectants were expanded and cultured in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml puromycin to keep selective pressure on the episomal vector. Conditioned supernatants from confluent cell layers were collected, centrifuged at 1000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and dialyzed against several changes of demineralized water. Dialyzed supernatants were adjusted to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm imidazol, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% ethanol and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g (4 °C) for 45 min. Up to 1 liter of the adjusted supernatant was loaded onto a column of 2 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). The column was washed with 30 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 500 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% ethanol. After equilibrating the column with 5 ml of 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.5, proteins were eluted with 8 × 1 ml of 0.2 m trifluoroacetic acid in 10% acetonitril. Fractions 2–5 appeared to contain the fusion proteins and were subjected to HPLC purification on a reversed-phase column (Vydac 208TP1015; MZ Analysentechnik, Mainz, Germany). Samples were injected in 500-μl aliquots, and the column was eluted with a gradient of 2–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used, and the chromatogram was registered spectrophotometrically at 214 nm. Peaks were collected manually, and the quality of the preparations was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with silver or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the fusion proteins were detected with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purified MFP6 was quantified by its extinction at 280 nm. Secretory MUC1 was isolated from the supernatants of T47D and MCF-7 cells by affinity chromatography on anti-MUC1 antibody columns (1 mg of a mixture of repeat peptide-specific monoclonal antibodies B27.29 and BW835 coupled covalently to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HighTrap columns from Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (13Müller S. Alving K. Peter-Katalinic J. Zachara N. Gooley A.A. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The MUC1-containing fractions that could be registered by enzyme immunoassay were collected, dialyzed against dilute ammonium hydrogencarbonate, pH 8.0, and dried by vacuum centrifugation prior to gel permeation chromatography. Final purification of the mucin (solubilized in 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride) was achieved by size exclusion on a Superdex 200 HR column (1 × 30 cm;Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and run in 0.1 mammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer, pH 8.0, using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Purity of the mucin-containing fractions monitored by enzyme immunoassay was finally checked after Western blotting and staining of the nitrocellulose membrane with the Glycan Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 20–50 μg of lyophilized MFP6 were subjected to hydrazinolysis (31Patel P. Bruce J. Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jaques A. Parekh R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), using the O-glycan release kit (Glyko, Novato, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some minor modifications. Briefly, the treatment of extensively dried, salt-free fusion proteins was performed for 5 h at 60 °C, followed by evaporation of the reagent under reduced pressure. After re-N-acetylation for 15 min at 4 °C using 2 mm acetic anhydride in ice-cold saturated bicarbonate, the reaction mixture was desalted with the supplied ion exchange resin in a batch procedure, and the glycans were dried by vacuum centrifugation. 2-Aminobenzamide (Fluka, Seelze, Germany) was 2× recrystallized from ethanol and stored under argon at −20 °C. A detailed description of the labeling chemistry is given in Ref. 32Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar. Briefly, dry glycans in 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes were mixed with 2 μl of 1 m 2-aminobenzamide in acetic acid and 3 μl of 2m sodium cyanoborohydride in dimethyl sulfoxide. After a 2-h incubation at 60 °C, the samples were spotted onto chromatography paper (Schleicher & Schüll), and excessive reagents were removed by ascending paper chromatography inn-butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:1). The application points were cut out and eluted with 500 μl of water in order to recover the labeled glycans that do not migrate under the chromatographic conditions described above. Eluted fractions were filtered through 0.2-μm membranes in centrifugal microfiltration devices and stored at −20 °C. Lacto-N-tetraose, 3-sialyllactosamine, and dextran hydrolysate were obtained from Glyko (Novato, CA). NeuAcα2,3Galβ1–3GalNAc and NeuAcα2,3Galβ1–3(NeuAcα2–6)GalNAc were prepared from human fetuin (Glyko, Novato, CA) and human glycophorin A (Sigma). Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ(Galβ1–3)GalNAc was prepared from MUC1 isolated from human milk as described (14Hanisch F-G. Uhlenbruck G. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Dabrowsky J. Dabrowsky U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 872-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrazinolysis of the glycoproteins and the mucin and 2AB labeling were performed as described above. HPLC runs were performed on a System Gold HPLC work station (Beckman Instruments, Muenchen, Germany) equipped with a Shimadzu RF-10AXLfluorescence detector and using Beckman Nouveau software for data acquisition. Wavelength settings on the detector were 330 nm for excitation and 420 nm for emission. Aliquots of 2AB-labeled glycans were dried in a centrifugal evaporator. Prior to analysis, the samples were dissolved in 75% acetonitrile in water, and 20 μl was injected onto a polymer-based aminophase column (Astec NH2 polymer, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech, Unterhaching, Germany). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile, 20% 250 mm ammonium formiate to 40% acetonitrile, 60% 250 mm ammonium formiate over 80 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Anion exchange HPLC was performed according to Ref. 33Guile G.R. Wong S.Y.C. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. The HPLC system described above was used with a polymer-based anion exchange column (Q HyperD 10, 10 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm; Beckman Instruments) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer A was water, and buffer B was 500 mmammonium formiate, pH 9.0. A gradient of 0% B for 1 min, 0–5% B over 12 min, 5–21% B over 13 min, and 21–80% over 25 min followed by 80–100% over 4 min was used. Samples were dissolved in water, and 20 μl was injected. Neuraminidase (Clostridium perfringens), α2–3 sialidase (Salmonella typhimurium), α1–3/4 fucosidase (Xanthomonas manihotis), and α1–2 fucosidase (X. manihotis) were obtained from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Digestion of glycan pools or isolated glycans was performed in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, at 37 °C overnight. 10 μg of MFP6 was partially deglycosylated by sequential treatment with neuraminidase (C. perfringens), α1–3/4 fucosidase (X. manihotis), α1–2 fucosidase (X. manihotis), β-galactosidase (bovine testes; Glyko, Novato, CA), and β-hexosaminidase (jack bean, Glyko, Novato, CA) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5. Galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase treatment was repeated once. The samples were desalted by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 (NAP5; Amersham Biosciences) in water and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Samples were solubilized in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm calcium acetate, and 5 mm dithiotreitol. Clostripain (Sigma) was activated in 5 mm dithiotreitol, 1 mm calcium acetate for 3 h at room temperature, and the samples were digested overnight at 37 °C with 2 μg of enzyme. The digests were subjected to reversed-phase chromatography on a C18 column (ODS Ultrasphere 5U, 2.0 × 150 mm; Beckman Instruments) as described previously (12Müller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson A.M. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and aliquots of 0.3-ml fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Tandem repeat glycopeptide-containing fractions were combined and stored frozen. Aliquots (10 μl) of HPLC fractions were mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 2:1 acetonitrile/water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). 1 μl of each sample was applied to a polished stainless steel target and air-dried. Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in the positive ion mode using a pulsed laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). The acceleration voltage was set to 20 kV, and the reflector voltage was 22.5 kV. MPF6 (10–20 μg) or ∼5 μg of endogenous MUC1 were dried by vacuum centrifugation and suspended under argon in dry, ultrapure dimethyl sulfoxide (Aldrich). After the addition of 0.5 volumes of methyl iodide (Fluka, Seelze, Germany), the samples were immediately mixed with 1 volume of a fine suspension of sodium hydroxide in Me2SO (25 mg/ml) and incubated overnight at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted from chloroform with water (3 × 0.5 volumes), and the chloroform phase was dried in a stream of nitrogen. The methylated oligosaccharides were solubilized in 20 μl of methanol, and 0.4-μl aliquots were mixed with 1.6 μl of matrix solution (dihydroxybenzoic acid, 10 mg/ml of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1:2 (v/v)). Reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Reflex III or IV instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in the positive ion mode using a pulsed laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). The acceleration voltage was set to 20 kV, and the reflector voltage was 22.5 kV. Fusion proteins containing the secretory signal peptide of the BM40 extracellular matrix protein and 2–16 tandem repeats of a MUC1 cDNA were constructed. A hexahistidine and a Myc tag were introduced to allow glycosylation-independent affinity purification and immunodetection. MFP6 is a clone with six tandem repeats and was chosen as a glycosylation probe (Fig.1 A), since we noticed that fusion proteins with smaller repeat numbers were expressed poorly in the breast cancer cell lines used in this study (data not shown), and substantially larger ones were expected to be difficult to chromatograph in reversed-phase HPLC. DNA sequencing of the MFP6 construct confirmed the expected sequence given in Fig. 1 A. Several tandem repeat sequences in this construct deviate from the “conserved” sequence in two positions, namely the PDTR (PESR) and PPAH (PAAH; PQAH) motive. These sequence variants originate from the MUC1 cDNA and represent a general sequence polymorphism that has been described previously (11Hanisch F-G. Müller S.

The breast carcinoma cell lines T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB231, and ZR75-1 were transfected with the episomal expression vector pCEP-PU containing the MFP6 construct. Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody revealed that MFP6 was expressed and secreted into the supernatant in the four cell lines (data not shown). Expression remained constant over several weeks and passages, as long as selective pressure was applied by culturing the cells in the presence of puromycin. Since serum reduction or depletion might have resulted in an artificial glycosylation pattern, 10% fetal calf serum was always included in the media. MFP6 was isolated from the conditioned supernatants by affinity chromatography on immobilized Ni2+ ions and subsequent reversed-phase chromatography on a C8-silica column. Prior to further analysis, the MFP6 preparations were rechromatographed on the same column in order to confirm the expected quantities and the homogeneity of the sample, which was checked by gel electrophoresis and silver staining combined with Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). According to photometric quantification of pure MFP6, the yields ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 mg of protein/liter of conditioned supernatant. Endogenous MUC1 was eluted from the antibody affinity column at low pH and appeared in the first 3–6 fractions according to enzyme immunoas"

In most previous studies a single cell line, E1A-immortalized human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), has been used. Here we show that in human malignant cell lines, human fibroblasts, and murine myoblasts mTOR is predominantly nuclear. In contrast, mTOR is largely excluded from the nucleus in HEK293 cells. Hybrids between HEK293 and Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells generated cells co-expressing markers unique to HEK293 (E1A) and Rh30 (MyoD). mTOR distribution was mainly nuclear with detectable levels in the cytoplasm. mTOR isolated from Rh30 nuclei phosphorylated recombinant GST-4E-BP1 (Thr-46) in vitro and thus has kinase activity. We next investigated the cellular distribution of mTOR substrates 4E-BP, S6K1, and eIF4E. 4E-BP was exclusively detected in cytoplasmic fractions in all cell lines. S6K1 was localized in the cytoplasm in colon carcinoma, HEK293 cells, and IMR90 fibroblasts. S6K1 was readily detected in all cellular fractions derived from rhabdomyosarcoma cells. eIF4E was detected in all fractions derived from rhabdomyosarcoma cells but was not detectable in nuclear fractions from colon carcinoma HEK293 or IMR90 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2172158244,"Sulphur is depleted in cold dense molecular clouds with embedded young stellar objects1, indicating that most of it probably resides in solid grains. Iron sulphide grains are the main sulphur species in cometary dust particles2,3, but there has been no direct evidence for FeS in astronomical sources4, which poses a considerable problem, because sulphur is a cosmically abundant element. Here we report laboratory infrared spectra of FeS grains from primitive meteorites, as well as from pyrrhotite ([Fe, Ni]1-xS) grains in interplanetary dust, which show a broad FeS feature centred at ∼23.5 micrometres. A similar broad feature is seen in the infrared spectra of young stellar objects, implying that FeS grains are an important but previously unrecognized component of circumstellar dust. The feature had previously been attributed to FeO5,6,7. The observed astronomical line strengths are generally consistent with the depletion of sulphur from the gas phase1, and with the average Galactic sulphur/silicon abundance ratio8. We conclude that the missing sulphur has been found."

Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). These organisms live alternately as extracellular promastigotes within the insect vector and as intralysosomal amastigotes in the host macrophages (2Alexander J. Russell D.G. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 175-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Among the variety of disease manifestations, visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani complex is fatal and is a serious health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries (3Tselentis Y. Gilkas A. Chaniotis B. Lancet. 1994; 343: 8913Abstract Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Leishmania parasites contain high levels of cysteine proteases, belonging to cathepsin L and cathepsin B families (4Mottram J.C. Brooks D.R. Coombs G.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cysteine proteases have been shown to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of parasitic protozoan infections (5McKerrow J.H. Sun E. Rosenthal P.J. Bouvier J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 821-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Studies using CA074, a cathepsin B-specific inhibitor-treated BALB/c mice, showed resistance against Leishmania major infection and also showed the shift of immune responses from Th2 to protective Th1 type (6Maekawa Y. Himeno K. Ishikawa H. Hisaeda H. Sakai T. Dainichi T. Asao T. Good R.A. Katunuma N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2120-2127PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cathepsin B affects the immune response is not known. Studies involving species of Leishmania such as L. major and Leishmania amazonensis have been shown to induce the production of biologically active transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 by macrophages upon infection (7Barral-Netto M. Barrel A. Brownell C.E. Skeiky Y.A.W. Ellingsworth L.R. Twardzik D.R. Reed S.G. Science. 1992; 257: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). L. donovani infection is known to induce the expression of a number of cytokine genes like TNF-α, GM-CSF, TGF-β, and IL-6. Also, susceptibility to Leishmania chagasi infection in BALB/c mice is correlated with the localized production of TGF-β1 at the site of maximal parasite growth in the liver (8Wilson M.E. Young B.M. Davidson B.L. Mente K.A. McGowan S.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6148-6155PubMed Google Scholar). Application of anti-TGF-β antibodies arrested the development of lesions in mice, whereas treatment with TGF-β exacerbated the infection with L. amazonensis,Trypanosoma cruzi, and Toxoplasma gondii (9Hunter C.A. Bermudez H. Beernink H. Waegell W. Remington J.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).L. major, Leishmania mexicana, andLeishmania braziliensis trigger the production of TGF-β and IL-10, which inhibit killing of intracellular organisms (10Bogdan C. Rollinhoff M. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 22-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was also shown that TGF-β plays a role in limiting IFN-γ production during the primary infection in mice (11Bogdan C. Paik J. Vodovotz C. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23301-23308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ, on the other hand, is known to induce the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, the key effector mechanism for the killing ofLeishmania and other parasites within the mouse macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo (12Bogdan C. Behring Inst. Res. Commun. 1997; 99: 58-72PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β isoforms are synthesized as large biologically inactive precursors, which are proteolytically processed to yield mature and active homodimer. A variety of agents and treatments are known to activate latent TGF-β, like heat, acidic pH, plasmin, subtilisin-like endopeptidases, and cathepsins (13Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 14Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B.

Earlier studies have implicated the role of proteases and sialidases in the processing of host-derived latent TGF-β (16Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize thatLeishmania cathepsin B enzymes cleave latent TGF-β into mature and active TGF-β and thus helps parasites to overcome the microbicidal activity of the macrophages. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized the cathepsin B-like gene from the L. donovani complex. The functional role of cathepsin B in parasite survival using cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA074 and antisense mRNA inhibition revealed that it plays an important role in the amastigote survival within the macrophages. Also, we have expressed the L. chagasi cathepsin B in an insect cell expression system, in its active form, and for the first time we have demonstrated that leishmanial cathepsin B can cleave latent TGF-β into biologically active form, using parasite whole cell extracts as well as recombinant cathepsin B protein. These results suggest that cathepsin B plays an important role in Leishmania survival within the macrophages, by activating TGF-β. Modified minimum essential medium (HO-MEM), M199 medium, fetal calf serum, Lipofectin, and gentamycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Tunicamycin and phorbol myristate acetate were purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitors, E-64, CA074, and peptide substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC were purchased from Peptides International, Inc., Louisville, KY. Human recombinant TGF-β1 and the neutralizing antibodies, anti-TGF-β1, anti-LAP (latency-associated protein), and anti-mouse secondary antibody, were obtained from R & D Systems. The ECL-enhanced chemiluminescent kit and Quick-Prime labeling kits were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. L. chagasi (MHOM/BR/84, kindly provided by Dr. Mary, E. Wilson, University of Iowa) was cultured at 26 °C in modified minimum essential medium (HO-MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. L. donovani (1S2D, kindly provided by Dr. Greg Matlashweshki, McGill University, Montreal, Canada) was cultured at 26 °C in modified M199 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cultures were seeded at 1 × 106 parasites/ml and harvested at logarithmic or stationary phase of growth as defined by cell density and morphological characteristics. U937 macrophage cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and in the presence of 5% CO2. Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (CCL-64, ATCC) were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1% MEM nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm HEPES in the presence of 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Conserved amino acid sequence information was obtained by comparing the reported cathepsin B-like gene sequences from various organisms. A sense primer was synthesized, which included anEcoRI site (5′-ACAGAATTCACGATCGGCGAGATTCGTGACC-3′), corresponding to the conserved amino acids16TIGEIRDQ23 in the mature domain, and the antisense primer included a HindIII site (5′-CGCAAGCTTGATCAAGAAGTAGCCTTTGTC-3′), corresponding to the amino acids 216DKGYFLI222 in the C-terminal domain of other trypanosomatid cathepsin B. These primers were used to PCR-amplify partial cathepsin B-like gene fragments from the genome ofL. chagasi and L. donovani. Genomic DNA (100 ng) was used in the standard PCR reaction. The parameters used in the PCR were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. A single band of ∼600 bp was amplified and subcloned for DNA sequencing. To obtain full-length clone, this partial gene fragment was used as a probe to screen an L. chagasi amastigote cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Wilson, University of Iowa, College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA). Clones were sequenced with vector-based external primers and the internal primers derived from the partial gene fragment. The partial gene sequence of cathepsin B starting from poly(A) tail end up to the end of predicted propeptide was obtained from the positive clones. To obtain the complete gene sequence, a partial genomic library was constructed using a 4-kb PstI fragment (Fig. 1 A) in pGEM-2 plasmid and screened. Positive clones were sequenced, and predicted amino acids sequences were aligned using ClustalW provided by Bioedit sequence alignment editor program. Genomic DNA was isolated from early stationary phase promastigotes of L. chagasi and L. donovani, using standard protocol (17Maniatis T. Frittsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Southern analyses, 2 μg of genomic DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. Digested genomic DNA samples were fractionated on 0.9% agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. Promastigote RNA was obtained from logarithmic and stationary phase parasites. To obtain amastigote RNA, the human macrophage cell line (U937, ATCC) was infected with stationary promastigotes, which subsequently converted into intracellular amastigotes within the macrophage cells. Total RNA was isolated from the infected macrophage cells using TRIzol reagent. RNA (8 μg/lane) was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond N+ membrane. Standard procedures were followed to perform Southern and Northern blot hybridizations (17Maniatis T. Frittsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes representing specific regions of cathepsin B were PCR-amplified from the cDNA clone or the genomic clone of L. chagasi and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using a Quick-Prime labeling kit. To express active cathepsin B-like cysteine protease enzyme, the coding region was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of L. chagasi. PCR product was digested with NotI restriction endonuclease and was cloned in-frame into unique NotI site of pIE1/153A.jhe vector (18Farrell P.J. Behie L.A. Iatrou K. Proteins. 2000; 41: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing. Culture of insect cells and procurement of samples containing recombinant protein from transfected insect cells are as described earlier (19Farrell P.J., Lu, M. Prevost J. Brown C. Behie L.A. Iatrou K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1998; 60: 6556-6563Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, High Five insect cells were seeded into six-well culture plates (35 mm diameter) at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml (2 ml/well) and transfected for 5 h with 0.5 ml of transfection solution containing 30 μg/ml Lipofectin and 6 μg/ml total plasmid DNA in basal IPL-41 medium. Then the transfection solution was removed, and the cells were rinsed with basal medium and 2 ml of IPL-41 + 10% fetal bovine serum was added and incubated for 60 h. The supernatant was then harvested and stored at −20 °C for analysis. Cathepsin B activity in the recombinant protein and the whole cell lysates of the parasites was assayed using the synthetic peptide substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-amidomethylcoumarin (AMC). The assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates. The buffer used for the assays contained 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5% Me2SO. Reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μm final concentration of the substrates and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteolytic activity was monitored by the appearance of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from the synthetic substrates. The fluorescence of the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured using a Labsystem Fluoroscan II Spectrofluorometer at 460 nm emission and an excitation wavelength of 355 nm. For inhibition studies, cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA074 was used at a final concentration of 10 μm. For in vitro inhibition studies, promastigotes of L. chagasiwere cultured in HO-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, with or without 20 μg/ml CA074 for 6 days at 26 °C. The proliferation of parasites was evaluated by counting the parasites every 24 h, and whole cell lysates were prepared to assay for the enzyme activity. To generate the specific sense and antisense mRNA of cathepsin B gene, the Leishmania-specific vector P6.5, (kindly provided by Dr. K. P. Chang, Chicago Medical Center) was used. P6.5 has a pBluescript backbone along with ∼7.5-kbLeishmania DNA (20Chen D.Q. Kolli B. Yadav N., Lu, H.G. Sachs A.G. Peterson D.A. Chang K.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 1-kb coding region of cathepsin B was inserted at BamHI site of the P6.5 vector. The insert was cloned in both sense and antisense orientations with reference to that of a downstream N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate transferase gene (nagt), which is the selective marker for tunicamycin resistance. The P6.5 plasmid alone, the sense plasmid CatB-S, and antisense plasmid CatB-AS were amplified inEscherichia coli, and plasmid DNA was isolated for transfection using DNA maxi-prep kit. All the plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing and transfected into L. chagasi promastigotes. Briefly, 4 × 107 log phase promastigotes were pelleted, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of electroporation buffer in a 0.2-cm cuvette. Twenty-five μg of plasmid DNA of vector alone (P6.5), P6.5 with cathepsin B in correct orientation (CatB-S), and P6.5 with cathepsin B in reverse orientation (CatB-AS) were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Unit at 0.45 kV, capacitance of 25 microfarads and resistance of 250 ohms. Following electroporation, cells were resuspended in drug-free medium for 24 h. Cells were then selected for tunicamycin resistance at 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml concentrations. Parasites selected at 20 μg/ml were used for all the analyses. The U937 macrophage cells were infected with L. chagasi promastigotes at a host to parasite ratio of 1:10. Briefly, U937 suspension cells (106 cells per ml) in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg of gentamycin were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 3 days in the presence of 5% CO2. The cells were counted and then seeded at the rate of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 area. The cells were induced to adhere with 7.5 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and allowed to recover for 72 h. The macrophage cells were then infected with 10 stationary phase parasites per macrophage cell and allowed to infect for 4 h. The free and unbound parasites were washed with RPMI medium, and the infected macrophage cells were fed with fresh RPMI medium and left for 4 days. Infected cells were scraped from flasks at a 24-h interval, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed on the microscopic slides. Slides were then stained using Diff-Quick and used for counting the intracellular amastigotes. Recombinant human latent TGF-β1 was diluted in sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cell-free incubations with different concentrations of either recombinant cathepsin B or the parasite whole cell lysates were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. As a positive control, active TGF-β1 was generated by acid activation by incubating with 2 n HCl for 10 min at room temperature. Following incubation, nonreducing 2× SDS sample buffer was added to all the samples, and denaturing electrophoresis was carried out according to the standard protocol. Under this condition, mature TGF-β1 migrates as a dimer with a molecular mass of 25 kDa. Bioactive TGF-β1 was monitored using a growth inhibition assay with Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells, as originally described (21Tucker R.F. Branum E.L. Shipley G.D. Ryan R.J. Mores H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6757-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, Mv1Lu cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2,500 cells/well. After 3-h incubation, samples to assay for TGF-β1 activity were added. After 72-h incubation, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 8 h. Medium was removed, and cells were washed with 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid, followed by three washes with 80% methanol. Cells were then incubated with 0.25 n NaOH and neutralized with 5 n HCl. Cell supernatant was collected in scintillation vials, and radioactivity incorporated into DNA was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the standard method. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto to Hybond P membrane using a semidry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% skim milk solution. For the detection of cathepsin B, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:2,000 dilution of anti-cathepsin B antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Judy Sakanari, Sonoma University, Rohnert Park, CA). To detect the proregion of the TGF-β1, the blots were incubated with anti-human LAP monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, and to detect the mature TGF-β1, anti- human TGF-β1 monoclonal antibody was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Following incubation in the primary antibody, membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with 1:5,000 dilution of anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. An enhanced chemiluminescent kit was used for protein detection. To isolate the cathepsin B gene from L. chagasi, primers were designed based on the conserved amino acid sequences from various organisms. PCR reaction using these primers yielded a fragment of 600 bp. This fragment was used to hybridize a Southern blot containing genomic DNA of L. major, L. donovani, and L. chagasi, digested with different restriction enzymes. The results showed that a cathepsin B-like gene is indeed present in L. chagasi and L. donovani as a single copy gene and that the gene organization is identical in case ofL. chagasi and L. donovani, but restriction sites varied in the case of L. major (Fig.1 A). The PCR fragment was then used to screen a promastigote cDNA library of L. chagasi, and several positive clones were selected. Sequence analysis revealed that only partial coding sequences were present in the cDNA clones. We then cloned the PstI fragment fromL. chagasi (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) into PGEM-2 vector and constructed a partial genomic library, to obtain the complete gene, including the 5′-untranslated region. Based on the sequence information of L. chagasi cathepsin B gene, primers were designed to amplify the L. donovani cathepsin B-like gene from L. donovani genome. The full-length of L. chagasi (GenBankTMaccession number AF216830) and L. donovani(GenBankTM accession number AF233525) cathepsin B genes encode a predicted protein of 340 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed that LcCatB and LdCatB are 99.7% identical to each other and 90% identical to that of LmajCatB, 66% identical to LmexCatB, and only 45% identical to human cathepsin B gene (data not shown). As in case of L. major cathepsin B, the amino acid serine 331 (Ser331) is replaced by a glycine residue in case ofL. donovani and L. chagasi cathepsin B, which results in low activity of leishmanial cathepsin B toward the synthetic peptide substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC. However, because of this replacement, leishmanial cathepsin B can readily cleave the cathepsin L-specific synthetic substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-AMC. Northern blot analysis revealed a transcript size of 2.4 kb, which is constitutively expressed in all the life cycle stages of the parasite (Fig. 1 B, panel I). When compared with the α-tubulin transcript controls (Fig. 1 B, panel II), the ratio of expression at all stages remained constant, suggesting that the cathepsin B gene might play a role in housekeeping, during the developmental stages of the parasite. To study the substrate specificity of the cathepsin B-like cysteine protease, the coding region of L. chagasi cathepsin B gene was cloned into pIE1/153A.jhe vector and transfected into High Five insect cells. Cathepsin B expressed as a JHE (juvenile hormone esterase) fusion protein is secreted into the medium. The supernatant was collected and analyzed for the presence of recombinant protein by Western blot analysis, using anti-JHE and anti-LmCatB antibodies. The results of the Western analysis are presented in Fig.2A, panel I (α-JHE antibody) and Fig. 2 A, panel II (α-LmCatB antibody). The antibodies detected a major band of 102 kDa, corresponding to the JHE-cathepsin B fusion protein. The recombinant protein was then assayed for the protease activity using the synthetic peptide substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-AMC. The specificity of the activity was determined by using a cathepsin B specific inhibitor, CA074. The results are tabulated in the form of bar diagram (Fig. 2 B). Results indicate that the recombinant JHE-cathepsin B fusion protein is indeed active against Z-Phe-Arg-AMC. The controls, cells, and JHE protein showed significantly low background fluorescence. The activity is specifically inhibited in presence of CA074, up to 85%. This indicates that the recombinant cathepsin B is proteolytically active, although it is fused with JHE protein. To study the functional role of cathepsin B on the parasite growth and survival, we have used CA074, a cathepsin B-specific synthetic inhibitor. Growth curve analysis indicates that the inhibitor itself does not affect the growth of the parasites during the promastigote stages of the parasite (data not shown). Furthermore, inhibitor treatment did not alter the amount of cathepsin B, both in promastigote and axenically grown amastigote stages of the parasite (Fig. 3 A). However, the cathepsin B activity in parasites, which were grown in presence of CA074 showed significant reduction, when compared with that of control parasites in both the stages of development (Fig. 3 B). The activity toward Z-Phe-Arg-AMC was similar in case of promastigotes as well as in axenically cultivated amastigotes. The parasites grown in the presence of inhibitor were then used to infect the U937 macrophages, to test the effect of reduced cathepsin B activity on parasite survival. The macrophage infection data (Fig.4) shows that the inhibitor-treated promastigotes had reduced survivability compared with untreated promastigotes, at all time points studied. Taken together the results from this study suggest that cathepsin B activity is important forLeishmania survival within the host macrophage cells, but does not play a role during the promastigote stage of the development.Figure 4Intramacrophage survival of L. donovani promastigotes treated with or without CA074. An equal number of wild type parasites and inhibitor-treated promastigotes were used to infect phorbol myristate acetate-activated U937 macrophages. The graph represents the average number of amastigotes present in a macrophage cell for every 100 macrophages counted, on a daily basis up to 96 h post-infection. The collective data from three independent trials are represented in this graph. The line with diamond shaped points represents the infection with wild type promastigotes, and the line with squaresrepresents the infection with promastigotes grown in the presence of CA074.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transfectants were selected and subsequently grew in medium with tunicamycin, up to 20 μg/ml. The presence of plasmids in these transfectants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using specific probes (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of these samples with specific PCR-generated probes revealed that they contained sense and antisense cathepsin B transcripts. Only transfectants with the CatB-AS plasmid expressed the antisense transcripts, which concomitantly showed a decrease in the sense transcript when compared with the wild type and vector alone transcfected parasites (Fig.5 A, panel II). Equal loading of RNA is shown by the ethidium bromide stain (Fig.5 A, panel III). The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the presence of episomal cathepsin B antisense mRNA significantly reduces the endogenous cathepsin B mRNA. Western blot analysis of these transfectants showed that the expression of antisense RNA affected the level of cathepsin B protein translated (Fig. 5 B, panel I). The changes in the level of cathepsin B is significant compared with those seen in the wild type parasites and those transfected with the vector alone. The Coomassie-stained gel is used to verify the equal loading of the protein extracts (Fig. 5 B, panel II). The results obtained thus indicate that antisense mRNA expression affects the translation of endogenous cathepsin B mRNA, thereby significantly reducing the cathepsin B protein in these transfectants. To study the effect of cathepsin B activity due to antisense mRNA inhibition on survival of parasites in the host macrophages, cathepsin B activity toward specific synthetic substrate in the transfectants was assessed using fluorogenic assay, and also the subsequent effect on intracellular survival and replication was studied using U937 macrophage-like cells. The results from the fluorogenic assay revealed that the transfectants with the antisense plasmid had significantly reduced activity toward the substrate used, Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (Fig.6 A) when compared with that of the transfectants with sense plasmids and vector alone. Similarly, the macrophage infection data also revealed that the transfectants with the antisense plasmid showed significant reduction in the parasite survival and multiplication within the macrophage cells when compared with those with sense plasmid and vector alone (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results clearly suggest that cathepsin B activity is important for the parasite survival within the macrophages. A recent study involving human cathepsin B has indicated its role in activation of latent TGF-β1 in the human breast epithelial cell line (22Guo M. Mathieu P.A. Linebaugh B. Sloane B.F. Reiners J.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14829-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To determine whether Leishmania cathepsin B had any effect on TGF-β1 processing and activation in vitro, an immunoenzymatic assay using a cell-free incubation method was followed. TGF-β1 activation was detected by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for latent TGF-β1 and mature-TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 7, lane 1, latent TGF-β1 is used as a negative control. Acid activation of TGF-β1 resulted in the cleavage of latent TGF-β1 into its pro and mature form (Fig. 7, lane 2), which is a positive control for our studies. The recombinant cathepsin B-JHE f"

We cloned a single copy gene, tgcp1, fromToxoplasma gondii and refolded recombinant enzyme to yield active proteinase. Substrate specificity of the enzyme and homology modeling identified the proteinase as a cathepsin B. Specific cysteine proteinase inhibitors interrupted invasion by tachyzoites. The T. gondii cathepsin B localized to rhoptries, secretory organelles required for parasite invasion into cells. Processing of the pro-rhoptry protein 2 to mature rhoptry proteins was delayed by incubation of extracellular parasites with a cathepsin B inhibitor prior to pulse-chase immunoprecipitation. Delivery of cathepsin B to mature rhoptries was impaired in organisms with disruptions in rhoptry formation by expression of a dominant negative μ1-adaptin. Similar disruption of rhoptry formation was observed when infected fibroblasts were treated with a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B, generating small and poorly developed rhoptries. This first evidence for localization of a cysteine proteinase to the unusual rhoptry secretory organelle of an apicomplexan parasite suggests that the rhoptries may be a prototype of a lysosome-related organelle and provides a critical link between cysteine proteinases and parasite invasion for this class of organism.

Dubremetz J.F. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D.

Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Invasion by T. gondii tachyzoites is mediated by the sequential regulated release of specialized secretory organelles of the parasite including the micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules (4Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). In early observations, the penetration of host cells by tachyzoites was enhanced by the addition of partially purified lysosomal enzymes (5Lucke E. Lund E. Strannegard O. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1965; 46: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, proteinases have been implicated in host cell invasion in other members of the Apicomplexa such as Plasmodium (6Mayer R. Picard I. Lawton P. Grellier P. Barrault C. Monsigny M. Schrevel J. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) andEimeria tenella (7Fuller A.L. McDougald L.R. J. Parasitol. 1990; 76: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We now show that a cathepsin B, toxopain-1, is strongly implicated in T. gondiiinvasion and that infection can be interrupted with specific cathepsin B inhibitors. Another unusual feature of Toxoplasma is the absence of a morphologically identifiable lysosomal system. In higher eukaryotic cells, acidic cathepsins in lysosomes are important in protein processing and breakdown. The mammalian precursor of cathepsin B is targeted to the lysosomal compartment by mannose 6-P for proteolytic activation (8Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Thus, the apparent lack of a lysosomal system inToxoplasma raises a number of questions regarding cellular proteinase functions within the parasite. The rhoptries are club-shaped organelles located at the apical end of the parasites with no known counterpart outside of the phylum Apicomplexa (9Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although nine rhoptry proteins (ROP1–9)1have been identified to date (10Reichmann G. Dlugonska H. Gischer H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a definitive function has only been determined for ROP2, which mediates binding of host mitochondria to the parasitophorous membrane (11Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). How rhoptry proteins directly contribute to the invasion process is still not clear. T. gondiirhoptry proteins are synthesized as prepro proteins that are subject to proteolytic cleavage to remove the presequence and the proregion at the N terminus and then processed to their mature forms (11Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Soldati D. Lassen A. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem.

Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Rhoptries and pre-rhoptries are the only acidified organelles identified in the parasite (15Shaw M.K. Roos D.S. Tilney L.G. Parasitology. 1998; 117: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), contain a high lipid to protein ratio (16Foussard F. Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and scavenge sterols from the host cell (17Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We now show that the T. gondii cathepsin B, toxopain-1, localizes to the rhoptries, and inhibition of cathepsin B activity or disruption of ROP protein targeting leads to mislocalization of toxopain-1 and abnormal rhoptry biogenesis. This is the first evidence for localization and function of any proteinase to the unusual rhoptry secretory organelle of an apicomplexan parasite. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise specified. All AMC and synthetic AMC peptide substrates were obtained from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Synthetic peptide inhibitors were a gift from Prototek Inc. (Dublin, CA). Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were initially cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) and 2 mm glutamine and maintained subsequently in the same medium with 2% fetal bovine serum. The RH strain of T. gondii was obtained from Dr. John Boothroyd (Stanford University, CA). Tachyzoites of the RH strain were maintained in confluent monolayers of HFF cells. A cathepsin B family proteinase gene, tgcp1, was amplified from cDNA with primers based on conserved sequences of eukaryotic cathepsins (18Eakin A.E. Bouvier J. Sakanari J.A. Craik C.S. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 39: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and on partial Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequence data from theToxoplasma genome project (EST clone: TgESTzy53g12r.1) (19Ajioka J.W. Boothroyd J.D. Brunk B.P. Hehl A. Hillier L. Manger I.D. Marra M. Overton G.C. Roos D.S. Wan K.L. Waterston R. Sibley L.D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The lambda phage clone was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO)in vivo excised with ExAssist (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as helper phage and sequenced. The remaining sequence was obtained by 3′- and 5′-RACE (Invitrogen). Total cellular RNA from T. gondiiwas isolated using RNAzol reagent and transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase andtgcp1-specific reverse primer R1 (5′-GAG TCA TCA TAT CTC TCT TGA CG-3′). Excess dNTPs and primer were removed from single-stranded cDNA, and a homopolymeric tail of dCs was added to the end of single-stranded cDNAs using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The 5′-end of tgcp1 cDNA was then amplified from dC-tailed cDNA using the abridged anchor primer and a specific nested primer F2 (5′-CTT CTG TGC TGG CGA AG-3′). For 3′-RACE, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the oligo(dT) primer. The 3′-end of the tgcp1 cDNA was PCR-amplified with thetgcp1-specific forward primer F5 (5′-GTG TCG GGG GCC TTC ATG GTC-3′) and the oligo(dT) primer. Finally, the complete gene forT. gondii cathepsin B was amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers against the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. All nucleotide sequences and predicted amino acid sequences were compared with known sequences in the data base using the BLASTX, BLASTN, and BLASTP programs at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Southern hybridization of Toxoplasma genomic DNA with a tgcp1 gene probe was performed according to previously described protocols (20Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). The sequence of toxopain-1 was aligned with human liver lysosomal cathepsin B, rat cathepsin B, and rat procathepsin B. Existing x-ray crystal structures of human liver lysosomal cathepsin B with CA030 inhibitor (PDB ID:1CSB), human liver lysosomal cathepsin B with no inhibitor (PDB ID:1HUC), and rat cathepsin B (PDB ID: 1CTE) were used as three-dimensional templates for the modeling of Toxoplasmacathepsin B. MODELLER, a module of the Quanta software package, was used to generate homology-based models of the enzyme. To express recombinant enzyme, the sequence of the pro- and mature toxopain-1 was amplified and subcloned into pBAD/Thio TOPO (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli codon plus cells (Stratagene) in SOB media and induced with 0.02% arabinose with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cell pellet was solubilized in 6 m GdnHCl, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and the soluble proteins applied to a nickel affinity column (Invitrogen ProBond), washed with the same buffer at pH 6.3, and eluted at pH 4.5. The protein in the fractions was determined by the Bradford reaction and the fractions screened by SDS-PAGE. One liter of culture yielded ∼30 mg of the thioredoxin-TgCP1 fusion protein. Thioredoxin-TgCP1 fusion protein (74.5 mg or 1 μm) was slowly added to 1 liter of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 750 mm arginine, 500 mm GdnHCl, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione and stirred in the cold for 48 h. The sample was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 and concentrated to 30 ml. The sample was re-dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.5 and separated by ion exchange FPLC on a Mono Q column. Proteinase activity in column fractions or tachyzoite lysates were measured by cleavage of peptide substrates. T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites were harvested from human fibroblast monolayers, purified by filtration through 3.0-μm nucleopore filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and resuspended at 109 cells/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Following three freeze-thaw cycles and a 15-s sonication, the proteinase activity was measured in the soluble fraction. Substrate specificity was tested for the liberation of the fluorescent leaving group, AMC, from the synthetic peptide substrates to determine the preferred cleavage of the P1 and P2 sites (21Reed S.L. Bouvier J. Pollack A.S. Engel J.C. Brown M. Hirata K. Que X. Eakin A. Hagblom P. Gillin F.D. McKerrow J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis (nmol/min/mg protein) is based on the rate of increase of fluorescence using a Labsystems Fluoroskan Spectrofluorometer. The inhibitor profile (IC50) was determined by monitoring inhibition of hydrolysis of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC substrate in the presence of serial dilutions of the inhibitors following incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The IC50 was calculated as the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 50% inhibition of proteinase activity compared with non-inhibited controls. The peptidyl ketone inhibitors, PRT2005 and PRT2253 (a kind gift from Prototek), with a Phe-hPhe substitution in the P2 and P1 residues, were used in all subsequent inhibitor studies. Recombinant toxopain-1 was expressed inE. coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography as above. Polyclonal antibody to recombinant toxopain-1 was produced by immunizing rabbits three times with 100 μg of recombinant protein mixed with Titermax Gold Adjuvant (Sigma). The antiserum was affinity-purified by adsorption and desorption to recombinant toxopain-1 on nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (22Ngo H.M. Bouck G.B. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1998; 45: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were produced previously by immunizing BALB/c mice with 50 μg of recombinant ACP1 (amebic cysteine proteinase 1) using RIBI adjuvant and boosted once intravenously (23Que X. Brinen L.S. Perkins P. Herdman D.S. Hirata K. Torian B.E. Rubin H.M. McKerrow J.H. Reed S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Spleens were harvested and fused with NSO myeloma cells. Three monoclonal antibodies, 1.7, 1.15, and 1.17 were subsequently found to cross-react with T. gondii lysates by immunoblots and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of specific proteinase inhibitors on invasion, tachyzoites (5 × 104 to 1 × 106) were preincubated 30 min at 37 °C in medium alone or medium containing 20 μm PRT2005 or PRT2253. They were then added directly to fibroblast monolayers on chamber slides (Lab Tek, Nunc) for 2 h. Following washing, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, stained with acridine orange (5 μg/ml), and the number of infected cells was determined by fluorescent microscopy. HFF cells were grown overnight on coverslips and infected with 2 × 105tachyzoites per well for 24–48 h. Monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed three additional times in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin using anti-ROP2/3/4 mAb T3 4A7 (14Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Toxopain-1 localization was performed with mAb CP1.7 (2 mg/ml) directly labeled with Alexa 594 per kit instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) before adding the second antibody. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and washed in PBS. The slides were mounted and examined by epifluorescent microscopy. To assess the effect of proteinase inhibitors on rhoptry protein processing in vivo, purified tachyzoites (2.5 × 108) were washed in prewarmed methionine/cysteine-free (Met−/Cys−) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C in medium alone or containing 20 μm inhibitor PRT2253S. Tachyzoites were pulse-labeled with 300 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 15 min in the presence or absence of 20 μm PRT2253S and chased in complete medium for 0–60 min before harvesting. Tachyzoites were washed with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2with inhibitor and lysed in 1% SDS, and the radiolabeled rhoptry proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb T3 4A7 and protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, the gel impregnated with fluorographic enhancement solution (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Tgμ1 mutants were produced by PCR with an HA epitope tag introduced into Tgμ1 between codons 231 and 232.2 The resulting D176A mutation had been shown to alter the binding of the rat μ2-chain to tyrosine-binding motifs (25Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Tgμ1-HA and the mutated Tgμ1-HA(D176A) were ligated into pNTP/Sec for transient transfection and into pDHFR-TS/C3M2M3 for stable transfection as previously described (24Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For cryoimmunoelectron microscopic localization, monolayers of fibroblast cells were infected with RH tachyzoites for 24 h, fixed in 0.8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25m HEPES buffer pH 7.4, for 48 h, scraped into 1% bovine serum albumin solution, and pelleted in 10% fish skin gelatin. The pellets were infiltrated overnight with 2.3 m sucrose and frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ultrathin cryosections were transferred to grids. Sections were incubated with monospecific polyclonal antibodies to toxopain-1. After washing, sections were incubated with 5 or 10 nmol of protein A-gold conjugates. Following washing, sections were postfixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and contrasted with 0.2% uranyl acetate in 2% methyl cellulose. Images were recorded with a Philips 410 Transmission electron microscope. For transmission electron microscopic studies, infected monolayers were grown in the presence of media with or without inhibitor for 48 h (20 μm PRT2005), fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 for 30 min, washed and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. Fixed samples were embedded in Epon and thin-sectioned for transmission electron microscopy. Images were recorded with a Philips Tcenai 10 Transmission electron microscope. A full-length cathepsin B gene,tgcp1, was amplified from RH tachyzoite cDNA based on homology to conserved sequences of eukaryotic cysteine proteinases and a partial sequence in the T. gondii EST data base (19Ajioka J.W. Boothroyd J.D. Brunk B.P. Hehl A. Hillier L. Manger I.D. Marra M. Overton G.C. Roos D.S. Wan K.L. Waterston R. Sibley L.D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The completed transcript of 3236 nucleotides encodes a prepro-cathepsin B precursor of 569 amino acids (M r = 62,165), comprising a predicted N-terminal signal sequence, a propeptide domain, and mature enzyme (Fig. 1). The predicted Met start codon conforms to a Kozak eukaryotic consensus sequence (ANNATG G) for initiation of translation. The sequences leading the ATG start codon (TTTTTTTCACCAAGGAAAAAATG G) conform closely to the T-stretches found in many T. gondiigenes. The N-terminal 34 amino acids of the prepeptide region possess a putative signal sequence consisting of hydrophobic amino acids. The putative cleavage site between the signal peptide and propeptide region is predicted by the (−3, −1) rule using the SignalP algorithm of von Heijne (26Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). The prodomain of toxopain-1 is much longer (239 amino acid residues) and more diverged than those of other cathepsin B family proteases. Toxopain-1 lacks the ERFNIN motif in its prodomain, which is found in cathepsin L and H but not cathepsin B. The prodomain of toxopain-1 contains two potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation NX(S/T) at residue positions −5 and −186 (27Kornfield S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The mature enzyme (296 residues, M r = 32,362) showed significant similarity to the cathepsin B proteases ofSchistosoma japonicum (61%) (28Merckelbach A. Hasse S. Dell R. Eschlbeck A. Ruppel A. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1994; 45: 193-198PubMed Google Scholar), Sarcophaga peregrina (59%) (29Takahashi N. Kurata S. Natori S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and human (60%) (30Chan S.J. Segundo B.S. McCormick M.B. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7721-7725Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Like human cathepsin B, toxopain-1 contains the active site triad of cysteine, histidine, and asparagine at positions 30, 211, and 231, respectively. Toxopain-1 has 12 Cys residues at similar positions to those of human cathepsin B to participate in formation of 6 disulfide bridges. In cathepsin B family proteases, there is a conserved motif Gly-Cys-Asn-Gly-Gly (residues 70–74 in human); this motif is also present in toxopain-1 (residues 73–77). Toxopain-1 has an intact occluding loop (His116 and His117) and likely possesses exopeptidase activity in addition to its endopeptidase function. Unlike the cysteine proteinases of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, toxopain-1 has a much shorter C-terminal extension (∼30 residues) (31Pamer E.G., So, M. Davis C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Southern blot hybridization of parasite genomic DNA with a toxopain-1 probe revealed two bands of ∼5200 and 3000 base pairs when restricted with EcoRI and a single band of ∼19,000 base pairs when cut with HindIII, indicating a single copy gene (data not shown). The model structure generated for Toxoplasma cathepsin B (Fig.2) was very similar to that of the templates, human liver lysosomal cathepsin B and rat cathepsin B. Overall, the root mean-squared deviation between the backbone of the model structures was less than 1 Å when superimposed on the template starting structures. Close examination of the active site region of the models shows a high degree of similarity. In particular, the catalytic triad residues of the models and templates are nearly perfectly superimposable. In human cathepsin B, the substrate-binding cleft located between the L and R domains of the enzyme is occluded by a loop (residues 104–114). The essential His110-His111 moiety in the loop provides positively charged anchors for binding of dipeptidyl carboxylpeptidase substrates for the exopeptidase activity, which is only present in cathepsin B. To express recombinant protein for refolding, we amplified the region encoding the promature sequence and subcloned the fragment into the pBAD/Thio vector, which optimizes expression of soluble protein and allows purification by nickel affinity chromatography of ∼30 mg of toxopain-1/liter. Using a partial factorial refolding screen spanning (32Armstrong N., De Lencastre A. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we found that maximal soluble protein was recovered (73% input protein) after 48 h in a buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 500 mm guanidine hydrochloride, 750 mm arginine, and a 10:1 ration of reduced and oxidized glutathione. Following dialysis against Tris-buffered saline, concentration and purification by ion exchange chromatography, proteolytic activity was associated with a single 32-kDa band, consistent with the mature enzyme (Fig.3). We compared the substrate specificity of the soluble cysteine proteinase activity in tachyzoite lysates to the recombinant enzyme. Substrate specificity was tested by cleavage of synthetic peptide substrates containing Boc-X-X-4-amino-7-methylcoumarin, whereX is a positively charged or neutral amino acid residue, to assess the preferred cleavage of the P1 and P2 sites. The initial velocity of cleavage of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC (modeling the specificity of cathepsin B) was greater than seven times that of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (substrate of cathepsin L) (Fig.4). Ten new peptidyl ketone cysteine proteinase inhibitors (from Prototek) were screened for their activity against cysteine proteinases in T. gondii lysates by measuring the IC50. The inhibitors are di- and tripeptides bearing activated ketones, which are irreversible and covalently modify the enzyme. Seven inhibitors were active at concentrations less than 100 μm (data not shown). PRT2005 and PRT2253, two of the most active inhibitors with an IC50 < 1 μm were used in the subsequent studies. To evaluate the effect of inhibitors on host cell invasion, tachyzoites (5 × 104 to 1 × 106) were incubated in medium alone or containing 20 μm PRT2005 and allowed to invade fibroblast monolayers in chamber slides for 2 h. The slides were washed, fixed in formaldehyde for 10 min, and stained with acridine orange for counting. The number of infected cells was significantly less in the presence of the inhibitor (p< 0.05 by Student's paired t test, Fig.5). To localize toxopain-1, we performed confocal fluorescent microscopy with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against toxopain-1, monoclonal antibodies against rhoptry proteins 2, 3, and 4 (14Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), polyclonal antibodies generated against ROP2 (33Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibodies against micronemes and dense granules. Studies of infected monolayers revealed that toxopain-1 localized to the rhoptries and residual body, but not to micronemes and dense granules (Fig. 6). Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to toxopain-1 confirmed that toxopain-1 is specifically localized (>90% of labeled gold particles) to the rhoptries, endosomal vesicles (34Robibaro R.

Microbiol. 2002; 4: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and secreted into the parasitophorous vacuolar space (Fig. 7). Toxopain-1 was concentrated in a narrow strip down the center of the rhoptry, in contrast to other rhoptry proteins, which are diffusely distributed.Figure 7Immunoelectron microscopy localization of toxopain-1 and ROP2.

Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we examined whether ROP2 processing is inhibited by specific cathepsin B inhibitors. Processing of pro-rhoptry proteins, ROP2, 3, 4 to mature rhoptry proteins was delayed >60% following preincubation of extracellular parasites with 20 μm PRT2253S for 15 min at room temperature prior to pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 8). Localization of T. gondii ROP2 is dependent on a tyrosine motif (YEQL) in the cytoplasmic tail that binds to the μ1-chain of the T. gondii AP-1 clathrin adaptor (Tgμ1) (24Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Tgμ1 adaptin is essential for normal biogenesis of rhoptries (24Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat.

A Tgμ1(D176A)-HA mutant with a mutation at a residue necessary for binding to the tyrosine motif functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1 function. In parasites overexpressing the dominant negative Tgμ1(D176A)-HA, rhoptry biogenesis is altered, and the labeling of ROP2 is decreased drastically in intensity and detectable only in a thin, discontinuous organelle spanning the apical half of the cell (Fig. 9).

Dimitrov S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The coiling of DNA by histones in nucleosomes is a barrier to the entry of proteins involved in transcription, replication, and other DNA transactions. Changes in chromatin structure as triggered by the combined action of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases as well as chromatin remodeling complexes have a significant influence on the processes occurring in DNA (reviewed in Refs. 2Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Bioessays. 1998; 20: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In search for factors that change the structure of chromatin and the replicative activity of chromatin templates, we have recently identified the proto-oncogene protein DEK as a candidate protein that changes the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro (6Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). The DEK protein was initially identified in a fusion with the CAN nucleoporin in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemias involving chromosomal translocations (7von Lindern M. Fornerod M. van Baal S. Jaegle M. de Wit T. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). DEK was later identified as an autoantigen in several autoimmune diseases such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (8Sierakowska H. Williams K.R. Szer I.S. Szer W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or systemic lupus erythematosus (9Wichmann I. Respaldiza N. Garcia-Lozano J.R. Montes M. Sanchez-Roman J. Nunez-Roldan A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite these disease associations the function of the DEK protein in the cell remains elusive. There are two recent reports demonstrating that DEK could be involved in RNA metabolism. It was shown that DEK associates with splicing complexes through interactions mediated by SR proteins. DEK associates with the SRm160 splicing coactivator in vitroand remains bound to the exon product RNA after splicing. This association requires the prior formation of a spliceosome (10McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S., Li, Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, DEK has been found in a five-component complex of ∼335 kDa at a conserved position 20–24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions in mRNAs (11Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). However, DEK also binds to DNA (12Faulkner N.E. Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol.

Grosveld G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1739-1748PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, we determined that DEK is a constituent of oligonucleosomes, generated by micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin in isolated nuclei (16Kappes F. Burger K. Baack M. Fackelmayer F.O. Gruss C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26217-26323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Most of the DEK protein was released from nuclei after DNase treatment, whereas only around 10% was released after RNase treatment, indicating that the major fraction of DEK is associated with chromatin in vivo (16Kappes F. Burger K. Baack M. Fackelmayer F.O. Gruss C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26217-26323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Isolated DEK changes the topology of DNA in viral minichromosomes and reduces the accessibility of chromatin to binding factors, including components of the replication machinery (6Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the DEK-induced change in topology has not been investigated. We describe here that DEK changes not only the topology of nucleosomal DNA but of protein-free DNA as well. Glycerol gradients and electron microscopy showed that DEK induces distinct alterations of the DNA structure due to an introduction of constrained positive supercoils. We believe that these findings have profound implications for the current understanding of chromatin functions. The DEK gene was cloned in the pGEX3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate a GST1 fusion protein. The GST-DEK fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS. A standard preparation of GST-DEK was prepared from 1 liter of liquid culture in 2× YT media. Further purification steps were done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length DEK cDNA was cloned into pBlueBac His2A and cotransfected with linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (Bac-N-Blue DNA) into SF9 cells as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Passage level three virus stocks were used to infect HighFive cells for protein expression. After 2 days post-infection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mmNaCl; 5 mm KCl; 0.5 mm MgCl2; 1% Nonidet P-40; and 5 mm imidazole). Soluble His-tagged DEK was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Agarose (Qiagen) chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified GST-DEK protein was dialyzed on Whatman filters (Type VS, pore size, 0.025 μm) against buffer A-100 (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin (New England BioLabs) for 90 min at 4 °C. Salt-treated SV40 minichromosomes or SV40 DNA (17Gruss C. Knippers R. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 7: 101-113Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were incubated with the dialyzed GST-DEK protein for 1 h at 37 °C (molar ratios of DEK to DNA ranged from 10 to 234 mol of DEK/mol of DNA) in the presence of 12 ng of human topoisomerase I. The reactions were performed in buffer A-100, containing 0.2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 90 μl. Supercoiling reactions withEscherichia coli topoisomerase I were done in the presence of 6 mm MgCl2. After Proteinase K digestion, DNA was precipitated and analyzed on 0.8% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 2 V/cm for 16 h. 1.5 μg of salt-treated SV40 minichromosomes or SV40 DNA was incubated as described above, except that the reaction volumes were 500 μl. The samples were loaded on 10–35% or 5–60% glycerol gradients (for chromatin and DNA, respectively) (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 10 mmsodium bisulfite, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm or 700 mm NaCl as indicated) and run in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) for 4.5 h (minichromosomes) or 4 h (DNA) at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated in 600-μl fractions; proteins were precipitated according to the Wessel-Flügge method (18Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis and immunostaining with a DEK-specific antibody. The DNA was purified and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE at 2 V/cm for 16 h. Nucleosomal cores were reconstituted onto a 1000-bp fragment of SV40 DNA by using a modification of the salt dilution method (19Germond J.E. Hirt B.E. Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In a standard reconstitution reaction, histone octamers were mixed in an initial volume of 10 μl with 6 μg of the EcoRI/EcoRV fragment of SV40 DNA (1000 bp) in 2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA. Samples were diluted at successive intervals of 60 min to contain 1.12, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and finally 0.12 m NaCl in the same buffer at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min to remove aggregated material and stored on ice until use. SV40 DNA and SV40 minichromosomes were incubated with increasing amounts of DEK and human topoisomerase I. Unbound protein was removed by gel filtration through a Biogel A-5 column, and samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde (0.1% v/v) for 15 min at 37 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were spread by the alkyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride technique of Vollenweider et al.(20Vollenweider H.J. Sogo J. Koller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken with a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope. The enclosed area of nucleoprotein complexes was determined with the IMAGE program (National Institutes of Health), and length measurements were made with the AutoCAD program. 500 ng of SV40 DNA (forms I, II, and III) or SV40 minichromosomes was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-DEK for 1 h at 37 °C. Standard reactions contained buffer A-100 in a total volume of 30 μl. Binding of GST-DEK was analyzed on 0.6% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE at 3.5 V/cm for 4 h. Supercoiling reactions were performed as described above and run in the first dimension on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE at 2 V/cm for 16 h. The second dimension was run in the presence of 0.25 μg/μl chloroquine on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE plus 0.25 μg/μl chloroquine at 2 V/cm for 16 h. DNA was analyzed by Southern blot and hybridization with [32P]dATP-labeled HinfI-digested SV40 DNA, followed by autoradiography. XL-1 blue cells were transformed with pJW 312Sal. Purification of topoisomerase I was done from a 500-ml liquid culture exactly as described previously (21Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Proteins. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alexiadis et al.(6Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that incubation of SV40 minichromosomes with DEK, purified from human HeLa cells in the presence of topoisomerase I, causes a drastic change in superhelical density. However, in our initial experiments, we failed to detect DEK-induced changes of the topology of relaxed protein-free DNA and concluded that DEK acts in a chromatin-specific manner (6Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). This was clearly in contradiction to the experiments from the Markovitz group (12Faulkner N.E. Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who had demonstrated that DEK binds to DNA in a site-specific manner. To reinvestigate this point, we used mobility shift assays to compare the binding of DEK to protein-free DNA and to chromatin (Fig.1 A). DNA or chromatin was incubated with increasing amounts of the DEK protein, and the resulting nucleoprotein complexes were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A). We found that DEK binds to DNA and chromatin substrates with similar affinities producing multiple complexes whose mobility decreased with increasing protein concentration until saturation was reached. High amounts of DEK on protein-free DNA resulted in nucleoprotein complexes, which did not enter the gel. This indicates that DEK directs the formation of multimeric DNA complexes (compare Figs. 6 A, panel e, and Fig. 7, see below).Figure 6Electron microscopic analysis. SV40 DNA (A) and SV40 minichromosomes (C) were incubated in the absence (A and C, panel a) or presence of increasing amounts of DEK and visualized by electron microscopy (compare DEK/DNA ratios with Fig. 5).Bar, 100 nm. Note that the graph in C,panel f, represents a different magnification to visualize compacted chromatin together with protein-free DNA as spreading control.

A 1000-bp DNA fragment was incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of DEK (molar ratio: 27 pmol of DEK/mol of DNA) and topoisomerase I and visualized by electron microscopy. The length of molecules (given in scan units) without DEK was measured (= 153.03 ± 7.81 scan units; 29 molecules) and compared with DNA molecules uniformly covered by DEK (= 169.68 ± 31.52 scan units; 41 molecules) (upper panel). At a molar ratio of 54 mol of DEK/mol of DNA a heterogeneous population of molecules was observed due to intra- and intermolecular interactions induced by the DEK protein (middle panel). The 1000-bp fragment was reconstituted into chromatin by salt gradient dialysis, and the length of the resulting DNA fragments was measured (= 100.84 ± 20.9 scan units; 34 molecules) (lower panel).

In three independent experiments, we found that DEK binds with similar affinities to the three DNA structures tested. We next asked whether DEK is able to change the topology of protein-free DNA. For this purpose, we used increasing amounts of DEK, comparing protein-free SV40 DNA and SV40 minichromosomes as substrates in the presence of topoisomerase I. Deproteinized DNA was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (Fig.1 C). As in our previous experiments, we found no significant change in the topology of protein-free DNA at low DEK/DNA ratios. At these ratios a topological alteration of DEK-treated SV40 minichromosomes was observed. However, topological changes of protein-free DNA occurred at higher DEK/DNA ratios, reaching a maximal value at ratios between 52 and 78 mol of DEK/mol of DNA. Thus, about 2-fold higher amounts of DEK are necessary to change the topology of protein-free DNA compared with minichromosomes. Titration of topoisomerase I revealed that we used saturating amounts of topoisomerase I in our assays; a further increase did not affect the topoisomer ladder (data not shown). In kinetic experiments, we found that rates at which linking number changes were introduced into DNA were similar for protein-free DNA and SV40 minichromosomes (data not shown). The experiments shown here were performed with GST-tagged DEK protein purified from bacteria. To exclude an effect of the GST tag alone, we repeated the assays with recombinant His-tagged DEK expressed and purified from insect cells (Fig. 1 D). We found that the His-tagged DEK protein exhibited the same activity as the GST-tagged DEK protein, both in mobility shift assays (Fig. 1 D,left panel) and in topology assays (Fig. 1 D,right panels). Together with the experiments performed with untagged human DEK protein (6Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar), these data clearly demonstrate that the observed effects are solely due to the DEK protein itself."

The expression pattern of Ten-m/Odz in flies and mammals suggests important roles during as well as after development. InDrosophila embryogenesis, Ten-m/Odz is expressed in seven stripes during the blastoderm stage (12Baumgartner S. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and later also in the central nervous system (1Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Chiquet-Ehrismann R.

Expression studies of Ten-m1–4 in adult mouse tissues showed a widespread expression with the highest levels in the brain (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D.

Biol. 2000; 217: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In chicken, both teneurin-1 (corresponding to Ten-m1) and teneurin-2 (corresponding to Ten-m2) are expressed in neurons of the developing visual system (4Minet A.D. Rubin B.P. Tucker R.P. Baumgartner S. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2019-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, teneurin-2 mRNA and protein are also found in the developing limbs, somites, and craniofacial mesenchyme (7Tucker R.P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Chevron M.P. Martin D. Hall R.J. Rubin B.P. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During the segmentation period of zebrafish, Ten-m3 is expressed in the somites, notochord, pharyngeal arches, and the brain, whereas the expression of Ten-m4 is restricted mainly to the brain (10Mieda M. Kikuchi Y. Hirate Y. Aoki M. Okamoto H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the fly Ten-m/Odz revealed a crucial role during segmentation and identified the Ten-m/Odz gene as the first pair rule gene that does not encode a transcription factor. Loss of Ten-m/Odz results in a typical deletion of cuticle segments, which appear in a reiterative manner along the body axis of the hatched larvae (1Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The function of Ten-m/Odz genes in vertebrates, however, is unknown. It has been reported that various forms of stress including alkylating agents or UV light can trigger the activation of mouse Ten-m/Odz 4 (16Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The induction of rat neurestin (corresponding to Ten-m2/Odz 2) in external tufted cells during regeneration of olfactory sensory neurons suggests a possible function in synapse formation and morphogenesis (3Otaki J.M. Firestein S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of a splice variant of teneurin-2 in neuronal cells significantly increased the number of filopodia and the formation of enlarged growth cones (5Rubin B.P. Tucker R.P. Martin D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in actin dynamics. All four mouse Ten-m protein chains are 2700–2800 amino acids long and lack signal peptides at the NH2 terminus, but they contain short hydrophobic stretches characteristic of transmembrane proteins. These hydrophobic domains are present about 300–400 amino acids after the translation start. Approximately 200 amino acids COOH-terminal to this transmembrane region are eight consecutive EGF-like repeats. In all Ten-m/Odz genes the second as well as the fifth EGF module contain an odd number of cysteine residues. They mediate the covalent dimerization of two Ten-m proteins. The sequence similarity of the EGF repeats between the mouse Ten-m homologues ranges from 65 to 72%, whereas other parts are less conserved. The large COOH-terminal domains distal to the EGF repeats, for example, have similarities ranging between 58 and 68% (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently for chicken teneurin-2 that the large COOH-terminal domain, constituting about 70% of the molecular mass, can be spliced alternatively (7Tucker R.P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Chevron M.P. Martin D. Hall R.J. Rubin B.P. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Outside of the EGF repeats, the Ten-m/Odz family sequences bear no similarity to any other eukaryotic sequences (15Ben-Zur T. Feige E. Motro B. Wides R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the COOH-terminal part harbors 26 repetitive sequence motifs termed YD repeats, which are most similar to the core of therhs elements of Escherichia coli. Related repeats in toxin A of Clostridium difficile bind specific carbohydrates (4Minet A.D. Rubin B.P. Tucker R.P. Baumgartner S. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2019-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the properties of the extracellular domains of all four mouse Ten-m/Odz family members. They have essentially identical arrays of EGF repeats but show different cysteine patterns in the appending COOH-terminal domains. Ten-m2 and Ten-m4 contain an uneven number of this amino acid. We show that the recombinantly produced extracellular domains of Ten-m1–4 can form homodimers. Differences in the cysteine patterns in the globular COOH-terminal domains appear to affect the stability of the tertiary structures, whereas all four mouse Ten-m molecules share the same dimeric quaternary structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the Ten-m molecules have the ability to form heterodimers, a property allowing the formation of a multitude of molecules from a limited set of genes. The extracellular domains of Ten-m2 (starting at serine 572), Ten-m3 (starting at glutamic acid 513), Ten-m4 (starting at serine 564), and the globular COOH-terminal parts of Ten-m1 (Gten-m1; starting at glutamic acid 799) and Ten-m3 (Gten-m3; starting at glutamic acid 787) (Table I) were linked to the signal peptide of BM-40 via the sequence APLA (Ten-m3) (17Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or APLGRGSHHHHHHGGLA (Ten-m2, Ten-m4, Gten-m1, and Gten-m3), which can be detected by the anti-RGS (H4) antibody (Qiagen). The latter property allows affinity purification on Ni-NTA-Sepharose (Qiagen) (18Janknecht R. de Martynoff G. Lou J. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The DNA was inserted into a eukaryotic expression plasmid driven by a CMV promoter (pRC/CMV, Invitrogen) and containing a puromycin resistance gene (19Kohfeldt E. Göhring W. Mayer U. Zweckstetter M. Holak T.A. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Upon transfection into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293 cells, American Type Culture Collection) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) puromycin-resistant clones were isolated as described earlier (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified by 5% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting using mouse anti-RGS (H4) antibody (Qiagen, Stockholm, Sweden). For heterodimer analysis HEK-293 cells expressing the His-tagged extracellular domain of Ten-m2 were co-transfected with the non-His-tagged Ten-m1 or Ten-m3 extracellular domains, respectively, using the same eukaryotic expression vector described above (pRC/CMV, Invitrogen) but containing a neomycin resistance gene. Clones resistant to puromycin (1 μg/ml) as well as G418 (1.2 mg/ml) were identified by Western blot.Table IPredicted characteristics of the proteins expressed in HEK-293 cellsConstructNH2-terminal amino acidNH2-terminal sequenceCalculated molecular massPotential N-glycosylation sitesTen-m1E 526APLAE IMDDC STNCN GNGEC24713Ten-m2S 572APLGR GSHHH HHHGG LASVQ24513Ten-m3E 513APLAE SVVEC PRNCH GNGEC24613Ten-m4S 564APLGR GSHHH HHHGG LASVD24811Gten-m1E 799APLGR GSHHH HHHGG LAEML22013Gten-m3E 787APLGR GSHHH HHHGG LAETL21913The sequences derived from the respective mouse Ten-m cDNAs starts with the NH2-terminal amino acid as indicated.

The molecular mass was calculated on the basis of the NH2-terminal sequence and the Ten-M C-termini predicted from the respective cDNA sequences.

The procedure has been described as the rat lymph node method (20Kishiro Y. Kagawa M. Naito I. Sado Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) for raising monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Briefly, WKY/NCRj rats (Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan) were immunized in the hind footpads with the emulsion of the recombinant protein and Freund's complete adjuvant. Three weeks later the rats were killed, and lymphocytes from the medial iliac lymph nodes were fused with mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0-Ag14). Supernatants from hybridoma cultures were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the recombinant protein as immobilized ligand. A subsequent screening was performed by indirect immunofluorescence for Ten-m1 and Ten-m3 using sections from mouse testis and mouse brain, respectively. The specificity of the mAbs TO4 and HG31, which were raised against the extracellular domains of Ten-m1 and Ten-m3, respectively, were tested by Western assays using the recombinant extracellular domains of Ten-m1, Ten-m2, and Ten-m3. Briefly, 50 ng of purified recombinant protein was separated under nonreducing condition on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P,Amersham Biosciences) in Tris/glycine buffer containing 10% methanol for 1 h with 100 V using the Bio-Rad mini-gel system. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with protein G-purified TO4 (1:1000) and HG 31 supernatant (1:3000), respectively, and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk and the ECL+ detection system (AmershamBiosciences). Serum-free conditioned medium was dialyzed (three times, 6 h each time) against 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NEM, and 1 mmimidazole supplemented with freshly added 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1 ml of the Ni-NTA slurry was added to 50 ml of conditioned medium, incubated with Ni-NTA matrix at 4 °C for at least 6 h, loaded into an empty column, and washed 15 times the column volume with wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm NEM). The protein was finally released with 5 ml elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm NEM). The eluate was concentrated to less than 1 ml by centrifugation through membranes with a cut-off of 10 kDa (Amicon). The concentrated protein was applied to a Superose 6 column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm NEM. Fractions containing the purified molecules were dialyzed against with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and stored at −80 °C. For heterodimer analysis of recombinant Ten-m1 and Ten-m2, 1 ml of conditioned medium from the co-transfected cells was dialyzed against 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NEM, and 1% bovine serum albumin plus 20 mmimidazole, each for 6 h for three times at 4 °C and then incubated with Ni-NTA beads overnight. The beads were washed with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and finally eluted two times with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Specific bands were detected with TO4 (1:1000) mAb and anti-RGS (H4) (1:50,000) antibody on Western blot. To analyze the heterodimers of the extracellular domains of Ten-m3 and Ten-m2, 1 ml of serum-free conditioned medium of cotransfected cells or a mixture of 0.5 ml of recombinant Ten-m3 and 0.5 ml of recombinant His-tagged Ten-m2 was applied to Ni-NTA beads. The beads were washed with 20 mm imidazole and finally eluted two times with 250 mm imidazole. Bands were detected with HG31 (1:3000) mAb and anti-RGS (H4) (1:50,000) antibody by Western blot. N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) treatment (2 units) of 12 μg of purified recombinant extracellular domain of Ten-m1 or Ten-m2 was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5% octylglucoside, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm EDTA. Subsequently the samples were denatured by heating to 97 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. A Beckman model XLA analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics was employed. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed in 12-mm double sector cells at rotor speeds of 40,000 and 52,000 rpm. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 4,400 rpm using the same cells but at a filling height of 1.5–3 mm only. Sedimentation coefficientss 20, w are corrected to standard conditions (water at 20 °C) (21Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 98-120Google Scholar). The molecular masses, M, were calculated from sedimentation equilibrium runs using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorption to obtain the best linear fit of lnA versus r 2 (A = absorbance, r = distance from the rotor axis). A partial specific volume of 0.70 cm3/g was used, which was calculated for proteins with 30% glycosylation (22Ralson G. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA1993Google Scholar). Frictional ratiosf/f 0 were calculated from the sedimentation coefficients and molecular masses according to Van Holde (21Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 98-120Google Scholar), and axial ratios of ellipsoids of revolution a/b were determined from Perrin's table (21Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1971: 98-120Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing, negative staining, and evaluation of the data from electron micrographs were carried out as described previously (23Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For negative staining 5-μl samples of different Ten-m preparations (typical concentrations of about 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline) were adsorbed to 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, washed briefly with water, and stained on two drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. For glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing, Ten-m samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9. They were mixed with equal volumes of 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica pieces with a nebulizer designed for small volumes. They were dried in a high vacuum for 2 h and shadowed under rotation with 2 nm platinum/carbon at a 9° angle, followed by coating with a stabilizing 10-nm carbon film. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Molecular masses of globular protein domains from negatively stained images were estimated as described previously (23Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of Ten-m2, -m3 and -m4, starting with the first EGF module, were recombinantly expressed in HEK-293 cells and purified from serum-free conditioned culture medium. The rotary shadowing electron microscopic image showed that the recombinant extracellular domain of all mouse Ten-m family members form similar cherry-like structures of two globular domains connected by two extended rods (Fig. 1) as previously observed for the recombinant extracellular domain of Ten-m1 (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In some images the connecting part between the two globular domains was extremely extended. In such cases the distances between the two globular domains was up to 30 nm (Fig. 1). Separation of all four recombinantly expressed extracellular domains of the Ten-m family proteins by 6% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions revealed apparent molecular masses of about 225 kDa for all four Ten-m proteins (Fig. 2 A). Gel separation under nonreducing conditions showed significant differences in the migratory behavior of the four samples (Fig. 2 B) dividing the extracellular domains of the four Ten-m molecules into two subfamilies, one consisting of Ten-m1 and Ten-m4 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2), which migrate considerably slower on a 6% SDS-PAGE than the second subfamily, consisting of Ten-m2 and Ten-m3 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). In our previous study (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) Ten-m1 was proposed to be a dimer mainly on the basis of electron microscopic observations, although a thorough SDS-PAGE analysis with technically adequate markers had not been performed. Application of a 3–12% gradient SDS-PAGE allowed the extracellular domains of Ten-m1 to migrate 4.5 cm into the polyacrylamide gel and decreased the apparent differences between the migratory abilities of the extracellular domains of the Ten-m molecules (Fig. 2 C). Apparent molecular masses derived from this gel using laminin (850 kDa), nidogen (150 kDa), and myosin (200 kDa) for calibration were 550 kDa for Ten-m1 and Ten-m4 and 440 kDa for Ten-m2 and Ten-m3. For the later proteins an additional band was seen migrating with the same apparent molecular mass of 225 kDa as the reduced protein, thus probably corresponding to unlinked monomers. To test whether differential N-linked glycosylation was responsible for the observed differences, the recombinant extracellular domains of Ten-m1 and Ten-m2 were subjected to N-glycosidase F treatment. This treatment reduced the apparent molecular masses of both molecules to a similar extent on SDS-PAGE ruling outN-linked glycosylation as the cause of the different migratory behaviors (results not shown). Despite their different migratory abilities on SDS-PAGE, the extracellular domains of Ten-m proteins from the two different subfamilies had identical elution profiles when subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Superose 6 (results not shown). It is possible that molecular mass determination on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions might be affected by particular tertiary or quaternary structures, which could be expected to be more different in molecules with unrelated sequences, like Ten-m 1 and laminin, than in molecules with closely related sequences, like Ten-m1 and Ten-m2. To obtain an accurate molecular mass independent of the structural peculiarities of the subjected substance, we performed ultracentrifugation experiments. The equilibrium ultracentrifugation data showed that both the recombinant extracellular domains of Ten-m1 and Ten-m2 had under nonreducing condition approximately the same average molar mass of 500–550 kDa. Experimental values are M = 515,000 ± 60,000 for Ten-m1 and 545,000 ± 60,000 for Ten-m2 (Fig. 3). The comparison of these values with the calculated molecular mass of a single polypeptide chain of the recombinantly expressed sequence of Ten-m1 (247 kDa) and Ten-m2 (245 kDa), both containing 13 potential N-glycosylation sites (Table I), indicates that the extracellular domains of both Ten-m proteins assume a similar dimeric quaternary structure. This result underlines the observations using rotary shadowing electron microscopy (Fig. 1) and indicates that, despite their differences in mobility on SDS-PAGE, all Ten-m molecules are dimeric type II transmembrane molecules covalently linked only via their EGF module arrays. Sedimentation velocity experiments with the recombinant extracellular domains of Ten-m1 and Ten-m2 gave sedimentation coefficient values ofs 20, w = 15.4 and 16.2 S, respectively. Frictional ratios calculated with these values and M = 500,000 aref/f 0 = 1.23 and 1.17, respectively. This indicates an axial ratio a/b of about 4 for the hydrodynamic equivalent of the dimers, which is consistent with the asymmetric shape revealed by electron microscopy (see below). Because the EGF module arrays are best conserved in all Ten-m molecules (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), they are least likely to account for biophysical differences between the subfamilies. To test whether the large COOH-terminal globular domain following the EGF module array was responsible for the differences in migratory behavior, the COOH-terminal domain of one member of each subfamily of Ten-m1 and Ten-m3 was recombinantly expressed and analyzed. As observed previously, the secreted protein products showed a different migratory behavior on SDS-PAGE. Although the migration behavior of the COOH-terminal domain of Ten-m3 (Gten-m3) was similar under reducing and nonreducing condition, the COOH-terminal region of Ten-m1 (Gten-m1) migrated considerably slower under nonreducing conditions on a 6% SDS-PAGE (Fig.4, A and B). Again, on a 3–12% gradient gel the difference in migratory behavior between the nonreduced molecules appeared decreased (Fig. 4 C). The apparent molecular masses determined from this gel were 195 kDa for Gten-m3 and 300 kDa for Gten-m1, with a second, less distinct subpopulation of Gten-m1 of about 250 kDa, most likely representing proteolytically nicked material. Thus, the observed reduced mobility of the extracellular domain of Ten-m1 on SDS-PAGE was reflected in a similarly reduced mobility of its globular COOH-terminal part. The electron microscopic analysis of Ten-m1 by negative staining revealed that the large, globular COOH-terminal domain is composed of subdomains (14Oohashi T. Zhou X.H. Feng K. Richter B. Morgelin M. Perez M.T., Su, W.D. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Rauch U. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The subdomains were especially evident in preparations of the globular COOH-terminal domains alone (Fig. 4 D). In Gten-m1 preparations we could almost always observe two globular structures, wh"

Previously we showed that E10 splicing involved exon splicing enhancer sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of E10, an exon splicing silencer, a weak 5′ splice site, and an intron splicing silencer (ISS) within intron 10 (I10). Here, we identify additional regulatory sequences in I10 using both non-neuronal and neuronal cells. The ISS sequence extends from I10 nucleotides 11–18, which is sufficient to inhibit use of a weakened 5′ splice site of a heterologous exon. Furthermore, ISS function is location-independent but requires proximity to a weak 5′ splice site. Thus, the ISS functions as a linear sequence. A newcis-acting element, the intron splicing modulator (ISM), was identified immediately downstream of the ISS at I10 positions 19–26. The ISM and ISS form a bipartite regulatory element, within which the ISM functions when the ISS is present, mitigating E10 repression by the ISS.

The ISM and ISS form a bipartite regulatory element, within which the ISM functions when the ISS is present, mitigating E10 repression by the ISS. Additionally, the 3′ splice site of E10 is weak and requires exon splicing enhancer elements for efficient E10 inclusion.

MAPT, the gene encoding tau, has 15 exons, and transcripts of the gene are alternatively spliced to produce different isoforms (3Andreadis A. Brown W.M. Kosik K.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10626-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Isoform expression patterns are under developmental control (4Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D.

In adult human brain, five additional variants are expressed by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10. The conditional inclusion of exon 10 (E10), which encodes a MT-binding domain, generates tau isoforms with four MT-binding repeats (4R tau) compared with isoforms without E10 that have only three MT-binding repeats (3R tau). The neuropathological aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles occurs in several progressive dementias including Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism chromosome 17-type (FTDP-17) (6Buee L.

Two classes of tau mutations are defined by in vitro functional analyses. One class, represented by mutations G272V (E9), P301L, P301S, and Δ280K (E10), V337M (E12), and R406W (E13), results in tau with altered biochemical properties.

Most of these mutations increase E10 inclusion. The result is that the 4R/3R ratio, which is normally 1 (14Hong M. Zhukareva V. Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Wszolek Z. Reed L. Miller B.I. Geschwind D.H.

Thus, subtle alterations in the 4R/3R ratio lead to FTDP-17, a severe neurodegenerative disease. The FTDP-17 splicing mutations in E10 and I10 indicate that multiplecis-acting regulatory elements control E10 inclusion. Previous work demonstrated that E10 splicing is complex, involving exonic and intronic regulatory elements that interact to modulate use of the weak E10 5′ splice site (21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The exonic elements include three nonredundant exon splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences located within the first 45 bases of E10. These are a 5′ SC35-like sequence, apolypurine enhancer (PPE), and a 3′A/C-rich enhancer (ACE). Additional E10 elements include an exon splicingsilencer (ESS) and two adjacent 9-nucleotide positive sequences immediately upstream of the 5′ splice site. The I10 intronic regulatory element is the intron splicingsilencer (ISS) located downstream of the 5′ splice. FTDP-17 mutations affect six of these cis-acting regulatory sequences (see “Discussion”). In previous work, multiple cis-acting E10 regulatory elements were identified that interact with the weak 5′ splice site and the ISS (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here, the role of flanking intronic sequences on E10 splicing regulation is examined. The results show that both I9 and I10 sequences regulate E10 inclusion. In I10, a novel bipartite regulatory element composed of the inhibitory ISS and an adjacentintron splicing modulator (ISM) sequence affect E10 inclusion. The data are consistent with the ISS functioning as a linear element rather than through a secondary structure as previously proposed (7Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H.

A. 1998; 95: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The E10 3′ splice site, like the 5′ splice site, is also weak and its activity is dependent on E10 ESEs. Thus, there is a complex interplay between I9, E10, and I10 regulatory sequences that maintains the normal ratio of 4Rversus 3R tau. FTDP-17 mutations disrupt this complex regulatory system by multiple mechanisms leading to distinct disease phenotypes. Splicing was assayed using a derivative of vector pSPL3 called pSPES (21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). pSPL3 contains an HIV genomic fragment with a multiple cloning site (MCS) between highly truncated tat exons 2 and 3 fused to rabbit β-globin coding sequences (22Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). pSPES was generated from pSPL3 by deleting a 500-bp fragment between the EcoRV (nucleotide 1050) and StuI (nucleotide 1550) sites, removing a previously reported cryptic exon within the tat intron. Construct hN contains human tau E10 with 33 and 51 bp of flanking introns inserted into the MCS of pSPES as previously described (21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In hN and other similar tau constructs, the weak E10 5′ splice site activates a 60-bp cryptic exon between the MCS and the downstreamtat/globin hybrid exon 3. Modifications withintau sequences were performed by PCR mutagenesis (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Construct E10860 is identical to hN but with longer flanking I9 (567 bp) and I10 (190 bp) sequences. The E10860 insert was generated by PCR from PAC clone 4139 using forward primer I9AF (5′-GGACTAGTGAGACTGAAGCCAGACTCCTAGATT-3′) and reverse primer I10AR (5′-ATGCATCCTCACACTGGGAACAGTGGACCATG-3′). The PCR product was blunt-end ligated into the MCS of pSPES. Human β-globin exon 2 (βE2) with 42 and 14 bp of flanking introns was PCR amplified from PAC Pβ(BglII) using forward and reverse primers G1XhoF (5′-CCGCTCGAGCACTGACTCTCTCTGCCTATTGG-3′) and GE2BamR (5′-CGGGATCCCATAGACTCACCCTGAAGTTCTCACGATCC-3′), respectively. The PCR product was digested with XhoI/BamHI and inserted into the pSPES MCS to generate GE2. For cloning purposes, theBamHI site in βE2 was destroyed and a syntheticBamHI site introduced into intron 2 by incorporating point mutations (G to C) and (c to t) at βE2 position −14 and intron 2 position +15, respectively. Mutant GE2/ISS contains the ISS sequence 5′-tcacacgt-3′ inserted 10 bp downstream of βE2 using mutagenized primer GE2/ISS (5′-CGGGATCCACGTGTGAATAGACTCACCCTGAAGTTCTCACGATCC-3′) with G1XF. In mutant GE2/ISS+14 the ISS sequence was neutralized to 5′-tcatacgt-3′ by a point mutation (underlined). All sequences were confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing with BigDye (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using an ABI377 DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated six-well plates to achieve 70% confluence 1 day prior to transfection. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from post-natal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rat pups cultured for 5–7 days prior to transfection as previously described (23Chiu-Chan G. Hinds T.R. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5322-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells (5 × 105) were transfected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37 °C (5% CO2), after which 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Primary cortical neurons were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 10 μl of the polycationic liposomal reagent DOSPER (Roche) and incubated at room temperature for 30–45 min in a total of 60 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.56 mm Na2PO4, and 21 mm HEPES, pH 7.3). The DNA/DOSPER mixture was added to 1 ml of Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.32 mmglutamine. Culture medium was removed and stored before adding the DNA/DOSPER/Neurobasal mixture (23Chiu-Chan G. Hinds T.R. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5322-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 h, conditioned medium was added back to allow neurons to recover. RNA was isolated as previously described (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). E10 splicing was assayed by RT-PCR as previously reported (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The E10− and E10+ products as amplified by RT-PCR from transfected cells are 261 and 354 bp, respectively. For each mutant construct, values presented are the average of at least three different transfection experiments with the normal tau E10 or βE2 construct also transfected in parallel. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student's t test. Criteria for significance were calculated using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons by dividing the initial p value of 0.05 by the number of comparisons made. Intronic FTDP-17 mutations are clustered in an I10 inhibitory element designated the ISS (Fig.1 A). These mutations dramatically increase E10 inclusion in tau transcripts, demonstrating that I10 sequences regulate E10 inclusion. Whether I10 sequences downstream of E10+16 also contribute to E10 splicing regulation is unknown. Furthermore, the role of I9 sequences in E10 inclusion has not been examined. Two mechanisms for ISS regulation of E10 splicing have been proposed. One is that, normally, the ISS is part of a stem loop (Fig. 1 B) that blocks access of U1 snRNP to the 5′ splice site, thereby inhibiting use of this splice site and E10 inclusion (7Hutton M.

I10 FTDP-17 mutations disrupt base pairing in the stem, resulting in increased availability of the 5′ splice site and increased E10 inclusion. Three variations of the stem loop that differ in stem length have been proposed (7Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A.

The second hypothesis is that the ISS functions as a linear sequence that bindstrans-acting factors and that FTDP-17 mutations in I10 alter this protein-RNA interaction (11D'Souza I. Poorkaj P.

Here, experiments were designed to: 1) define the sequences required for ISS function, 2) identify additional I10 regulatory elements, 3) distinguish between the stem loop and linear models, and 4) determine whether I9 contributes to E10 splicing regulation. E10 splicing regulation was evaluated by transfecting COS-7, PC12, and rat primary cortical neuron cultures with vector pSPES containing E10 and portions of I9 and I10 inserted into an HIV tat intron between tat exons 2 and 3. E10 splicing was quantitated by RT-PCR assays of RNA from transfected cells. To determine the I10 sequences needed for regulated E10 splicing, a series of constructs were generated that differ only in the amount of I10 included (6B-37B, Fig. 1 A), and cloned into theXhoI/BamHI sites of the MCS of vector pSPES. The FTDP-17 mutation E10+3 was incorporated into a second set of constructs (6B3A to 37B3A) to determine whether the regulation of E10 splicing paralleled that observed in vivo in FTDP-17 patients with I10 mutations. The shortest constructs (6B and 6B3A) yielded only partial E10 inclusion, probably because positive downstream elements are missing (Fig. 1, C and D). Splicing was not influenced by the E10+3 mutation. The 12B and 12B3A constructs showed near-constitutive splicing, presumably because I10 nucleotides 7–12 contain a positive sequence and the ISS is missing. Construct 18B has reduced E10 inclusion, indicating that I10 nucleotides 13–18 contain part or all of the ISS. These sequences restore mutation-sensitive regulated E10 splicing (18B3A). Longer constructs (24B, 37B, and hN) yielded varied amounts of E10 inclusion percentages, indicating additional regulatory element(s) exist downstream of the ISS. To further refine the locations of the ISS and the positive regulatory sequences adjacent to the ISS, a series of deletions in I10 were constructed, beginning at position 7 and extending to 42 (Fig. 1 B). Deletion Δ7–10 removes 4 of 6 nucleotides from the loop sequence. The stem loop hypothesis predicts this deletion would destabilize the proposed secondary structure, causing E10 to oversplice. However, E10 inclusion was decreased when these 4 nucleotides were removed (Fig.2). Thus, the deleted nucleotides contain a positive element, a conclusion that is consistent with the results with constructs 6B and 12B (Fig. 1). Deletions Δ11–14 and Δ15–18 allow almost constitutive inclusion of E10 (Fig. 2). This phenotype is the same as yielded by FTDP-17 point mutations E10+12, E10+13, E10+14, and E10+16 (92, 91, 93, and 89% E10 inclusion, respectively; Ref. 21D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deletions Δ19–22 and Δ23–26, immediately downstream of the ISS, severely inhibit E10 inclusion, indicating that a previously unrecognized positive element is at nucleotides 19–26. Deletion Δ27–29 shows normal E10 inclusion and defines the 3′ boundary of this positive element. Key deletions Δ7–10, Δ12–18, and Δ19–22 were also tested in primary rat cortical cells, and the results were comparable with those from COS-7 and PC12 cells. Additional constructs were tested to refine the locations of the ISS and the downstream positive element. Deletion Δ7–11, designed to define the 5′ end of the ISS, slightly increased E10 inclusion compared with Δ7–10 (Fig. 2). It appears that ISS function is partially compromised in Δ7–11, which compensates for loss of the positive sequence located between positions 7 and 10. Thus, the functional ISS sequence begins at I10 position 11, a conclusion supported by FTDP-17 mutation E10+11A, that causes an increase in E10 splicing (25Miyamoto K. Kowalska A. Hasegawa M. Tabira T. Takahashi K. Araki W. Akiguchi I. Ikemoto A. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deletion Δ17–18, designed to define the 3′ end of the ISS, increased E10 inclusion. Thus, these 2 nucleotides are part of the ISS. The results from these deletions, from I10 FTDP-17 mutations, and the constructs in Fig. 1 (compare 12B, 18B, and 24B) define the ISS element as the sequence from 11 to 18. Additionally, these results demonstrate that there is positive element between 19 and 26. To determine whether the ISS and the positive 19–26 element interact, the ISS alone or both elements were deleted in mutant Δ12–18 and Δ12–24, respectively. Constitutive E10 incorporation was observed in both Δ12–18 and Δ12–24 (Fig. 2). Thus, removal of the ISS relieves inhibition of E10 inclusion regardless of the presence of nucleotides 19–26. Because the positive element functions only in the presence of an intact ISS (compare deletions Δ19–22 and Δ23–26 with Δ12–18) and appears to counteract ISS function (compare Δ19–22 and Δ23–26 with Δ12–18 and Δ12–24), it does not behave as a splicing enhancer per se, but rather as a modulator of ISS inhibition of E10 inclusion. Thus, the E10 19–26 element is designated the intron splicingmodulator (ISM). Further evidence supporting the existence of the ISM is the recent identification of an FTD mutation, E10+19G (Fig. 1 A). 2P. M. Stanford, J. B. J. Kwok, and P. R. Schofield, personal communication. This mutation decreases E10 inclusion (Fig.3), although not as dramatically as removing the entire ISM (Δ19–26, Fig. 2). It also appears that a purine at position 19 (mutants E10+19G and E10+19A, Fig. 3) compromises ISM function more effectively than a pyrimidine (E10+19T). The decrease in E10 spl"

Interaction of CAR with p160 coactivators and enhancement of CAR transactivation by the coactivators have been shown in cultured cells. In the present studies, the interaction of CAR with the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) was examined in vitro and in vivo. Binding of GRIP1 to CAR was shown by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down and affinity DNA binding. N- or C-terminal fragments of GRIP1 that contained the central receptor-interacting domain bound to GST-CAR, but the presence of ligand increased the binding to GST-CAR of only the fragments containing the C-terminal region. In gel shift analysis, binding to CAR was observed only with GRIP1 fragments containing the C-terminal region, and the binding was increased by a CAR agonist and decreased by a CAR antagonist. Expression of GRIP1 enhanced CAR-mediated transactivation in cultured hepatic-derived cells 2–3-fold. In hepatocytes transfected in vivo, expression of exogenous GRIP1 alone induced transactivation of theCYP2B1 PB-dependent enhancer 15-fold, whereas CAR expression alone resulted in only a 3-fold enhancement in untreated mice. Remarkably, CAR and GRIP1 together synergistically transactivated the enhancer about 150-fold, which is approximately equal to activation by PB treatment. In PB-treated mice, expression of exogenous CAR alone had little effect, expression of GRIP1 increased transactivation about 2-fold, and with CAR and GRIP, a 4-fold activation was observed. In untreated mice, expression of GRIP resulted in nuclear translocation of green fluorescent protein-CAR. These results strongly suggest that a p160 coactivator functions in CAR-mediated transactivation in vivo in response to PB treatment and that the synergistic activation of CAR by GRIP in untreated animals results from both nuclear translocation and activation of CAR.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Underlying the increase in most cases is an induction of the expression of cytochrome P450 genes. Different subsets of cytochrome P450 genes are induced by different chemicals. Recently, members of the nuclear receptor family that form heterodimers with RXR, including peroxisomal proliferator activating receptor α, pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor, and CAR,1 have been identified as mediators of the cellular response to xenobiotics (reviewed in Ref. 2Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors have relatively low specificity and affinity for their ligands so that they can be activated by a wide range of structurally diverse chemicals and thus comprise a broad response mechanism to xenobiotics.CAR has been identified as the mediator of induction ofCYP2B genes by the classical inducer of drug metabolism, PB. CAR was implicated in PB induction of CYP2B genes by the observation that CAR was selectively present in nuclear extracts from PB-treated animals and could bind to site with direct repeats separated by 4 base pairs (NR-1 and NR-2) in the CYP2B PB-responsive enhancer, termed PBRU or PB-responsive module (3Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, expression of CAR by transient or stable transfection could transactivate the PBRU or induce the expression of the endogenousCYP2B6 gene in HepG2 cells (4Honkakoski P. Moore R.

J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The loss of PB induction of Cyp2b genes in transgenic mice with a disrupted CAR gene provided conclusive evidence of an essential role for CAR in PB induction (8Wei P. Zhang J. Egan-Hafley M. Liang S. Moore D.D. Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).CAR is unusual among the nuclear receptors in that it has relatively high constitutive activity (9Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Grazia M. Martinoli G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The initial ligands identified for CAR, androstanes, inhibited rather than activated CAR so that CAR was considered constitutively active (10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The concentrations of androstanes required for inhibition were higher than physiological concentrations, so it was initially unclear how PB induction could be mediated by such a constitutive nuclear receptor. This was clarified by the observation that CAR in untreated animals or primary cultures of hepatocytes is predominantly located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in contrast to continuously cultured cells where it is located in the nucleus (11Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Treatment with PB resulted in translocation into the nucleus, which should be sufficient for transactivation of the PBRU because of its constitutive activity. Binding of PB to CAR was not detected, but binding of other PB-like ligands, such as TCPOBOP, was detected by several techniques, and activation of CAR by these ligands was implied by an increase in interaction with the coactivator SRC-1 in the presence of TCPOBOP (12Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 13Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B.

This led to a two-stage model for CAR activation in which (i) translocation into the nucleus was induced by PB-like inducers and (ii) CAR was directly activated by some of the inducers. The translocation was inhibited by okadaic acid, suggesting that phosphatase activity is required for the translocation (11Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and activation in the nucleus could be blocked by a Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, suggesting a role for phosphorylation in the activation (14Zelko I. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which CAR transactivates the PBRU is not clear. In transient transfections, in addition to the NR-1 and NR-2 CAR-binding sites, a nuclear factor 1 site between and sequences flanking these NR sites are required for maximal PB induction (4Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, CAR transactivation probably involves coactivator proteins. The p160 coactivator SRC-1 has been shown to bind to CAR both biochemically and in two-hybrid studies, and the binding was decreased by antagonists, androstanes, and increased by the agonist, TCPOBOP (10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,12Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of hepatocytes, SRC-1 expression alone increased transactivation of the PBRU but not a synthetic enhancer with two of the CAR NR-1 sites about 3-fold in untreated cells and similarly increased transcription 2–3-fold in cells expressing exogenous CAR (7Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p160 coactivators interact with and enhance transactivation by CAR, but the relatively small increases in transactivation mediated by overexpressed SRC-1 and the assay of activity in cultured hepatocytes in which the relative concentrations of regulatory factors may differ from hepatocytes in vivofall short of establishing a role for these coactivators in PB induction.SRC-1 is a member of a family of related p160 coactivators that includes SRC-1, TIF2/GRIP1, and RAC3/ACTR/pCIP/AIB-1 (18Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). GRIP1 has been shown to coactivate hepatic nuclear receptors, for example hepatic nuclear factor 4 (19Dong Y. McGurie J. Okret S. Poellinger L. Makino I. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1854-1859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Estabrook R.W. Hilderbrandt A.G. Baron J. Netter K.J. Leibman K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and thus is a potential coactivator for CAR in the liver. We now show that GRIP1 interacts with CAR and with DNA-bound CAR·RXR and that the binding is modulated by ligands. GRIP1 modestly enhances CAR-mediated activation in continuously cultured cells. Remarkably, in untreated mice, exogenous expression of GRIP1 in hepatocytes transfected in vivoincreases transactivation of the PBRU more than expression of CAR does, and coexpression with CAR results in a dramatic synergistic activation equal to that resulting from PB treatment. In PB-treated animals, exogenous expression of GRIP1 also results in a 2-fold increase in transactivation, whereas CAR has little effect and a 4-fold increase is observed if both exogenous CAR and GRIP are expressed.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have implicated p160 coactivators in the transactivation mediated by CAR, but these studies rested on showing interactions of SRC-1 with CAR alone (10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 12Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and modest increases in CAR transactivation resulting from overexpression of SRC-1 in cultured cells (7Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The present studies confirm the interaction of CAR with a p160 coactivator, GRIP1, and further show that GRIP1 interacts with CAR·RXR heterodimers bound to DNA, which is a more functional form of these nuclear receptors. CAR-mediated transactivation of either the PBRU (data not shown) or four copies of the CYP2B1 NR-1 was enhanced 2–3-fold by expression of GRIP1 in cultured cells. These results are similar to those obtained for the PBRU or βRARE sites when SRC-1 was coexpressed with CAR in primary cultures of hepatocytes or CV-1 cells, respectively (7Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), although transactivation of 2 NR-1 sites was not increased by SRC-1 in primary hepatocytes in contrast to the present results with four copies of the NR-1. Although CAR transactivation in cultured cells was only modestly enhanced by GRIP1, exogenous expression of GRIP1 in vivo in untreated mice increased transactivation by 15-fold and increased transactivation by 50-fold in cells exogenously expressing CAR. In PB-treated animals, exogenous expression of GRIP1 enhanced CAR transactivation about 2-fold. The dramatic 50-fold increase in CAR transactivation mediated by GRIP1 expression in vivo in the untreated animals, compared with 2–3-fold increases in cell culture, provides strong additional evidence for the role of p160 coactivators in PB induction of CYP2B genes. GRIP1 has been shown to activate hepatic nuclear receptors, and either the protein or mRNA was reported to be present in human or mouse liver (25Gervois P., Vu- Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), but it was recently reported that GRIP1 was not detectable in hepatic parenchymal cells using immunocytochemical techniques (28Puustinen R. Sarvilinna N. Manninen T. Tuohimaa P. Ylikomi T. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, either SRC-1 or AIB1/p/CIP/SRC-3, the latter of which is predominantly expressed inXenopus liver (29Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K., Na, S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), may function as the p160 form interacting with CAR in the liver.The binding of GRIP1 to GST-CAR in vitro was increased by the agonist TCPOBOP and decreased by the antagonist androstenol, which is consistent with earlier studies in which ligands modulated binding of SRC-1 to CAR (10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 12Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Interesting differences were observed in the binding between CAR and different fragments of GRIP1 containing the central receptor interacting sites and either the N-terminal portion or the C-terminal portion of molecule. Both types of fragments bound to CAR alone, but binding was modulated by ligand only for the C-terminal fragment. In gel shift assays, little binding of GRIP1 to CAR·RXR·DNA complexes was observed with the N-terminal fragment, but binding was observed with the C-terminal fragment even if only one of the three LXXLL motifs in the nuclear interaction domain was present. This binding was increased by the CAR agonist TCPOBOP and decreased by the antagonist androstenol. The role of LXXLL in binding of GRIP1 to CAR has not been established, but there appears to be little specificity for individual LXXLL motifs because mutation individually of each of the three LXXLL motifs in the nuclear receptor interaction domain did not alter the interaction of CAR and the related p160 coactivator from Xenopus, xSRC-3 (29Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K., Na, S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results suggest that effects on the binding of GRIP1 to CAR by ligands is mediated through the C-terminal portion of the molecule, analogous to ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, such as the steroid hormone receptors, and that the C-terminal portion is required for stable binding of GRIP1 to CAR under the conditions of the gel shift assay.It has been reported that exogenous expression of CAR inhibited PB induction of CYP2B1 in primary cultures of hepatocytes and that changing the PBRU NR-1 site to a βRARE site, which still binds CAR, eliminated PB induction (30Paquet Y. Trottier E. Beaudet M.-J. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38427-38436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results led to the proposal that CAR was not involved in PB induction of CYP2B genes. An alternate explanation of these results is that CAR is saturating in the nucleus after PB treatment, so that expression of additional CAR has little effect and may be inhibitory. The present result that exogenous expression of CAR in PB-treated animals does not increase transactivation unless GRIP1 is expressed exogenously as well provides support for this alternate explanation and suggests that the p160 coactivator is limiting relative to CAR in the PB-treated hepatocyte. The loss of PB induction in transgenic mice with disrupted CAR genes (8Wei P. Zhang J. Egan-Hafley M. Liang S. Moore D.D. Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and other studies showing that exogenous CAR expression increased transactivation of the PBRU in PB-treated primary cultures of hepatocytes or hepatocytes transfected in situ by bolistic particles (7Muangmoonchai R. Smirlis D. Wong S.C. Edwards M. Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) also support a role for CAR in PB induction. Possible explanations for the loss of PB induction observed with the conversion the PBRU NR-1 site to a βRARE site (30Paquet Y. Trottier E. Beaudet M.-J. Anderson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38427-38436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are that the conformation of CAR·RXR may be different when bound to the βRARE site (31Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or the alignment of CAR·RXR with other proteins binding to the PBRU may be changed (32Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), resulting in a loss of transactivation.The most surprising result in this study was the dramatic synergistic effects of exogenous CAR and GRIP1 expression in untreated animals resulting in a 150-fold increase in transactivation. The basis for the synergistic effect is most likely due to two effects of the expression of exogenous GRIP1, translocation of CAR to the nucleus, and direct activation of CAR by GRIP1. Exogenous expression of GRIP1 resulted in nuclear localization of GFP-CAR in essentially all of the transfected hepatocytes, although the extent of translocation was heterogenous and less complete than that observed in PB-treated cells. Direct activation of CAR by GRIP1 is about 2-fold based on the effects of GRIP1 in cultured cells and in PB-treated mice, so that most of the synergistic 150-fold effect in untreated animals is the result of translocation of CAR to the nucleus. Because in cultured cells, CAR is always present in the nucleus, the difference in localization of CAR explains most of the dramatic difference in magnitude of the GRIP1 effect in cultured cells and in vivo. In addition, the PBRU is a complex enhancer with DNA-binding proteins other than CAR contributing to the PB response, (4Honkakoski P. Moore R. Washburn K.A. Negishi M. Mol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and coactivators or cosuppressors other than the p160 coactivators may be also recruited to the PBRU. The differences in concentration of these factors in cultured cells and in vivomay contribute to the differences observed for the effects of GRIP1 expression in these two systems.These studies raise the possibility that PB activation of GRIP1 might contribute to the translocation of CAR to the nucleus after PB treatment. Although the action of PB is poorly understood, the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, inhibits CAR nuclear translocation (11Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The target of the phosphatase, presumed to be CAR, has not been directly identified. Precedents exist for modulation of GRIP1 activity by phosphorylation (33Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and for translocation of regulatory proteins by coregulators, for example translocation of histone deacetylase-4 by SMRT (silencing mediator forretinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor) (34Wu X., Li, H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), so that it is possible that dephosphorylation of a p160 coactivator could contribute to the PB response. An activated GRIP1 could mediate translocation of CAR either by interacting with cytoplasmic CAR and inducing nuclear translocation or by interacting with nuclear CAR and enhancing of nuclear retention of CAR. The latter mechanism would be possible if CAR is continuously shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm even in untreated animals as has been proposed for nuclear receptors (35Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 285-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Any GRIP effect on CAR nuclear translocation would have to be independent of its effect on activation of CAR because CAR with the C-terminal transactivation domain inactivated by deletion is still translocated to the nucleus (24Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Moore R. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to establish the mechanism by which p160 coactivators induce CAR nuclear translocation and the role of this effect in PB induction of CYP genes. In response to treatment with drugs or other xenobiotics, metabolism of the administered drug or other drugs is often increased (1Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 45: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Underlying the increase in most cases is an induction of the expression of cytochrome P450 genes. Different subsets of cytochrome P450 genes are induced by different chemicals. Recently, members of the nuclear receptor family that form heterodimers with RXR, including peroxisomal proliferator activating receptor α, pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor, and CAR,1 have been identified as mediators of the cellular response to xenobiotics (reviewed in Ref. 2Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors have relatively low specificity and affinity for their ligands so that they can be activated by a wide range of structurally diverse chemicals and thus comprise a broad response mechanism to xenobiotics. CAR has been identified as the mediator of induction ofCYP2B genes by the classical inducer of drug metabolism, PB. CAR was implicated in PB induction of CYP2B genes by the observation that CAR was selectively present in nuclear extracts from PB-treated animals and could bind to site with direct repeats separated by 4 base pairs (NR-1 and NR-2) in the CYP2B PB-responsive enhancer, termed PBRU or PB-responsive module (3Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, expression of CAR by transient or stable transfection could transactivate the PBRU or induce the expression of the endogenousCYP2B6 gene in HepG2 cells (4Honkakoski P. Moore R.

J. 2001; 355: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The loss of PB induction of Cyp2b genes in transgenic mice with a disrupted CAR gene provided conclusive evidence of an essential role for CAR in PB induction (8Wei P. Zhang J. Egan-Hafley M. Liang S. Moore D.D. Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). CAR is unusual among the nuclear receptors in that it has relatively high constitutive activity (9Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Grazia M. Martinoli G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The initial ligands identified for CAR, androstanes, inhibited rather than activated CAR so that CAR was considered constitutively active (10Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The concentrations of androstanes required for inhibition were higher than physiological concentrations, so it was initially unclear how PB induction could be mediated by such a constitutive nuclear receptor. This was clarified by the observation that CAR in untreated animals or primary cultures of hepatocytes is predominantly located in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in contrast to continuously cultured cells where it is located in the nucleus (11Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Treatment with PB resulted in translocation into the nucleus, which should be sufficient for transactivation of the PBRU because of its constitutive activity. Binding of PB to CAR was not detected, but binding of other PB-like ligands, such as TCPOBOP, was detected by several techniques, and activation of CAR by these ligands was implied by an increase in interaction with the coactivator SRC-1 in the presence of TCPOBOP (12Tzameli I.

Overexpression of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane drives receptor self-association in a concentration-dependent manner, which in turn leads to constitutive receptor activation. Subsets of human breast cancers contain a molecular alteration that leads toerbB2 gene amplification and subsequent protein overexpression. Although not recognized to occur in human cancers, mutation can also lead to increased ErbB2 association. A well characterized mutant of the rodent ortholog neu involves substitution of glutamate for valine within the transmembrane domain. In each case, a number of explanations have been proposed to explain the resulting ErbB2 activation. These include stabilization of receptor oligomers, release of negative constraints, and altered receptor conformations. Here we define a short amino acid segment comprising amino acids 966–968 in the intracellular domain that seemingly disrupts receptor-receptor association that is driven either by overexpression or mutation in the transmembrane region. Because of the hydrophobic nature of these amino acids (VVI), we propose that alteration of this segment likely results in a global conformational change in an area that has been proposed previously to be a dimerization motif for ErbB homomeric association.

Ligand-induced activation of these transmembrane growth factor receptors results in the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domains (ICDs) of the receptors themselves and occurs via transphosphorylation of homo- and heteromeric receptor complexes (1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The propensity of the ErbBs to form complexes is integral to their function as signal transducers. A distinguishing characteristic of ErbB2 is that unlike the other ErbB receptors, it lacks the ability to bind a specific ligand. ErbB2 instead is indirectly activated in a ligand-dependent manner via formation of heteromeric complexes with other ErbB family members and thereby responds to the respective ligand (2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5605) Google Scholar). In fact, ErbB2 is the preferred heterodimeric partner (3Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that its normal role is that of an activation partner for the other ErbB family members (4Klapper L.N. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G.C. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4995-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ErbB2 functions primarily in this context by providing an active tyrosine kinase. This is best exemplified by the most active ErbB heteromer, the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex (5Riese D.J.I. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 6Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) by providing an active kinase and by enhancing HRG binding to ErbB3 (10Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III., K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Karunagaran D.

Both of these characteristics contribute to the signal amplification effect of ErbB2 when it is part of a heteromeric complex. Although EGFR and ErbB4 are fully functional kinases, association with ErbB2 also results in receptor complexes that are more responsive to ligand stimulation and have greater and more sustained signaling effects (12Jones J.T. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 13Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore heteromeric association with ErbB2 increases the signaling repertoire by providing additional SH2 docking sites beyond those present on the partner receptor (16Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent activation of ErbB2, as the name implies, occurs in the absence of ligand and is unique to the ErbB2 receptor. Activation by this mechanism results when ErbB2 receptors self-associate. It is generally thought that overexpression of ErbB2 results in dimerization/oligomerization. In cell culture models, moderate overexpression of ErbB2 fails to cause transformation in NIH3T3 cells, whereas high overexpression is transforming (17Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O.

Biol. 1990; 10: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The clinical significance of this laboratory observation is underscored by the fact that the erbB2 gene is frequently amplified in a subset of women with primary breast cancer (19Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9905) Google Scholar, 20Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E.

This molecular alteration leads to overexpression and correlates with a particularly aggressive phenotype (21Seshadri R. Firgaira F. Horsfall D. McCaul K. Setlur V. Kitchen P. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 10: 1936-1942Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). An alternative mode of ligand-independent homodimerization is also observed when rats are treated with a carcinogen. In this case a mutation in the transmembrane domain, the rat neu mutation (V664E), is generated (22Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 23Burke C. Stern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5371-7379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and results in constitutive receptor activation and the formation of neuroglioblastomas (24Padhy L.C. Shih C. Cowing D. Finkelstein R.

Although the functional contribution of specific domains to overall receptor activation has been studied in detail for the ErbB receptors, the paucity of structural data for this receptor family has made it difficult to elucidate specific activation mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that ligand binding is a prerequisite for activation of ErbB1, ErbB3, and ErbB4 in both homomeric complexes as well as heteromeric complexes in which ErbB2 is the partner receptor. Ligand binding requires extracellular domain (ECD) subdomains I and II for HRG binding to ErbB3 (26Singer E. Landgraf R. Horan T. Slamon D. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44266-44274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas subdomains I and III (27Lax I. Bellot F. Honegger A.M. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Harte M.T. Gentry L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are required for EGF binding to EGFR. However, complete receptor activation also requires sequences in the C terminus (13Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol.

Based on the distinctive nature of ErbB2 activation, we have examined a sequence in the ICD that may be important for ligand-independent ErbB2 activation. Specifically, we have targeted a region of the C terminus previously shown to be important for the ErbB2 transactivation capability of the other ErbB family members (29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that a three-amino acid sequence comprising amino acids 966–968 may be part of a larger dimerization motif. Cells were maintained in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50:50) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. K562 cells are hematopoietic cells that do not express ErbB receptors. ErbB2-neu (C18) rabbit polyclonal and ErbB3 (C17) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FLAG mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma, and glycoprotein D (gD) antibodies were generated at Genentech (31Paborsky L.R. Fendly B.M. Fisher K.L. Lawn R.M. Marks B.J. McCray G. Tate K.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C.M. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, subconfluent cells were serum-starved in F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50:50) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in RPMI 1640 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% CHAPS, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, protease inhibitor mixture I (Calbiochem), and 1 mm pervanadate. Lysates were then clarified for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis. The membrane was blocked with TBST (10 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 3 h. Membranes were probed with anti-ErbB antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST, incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody diluted 1:20,000 for 1 h at room temperature, and washed an additional five times. Membranes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak-X-Omat LS film (Kodak). ErbB2 and mutant constructs were expressed using a pRK mammalian expression vector as described previously by Schaefer et al. (29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The endogenous signal sequence of ErbB2 was replaced with the herpes simplex signal sequence of gD for quantitative analysis (32Lasky L.A. Dowbenko D.J. DNA. 1984; 3: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. K562 cells were transiently transfected using superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, subconfluent cells were rinsed once with Hepes buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes). BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) (Pierce) was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After cross-linking the cells were rinsed with Tris saline and lysed in RPMI 1640 lysis buffer. A previous detailed study of the ErbB3 ICD revealed that a three-amino acid sequence, LVI (residues 957–959), is critical for ErbB2 transactivation (29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutation of an identical segment in EGFR or ErbB4 yielded similar results. To investigate the role of the corresponding sequence in ErbB2 VVI (residues 966–968), these residues were mutated to alanines. The effect of this ErbB2-VVI/AAA mutation on ligand-independent activation was assessed initially by comparing the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the mutant ErbB2 (ErbB2-VVI/AAA) with that of the wild-type receptor. Although overexpression of wild-type ErbB2 in COS-7 cells displays the characteristic phosphorylation pattern representative of constitutive ErbB2 activation, similar overexpression of ErbB2-VVI/AAA fails to show any phosphorylation (Fig. 1). These results indicate that mutation of the VVI sequence abolishes the ligand-independent activation that is characteristic of ErbB2 overexpression. An alternative mechanism of ligand-independent ErbB2 activation is the characteristic rat neuroglioblastoma mutation,neu (24Padhy L.C. Shih C. Cowing D. Finkelstein R. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 865-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In rodents, this activation mutation occurs within the TM region at residue 664, where the wild-type valine is replaced by glutamate. The corresponding residue in human is Val659. To address whether mutation of the ICD VVI (966–968) sequence would alter activation by a TM mutation, these three amino acids all were mutated to alanine in the context of the V659E TM mutation. ErbB2, ErbB2-V659E, or ErbB2-V659E/VVI-AAA each were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the tyrosine phosphorylation status was monitored by immunoblotting. As expected the ErbB2-V659E was constitutively phosphorylated to a greater degree than wild type. Surprisingly, ErbB2-V659E phosphorylation was blocked by the VVI→AAA mutation, providing additional evidence to support the notion that the VVI sequence is critical for ligand-independent ErbB2 activation. (Fig. 1). The constitutive activation of ErbB2 that results from overexpression or mutation of the transmembrane domain is a consequence of constitutive self-association. We therefore went on to investigate whether mutation of the ICD VVI sequence disrupts ErbB2 activation by disrupting self-association. To address whether the ErbB2-VVI/AAA mutation affects the formation of an active complex, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed on COS-7 cells expressing ErbB2, ErbB2-VVI/AAA, ErbB2-V659E, or ErbB2-V659E-VVI/AAA. As shown in Fig.2 A, cross-linking studies using cells overexpressing ErbB2 or ErbB2-V659E followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated complexes are formed. However, neither the ErbB2-VVI/AAA nor the ErbB2-V659E/VVI-AAA mutants of these receptors formed tyrosine-phosphorylated complexes (Fig. 2 A). Immunoprecipitation of these complexes using ErbB2 antibodies and Western blotting with a second specific ErbB2 antibody demonstrated that the absence of activated complexes is due to the inability to associate (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that mutation of the VVI sequence disrupts the ability of ErbB2 to self-associate regardless of whether the association is caused by ErbB2 overexpression or mutations in the transmembrane domain. The inhibition of homomeric association could not be attributed to the lack of receptor expression at the cell surface because indirect staining of transfected cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showed that wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed at comparable levels at the cell surface (data not shown). These results suggest that although sequences in the transmembrane domain are important for homomeric association, the VVI sequence, or more likely a region that encompasses this sequence in the ICD, may be more critical. Having established that ErbB2-VVI/AAA blocks autophosphorylation and self-association that normally results from overexpression or mutations in the transmembrane domain, we wanted to further investigate the role that this region plays in ErbB2 association. Specifically, we wanted to know whether the inhibition of receptor association could be attributed directly to the VVI sequence or if inhibition is an indirect effect. To address whether autophosphorylation is required for ErbB2 self-association, an ErbB2 construct lacking kinase activity was examined for its ability to self-associate. The critical Lys732 at the ATP binding site was mutated to methionine, and this mutant has been designated ErbB2-KD. COS-7 cells were transfected with vector, ErbB2, ErbB2-VVI/AAA, or ErbB2-KD, and cross-linking experiments were performed. As before, the formation of oligomeric complexes was assessed by ErbB2 immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type ErbB2 and kinase-dead ErbB2 effectively formed oligomers. The slight increase (∼25%) in oligomer formation observed with the kinase-dead mutant has been reported previously (33Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and is likely due to the increased expression of this particular mutant. In contrast, the ErbB2-VVI/AAA did not form oligomers. These results suggest that inhibition of association cannot simply be attributed to the absence of autophosphorylation, as the kinase-dead ErbB2 still associates. Because ErbB2 can be activated by both ligand-independent and -dependent mechanisms, we investigated whether the ErbB2 VVI sequence plays a role in ligand-dependent activation. Ligand-dependent activation of ErbB2 by HRG and ErbB3 has been well characterized. Each receptor in the ErbB2-ErbB3 complex is critically dependent upon one another. Activation of ErbB2 requires the ErbB3-dependent ligand association, and ErbB3 requires the active ErbB2 tyrosine kinase to initiate signal transduction cascades. To investigate whether the VVI sequence is required for ligand-dependent ErbB2 activation we analyzed the effect of mutation of the VVI sequence of ErbB2 on HRG-dependent ErbB3-ErbB2 activation. Wild-type ErbB2 or mutant ErbB2 constructs were co-expressed with ErbB3 in hematopoietic cells engineered to express only ErbB3 (K562erbB3). Specifically, the effect on receptor phosphorylation in response to the ErbB3 ligand, HRGβ1, was assessed following transfection with wild-type ErbB2, a kinase-deficient mutant of ErbB2, or the ErbB2-VVI/AAA mutant. Similar to the results obtained with the COS-7 ErbB2-VVI/AAA-overexpressing cells, there was no autophosphorylation of ErbB2-VVI/AAA when it was overexpressed. Furthermore, even in the presence of ligand, the level of ErbB2-VVI/AAA phosphorylation was reduced to such a level that only upon extended exposure was there any evidence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB2-VVI/AAA (Fig.4 A). As expected the ErbB3 was phosphorylated by wild-type ErbB2 in response to HRGβ1, but surprisingly ErbB3 also was phosphorylated by ErbB2-VVI/AAA in response to ligand stimulation, albeit to a lesser degree (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells co-transfected with ErbB3 and ErbB2 mutant constructs (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the ErbB2 kinase activity was still functional. Mutation of the VVI sequence blocked homomeric association and activation but had only modest effects on the activation of heteromeric complexes. Previously, we have reported that a corresponding sequence in ErbB3 is obligatory for transactivation by ErbB2 (29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on the evidence that mutation of VVI blocked ligand-independent ErbB2 activation by disrupting receptor association, we addressed whether the differences in ligand-dependent versusligand-independent phosphorylation may be attributed to differences in the ability of the VVI mutant to form complexes. Cross-linking was performed on HRGβ1-stimulated cells expressing ErbB3 and either wild-type ErbB2 or mutants of ErbB2. Immunoprecipitation of ErbB2-ErbB3 complexes demonstrate that mutation of the VVI sequence of ErbB2 does not abrogate the formation of hetero-association. The ability of ErbB2-VVI/AAA to form complexes with ErbB3 is partially reduced relative to wild-type ErbB2, but clearly complexes are formed (Fig. 5 A). These results were confirmed using 125I-labeled HRGβ1 followed by cross-linking (data not shown). Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation status of ErbB3 in these cross-linked complexes correlated with the hetero-oligomer formation (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the region encompassing the VVI may play a less critical role in ligand-dependent ErbB2 activation than in ligand-independent ErbB2 activation. Ligand-independent ErbB2 activation occurs in a threshold-dependent manner when the protein is expressed at abnormal levels. This activation is caused by its self-association at the plasma membrane (34Brennan P.J. Kumogai T. Berezov A. Murali R. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6093-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although various aspects of the ligand-independent activation process are known, a number of the molecular details are uncertain. The roles that various receptor subdomains play in this activation process have been examined. For example, analytical ultracentrifugation studies with recombinant ErbB2 ECD fail to demonstrate significant dimerization (35Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Philo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24604-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutive homodimerization and activation are observed with ErbB2 mutant proteins that lack the ECD (36Segatto O. King C.R. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5570-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or with the closely relatedv-erbB (37Adelsman M.A. Huntley B.K. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2533-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that interactions within the C-terminal region of ErbB receptors are sufficient for constitutive activation. Moreover, it is known that the kinase domains, but not the kinase activities, are important for oligomerization (30Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the C-terminal autophosphorylation sites may negatively regulate cellular transformation (38Akiyama T. Matsuda S. Namba Y. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of these sites may eliminate this negative regulation (39Qian X. O'Rourke D.M. Zhao H. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2149-2157PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that segments within the intracellular domain contain sequences necessary for oligomerization and that this motif is distinct from the catalytic or tyrosine phosphorylation domains. Our present study lends credence to this hypothesis and suggests that major determinants of this motif may encompass amino acid residues that reside between the kinase domain and the C-terminal phosphorylation sites. In previous studies with ErbB3, EGFR, and ErbB4, we identified a region in the ICD that was required for transactivation of ErbB2 (29Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we extend these findings and demonstrate that a similar region in ErbB2, composed of amino acids 966–968, is essential for homomeric association. Given the hydrophobic nature of this short sequence (VVI), it is unlikely that these residues are surface-exposed and form the sole contact region involved in a protein-protein interaction. Rather, we hypothesize that the VVI segment is buried within a hydrophobic core of the cytoplasmic domain and that replacement of these residues with alanines results in a global conformational or orientational change in protein structure. Recently, we have determined the crystal structure for the EGFR kinase domain. 2J. Stamos, M. X. Sliwkowski, and C. Eigenbrot, manuscript in preparation. Consistent with this hypothesis the corresponding tripeptide in EGFR, Leu979-Val980-Ile981, is buried in a hydrophobic pit with Met884 at the bottom. It is conceivable that disruption of this region may prevent inter-receptor interactions that stabilize the homo-oligomer directly, may act indirectly to prevent binding of adapter molecules that facilitate these interactions, or may block stabilizing interactions in other parts of the receptor. The importance of this region for homomeric association is supported by our results using the ErbB2-V659E mutant. This well characterized mutant exhibits greater constitutive activation and oligomerization relative to wild-type ErbB2 because of an alteration within its TM domain that favors stabilization of homodimer formation (22Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 40Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A widely accepted mechanistic explanation for these observations is that this mutation stabilizes TM interactions (41Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 587Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, Mendrola et al. (42Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) measured TM dimerization using the TOXCAT system. Surprisingly these investigators demonstrate that the ErbB2-V659E mutant does not directly enhance TM dimerization. They propose that the greater extent of dimerization seen in the V659E mutant of ErbB2 is caused by changes in the relative orientation of the dimerization interface. The TM domain itself, however, does actively drive the process. Our results corroborate this hypothesis. We show that mutation of the VVI sequence in the context of the V659E mutant abrogates constitutive oligomerization. Evidently, interactions within the ICD of ErbB2 are critical for homomeric association and are profoundly affected by mutation of the VVI sequence. In contrast to homomeric association, ligand-dependent ErbB2 heteromeric association is likely initiated by interactions involving the ECD (43Qian X. O'Rourke D.M. Fei Z. Zhang H.-T. Kao C.-C. Greene M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 574-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ligand binding may induce a conformational change that drives heteromeric association directly, or it may release a negative constraint that allows positive interactions to occur between receptor ECDs and possibly between other domains as well (44Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In either case, contacts within the ICD probably contribute to the overall stability of the complex. For instance, the ErbB2-VVI/AAA mutant can still phosphorylate ErbB3 in a ligand-dependent manner, albeit at reduced levels. Our results taken with those of others imply that receptor association may result from the combined effects of multiple different domain-domain interactions (43Qian X. O'Rourke D.M. Fei Z. Zhang H.-T. Kao C.-C. Greene M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 574-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 45Qian X. Dougall W.C. Fei Z. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the relative importance of these subdomain interactions may be different for ErbB2 homomeric versus heteromeric association with other ErbB receptors. We postulate that ErbB2 self-association is initiated by interactions arising in the ICD and that critical contacts within the TM region stabilize this association. The stabilizing effects of these TM interactions can be enhanced by a number of mutations including the well characterized V659E mutation or by the judicious introduction of disulfide bonds (23Burke C. Stern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5371-7379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cao H. Bangalore L. Dompe C. Bormann B.J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20489-20492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of amino acids 966–968 in ErbB2 overrides the effect of the V659E mutation, suggesting that TM interactions alone are insufficient to drive ErbB2 association. The observation that membrane-bound forms of ErbB receptors lacking their ECD are constitutively active suggests that the ECD is dispensable with regard to ligand-independent ErbB2 association and may negatively regulate ErbB2 homodimerization (36Segatto O. King C.R. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5570-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, several lines of evidence suggest that ligand-dependent ErbB2 association is driven primarily by interactions occurring in the ECD. First, membrane-associated receptors lacking ICDs still form complexes in a ligand-dependent manner. Additionally, soluble heteroreceptors that are predimerized display high affinity binding sites that are characteristic of heterodimers (47Fitzpatrick V.D. Pisacane P.I. Vandlen R.L. Sliwkowski M.X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This view of ligand-activated hetero-association is consistent with the flexible rotational model that was recently proposed by Moriki et al.(48Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1011-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) for EGF binding to the EGFR. In summary, our results lend support to the concept that a dimerization motif exists within the ICD of ErbB2. At present the location of this motif is roughly assigned between the kinase domain and the tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We suspect that amino acids 966–968 are within this motif and play a critical role in maintaining a conformation that is necessary to facilitate receptor self-association and subsequent constitutive activation. Disruption of critical ICD interactions may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer patients whose tumors contain molecular alterations that result in ErbB2 protein overexpression.

Open table in a new tab Carrier UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine was prepared according to Radika and Raetz (30Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine was synthesized by coupling [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate to UMP-morpholidate (20Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4846-4851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, the [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate was prepared according to Radika and Raetz (30Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a yield of 2 × 107 cpm of [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate per mCi of input 32Pi used to label a culture of mutant MN7 (31Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nishijima M. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the material was dried under a stream of N2. The [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate was resuspended and dispersed by sonic irradiation in 1 ml of anhydrous pyridine (99.8%; Aldrich), containing 1.5 mg of UMP-morpholidate. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the reaction went to 60–90% completion. The reaction volume was reduced to 200 μl under a stream of N2 and applied in a thin line to a 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. The line was dried with a cold air stream. The plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v) and dried again under a stream of cold air for about 20 min. The plate was then exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak BioMax MR Film) for 15 min to locate the [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine band. The plate was sprayed with a fine mist of water, and the silica containing the [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine was scraped off with a sharp blade. The silica powder was placed into a 10-ml glass pipette that was plugged with glass wool and washed with 20 ml of CHCl3. The [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine was then eluted with 12 ml of a single phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (33Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar), consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v), and the effluent was collected in 12 1-ml fractions. The amount of radioactivity in each fraction was monitored with a Geiger counter. The most radioactive fractions (typically the first ten) were pooled, mixed, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge. The supernatant was separated from the pellet of residual silica particles and placed in a fresh tube. It was then divided equally into three 10-ml-thick walled Pyrex glass tubes, cooled in a dry ice/acetone mixture, and dried down using a vacuum pump. The lipid in each tube was dispersed in a small volume of 10 mm BisTris, pH 6, to obtain 20,000 cpm/μl and stored at −80 °C. Prior to assay it was dispersed by sonic irradiation in a bath apparatus. Approximately 1 × 107 cpm of [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine was usually obtained (∼50% yield). The conversion of [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate was monitored by thin layer chromatography followed by PhosphorImager analysis. The standard reaction mixture contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 100 μm[β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine (1000 cpm/nmol). The lipid substrates were subjected to sonic irradiation for 2 min prior to their addition to the reaction mixture. Protein in the amount of 0.1–500 μg/ml (depending on the extract) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for various times at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by spotting portions of the reaction mixtures onto Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates. The plates were dried under a cold air stream, developed in the solvent chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v), dried again, and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager screen overnight at room temperature. The screen was analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) for the Macintosh. KB1 was constructed by P1 vir transduction (29Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) of thecdh::Tn10 mutation from JB1104 (17Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11257-11264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into W3110. P1 vir lysates of JB1104 were made by infecting the strain with a P1 vir bacteriophage stock (7 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) generously provided by Dr. R. Webster, Duke University (29Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Transduction ofcdh::Tn10 into W3110 was confirmed by growth on Luria broth plates containing tetracycline and concomitant loss of Cdh-mediated UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase activity in cell extracts. Cdh activity was monitored radiochemically, as described above, by following the conversion of [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate. Fresh lysates of the Kohara λ library were made according to the methods described previously (25Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 26Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Thecdh-deficient E. coli strain KB1 was used as the host for infection. Each lysate was assayed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 8 μl of cell lysate, 25 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.0, and [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine (2000 cpm/nmol). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2.5 h in 96-well microtiter plates and stopped by spotting 5-μl portions onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The plates were dried under a stream of cold air, developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v), dried again, and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) screen overnight. Conversion of [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate was quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Most recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli W3110 chromosomal DNA was isolated according to Ausubel et al. (35-Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Qiaex II Gel Extraction Kit was used to extract DNA from agarose gels (Qiagen). CaCl2-treated competent cells were used for the transformation of plasmid DNA (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gene encoding the UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase, ybbF (28Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar), was cloned into the pET21a+ cloning vector (Novagen). This vector has a T7lac promoter for tight transcriptional control. PCR was used to amplify ybbF from W3110 chromosomal DNA.Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's specifications. The sequence of the forward primer, introducing an NdeI site, is 5′-GCC CGC GCA TAT GGC GAC ACT CTT TAT TGC-3′. The sequence of the reverse primer, which introduces aBamHI site, is 5′-GGC GGG GAT CCT TTA AAA CGG AAA ATG-3′. The NdeI site includes the start codon for ybbF, whereas the BamHI site is immediately downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was electrophoresed using a 1% agarose gel. The 723-bp piece was extracted from the gel using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. Both the PCR product and pET21a+ were then digested with BamHI and NdeI. The digestion products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and extracted from the gel using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. The plasmid was then dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The digested ybbF PCR product and the dephosphorylated vector were ligated together with T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C overnight. The ligation reactions were then transformed into competent E. coli XL1Blue (Stratagene) cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these colonies using the Qiagen Mini-Prep Kit. The plasmids were digested with NdeI and BamHI and electrophoresed again on a 1% agarose gel to identify those plasmids containing the 723-bp ybbF insert. The desired plasmid was designated pKJB2, and its sequence was confirmed. The pKJB2 plasmid was transformed into competent cells of E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen), and colonies resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol were selected. A 5-ml culture of BLR(DE3)pLysS/pKJB2 was grown overnight at 37 °C. A portion of this was used to inoculate a 1-liter culture at an A 600 of 0.01. This was grown at 37 °C. When the A 600reached 0.6, a 50-ml portion was transferred to a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, and IPTG was added to the remaining 950 ml at a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown for an additional 3 h. The control strain, BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET21a+, was grown in a similar manner. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min. The cells were washed with 100 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 30 ml of the same buffer. Cells were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 pounds/square inch. To obtain cell-free crude extracts, the suspension was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cell-free crude extracts of BLR(DE3)pLysS/pKJB2 were obtained from 1 liter of cells induced with 1 mm IPTG. The membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from the crude extracts by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was placed into a fresh tube, and the membrane fraction was resuspended by homogenization in 5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The soluble and membrane fractions were centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final cytosol (twice centrifuged) and the washed membranes were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The washed membranes and the residual membranes recovered from the second centrifugation of the cytosol were resuspended by homogenization in 1.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. A portion of the final cytosol containing 50.4 mg of protein was adjusted to 40 ml to yield a final concentration of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol. A 15-ml column (1.5-cm diameter) of Reactive Green 19 (Sigma) was washed at 4 °C with 20 column volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The resin was then equilibrated with 20 column volumes of a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol at 1.5 ml/min. The cytosol described above was applied to the column at the same flow rate, and the column was washed with 10 volumes of the equilibration buffer. The protein was eluted by applying 5 column volumes each of the above buffer, containing either 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 m NaCl. Sixty fractions (about 7 ml each) were collected. The peak of enzyme activity was determined by assaying each fraction under standard conditions for the conversion of [β-32P]UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to [32P]2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate. In addition, the proteins in the samples were visualized by 12% SDS-PAGE, using the Laemmli buffer system (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Fractions 40–44 contained most of the active LpxH and were pooled. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Enhanced Standard Protocol. The partially purified protein was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. For NMR analysis of the reaction products generated by LpxH in the presence of H218O, a 1.2-ml solution containing 0.5 mm UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine, 25 mm HEPES, pH 8, 40% H218O (95%, Isotec) and 2 μg/ml partially purified LpxH was incubated at 30 °C for 5 h. A second reaction mixture with the same components in 100% H216O was incubated in parallel. Complete conversion of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate and UMP was achieved in both cases. Each reaction was converted to a single phase Bligh-Dyer mixture, consisting of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v), by addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3 and 3.0 ml of CH3OH. These were converted into acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixtures by the further addition of 1.5 ml of CHCl3, 1.5 ml of H2O, and 75 μl of concentrated HCl. In an acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer system, the 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate partitions into the lower phase, and the UMP is recovered in the upper phase (20Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4846-4851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate-containing lower phase of each sample was washed with the upper phase of a new pre-equilibrated acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture and then transferred to a fresh tube. Both samples were then dried under a stream of N2 gas, dissolved in 0.6 ml of CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O (2:3:1, v/v), and transferred into 5-mm NMR tubes. The UMP-containing upper phase of each sample was washed with the lower phase of a fresh pre-equilibrated acidic two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture and transferred to a new tube. Both UMP samples were then dried on a vacuum pump, dissolved in 0.6 ml of 100% D2O, and transferred into 5-mm NMR tubes. Measurement with a 3-mm pH electrode revealed that the UMP prepared in 40% H218O and the UMP prepared in H216O had pD values of 0.98 and 0.53, respectively. The NMR spectra of the UMP samples generated by the LpxH-catalyzed hydrolysis of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine were compared with the spectrum of a 5 mm UMP standard (Aldrich) dissolved in 0.6 ml of 100% D2O. 31P and 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer equipped with a Sun Ultra 5 computer and 5-mm Varian probe. 1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 3,237 Hz, 67° pulse flip angle (20 μs), 4.94-s acquisition time, and 0.4-s relaxation delay and were digitized using 32,000 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.202 Hz/point. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 4,500 Hz, 67° pulse flip angle (6 μs), 5-s acquisition time, and 1-s relaxation delay and were digitized using 45,000 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.20 Hz/point.

To confirm the function of lpxH, we constructed KB21/pKJB5. This strain contains a kanamycin insertion element in the chromosomal copy of lpxH, complemented by plasmid pKJB5, which is temperature-sensitive for replication and harborslpxH+ . KB21/pKJB5 grows at 30 °C but loses viability at 44 °C, demonstrating that lpxH is essential. CDP-diglyceride hydrolase (Cdh) catalyzes the same reaction as LpxH in vitro but is non-essential and cannot compensate for the absence of LpxH. The presence of Cdh in cell extracts interferes with the LpxH assay. We therefore constructed KB25/pKJB5, which contains both an in-frame deletion of cdh and a kanamycin insertion mutation in lpxH, covered by pKJB5. When KB25/pKJB5 cells are grown at 44 °C, viability is lost, and allin vitro LpxH activity is eliminated. A lipid migrating with synthetic UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine accumulates in KB25/pKJB5 following loss of the covering plasmid at 44 °C. This material was converted to the expected products, 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate and UMP, by LpxH. Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains two proteins with sequence similarity to E. coli LpxH.

The accumulation of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine in our lpxH mutant is consistent with the observation that the lipid A disaccharide synthase LpxB, the next enzyme in the pathway, cannot condense two UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine molecules, but instead utilizes UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine as its donor and 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate as its acceptor.

LpxH orthologs were found by searching the NCBI microbial database with the E. coli LpxH sequence, and LpxH2 orthologs were found using the R. solanacearum LpxH2 sequence. To confirm the function of lpxH in E. coli, we now describe the construction of two E. colimutant strains deficient in lpxH. KB21/pKJB5 harbors a kanamycin insertion mutation in the lpxH gene and is complemented by a plasmid carrying a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and lpxH+ . KB25/pKJB5 also bears an in-frame deletion of the chromosomal copy of cdh. At 44 °C, pKJB5 is lost, and the lpxH gene and protein product disappear. Under these conditions, both mutant constructs lose viability, demonstrating the requirement of lpxH forE. coli growth, and the inability of cdh to compensate for loss of lpxH. The precursor UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine accumulates from undetectable levels to about 10% of the total phospholipid in KB25/pKJB5 at 44 °C, providing further genetic validation for the lipid A pathway (Fig. 1, see accompanying article (1Babinski K.J.

The complementation of the lpxH-deficient E. coli mutant strains was also investigated. Only P. aeruginosa LpxH catalyzes UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolysis in vitro and can substitute for E. coli lpxH in vivo. The function of LpxH2 remains unknown. Bacteria lacking LpxH presumably contain a distinct UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine-specific pyrophosphatase that remains to be identified. 32Pi was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

ThelpxH gene contains an internal NsiI restriction site. pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was digested with PstI to generate the 1.2-kb kanamycin cassette. The linearized pKJB2 plasmid and the kanamycin cassette were electrophoresed using a 1% agarose gel and extracted from the gel using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit. pKJB2 was dephosphorylated by shrimp alkaline phosphatase and ligated together with the kanamycin cassette using T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C overnight. The ligation reactions were then transformed into competentE. coli XLIBlue (Stratagene) cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these colonies using the QIAprep Spin Mini-Prep Kit (Qiagen). The plasmids were digested with XbaI and BamHI to excise the 1.9-kb lpxH::kan cassette. The digestion reactions were electrophoresed using a 1% agarose gel to identify those plasmids containing the insert. The desired plasmid was designated pKJB3. pKJB3 and pMAK705 (22Hamilton C.M.

The ligation reactions were transformed into XL1Blue, and colonies resistant to chloramphenicol and kanamycin were selected. Plasmids were isolated from these colonies and digested with XbaI andBamHI to verify the presence of the correct insert. The resulting plasmid is pKJB4. The lpxH gene was cloned into the low copy vector pNGH1-amp (23Garrett T.A. Que N.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's specifications. The sequence of the forward primer introducing a SacI site is 5′-GGG GCC GAG CTC ATG GCG ACA CTC TTT ATT GC-3′. The sequence of the reverse primer, which introduces a BamHI site, is 5′-GGC GGG GAT CCT TTA AAA GGG AAA ATG-3′. The SacI site includes the start codon for lpxH, whereas the BamHI site is immediately downstream of the stop codon. PCR was electrophoresed using a 1% agarose gel and extracted from the gel. Both the PCR product and pNGH1-amp were digested with SacI and BamHI. The digestion reactions were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and extracted from the gel. The plasmid was dephosphorylated. The digestedlpxH PCR product and the dephosphorylated vector were ligated together; the ligation reactions were transformed into competent XL1Blue cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these colonies, digested withSacI and BamHI, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis to identify those plasmids containing thelpxH insert. The desired plasmid was designated pKJB6, and its sequence was confirmed. The cdhreplacement vector, pKJB102, was constructed in the following manner. To assemble the insert cloned into pKO3 (Table II), crossover PCR was employed, as illustrated by Link et al. (24Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J.

Primer A and primer B were used in PCR 1, whereas primer C and primer D were used in PCR 2. Primer A has a 5′-BamHI site and anneals to a region 500 bp upstream of cdh. Its sequence is 5′-AAG AGA GGA TCC TGT CGA GCG CGG AAT-3′. Primer B includes a 3′-end containing the first 18 bp of cdh and a 5′-end with a 21-bp region designed to complement the 5′-end of primer C.

Plasmids were isolated from these colonies and digested withBamHI to identify those containing the insert. The desired plasmid was designated pKJB102. The expression vector pKJB130 was constructed as follows. PCR was used to amplify lpxH from P. aeruginosa chromosomal DNA PAO1 with Pfu DNA polymerase. The sequence of the forward primer introducing an NdeI site is 5′-CCC CCC CAT ATG AGC GTC CTG TTC ATC-3′. The sequence of the reverse primer introducing aBamHI site is 5′-AAA GGA GGA TCC TCA GAG CGG GAA GGG-3′. The PCR was gel-electrophoresed, and the lpxH gene was extracted from the gel. Both the PCR product and pET21a+ were then digested with NdeI and BamHI. The digestion reactions were gel-extracted. The plasmid was dephosphorylated and ligated together with the digested PCR product. The ligation reactions were then transformed into competent XL1Blue cells, and colonies resistant to ampicillin were selected. The plasmids were digested withNdeI and BamHI and electrophoresed to identify those plasmids containing the lpxH insert. The desired plasmid was designated pKJB130, and its sequence was confirmed. The expression vector pKJB133, a pET21a+ vector harboring the P. aeruginosa lpxH2 gene, was constructed as described above, with modification.

Pea chloroplast nucleoids have an abundant 70-kDa protein identified as sulfite reductase (SiR) that can compact DNA. Using an in vitro transcription assay, we show here that heparin increased the transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoids with concomitant release of SiR. Using a fluorometric method we developed for analyzing DNA compaction, we found that the fluorescence intensity of chloroplast DNA stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was decreased by the addition of SiR and increased by the subsequent addition of heparin. Addition of exogenous SiR increased the compaction of isolated nucleoids, and the addition of heparin relaxed it. SiR effectively repressed the in vitro transcription activity of nucleoids and counteracted the activation by heparin. These results suggest that SiR regulates the transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoids through changes in DNA compaction.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 128: 1-62Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The cpDNA, which is 120–180 kilobase pairs in size, contains more than 100 genes encoding mostly proteins for photosynthesis and gene expression (2Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 149-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Most proteins constituting the nucleoid are thought to be encoded by the nuclear genome (3Sato N. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Chloroplast nucleoids are known to change their morphology, molecular composition, and intraplastidial localization during leaf development (4Sato N. Rolland N. Block M.A. Joyard J. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, nucleoid proteins have been poorly characterized except for the following ones: CND41 (chloroplast nucleoid DNA binding protein) (5Nakano T. Murakami S. Shoji T. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Sato F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Murakami S. Kondo Y. Nakano T. Sato F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is known to repress the expression of cpDNA and has a protease activity; topoisomerase II is co-localized with the nucleoids (7Marrison J.L.

Case C.I. Heinhorst S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that a 68-kDa protein of chloroplast nucleoids in soybean-cultured cells suppressed replication and compacts cpDNA. In pea (17Sato N. Nakayama M. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), an abundant 70-kDa protein in the nucleoids was demonstrated to be sulfite reductase (SiR). Although SiR is an enzyme catalyzing the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, DNA binding is its second function in higher plant chloroplasts. In the present report, we describe the effects of exogenous heparin and SiR on the structure and transcription of chloroplast nucleoids and discuss the relationship between DNA compaction and transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoids. Pea seedlings were grown essentially as described previously (18Sato N. Misumi O. Shinada Y. Sasaki M. Yoine M. Protoplasma. 1997; 200: 163-173Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The leaf buds of epicotyls of 7-day-old seedlings were used. Nucleoids were prepared as described previously (18Sato N. Misumi O. Shinada Y. Sasaki M. Yoine M. Protoplasma. 1997; 200: 163-173Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the TAN buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose, 7 mm 2-mercaptoetanol, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 mm spermidine) and then stored in the presence of 33% glycerol at −80 °C until use. The cDNA for the maize SiR (GenBankTM accession number D50679) was overexpressed with the siroheme synthase gene (cysG) inEscherichia coli cells, and then the active enzyme was purified by MonoQ column chromatography (19Ideguchi T Akashi T. Onda Y. Hase T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: from Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 713-716Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against maize SiR as described in Ref. 20Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Ashikari T. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Hase T. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: rifampicin, Serva Feinchemica (Heidelberg, Germany); heparin and α-amanitin, Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); actinomycin D, ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA); and tagetitoxin, Epicentre (Madison, WI). The in vitrotranscription assay was performed essentially according to the method of Sakai et al. (21Sakai A. Yamashita H. Nemoto Y. Kawano S. Kuroiwa T. Plant Cell Pysiol. 1991; 32: 835-842Google Scholar, 22Sakai A. Saito C. Inada N. Kuroiwa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with some modification. The reaction mixture contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 7 mm MgCl2, 24 μm(NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (w/v) Nonidet P40, 180 μm ATP, 180 μm GTP, 180 μm CTP, 5 μm [5,6-3H]UTP (about 0.16 TBq/mmol), and chloroplast nucleoids (30 μg of protein/ml). Before addition of radiolabeled UTP to start the reaction, we incubated the mixture at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C. After the reaction, an aliquot (5 μl) was spotted on a small disk of DEAE paper (DE81, Whatman). The paper was washed successively in 5% Na2HPO4, water, and ethanol and then finally dried. The incorporation of [5,6-3H]UTP radioactivity into the DEAE paper-bound fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The experimental error in the UTP incorporation was generally within 5%. Isolated nucleoids were resuspended in the spermidine-free TAN buffer with or without various concentrations of heparin. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in spermidine-free TAN buffer without heparin. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed with 12% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (10Sato N. Albrieux C. Joyard J. Douce R. Kuroiwa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Sato N. Misumi O. Shinada Y. Sasaki M. Yoine M. Protoplasma. 1997; 200: 163-173Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For microscopy, 4 μl of the nucleoid suspension, with or without addition of heparin, were mixed with 4 μl of 1% glutaraldehyde in the TAN buffer and then stained with 4 μl of 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in the TAN buffer. The specimens were examined with a fluorescence microscope model BX-60 (Olympus) with the WU filter cube set. cpDNA was prepared from developing chloroplasts of pea as described previously (10Sato N. Albrieux C. Joyard J. Douce R. Kuroiwa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). cpDNA (150 μg/ml) was mixed with recombinant SiR and incubated on ice for 2 h. The mixture (5 μl) was diluted with 500 μl of spermidine-free TAN buffer containing 0.02 μg/ml DAPI. The fluorescence of the mixture was monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, model 850). Excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and the emission at 450 nm was measured. The fluorescence was monitored for 60 min to confirm stabilization of drift, and then 1 μl of heparin (5 mg/ml) in spermidine-free TAN buffer (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) was added to the mixture. Essentially similar experiments were done using 20 μl of nucleoids (100 μg/ml) instead of cpDNA. Kinetics of incorporation of radiolabeled UTP into RNA with various amounts of pea nucleoids is shown in Fig.1 A. The incorporation of UTP was proportional to the amount of nucleoids (inset in Fig.1 A), indicating that the reaction in this system was dependent on the isolated nucleoids. The effect of various inhibitors on the transcription of nucleoids was investigated (Table I). The incorporation of UTP was effectively inhibited by actinomycin D. This suggests that the incorporation of UTP is dependent on double-stranded DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Tagetitoxin, which specifically inhibits plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (23Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 493-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), abolished completely the transcription, indicating that plastid-encoded RNA polymerase is mainly operating in this transcription system. α-Amanitin and rifampicin, which inhibit the transcription by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II and bacterial RNA polymerase, respectively, had no effects. These results were consistent with those obtained previously using chloroplast nucleoids from tobacco-cultured cells (22Sakai A. Saito C. Inada N. Kuroiwa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heparin, which is known to inhibit the initiation of transcription, however, markedly increased the incorporation of UTP. No such enhancement has been reported in cultured cells of tobacco (21Sakai A. Yamashita H. Nemoto Y. Kawano S. Kuroiwa T. Plant Cell Pysiol. 1991; 32: 835-842Google Scholar,22Sakai A. Saito C.

The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of indicated inhibitors before addition of UTP to start the reaction. Radiolabeled UTP were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The activity under standard assay conditions was arbitrarily set at 100%. Open table in a new tab Transcription assay was carried out for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of indicated inhibitors before addition of UTP to start the reaction. Radiolabeled UTP were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The activity under standard assay conditions was arbitrarily set at 100%. The effect of heparin on the kinetics of UTP incorporation is shown in Fig. 1 B. After treatment with heparin, the incorporation of UTP by isolated nucleoids increased linearly for 40 min after the start of reaction, but the rate of incorporation gradually decreased thereafter. The nucleoids were treated with heparin, and the nucleoid proteins were analyzed. When the isolated nucleoids were washed with buffers containing various concentrations of heparin, one of the major protein components of nucleoids, a 70-kDa polypeptide was released; namely, a small amount of this polypeptide was released by 1 μg/ml heparin, and the release was almost complete at 100 μg/ml (Fig.2 A). Concurrently with the release of the 70-kDa polypeptide, cpDNA was also released from the nucleoids in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 B), but the maximal release of cpDNA was about 50%. Both supernatant and precipitate fractions from the nucleoids treated with 10 μg/ml heparin showed comparable transcriptional activities (data not shown). Previously, a 70-kDa polypeptide of nucleoids from developing pea chloroplasts was identified as SiR (17Sato N. Nakayama M. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We performed immunoblot analysis to examine whether the 70-kDa polypeptide released from nucleoids by heparin treatment was also SiR (Fig. 2 C). The antiserum raised against maize SiR specifically reacted with the 70-kDa protein in the nucleoids as reported previously (17Sato N. Nakayama M. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa protein released by heparin treatment reacted clearly with the antiserum. These results suggest that the treatment with heparin causes pea chloroplast nucleoids to release SiR. The effect of heparin on the structure of nucleoids was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The nucleoid retains its particulate structure in TAN buffer (Fig. 3), whereas in the presence of 1 μg/ml heparin the nucleoids becomes swollen. At a higher concentration of heparin, the granular structure of the nucleoid is destroyed. At the same time, the fluorescence of DAPI appeared to increase at a high concentration of heparin (compare A andD with identical amount of nucleoids). These results can be attributed to the release of both SiR and DNA from the nucleoids by the treatment with heparin. These results suggest that the released DNA stains better with DAPI than the DNA present within the nucleoids in a compact form. Because the reconstitution of nucleoid-like structure from recombinant SiR and cpDNA was reported previously (17Sato N. Nakayama M. Hase T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of heparin on this reconstitution system. Pea cpDNA was mixed with SiR, incubated for 2 h, and then mixed with 0.02 μg/ml DAPI. The fluorescence intensity of the DAPI-stained cpDNA was quantitated by fluorometry (Fig. 4 A). The fluorescence intensity gradually increased during the first 30 min, probably reflecting the kinetics of binding of DAPI to DNA. The fluorescence intensity of the DNA-protein complex was significantly lower than that of cpDNA alone. The addition of heparin increased the fluorescence of cpDNA-SiR complex, while no effect was detected on cpDNA alone. These results clearly indicate that the formation of DNA-protein complex decreased the fluorescence intensity of DNA-bound DAPI. The fluorescence is therefore a measure of compaction of DNA. We measured the fluorescence intensity of the DAPI-stained nucleoids by fluorometry (Fig. 4 B). An aliquot of the nucleoids was mixed with exogenous SiR and 0.02 μg/ml DAPI, and the fluorescence was measured. Another aliquot was mixed with DAPI (no SiR) as a control. The transient changes settled after a 30-min incubation. At this stage, the fluorescence of DAPI-stained nucleoids was lower in the presence of exogenous SiR than in the control. This decrease can be attributed to the direct binding of SiR to DNA within the nucleoids. Another possibility is that the exogenous SiR bound to the native nucleoprotein complex and that the compaction of cpDNA was affected indirectly by the exogenous SiR. Then heparin was added to both samples at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The fluorescence intensities of both nucleoids increased markedly after the addition of heparin. Curiously, the final level of fluorescence after addition of heparin was identical with or without exogenous SiR. This suggests that DAPI maximally binds to the DNA that was released by heparin, and this level is not affected by the presence of endogenous and exogenous SiR. Although the DNA was not totally solubilized as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, the DNA was no longer tightly packed within the nucleoids after addition of heparin. On the contrary, in the absence of heparin, the addition of SiR tightens the compaction of DNA within the nucleoids, thus lowering the fluorescence intensity. We examined the effect of SiR on transcription using the nucleoids treated with heparin (Fig. 5). The nucleoids were incubated in the reaction buffer in the presence of 2 or 4 μg/ml heparin at 25 °C for 30 min. Then various concentrations of recombinant SiR were added to the reaction mixtures, and the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. We measured the transcriptional activities of nucleoids as the incorporation of radiolabeled UTP into RNA. In the absence of heparin, the transcription activity was reduced as the SiR concentration increased. The activity at 255 μg/ml SiR (3 pmol of UTP/μg of protein) was approximately one third of that in the absence of exogenously added SiR (9 pmol of UTP/μg of protein). In the nucleoids treated with 2 and 4 μg/ml heparin, the transcriptional activity was respectively two and three times higher than that in the absence of heparin, but these enhanced activities were also drastically reduced with the increase in SiR concentration. The transcriptional activity of nucleoids in the presence of 2 μg/ml heparin was identical to the control at 120 μg/ml or higher concentrations of SiR. In the presence of 4 μg/ml heparin, the activity was reduced to the control level at 165 μg/ml or higher concentration of SiR. These results suggest that SiR and heparin exerted antagonistic actions on the transcription activity of nucleoids, i.e. SiR acts as a repressor, while heparin acts as a de-repressor. Curiously, the slopes of the decline in activity as a function of concentration of exogenous SiR were identical with various concentrations of heparin. The nearly equal spacing of the two lines obtained with 2 and 4 μg/ml heparin suggests that 1 μg of heparin counteracts with the action of 35 μg of SiR. A rough estimate indicates that the ratio is 10 sugar in heparin residues per SiR molecule. The activation by heparin indicates that the repression by endogenous SiR is reversible, whereas the repression by exogenous SiR indicates that the de-repression by heparin is reversible. Therefore, the transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoid is reversibly regulated by DNA compaction. Most of the recent studies on the transcriptional regulation in chloroplast have been focused on the transcription factors for individual genes as well as ς factors (5Nakano T. Murakami S. Shoji T. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Sato F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Murakami S. Kondo Y. Nakano T. Sato F.

In the present study, we focused on the correlation between DNA compaction and transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoids. The marked activation of transcription by heparin (Table I, Fig. 2) was unexpected. Heparin, which is a polysaccharide sulfate consisting ofd-glucosamine, d-glucuronic acid, andl-iduronic acid, acts as a potent inhibitor of initiation of transcription by bacterial (25Zillig W. Zechel K. Rabussy D. Schachner M. Sethi V.S. Palm P. Heil A. Seifert W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1970; 35: 47-58Crossref Google Scholar, 26Madon J. Leser U. Zillig W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and plastid (27Briat J.F. Mache R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) RNA polymerases and is known to disrupt the relatively fragile nonspecific RNA polymerase-DNA interaction but has no effect on tightly bound complexes (28Kadesch T.R. Williams R.C. Chambelin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Heparin is also known to bind to various proteins in vivo (29Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). More than twenty years ago, it was demonstrated that histones and most of the non-histone proteins were removed from a metaphase chromosome in human HeLa cells by treatment with heparin or dextran sulfate, which competes with DNA for protein binding (30Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with our results, if histones and SiR are both considered as DNA-binding proteins. The activation of transcriptional activity by heparin appears to be related to the interference of heparin in DNA-protein interaction. Heparin seems to compete with cpDNA for the binding of SiR within the nucleoids and de-compacts the structure of nucleoids. On the other hand, a function of DNA compaction is assigned to SiR as described below. Using fluorometry, we can semi-quantitatively evaluate the DNA compaction in cpDNA and nucleoids (Fig. 4). The increase in fluorescence intensity by heparin is correlated with the relaxation of DNA compaction, and the decrease in fluorescence by SiR is correlated with tightening. Although the fluorescence intensity of isolated nucleoids mixed with SiR increased to a level similar to that for nucleoids alone by the addition of heparin, the intensity of the cpDNA-SiR complex did not increase completely to a level similar to that for cpDNA alone by heparin. The difference in fluorescence intensity after the addition of heparin in the cpDNA-SiR complex may reflect the equilibrium between SiR and DNA or absorption of the fluorescence of DAPI by SiR. There are three possible reasons for the decline of fluorescence intensity of DNA-DAPI complex by SiR. One is the reduced binding of DAPI to cpDNA by the formation of cpDNA-SiR complex. Another is fluorescence quenching by SiR, and the last one is the change in self-quenching of DAPI due to changes in local density of DAPI. A direct effect of heparin on the fluorescence of DAPI is also unlikely, because when a spermidine-free TAN buffer containing DAPI without either cpDNA or nucleoids was monitored with the addition of heparin, the fluorescence intensity was not affected by heparin (data not shown). We showed that the transcriptional activity of chloroplast nucleoids was repressed by SiR (Fig. 5). The enhancement of transcriptional activity by heparin was reduced by the addition of SiR to a level comparable with the transcriptional activity of nucleoids not treated with heparin in the presence of SiR. The fluorometric study demonstrated tightening of DNA compaction by SiR and its relaxation by heparin within the nucleoids. These results suggest that the transcription of nucleoids is activated by relaxation of DNA compaction and is repressed by tightening of DNA compaction. Some examples that DNA compaction regulates transcription are known. In the eukaryotic cell nucleus, the binding of many transcription factors and RNA polymerase can be strongly inhibited by the formation of nucleosomes (31Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Krude T. Elgin S.C.R. Curr.

In bacteria, various DNA-binding proteins such as IHF (integration hostfactor) and H-NS (histone-likenucleoid-structuring protein) regulate transcription of many genes through changes in local DNA compaction due to DNA bending (37McLeod S.M. Johnson R.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the nucleoids of E. coli, non-enzymatic phase transition of nucleoid structure occurs on nucleoids when the cells enter the growth phase and stationary phase; namely, the abundant Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells), a nonspecific DNA-binding protein, protects DNA through DNA-Dps co-crystallization in the stationary phase, and the DNA-Dps co-crystals are rapidly disrupted upon onset of growth (38Frenkiel-Krispin D. Levin-Zaidman S. Shimoni E. Wolf S.G. Wachtel E.J. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The phase transition regulates the global transcriptional rate. Our findings prompt us to assume the presence of such mechanisms in chloroplasts. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the step at which DNA compaction is regulated, using nucleoids at various developmental stages. Furthermore, heparin might not be present in the chloroplast. Therefore additional evidence for the presence of substances that relax DNA compaction within the chloroplast is required. In this context, we tested the negatively charged lipids such as sulfolipid and phosphatidylglycerol, which are present in the chloroplast membrane, but we found no evidence that these acidic lipids can act as a transcriptional activator."
https://openalex.org/W2081452057,"ADAM12 has been implicated in cell-cell interactions in myogenesis and cancer, but the structure of the mature form of ADAM12 is not known, and its localization on the cell surface has been questioned. In this report, we show that full-length ADAM12 isN-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi network to an ∼90-kDa form. The ∼90-kDa form, which lacks the prodomain, was the predominant form present at the cell surface. Replacement of Leu73 in the putative α-helical region in the prodomain with proline resulted in retention of ADAM12 in the ER and a complete lack of its processing. However, deletion of the entire pro- and metalloprotease domains did not affect the processing and trafficking of ADAM12. In contrast, replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 with that of ADAM9 or adding a c-Myc tag at the C terminus led to a significant increase in transport of the protein to the cell surface. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 plays an important role in regulating ADAM12 exit from the ER. We conclude that properly folded mouse ADAM12, after passing a rate-limiting step of exit from the ER, is processed in the secretory pathway and reaches the cell surface, where it can mediate adhesion-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1973724353,"Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-1, -3, and -9, mediate matrix destruction during chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis. MMP up-regulation by inflammatory cytokines involves interactions between several transcription factors, including activator protein-1 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The upstream regulatory pathways are less well understood. We investigated the role of isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) in basic fibroblast growth factor- and interleukin-1α-mediated MMP production from cultured rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. A synthetic PKC inhibitor, RO318220, inhibited MMP-1, -3, and -9 production by 89 ± 3, 75 ± 18, and 89 ± 9%, respectively. However, down-regulation of conventional and novel isoforms did not inhibit but rather increased MMP-9 production by 48 ± 16%, implicating an atypical PKC isoform. Consistent with this, PKCζ protein levels and activity were stimulated 3.3- and 13-fold, respectively, by basic fibroblast growth factor plus interleukin-1α and antisense oligonucleotides to PKCζ significantly decreased MMP-9 formation by 62 ± 18% compared with scrambled sequences. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative (DN) PKCζ reduced MMP-1, -3, and -9 production by 78 ± 9, 76 ± 8, and 76 ± 5%, respectively. DN-PKCζ inhibited NF-κB DNA binding but did not affect ERK1/2 activation or AP-1 binding. Antisense PKCζ oligonucleotides and DN-PKCζ stimulated cell proliferation by 89 ± 14% (n = 4) and 305 ± 74% (n = 3), respectively (both p < 0.05). Our results show that PKCζ is essential for cytokine-induced up-regulation of MMP-1, -3, and -9, most likely by activating NF-κB. Selective inhibition of PKCζ is therefore a possible strategy to inhibit MMP production in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-1, -3, and -9, mediate matrix destruction during chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis. MMP up-regulation by inflammatory cytokines involves interactions between several transcription factors, including activator protein-1 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The upstream regulatory pathways are less well understood. We investigated the role of isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) in basic fibroblast growth factor- and interleukin-1α-mediated MMP production from cultured rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. A synthetic PKC inhibitor, RO318220, inhibited MMP-1, -3, and -9 production by 89 ± 3, 75 ± 18, and 89 ± 9%, respectively. However, down-regulation of conventional and novel isoforms did not inhibit but rather increased MMP-9 production by 48 ± 16%, implicating an atypical PKC isoform. Consistent with this, PKCζ protein levels and activity were stimulated 3.3- and 13-fold, respectively, by basic fibroblast growth factor plus interleukin-1α and antisense oligonucleotides to PKCζ significantly decreased MMP-9 formation by 62 ± 18% compared with scrambled sequences. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative (DN) PKCζ reduced MMP-1, -3, and -9 production by 78 ± 9, 76 ± 8, and 76 ± 5%, respectively. DN-PKCζ inhibited NF-κB DNA binding but did not affect ERK1/2 activation or AP-1 binding. Antisense PKCζ oligonucleotides and DN-PKCζ stimulated cell proliferation by 89 ± 14% (n = 4) and 305 ± 74% (n = 3), respectively (both p < 0.05). Our results show that PKCζ is essential for cytokine-induced up-regulation of MMP-1, -3, and -9, most likely by activating NF-κB. Selective inhibition of PKCζ is therefore a possible strategy to inhibit MMP production in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. extracellular matrix matrix metalloproteinase smooth muscle cell protein kinase C extracellular signal-regulate kinase dominant-negative nuclear factor κB basic fibroblast growth factor interleukin oligodeoxynucleotide phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate activator protein-1 Tris-buffered saline novel protein kinase C conventional protein kinase C atypical protein kinase C electromobility shift assay Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 occurs physiologically during morphogenesis, and pathologically in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis (1Dollery C.M. McEwan J.R. Henney A.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Matrix degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are key enzymes in extracellular matrix turnover at physiological pH, play a dual role in atherosclerosis. They are necessary for the smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation that underlie fibrous cap formation but also mediate the degradation of the ECM that underlies atherosclerotic plaque rupture and aneurysm formation (2Newby A. Zaltsman A.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The MMP family of more than 20 proteases includes the gelatinases, collagenases, and stromelysins, which interact synergistically to degrade all the ECM components (3Woessner J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1-19Crossref Google Scholar). The gelatinases comprise a 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2), which tends to show constitutive pattern of regulation in connective tissue cells, and a 95-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9) that is inducible by inflammatory cytokines, especially together with connective tissue growth factors. Both degrade the basement membrane around SMC, which permits SMC migration and proliferation (4Southgate K.M. Davies M. Booth R.F.G. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Zempo N. Koyama N. Kenagy R.D. Lea H.J. Clowes A.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

On the other hand, the localization of stromelysin (MMP-3) and collagenase (MMP-1) in macrophage-rich shoulder regions of atherosclerotic plaques (7Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar), in association with degraded collagen (8Sukhova G.K. Schonbeck U. Rabkin E. Schoen F.J. Poole A.R. Billinghurst R.C. Libby P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2503-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), points to their role in plaque destabilization, which underlies myocardial infarction. Both MMP-1 and MMP-3 are also powerfully induced by cytokines and growth factors (9Benbow U. Brinkerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Aneurysm formation is also associated with inflammation and increased levels of MMP-1, -3, and -9 (10Newman K.M. Ogata Y. Malon A.M. Irizarry E. Gandhi R.H. Nagase H.T., M.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, knockout of MMP-9 or MMP-3 significantly reduces the incidence of micro-aneurysms in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout mice (11Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Baes M. Lemaitre V. Tipping P. Drew A. Eeckhout Y. Shapiro S. Lupu F. Collen D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,12Pyo R. Lee J.K. Shipley J.M. Curci J.A. Mao R. Ziporin S.J. Ennis T.L. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Thompson R.W. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1641-1649Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Because of their divergent roles in atherosclerosis and other connective tissue diseases, there is great interest in understanding the regulation of the various MMP genes, and their proximal promoter regions have been intensely studied. Common regulatory principals between MMP-1, -3, and -9 include an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site at approximately −90 in their promoter sequences that is essential for responses to growth factors and cytokines (9Benbow U. Brinkerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recent work also shows an essential role for the NF-κB transcription factor in MMP-1, -3, and -9 secretion (13Bond M. Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 14Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Bond M. Chase A.J. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), even though only the MMP-9 gene has well defined NF-κB binding sites in its proximal promoter (16Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T. Rainville J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream signaling pathways that regulate MMP secretion are less well defined. A role for extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 has been identified from the use of inhibitors. Furthermore, we previously implicated protein kinase C in MMP-9 regulation using a synthetic inhibitor, RO318220 (18Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Murray E.J. Booth R.F.G. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This study left undefined the isoform of PKC responsible for MMP up-regulation and how PKC activation leads on to MMP gene regulation. The PKC family comprises 11 isoenzymes, subdivided into four classes: conventional (cPKCs α, β, and γ), novel (nPKCs δ, ε, η, and θ), atypical (aPKCs ζ, ι, and λ), and protein kinase D. The cPKCs are activated by phosphatidylserine in a Ca2+-dependent manner; they also bind diacylglycerol, which both increases the specificity of the enzyme for phosphatidylserine and shifts the affinity for Ca2+ into the physiological range (19Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. l. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). The cPKCs are targets of the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, PMA, which activates these enzymes by eliminating the requirement for diacylglycerol and decreasing the concentration of Ca2+ needed for activation. The nPKCs are Ca2+-insensitive, but they are still activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters in the presence of phosphatidylserine. The aPKCs, like the nPKCs, are Ca2+-insensitive, but they do not respond to PMA/diacylglycerol (19Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. l. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 20Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Previous studies of SMC show that they express PKCα, -δ, and -ζ and low levels of PKCε (21Assender J.W. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Dixon B.S. Sharma R.J. Dickerson T. Fortune J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1406-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morgan K.G. Leinweber B.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In different cellular systems, isoforms of PKC have been shown to lie upstream of and activate both NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (24Dominguez I. Sanz L. ArenzanaSeisdedos F. DiazMeco M.T. Virelizier J, L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encourages the concept that PKC is important for MMP regulation. We first therefore extended our study of RO318220 to include MMP-1 and -3. We then observed the effect of down-regulating the conventional and novel PKC isoforms (i.e. PKCα, -δ, and -ε) through pretreatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and found that MMP up-regulation was preserved, which implicated PKCζ. To verify this we used antisense oligonucleotides and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of PKCζ (25Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Dia Zgolpe V., De Lera M.T.L. Alcami J. Paya C.V. ArenzanaSeisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally we found evidence that PKCζ lies upstream of NF-κB rather than AP-1 in the regulation of MMP genes. Cell culture media and media supplements were purchased from Invitrogen (Inchinnan Business Park, Paisley, Scotland, UK), whereas fetal calf serum was obtained from Advanced Products (Brierley Hill, West Midlands, UK). Human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGFBB) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Ltd (Lewis, East Sussex, UK) and Promega (Southampton, Hampshire, UK), respectively. Human recombinant interleukin-1α (IL-1α) was a generous gift from Roche Products (Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK) and also obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK). PMA was from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK), RO318220 (PKC) was from Roche, and PDBu from Sigma. Sheep antisera to rabbit MMP-1 and rabbit MMP-3 were a generous gift from Professor G. Murphy (Strangeways Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK). All other antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz. All reagents used in protein electrophoresis were purchased from Sigma and were of electrophoresis grade, unless otherwise stated. Reagents for RNA analysis were obtained from BDH (Merck Ltd, Lutterworth, Leicester, UK) and were analytical grade. SMC were cultured from rabbit aortic tunica media by the explant method as modified by Ref. 26Southgate K.M. Newby A.C. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 82: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar. Explants (40/T75 flask) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 10–14 days, SMCs were subcultured by trypsin/EDTA treatment and seeded at a density of 1.4 × 103cells/cm2 in 24-well plates for zymography or Western analysis or 75-cm2 flasks for electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) or RNA studies, and were used between passages 1 and 3. For all experiments, subconfluent cells were rendered quiescent by washing in phosphate-buffered saline followed by a 72-h incubation in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25% v/v lactalbumin hydrolysate). Cultures were then exposed to fresh serum-free medium containing the appropriate concentration of the agent under investigation. After incubation (times ranging from 4 to 24 h), the conditioned media were removed and in some cases the cells were the extracted with perchloric acid and the ATP and DNA concentrations in the explants measured as previously described (26Southgate K.M. Newby A.C. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 82: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The DNA concentrations did not vary significantly 24 h after any treatment (results not shown), and hence no correction was made for cell number when comparing conditioned media. For metalloproteinase secretion, cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates to 90% confluence and quiesced for 72 h. Cells were then treated for 18 h with the synthetic inhibitors RO318220 and the agonists IL-1α and bFGF, or pretreated for 24 h with PDBu, and then treated with PMA or bFGF plus IL-1α. The conditioned media were harvested and analyzed for MMP-9 by gelatin zymography or for MMP-1 and -3 by Western analysis. For the detection of endogenous signaling proteins, cells were lysed (after treatment) with the reducing Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and samples were subjected to Western analysis. Detection was through the aid of antibodies for PKCζ, -α, and -δ (Santa Cruz). Gelatinase activity was detected in conditioned media and described previously (4Southgate K.M. Davies M. Booth R.F.G. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15-μl aliquots of conditioned media were mixed with an equal volume of nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed at 4 °C in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mg/ml gelatin derived from porcine skin collagen (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed clear of SDS by incubating for 1 h with two changes of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Gels were then incubated overnight in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij 35) at 37 °C. The gels were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and gelatinolytic activity was revealed as clear bands against a blue-stained background. Gelatinolytic bands were size-calibrated with a high molecular mass standard mixture of proteins (Sigma). MMP-1, MMP-3, and levels of PKC were detected through Western analysis, through the aid of antibodies specific for these MMPs and signaling proteins (respectively). Briefly, 15 μl of 50× concentrated conditioned medium was denatured by the addition of a reducing sample loading containing β-mercaptoethanol and then heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed at 95 V at 4 °C in a discontinuous buffer system comprising an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide resolving gel and a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel. Samples were calibrated with a high molecular weight marker (Sigma) and a rabbit dermal fibroblast standard. After electrophoresis, the gels were removed and equilibrated in transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20% (v/v) methanol), following which the protein samples were transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose pure membrane (Amersham Biosciences), at 300 mA for 3 h at 4 °C. After transfer, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating in “blocking buffer” TBS-T-M (1× TBS (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl), 5% skim milk powder (Marvel), 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight in the primary antibody at 4 °C. After incubation, the membranes under went several washes in the blocking buffer, after which they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Unbound secondary was removed by washing in TBS-T. Detection was achieved with the ECL Western blotting kit with exposure to Hyperfilm x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). The detection of DNA binding proteins was determined through the EMSA. Briefly, cells were cultured in RO318220 for 1 h before stimulation with the agonists IL-1α and or bFGF for 30 min. The cells were harvested, and nuclear protein was extracted and purified as described previously (14Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A consensus NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) oligonucleotide (Promega) and an AP-1 (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′) oligonucleotide (Promega) were labeled with [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were performed as described previously (14Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and the protein-DNA complexes separated on polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried for 1 h at 65 °C, on Whatman No. 3MM paper. Detection was achieved through exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) at −80 °C for a minimum of 24 h. PKC-ζ activity was measured by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay. Briefly, cells were stimulated with IL-1α and bFGF for 10 min at 37 °C and then lysed on ice in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.25 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg·ml−1 aprotinin, 100 μg·ml−1leupeptin, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min at 13,000 ×g), and the supernatant was treated with anti-PKC-ζ antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The PKC-ζ was then immunoprecipitated with Protein A-agarose for 2 h. The precipitate was washed first in lysis buffer minus dithiothreitol and Nonidet P-40, then in ice-cold kinase buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mg·ml−1l-glucose, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA). Finally the pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer containing 100 μm ATP radiolabeled to approximately 500,000 cpm/40 μl with [γ-32P]ATP with or without 50 μm substrate peptide (ε-peptide,Calbiochem) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. PKC-ζ activity was determined by scintillation counting 32P incorporated after spotting the reaction mix onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) and then washing away unincorporated 32P with two 1-min washes plus one 10-min wash with 75 mm phosphoric acid, followed by two 5-min and one 1-min wash with 75 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Alternatively, cell lysates were precipitated with acetone at −20 °C overnight, pelleted at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and subjected to 8% PAGE. Western blotting with anti-phospho-PKCζ (Thr-410) (Cell Signaling Technology) was then conducted as described above. PKCζ antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing the C-5 propyne analogs of uridine and cytidine were obtained from Sigma Genosys. The rabbit PKCζ sequences used were as follows: rabbit PKCζ antisense (5′-GCTGCGCCGGCCTCACACG-3′); PKCζ scrambled antisense (5′-ACCCCGTCGGCCCATGGCG-3′) was used as control. To enhance cellular uptake, a novel cationic liposome vesicle Cytofectin GSV (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) was used to deliver the oligonucleotides into the host SMC as described in the manufacturer's instructions. An effective kinase-defective DN mutant derivative of PKCζ has been described (25Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Dia Zgolpe V., De Lera M.T.L. Alcami J. Paya C.V. ArenzanaSeisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained as a plasmid from Dr. Jorge Moscat (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain). The DN-PKCζ was engineered into a tetracycline-regulated binary adenoviral system (28Harding T.C. Geddes B.J. Noel J.D. Murphy D. Uney J.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2620-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Harding T.C. Geddes B.J. Murphy D. Knight D. Uney J.B. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1998; 16: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The DN-PKCζ cDNA was cloned under the control of the tetracycline response element. Expression of this transgene is dependent upon the presence of a second virus expressing the Tet-OFF transcriptional regulator under constitutive (cytomegalovirus) control (28Harding T.C. Geddes B.J. Noel J.D. Murphy D. Uney J.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2620-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Harding T.C. Geddes B.J. Murphy D. Knight D. Uney J.B. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1998; 16: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Following the application of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline, the Tet-OFF molecule can no longer bind and transcription of the PKCζ transgene ceases. To establish the viral titer required for 100% infection of rabbit SMCs, a recombinant adenovirus, Rad35:βgal, capable of expressing the bacteriallacZ gene was used. Briefly, SMCs were cultured in 12-well plates, to 80% confluence (∼4 × 104 cells/well) and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. The cells were then infected with increasing multiplicity of infection (0, 300, and 600) of virus for 16 h. This was followed by an additional 24-h incubation in complete medium, to allow transgene expression. Viral infection efficiency was then assessed by histochemical staining for β-galactosidase as described previously (14Bond M. Baker A.H. Newby A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For the viral infection with the DN-PKCζ and Tet-OFF viruses, cells were seeded at an approximate density of 4 × 104 cells/well. On the following day, cells were infected with both viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 600 and incubated for 16 h. The cells were then quiesced for 3 days in serum-free medium with or without 1 mg/ml doxycycline so as to allow for viral transgene expression, then treated for 18 h with the agonists, IL-1α and bFGF; the conditioned medium was harvested and analyzed for MMP-1, -3, and -9 expression. In the presence of the agonists, bFGF and IL-1α, rabbit SMCs produced increased levels of MMP-9 (95 kDa gelatinase B), collagenase (MMP-1), and stromelysin (MMP-3) compared with the control (Fig.1A). RO318220 alone had no effect on MMP-1, -3, or -9 production. However, RO318220 significantly inhibited bFGF- and IL-1α-induced up-regulation of MMP-9 by 89 ± 8%, MMP-1 by 75 ± 18%, and MMP-3 by 89 ± 3% (allp < 0.03). MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase A) was constitutively expressed (Fig. 1A). Only conventional and novel PKC isoforms are activated by and subsequently down-regulated by phorbol esters. The phorbol ester, PMA, stimulated MMP-9 expression in SMCs to a similar extent as bFGF plus IL-1α (Fig.2, A and B). Hence, conventional or novel PKC isoforms mediate up-regulation of MMP secretion in response to PMA. However, this does not indicate their role in responses to bFGF plus IL-1α. To investigate this, PDBu was used to down-regulate the novel and conventional PKCs and the cells were treated with PMA or with bFGF plus IL-1α. After PDBu pretreatment for 24 h, the rate of MMP-9 production had returned toward basal levels (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequent addition of PMA (Fig. 2A) produced significantly less (62 ± 13%) MMP-9 secretion. In contrast, PDBu did not inhibit, but rather increased by 48 ± 16% (p < 0.05), the stimulatory effect of bFGF plus IL-1α (Fig. 2B). To verify that pretreatment with PDBu did not lead to a cytotoxic effect on the cells, changes in ATP concentration (nmol/mg DNA) were measured and showed no significant differences under any of the conditions used (results not shown). These results implicate an atypical PKC in the response to bFGF plus IL-1α. The atypical isoform PKCζ has been previously identified in SMC (21Assender J.W. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Dixon B.S. Sharma R.J. Dickerson T. Fortune J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1406-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morgan K.G. Leinweber B.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blotting confirmed that PKCζ was present in rabbit VSMC and that protein levels were similar before and after pretreatment with PDBu (Fig. 2C). We used an antisense sequence that corresponded to bases 1862–1880 of the published rabbit PKCζ sequence (GenBankTM accession no. U78768). To verify that the ODNs were specific for PKCζ, changes in levels of PKCζ, PKCα, and PKCδ were measured. Fig. 3demonstrates that bFGF plus IL-1α significantly increased PKCζ levels 3.3-fold, which is also evident in Fig. 2C. Furthermore, antisense ODNs at 0.5 μm significantly reduced PKCζ levels in the presence of bFGF plus IL-1α, whereas a scrambled sequence had no effect. Levels of PKCα/β and PKCδ were not significantly affected by antisense or scrambled PKCζ ODNs (Fig.3), which demonstrates the specificity of the antisense effect. As shown in Fig. 4, bFGF- plus IL-1α-induced up-regulation MMP-9 was ∼50% inhibited by scrambled ODNs. However, a significantly greater effect was seen in the presence of antisense PKCζ ODNs (Fig. 4). The antisense ODNs showed a concentration-dependent reduction on MMP-9 expression, where 0.5 μm antisense ODNs significantly blocked bFGF- plus IL-1α-induced MMP-9 expression by 62 ± 18% relative to the scrambled control. As a further control for specificity, neither scrambled nor antisense PKCζ ODNs had any effect on constitutive MMP-2 production (Fig. 4).Figure 4Effect of PKC ζ antisense oligonucleotides on MMP-9 and MMP-2 secretion.MMP-9 and MMP-2 secretion were measured by zymography under conditions described in detail in the legend to Fig. 3.

However, measurements of ATP levels (nmol/μg DNA, n = 3) were not different in control cells (0.77 ± 0.04) or after cytofectin-mediated transfection of sense (0.67 ± 0.3) or PKCζ antisense ODNs (0.73 ± 0.3). Furthermore, total DNA levels were not altered by any treatment (results not shown) so that the effects observed could not be because of different cell number. To confirm the role of PKCζ in bFGF- plus IL-1α-induced MMP secretion, we used a previously characterized dominant negative form of the enzyme (25Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L.

To transfer this efficiently to primary cells such as rabbit SMCs, we developed a recombinant adenovirus. Furthermore, we used a regulated system by which DN-PKCζ overexpression could be reversed by incubation of cells with doxycycline (so-called Tet-OFF system). Inclusion of doxycycline, therefore, controlled for the effect of virus infection per se, without transgene expression.

The structure of the unbound form of this thioesterase has been shown to contain the so-called “hot dog” fold with a large helix packed against a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. To address the manner in which the enzyme accommodates the substrate within the active site, two inhibitors have been synthesized, namely 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA. Here we describe the structural analyses of the enzyme complexed with these two inhibitors determined and refined to 1.5 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. These studies indicate that only one protein side chain, Ser91, participates directly in ligand binding. All of the other interactions between the protein and the inhibitors are mediated through backbone peptidic NH groups, carbonyl oxygens, and/or solvents. The structures of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes suggest that both a hydrogen bond and the positive end of a helix dipole moment serve to polarize the electrons away from the carbonyl carbon of the acyl group, thereby making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Additionally, these studies demonstrate that the carboxylate group of Asp17 is ∼3.2 Å from the carbonyl carbon of the acyl group. To address the role of Asp17, the structure of the site-directed mutant protein D17N with bound substrate has also been determined.

Markus A. Lingens F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 64-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolic pathway by which 4-chlorobenzoate is degraded to 4-hydroxybenzoate in this organism is outlined in SchemeFS1 (2Dunaway-Mariano D. Babbitt P.C. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The focus of this paper, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase, catalyzes the third step in this degradative pathway, namely the hydrolysis of the thioester moiety in 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA to yield 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA. Previous x-ray crystallographic studies of this thioesterase have revealed that each subunit of the homotetrameric enzyme contains a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and three major α-helices as shown in Fig.1 (3Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Liu R. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33572-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The molecular architecture of this thioesterase is topologically equivalent to that observed in β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase from Escherichia coli and has been referred to as the “hot dog” fold (4Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the case of the E. coli dehydrase, the functional unit is a dimer in which the two active sites are located at the subunit-subunit interface. The recently reported structure of the long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase II from E. coli shows that in the case of this dimeric protein, each monomer is composed of two hot dog folds connected by a linker region (5Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to possessing similar molecular motifs, all three enzymes recognize a pantetheine-linked acyl-thioester substrate: acyl-CoA in the cases of the two thioesterases and acyl carrier protein in the case of the dehydrase. Despite similarities in their substrates and three-dimensional architectures, these enzymes do not share significant amino acid sequence identities. Recent BLAST searches, however, have identified unique, nonoverlapping sets of homologs for each of these enzymes, indicating that this hot dog superfamily may be both vast and ancient. Most likely this superfamily is composed of smaller protein families, which have diverged to such a point that detectable amino acid sequence homologies are no longer present.Figure 1Ribbon representation of one subunit of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase.

In light of the structural similarity between this thioesterase and β-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase complexed with 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a model of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA was positioned into the thioesterase putative active site (3Benning M.M.

On the basis of this model building study, it was postulated that Asp17 was important for the proper positioning of a water molecule required for nucleophilic attack on the thioester carbonyl carbon of the substrate. To further characterize the functional groups on the enzyme that participate in substrate binding and catalysis, recent efforts have been directed toward the synthesis of tight binding substrate analogs resistant to catalyzed hydrolysis. Two such inhibitors, 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, have now been identified and are shown in SchemeFS2. As described here, subsequent x-ray crystallographic analyses of these two enzyme-inhibitor complexes further indicate a key role for Asp17 in the reaction mechanism of the thioesterase. To test the presumed catalytic role of this aspartate, site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been conducted whereby it has been substituted with an asparagine residue. At 25 °C and pH 7.5, the kcat of this mutant protein is 5 × 10−4 s−1 compared with 15 s−1 measured for the wild-type enzyme. 1Z. Zhuang, W. Zhang, K. L. Taylor, A. Archambault, and D. Dunaway-Mariano, submitted for publication. This slow activity allowed the mutant enzyme D17N to be co-crystallized with its substrate, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA. The high resolution x-ray structures of the complexes between wild-type protein and 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA, wild-type protein and 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, and D17N mutant protein and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA are described here. Taken together, these enzyme-inhibitor (or substrate) complexes provide a three-dimensional understanding of substrate binding and catalysis in this thioesterase. Wild-typePseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase was purified as described previously (7Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Beck W. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5606-5610Google Scholar). The D17N mutant protein was prepared and purified according to Zhuang et al.1 Crystallization conditions were tested at both room temperature and at 4 °C with a sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions. The protein solution was concentrated to 14 mg/ml and contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 200 mmKCl, and 5 mm 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA. The best crystals grew from 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 2% Me2SO, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.0) at room temperature. Larger crystals of dimensions 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.35 mm were produced by macro-seeding into batch experiments containing 2–4% polyethylene glycol 8000, 200 mm KCl, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.0). These crystals belonged to space group I222 with unit cell dimensions of a = 49.4 Å, b = 54.6 Å, and c = 93.1 Å and contained one subunit in the asymmetric unit. Macro-seeding techniques under similar conditions were used to obtain isomorphous crystals grown in the presence of 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA. Crystals of the D17N mutant protein in complex with the substrate 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA were first identified from a sparse matrix screen and “optimized” in batch by macro-seeding into droplets containing 8–10% polyethylene glycol 5000-O-methyl ether, 200 mm KCl, 100 mmMES2 (pH 6.0), and 1 mm substrate with the protein concentration at 5 mg/ml. These crystals were difficult to grow and achieved, at best, maximal dimensions of 0.075 × 0.075 × 0.1 mm. Like the wild-type enzyme, the D17N mutant protein crystallized in the space group I222 with unit cell dimensions of a = 49.4 Å,b = 54.6 Å, and c = 93.1 Å and one subunit in the asymmetric unit. Prior to x-ray data collection, the wild-type thioesterase crystals in complex with 4-hydroxyphenacyl- CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution composed of 20% polyethylene glycol, 250 mm KCl, 20% ethylene glycol, and 100 mmsuccinate (pH 5.0). This solution also included the relevant CoA inhibitor at a concentration of 5 mm. The crystals were suspended in 20-μm nylon loops and flash cooled to −150 °C in a nitrogen gas stream. Because of their small size, the D17N protein crystals were mounted in quartz capillary tubes, and the x-ray data were collected at 4 °C. X-ray data from the wild-type enzyme-4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA complex crystals were collected at the Structural Biology Center beam line 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratories) and reduced with HKL2000 (8Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). X-ray data from the wild-type protein/4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA and the D17N mutant protein/4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA crystal complexes were collected with a HiStar (Bruker AXS) area detector system using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA and equipped with Supper “long” mirrors.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15684-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxybenzyl-CoA was synthesized according to the following procedure. Under N2 protection, 30 μl of 4-(chloromethyl)phenyl acetate and 30 mg of CoA were allowed to react in a 1:1 H2O/tetrahydrofuran solution for 12 h at room temperature. During this period the pH of the reaction solution was maintained between 7.5 and 8.0 by adding 0.1 mLiOH. The pH was then adjusted to 11 with 1 m KOH to facilitate the hydrolysis of the acetate group. After 1 h the pH was reduced to 7.5, and the solution was extracted with two 10-ml portions of ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was concentrated by lyophilization. The concentrate was loaded onto a 120 × 2.5-cm Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with deionized water at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions containing 4-hydroxybenzyl- CoA were collected, analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, pooled, and concentrated. The yield of pure 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA was 23 mg (70%).

The binding affinities of the 4-hydroxyphenacyl- CoA and 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA were evaluated by measuring the competitive inhibition constant Ki(wild-type thioesterase only) and by measuring the dissociation constant Kd via fluorescence spectral titration (wild-type and D17N thioesterase). For measurement of the competitive inhibition constants, the initial velocity of thioesterase catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA was measured using the 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase-coupled spectrophotometric assay described in Ref. 7Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Beck W. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5606-5610Google Scholar. The reactions were carried out in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) containing wild-type 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (0.004 μm), 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm FAD, 0.5 unit/ml 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, and varying concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (2–38 μm) with (0.6–2.5 μm) or without inhibitor. For all measurements, the initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the computer program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). V=Vmax[S]/[Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]]Equation 1 where V is the initial velocity,Vmax is the maximum velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, Km is the Michaelis constant, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, andKi is the inhibition constant. Thekcat was calculated fromVmax/[E], where [E] is the total enzyme concentration. A FluoroMax-2 fluorometer was employed in protein fluorescence quenching experiments aimed at measuring the binding constants of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, and 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA with wild-type protein and/or with the D17N mutant thioesterase. The fluorescence spectrum of wild-type and D17N 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (0.5 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) resulting from 290 nm excitation is characterized by an emission maximum at 334 nm. For a typical titration experiment, 1-μl aliquots of ligand were added to a 1 ml solution of 0.5 μm of thioesterase, and the fluorescence intensity measured at 334 nm following each addition. The fluorescence data, collected at ligand concentrations ranging from 0 to 12 μm, were fitted to Equation 2 (13Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the Kaleida Graph computer program for nonlinear regression analysis.

The fluorescence spectrum of wild-type and D17N 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase resulting from 290 nm Trp excitation is characterized by an emission maximum at 334 nm. The enzyme contains four Trp residues at positions 23, 30, 47, and 87. Both Trp23 and Trp47 are located in the active site. Binding of 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA produces a 37% reduction in fluorescence intensity caused by static quenching. Strikingly, binding of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA results in 90% reduction in fluorescence intensity, suggesting that an additional mechanism of fluorescence quenching is operative. The 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA ligand (in buffer or bound to the thioesterase) does not absorb beyond 280 nm, but the 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA ligands do, especially when bound to the enzyme. This long wavelength absorption (290–380 nm) introduces a significant filter effect. Such an effect may influence the Kd values obtained from fluorescence titration experiments. Thus, the apparent Kd values reported for 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA in Table III are expected to be true to the actual dissociation constants, whereas the apparent Kd values reported for 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA may be smaller than the true dissociation constants.Table IIIWild-type and D17N mutant thioesterase-ligand binding constants measured at pH 7.5 and 25 °CComplexBinding constantWild-type enzyme-4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoAKi = 1.4 ± 0.1 μmWild-type enzyme-4-hydroxybenzyl-CoAKi = 0.26 ± 0.02 μmWild-type enzyme-4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoAKd = 0.33 ± 0.01 μmWild-type enzyme-4-hydroxybenzyl-CoAKd = 1.09 ± 0.04 μmD17N enzyme-4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoAKd = 0.42 ± 0.02 μmD17N enzyme-4-hydroxybenzyl-CoAKd = 1.00 ± 0.05 μmD17N enzyme-4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoAKd = 0.14 ± 0.02 μmInhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from steady-state competitive inhibition data, and dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from protein fluorescence quenching data. Open table in a new tab Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from steady-state competitive inhibition data, and dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from protein fluorescence quenching data. The binding constants of the two substrate analogs were also evaluated by measuring their competitive inhibition constants (Table III). In these measurements, the very small Km value of the substrate introduces uncertainty into the Ki value extracted, despite the low error obtained in data fitting. Our interpretation of the binding constants obtained by the two independent methods is simply that the substrate and inhibitor ligands bind to the thioesterase with high affinity (Kd = ∼1 μm) and that mutation of Asp17 to an asparagine residue does not impair this tight binding. The structures of the wild-type thioesterase complexed with either 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA were determined to 1.5 and 1.8 Å resolutions, respectively. The structure of the D17N mutant protein with bound substrate was determined to a nominal resolution of 2.8 Å. As an example of coordinate quality, a Ramachandran plot for the thioesterase-4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA complex is shown in Fig.2a, and the electron density corresponding to the bound ligand is displayed in Fig. 2b. Only two residues adopt dihedral angles significantly outside of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, namely Asp75 and Arg88. The electron densities for these two residues are unambiguous. Asp75 is the third residue in a type II turn that connects the second and third β-strands of the subunit. Arg88 is located near the 3′-phosphate group of the CoA ribose, and in fact, the peptidic NH group of Arg89lies within 2.8 Å of one of the phosphoryl oxygens. The torsional angles for Arg88 are similar in the unbound enzyme structure (3Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Liu R. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

All three structures described in this study are, like the structure of the unbound wild-type thioesterase, homotetramers with 16-kDa subunits. An α-carbon trace of the complete tetramer for the thioesterase complexed with 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA is depicted in Fig.3. The quaternary structure can be aptly described as a dimer of dimers. The α-carbons for the enzymes complexed with either 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA superimpose on those of the unbound wild-type thioesterase with root mean square deviations of 1.25 and 1.20 Å, respectively. Additionally, the α-carbons for the D17N mutant protein and the unbound wild-type enzyme superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.25 Å. On the other hand, the α-carbons for the complexes of the thioesterase with bound 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.20 Å. Clearly ligand binding influences the structure of the enzyme to some extent. The most significant regions of change upon ligand binding are concentrated in the loops defined by Arg100–Gln108 and Asn122–Leu127. The latter loop is located near the pyrophosphate moiety of the respective inhibitor. The active sites for the thioesterase are located at the interfaces of subunits A and B and subunits C and D (Fig. 3). As can be seen in Fig.3, the thioester and pantetheine moieties are bound in a deep crevice formed at the subunit-subunit interface, whereas the nucleotide moiety is positioned in a depression located on the solvated surface of one of the paired subunits. The 4-hydroxyphenacyl inhibitor differs from the natural substrate by one methylene group positioned between the sulfur of the CoA and the carbonyl carbon of the acyl group (Scheme FS2). A close-up view of the thioesterase active site with bound 4-hydroxyphenacyl is displayed in Fig. 4a. For the sake of clarity, only those residues located within 3.5 Å of the acyl pantetheine unit are shown. Trp47 from one subunit and Trp23 and Tyr24 from the second subunit encircle the aromatic moiety of the ligand. Two aspartate residues lie near the 4-hydoxyphenacyl group, namely Asp32 from one subunit and Asp17 from the second subunit. These residues are separated by ∼7 Å. Note that Oδ2 of Asp17 is positioned at 3.2 Å from the carbonyl carbon of the phenacyl group. There are four well ordered water molecules located within 3.5 Å of the acyl pantetheine moiety, two of which serve to link the polar groups of the ligand to either Nε1 of Trp47 or Oη of Tyr27. A cartoon of the hydrogen-bonding pattern exhibited between the ligand and the protein is presented in Fig. 4b. The ribose ring of the inhibitor is in the C2′-endo configuration. Thirteen water molecules are located within hydrogen bonding distance to the ligand. There is an ethylene glycol molecule that serves as a bridge between one of the hydroxyl groups of the acyl pantetheine unit and a phosphoryl oxygen. Interestingly, only one protein side chain, namely that contributed by Ser91, participates directly in ligand binding. All of the other interactions between the protein and the inhibitor are mediated through backbone peptidic NH groups, carbonyl oxygens, and/or solvents. Of interest is the fact that the three positively charge residues Arg88, Arg89, and Lys90, which are in the vicinity of the CoA phosphate groups, are not used in ion pair formation. Rather the side chain of Lys90 interacts with the inhibitor through a bridging water molecule. Likewise, the guanidinium group of Arg88 lies within hydrogen bonding distance to a water, which, in turn, interacts with N-3 of the adenine ring. In 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, the carbonyl moiety of the acyl group has been removed (Scheme FS2). A close-up view of the thioesterase active site with this bound ligand is shown in Fig.5a, and a superposition of the active sites with either bound 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA or 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA is given in Fig. 5b. In the case of 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, there are five ordered water molecules lying within 3.5 Å of the acyl pantetheine group. The ethylene glycol molecule discussed above is not observed in the model with bound 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the aromatic moieties of both inhibitors occupy, within experimental error, identical positions within the thioesterase active site. The lack of the carbonyl group in 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA, however, results in a movement of the ligand within the active site such that the positions of the sulfurs in 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA versus4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA differ by ∼1.5 Å. As expected, Asp17 of the wild-type thioesterase and Asn17 of the mutant protein coincide within experimental error. Because of the lower resolution of the x-ray data from the D17N mutant protein crystals, however, it was not possible to define the solvent structure. Given that the three ligands are bound in the active site in approximately the same orientation as can be seen in Fig.6, it is possible to discuss a catalytic mechanism for the thioesterase based on the arrangement of the groups in the enzyme-4-hydroxyphenacyl complex. The thioester carbonyl group is positioned at the N-terminal region of an active site helix, thereby placing the reaction center under the influence of a positive helical dipole moment. Specifically, this carbonyl group is locked into place via a hydrogen bond with the backbone peptidic NH group of Tyr24 as indicated in Fig. 4b. Most likely the hydrogen bond and the helical dipole moment serve to polarize the electron density away from the carbonyl carbon, thereby making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Additionally, the C-4 OH group on the ring of the inhibitor (or substrate) serves to correctly position the ligand into the active site by forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone peptidic NH of Thr59 and a water molecule that is in turn hydrogen-bonded to Nε1 of Trp47. Thus far, all biochemical and structural data indicate that the catalytic residue in this thioesterase is Asp17. The side chain of Asp17 is held into position through a hydrogen bonding interaction with the backbone peptidic NH group of Ala19. In the wild-type enzyme complexed with 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA, the Asp17 oxygen is ∼3.2 Å away from the carbonyl carbon, whereas in the D17N mutant protein complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, Nδ2 of Asn17 is positioned at ∼3.7 Å from the carbonyl carbon. It was originally speculated that Asp17 would be involved in activating a water molecule for attack on the thioester carbonyl carbon (3Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Liu R. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33572-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On the basis of the current structural data, however, there is apparently not enough space between the ligand and Asp17 to accommodate a water molecule. Indeed, there are no water molecules bound in the region between the Asp17 carboxylate side chain and either the 4-hydroxybenzyl-CoA or 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA inhibitors. Solvent accessibility calculations with a search probe of 1.4 Å further support an active site devoid of waters between Asp17 and the inhibitors or substrate (14Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The distance of the nucleophile from the carbonyl carbon and its attack angle (15Lightstone F.C. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2595-2605Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), coupled with the absence of a water molecule near the reaction center, suggests the possibility that Asp17functions as a nucleophile in the hydrolysis of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA rather than as a general base. Nucleophilic catalysis requires that the reaction proceeds via an anhydride enzyme intermediate. Catalysis by phosphotransferases of the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase enzyme family is known to proceed via aspartylphosphate intermediates (16Cantley L.C., Jr. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Missiaen L. Wuytack F., De Smedt H. Vrolix M. Casteels R. Biochem.

Moreover, the catalytic mechanisms of succinyl-5CoA:3-ketoacid CoA-transferase (21Solomon F. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1079-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rochet J.-C. Bridger W.A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Jacob U. Mack M. Clausen T. Huber R. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Structure. 1997; 5: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) proceed via acyl transfer to an active site glutamate to form an anhydride intermediate, which subsequently reacts with the displaced CoA to form the glutamyl-CoA thioester intermediate. The formation of the aspartyl 4-hydroxybenzoate intermediate during 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase catalysis has, therefore, ample precedence. According to the present structural data, the active site does not offer acid catalysis for stabilization of the displaced CoA thiolate anion. On the other hand, the basicity of this anion is very modest (conjugate acid pKa = ∼8.5), and electrostatic interactions between it and the positive end of the helix dipole may be all the stabilization that is required. If the reaction proceeds via an acylated enzyme intermediate, then it would be expected that once the CoA departs, the water nucleophile binds and attacks at the carbonyl carbon. The identity of the base required to position and activate the water for nucleophilic attack is unknown at the present time. In summary, the present study defines in detail the interactions required for the binding and positioning of a substrate molecule within the active site pocket of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase. Several key and intriguing questions remain for future study. For example, does the reaction proceed via simple base catalyzed hydrolysis or via nucleophilic catalysis? If the former occurs, where does the water molecule bind? If the latter situation is operational, how is the water molecule activated for hydrolysis of the acylated enzyme intermediate? If the reaction occurs via a covalent enzyme intermediate, is the nucleophilic displacement concerted? Both biochemical and x-ray crystallographic experiments designed to address these issues are presently underway."
https://openalex.org/W2025465570,"Vitamin A derivatives (retinoids) are potent regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Retinoids inhibit the function of the oncogenic AP-1 and β-catenin/TCF pathways and also stabilize components of the adherens junction, a tumor suppressor complex. When treated with retinoic acid (RA), the breast cancer cell line, SKBR3, undergoes differentiation and reduction in cell proliferation. The present work demonstrates that in SKBR3 cells, which exhibit high AP-1 activity, RA-regulation of cadherin expression and function, but not changes in AP-1 (or β-catenin/TCF) signaling, is responsible for the epithelial differentiation. However, cadherin function and recruitment of β-catenin to the membrane is not required for RA to regulate DNA synthesis in these cells. RA also reduces the activity of an AP-1 and TCF-sensitive cyclin D1 reporter in SKBR3 cells in a manner that is independent of the TCF site. In contrast, in SW480 cells, which have high levels of β-catenin/TCF signaling, the activity and retinoid responsiveness of the cyclin D1 promoter was markedly inhibited by mutation of the TCF site. These data indicate that the remarkably broad effects of RA on the growth and differentiation of many different epithelial cancers may well be explained by the ability of RA to differentially regulate the activity of RAR/RXR, AP-1, and β-catenin/TCF pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2147138483,"Phospholipid translocation (flip-flop) across membrane bilayers is typically assessed via assays utilizing partially water-soluble phospholipid analogs as transport reporters. These assays have been used in previous work to show that phospholipid translocation in biogenic (self-synthesizing) membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum is facilitated by specific membrane proteins (flippases). To extend these studies to natural phospholipids while providing a framework to guide the purification of a flippase, we now describe an assay to measure the transbilayer translocation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, a membrane-embedded phospholipid, in proteoliposomes generated from detergent-solubilized rat liver endoplasmic reticulum. Translocation was assayed using phospholipase A2 under conditions where the vesicles were determined to be intact. Phospholipase A2 rapidly hydrolyzed phospholipids in the outer leaflet of liposomes and proteoliposomes with a half-time of ∼0.1 min. However, for flippase-containing proteoliposomes, the initial rapid hydrolysis phase was followed by a slower phase reflecting flippase-mediated translocation of phospholipids from the inner to the outer leaflet. The amplitude of the slow phase was decreased in trypsin-treated proteoliposomes. The kinetic characteristics of the slow phase were used to assess the rate of transbilayer equilibration of phospholipids. For 250-nm diameter vesicles containing a single flippase, the half-time was 3.3 min. Proportionate reductions in equilibration half-time were observed for preparations with a higher average number of flippases/vesicle. Preliminary purification steps indicated that flippase activity could be enriched ∼15-fold by sequential adsorption of the detergent extract onto anion and cation exchange resins.

Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To populate the exoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer and allow for uniform bilayer growth, some of the newly synthesized phospholipids have to be transferred (flipped) to the opposite membrane leaflet. Flip-flop does not occur spontaneously because of the thermodynamic barrier encountered in moving the charged/polar headgroup of a phospholipid through the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer. Indeed, in artificial bilayers, liposomal systems, and certain biomembranes, transverse movement of phospholipids, i.e. transfer of a phospholipid from one side of the membrane to the other, occurs only very slowly if at all (2Kornberg R.D. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 3Rothman J.E. Dawidowicz E.A.

Nevertheless, it is clear from a number of studies, including our own, that transbilayer movement of phospholipids occurs rapidly in the ER as well as in other biogenic membranes such as the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (5Bishop W.R.

These studies further indicate that phospholipid translocation in the ER occurs bidirectionally by a facilitated diffusion process requiring no metabolic energy input. The latter observation rules out the participation of the ABC family of transporters that are involved in metabolic energy-dependent, vectorial transport of solutes and some lipids. Thus the molecular mechanism by which phospholipids are translocated across the ER is unknown. It is commonly hypothesized that the metabolic energy-independent flipping of phospholipids across the ER bilayer is facilitated by specific transport proteins (termed biogenic membrane flippases) (13Bretscher M.S.

Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) described a reconstitution system in which a detergent extract of ER membranes was used to prepare proteoliposomes capable of transporting dibutyroyl-PC, a water-soluble analog of phosphatidylcholine. This reconstitution system was used to show that dibutyroyl-PC translocation required a specific membrane protein(s) whose abundance was estimated at ∼0.2% by weight of ER membrane proteins. We now extend these results to assay the transbilayer movement of a genuinely membrane-embedded phospholipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The new assay, based on phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids located in the outer leaflet of membrane vesicles, confirms the main conclusions of our previous work while eliminating the real and perceived complications of using short chain phospholipid analogs as transport reporters. 2The initial comparison of the dibutyryl-PC-based assay with the PLA2-based assay was described by Hrafnsdóttir and Menon (18Hrafnsdóttir S. Menon A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The assay also offers the opportunity to measure the kinetics of transport, a measurement that was not possible with the dibutyroyl-PC-based assay. Thus we report on the requirement for a specific, trypsin-sensitive ER protein(s) to translocate DPPC as well as on the rate at which DPPC equilibrates between the inner and outer leaflets of vesicles equipped with a single translocator/flippase. We conclude by using our assay procedures to show that flippase activity can be readily enriched by biochemical fractionation of the ER detergent extract, thus laying the groundwork for eventual purification of the transporter. l-α-Dipalmitoyl-[3H]phosphatidylcholine (∼80 Ci/mmol) and d-[2-3H]mannose (∼20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Frozen rat livers were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals. SM-2 Bio-Beads for detergent removal and all chemicals required for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. ULTROLTM grade Triton X-100 and CM-Sepharose fast flow resin were purchased from Calbiochem. Egg phosphatidylcholine (ePC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), PLA2 from Naja najavenom, FITC-dextran (molecular mass ∼ 4,300 Da) and routine chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise specified. Silica 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from EM Science. All chemicals were analytical grade unless otherwise specified. Rough ER microsomes were isolated from rat liver homogenates and stripped of peripheral proteins by salt washing as described previously (17Menon A.K. Watkins W.E. Hrafnsdóttir S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Commercially available frozen rat livers were used for this purpose. The SWER preparations were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼20–25 mg/ml. Aliquots (0.5 ml) were stored frozen at −80 °C and thawed rapidly in a 30 °C water bath before use. The yield of SWER was ∼120 mg/g, wet weight, of liver. TEs were prepared freshly for every experiment by mixing equal volumes of SWER and solubilizing buffer (50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) Triton X-100). The mixture was incubated for 30–60 min on ice with occasional pipette mixing before being centrifuged in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 70,000 rpm (175,000 × g) for 30 min. The clear supernatant (TE) was removed carefully using a Pasteur pipette without disturbing the fluffy surface of the pellet of Triton-insoluble material. The TE was placed on ice until use for chromatography or vesicle reconstitution. The TE typically contained ∼65% SWER protein. Proteoliposomes were prepared from a mixture of TE (or TE-derived chromatographic fractions) and Triton X-100-solubilized ePC. Protein-free liposomes were prepared similarly from Triton X-100-solubilized ePC alone or ePC supplemented with other phospholipids or a lipid extract of SWER. The mixtures were supplemented with [3H]DPPC to a concentration of ∼1.25 μCi of [3H]DPPC/μmol of ePC. Briefly, ePC and [3H]DPPC were dried under nitrogen in a glass screw cap tube, and the dried residue was dissolved in reconstitution buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100). TE or TE-derived fractions were added as specified to yield 2 ml of sample in reconstitution buffer at a phospholipid concentration of 4.5 mm. Different amounts of TE were used to generate proteoliposomes with different protein/phospholipid ratios. The samples were then treated with SM-2 Bio-Beads as described previously (17Menon A.K. Watkins W.E. Hrafnsdóttir S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Hrafnsdóttir S. Menon A.K. J.

Acta. 1990; 1025: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to remove the Triton X-100 and generate liposomes or proteoliposomes. The vesicles were collected by centrifugation in a TLA 100.3 rotor for 45 min at 80,000 (∼230,000 × g) rpm and 4 °C, resuspended in HS buffer (10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), and centrifuged again as described above. The washed vesicles were suspended in HS buffer, and transport assays were carried out the same day. Protein recovery in the reconstituted vesicles was ∼50%; lipid recovery was ∼70%. Transbilayer translocation of [3H]DPPC in reconstituted vesicle preparations was measured by determining the accessibility of the lipid to exogenously added PLA2 (for a schematic illustration of the assay, see Fig. 1). Suspensions of [3H]DPPC-containing reconstituted vesicles were adjusted to a concentration of 0.1 mmphospholipid, supplemented with CaCl2 (5 mmfinal) and NaCl (180 mm final), then incubated with PLA2 from N. naja venom (∼1 unit/μl) at 30 °C for different periods of time. The total assay volume was 30 μl. Hydrolysis was stopped by adding EGTA (30 μl from a 120 mm stock solution) and 40 μl of water. Phospholipids were immediately extracted according to the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC on silica 60 plates using chloroform, methanol, and 28% ammonia (65:25:5, by volume) as the solvent system. Radioactivity on the TLC plate was detected and quantitated with a Berthold LB 2842 TLC scanner. Samples in which buffer was used instead of PLA2, or EGTA and buffer were added before the addition of PLA2, were used as controls. In addition, vesicles were disrupted by adding 0.5% Triton X-100 before the addition of PLA2 to determine maximum hydrolysis. The extent of hydrolysis was determined as (lyso-[3H]PC)/(lyso-[3H]PC + [3H]DPPC). [3H]DPPC-containing proteoliposomes were prepared from a mixture of ePC, [3H]DPPC, and TE such that the protein/phospholipid ratio was <60 mg/mmol. The reconstituted vesicles (suspended in HS at a concentration of ∼1 mm phospholipid) were treated with trypsin (0.3–0.9 mg/ml final concentration as specified) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding ∼0.6–1.8 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (in proportion to the amount of trypsin used). Parallel samples were mock-treated with HS buffer instead of trypsin or by adding trypsin inhibitor together with trypsin. Trypsin-treated and mock-treated samples were assayed as described above for their ability to translocate [3H]DPPC. Vesicle integrity was monitored by determining the extent of leakage of soluble reporters trapped within the vesicles. The leakage of radiolabeled reporters such as [3H]mannose and [3H]inulin was determined as described previously (17Menon A.K. Watkins W.E. Hrafnsdóttir S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Hrafnsdóttir S. Menon A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additional tests were conducted using the fluorescent molecule FITC-dextran (molecular mass ∼ 4,300 Da) trapped at self-quenching concentrations within the vesicles. Leakage of FITC-dextran results in dequenching and a consequent increase in fluorescence. Vesicles were reconstituted in the presence of 0.1 mm FITC-dextran and washed by centrifugation to remove nonenclosed FITC-dextran. FITC-dextran-containing vesicles were treated with PLA2 to measure [3H]DPPC transport. Mock-treated samples were used as controls. After PLA2 treatment for different periods of time, the vesicles were diluted with HS buffer, and FITC-dextran fluorescence was measured using an Aminco spectrofluorometer set at an excitation wavelength of 465 nm and an emission wavelength of 543 nm. Total FITC-dextran fluorescence in the sample was determined after treating the vesicles with 0.5% Triton X-100 to release all of the trapped fluorescent reporters. The percent leakage of FITC-dextran was determined as ∼ (Ft −F 0)*100/(FT −F 0) where Ft is fluorescence (arbitrary units) of samples treated with PLA2for time t, F 0 is fluorescence of mock-treated samples, and FT is total fluorescence determined after Triton X-100 permeabilization. TE and TE-derived fractions were fractionated on DE52 and CM-Sepharose. Detergent (1% Triton X-100) was present in all buffers. Samples were dialyzed to adjust to buffer and salt conditions determined to be optimal for column binding. Samples to be fractionated on DE52 were adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100; samples for CM-Sepharose were adjusted to 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Binding was carried out in batch mode with end-over-end mixing for 2 h. Supernatant solutions containing unbound material were separated from the resin by centrifugation and tested for flippase activity after dialysis (to adjust salt to 100 mm) and reconstitution. Flippase activity was calculated first by determining the extent,x, of [3H]DPPC hydrolysis beyond that seen in liposomes, i.e. the amplitude of the second phase of the hydrolysis time course shown in Fig. 2 B, and second, by normalizing the result to the protein/phospholipid ratio, r. Thus, specific activity = x/r. The total activity was calculated by multiplying the specific activity by the total amount of protein. Phospholipids were quantitated by measuring lipid phosphorus (21Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined with the micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce Chemical Co. In the case of proteoliposomes, especially those with a low protein/phospholipid ratio, samples were delipidated, precipitated, and dissolved in 1% SDS before protein measurement (17Menon A.K. Watkins W.E. Hrafnsdóttir S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Hrafnsdóttir S. Menon A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). All lipid and protein estimations were performed in duplicate. All experiments were performed in duplicate unless mentioned otherwise. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The assay is illustrated in Fig.1. Glycerophospholipids located in the outer leaflet of a membrane vesicle are susceptible to hydrolysis by exogenously added PLA2. In the absence of any transbilayer transport as in liposomes, all phospholipids in the outer leaflet are expected to be converted to lysophospholipids and fatty acids by PLA2, whereas phospholipids in the inner leaflet will be protected from hydrolysis. For unilamellar liposomes of ∼250-nm diameter, up to 60% of the total phospholipid is expected to be hydrolyzed (23Cullis P.R. Fenske D.B. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 1-33Google Scholar). If the vesicles contain a flippase capable of facilitating bidirectional translocation of phospholipids, then the extent of hydrolysis is expected to increase to 100% as inner leaflet lipids are flipped to the outer leaflet and become accessible to PLA2 (outer leaflet lysophospholipids + fatty acid complexes are presumed to be flipped to the inner leaflet to compensate (24Kawashima Y. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16495-16502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Because both products of PLA2 cleavage (the lysophospholipid and fatty acid) remain in the membrane, the vesicles remain structurally intact and retain their permeability barrier (see below). Indeed, stoichiometric mixtures of lysophospholipids and fatty acids are known to form bilayer structures when dispersed in aqueous media, suggesting that despite the lack of covalent linkage, the lysophospholipid and fatty acid remain associated or pack together in such a way as to form a bilayer membrane (25Jain M.K. van Echteld C.J.A. Ramirez F. de Gier J. de Haas G.H. van Deenen L.L.M. Nature. 1980; 284: 486-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When ePC vesicles prepared with trace amounts of [3H]DPPC were treated with PLA2, roughly half of the [3H]DPPC was converted to lyso- (monoacylated) [3H]PC and palmitic acid in the outer leaflet (Fig.2 A, ■). The time course of hydrolysis could be well described by a single exponential function, with a half-time of ∼0.1 min to reach a plateau value of ∼45–50% hydrolysis. Similar time courses were seen with ePC vesicles containing ER lipids (comparable with the amount of phospholipid in 100 μl of a TE of SWER (see below); Fig. 2 A, ●), ePC vesicles containing a mixture of PS and PE (5 mol% each; Fig. 2 A, ⋄), and ePC vesicles that had been subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles, followed by extrusion through a 0.2-μm filter (data not shown). We conclude that the liposome preparations are unilamellar and that only those phospholipids located in the outer leaflet are accessible to PLA2. Similar experiments were carried out with proteoliposomes prepared from a solution of [3H]DPPC/ePC supplemented with a TE of SWER vesicles. Unlike the time course of hydrolysis seen with liposomes, the time course of PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of [3H]DPPC in the proteoliposome samples showed biphasic behavior, reaching a final extent of hydrolysis greater than that seen with liposomes (Fig. 2 B). For the two proteoliposome preparations analyzed in Fig. 2 B, the final extent of [3H]DPPC hydrolysis was greater in the sample prepared at a protein/phospholipid ratio of ∼65 mg/mmol compared with the sample prepared at ∼23 mg/mmol. A systematic investigation of the extent of PLA2-mediated [3H]DPPC hydrolysis in proteoliposomes as a function of the protein/phospholipid ratio of the preparations is shown in Fig.2 C. The extent of hydrolysis increased linearly from ∼45% for protein-free liposomes to ∼75% for proteoliposomes prepared at a protein/phospholipid ratio of ∼60 mg/mmol. This can be explained by noting that an increase in the protein/phospholipid ratio in the range of 0–60 mg/mmol increases the number of flippase-containing vesicles in the sample, i.e. at a low protein/phospholipid ratio not every proteoliposome contains a flippase, whereas at protein/phospholipid ratios approaching 60 mg/mmol the majority of proteoliposomes contain one flippase/vesicle on average. Thus the 0–60 mg/mmol regime is characterized by vesicles containing no or one flippase/vesicle, tending to zero flippases/vesicle at 0 mg/mmol and one flippase/vesicle at 60 mg/mmol. No additional hydrolysis was seen when the protein/phospholipid ratio was increased beyond ∼60 mg/mmol. The reason for hydrolysis plateauing at ∼75% instead of 100% as suggested in the schematic in Fig. 1 is unclear (see “Discussion”). A maximum of 90–95% hydrolysis was achieved, however, when the membrane permeability barrier was disrupted by adding 0.5% Triton X-100 before the addition of PLA2. We interpret the data shown in Fig. 2 Cas follows. We propose that for proteoliposomes with a protein/phospholipid ratio of ∼60 mg/mmol, each vesicle in the preparation contains one flippase unit capable of transporting inner leaflet phospholipids to the outer leaflet where PLA2-mediated hydrolysis to lysophospholipid and fatty acid occurs. Increases in protein/phospholipid ratio beyond ∼60 mg/mmol result in vesicles with more than one flippase unit/vesicle on average. An increase in the number of transporters beyond one/vesicle does not change the amplitude of transport (monitored as the extent of PLA2-mediated hydrolysis) as seen by the hydrolysis plateau in Fig. 2 C but is expected to increase the rate of transport as discussed below. The biphasic time course of [3H]DPPC hydrolysis in PLA2-treated proteoliposomes consists of an initial phase similar in rate and extent to that seen with liposomes, followed by a slower second phase (Fig.2 B). The initial phase corresponds to the rapid hydrolysis of phospholipids situated in the outer leaflet of the vesicles and is independent of the protein/phospholipid ratio of the proteoliposome preparation (Fig. 3 A). We argue that the second, slower phase corresponds to the rate-limiting transbilayer movement of [3H]DPPC from the inner leaflet to the vesicle exterior, presumably accompanied by the compensatory inward flipping of PC and quasi-complexes of lyso-PC and fatty acid. One prediction of this idea is that the second phase half-time will be independent of the protein/phospholipid ratio in the range of 0–60 mg/mmol in which proteoliposome preparations contain ≤ one flippase/vesicle as discussed above, but will decrease proportionately once the protein/phospholipid ratio exceeds 60 mg/mmol and preparations have > one flippase/vesicle on average. Fig. 3 B shows that this is indeed the case. The transbilayer movement of [3H]DPPC in vesicles equipped with a single flippase unit is characterized by a half-time of 3.3 min. As the protein/phospholipid ratio increases past 60 mg/mmol, the half-time of transbilayer translocation decreases. The slope of the line drawn in the >60 mg/mmol regime in Fig. 3 B corresponds to a decrease in rate proportional to the increase in the protein/phospholipid ratio. The data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that specific membrane proteins in the TE are required to translocate [3H]DPPC from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of proteoliposomes (see “Discussion”). To test this further, we investigated the effect of proteolysis on the extent of [3H]DPPC hydrolysis in PLA2-treated proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes (protein/phospholipid ratio ∼37 mg/mmol) were incubated with trypsin for 20 min at room temperature after which the trypsin was inactivated by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (a control sample was incubated with a combination of trypsin and trypsin inhibitor). The proteoliposomes were then assayed for their ability to translocate [3H]DPPC. As shown in Fig.4 A, trypsin treatment resulted in a reduction in the number of flippase-active vesicles (seen as a reduction in the extent of [3H]DPPC hydrolysis in the slow kinetic phase) by about 30% and a decrease in the rate of flipping (by a factor of ∼1.7). Increasing amounts of trypsin caused progressively greater effects (Fig. 4 B). These data confirm that transbilayer movement of [3H]DPPC requires the participation of trypsin-sensitive membrane proteins. PLA2 treatment results in hydrolysis of up to 75% of the phospholipid in proteoliposome preparations of ≥60 mg/mmol. To verify that the barrier function of the membrane is not compromised under these conditions and that PLA2 does not have direct access to phospholipids in the inner leaflet of the vesicles, we tested the ability of the vesicles to retain soluble content markers that were trapped in the vesicle interior during reconstitution. In preliminary experiments we trapped [3H]mannose in liposomes and proteoliposomes and measured the extent to which [3H]mannose leaked of the vesicles in response to PLA2 treatment for 60 min. Vesicles were centrifuged after PLA2 treatment, and an aliquot of the supernatant was taken for liquid scintillation counting. The results showed that ∼8–10% of the [3H]mannose radioactivity in the vesicle sample was released and that this level of leakage occurred in both liposomes and proteoliposomes irrespective of PLA2 treatment (result not shown). We confirmed this result using a different leakage assay in which FITC-dextran (molecular mass ∼ 4,300 Da) was trapped at a self-quenching concentration within the vesicles. FITC-dextran-containing vesicles were treated with PLA2 to measure [3H]DPPC transport. Mock-treated samples were used as controls. Total FITC-dextran fluorescence in the sample was determined after treating the vesicles with 0.5% Triton X-100 to release all of the trapped fluorescent reporters. The results reinforced the data obtained with [3H]mannose: there was no detectable leakage of FITC-dextran from liposomes and proteoliposomes treated for 20 min with PLA2 and only a low level of leakage (6 ± 2% of the total, detergent-released signal) in vesicles treated for 60 min with PLA2. Trypsin-treated vesicles, such as those described in Fig. 4, displayed identical characteristics (data not shown). We conclude that PLA2 treatment does not disrupt the membrane permeability barrier in samples treated for 20 min, a time period more than sufficient to reach equilibrium in the transport/hydrolysis assays shown in Fig. 2, A and B. As an initial step toward purifying a phospholipid flippase from rat liver ER, we chromatographed the TE on ion exchange resins. The TE was first incubated with preequilibrated DE52 anion exchange resin, and the unbound protein was incubated further with CM-Sepharose fast flow cation exchange resin. Incubations were carried out in batch mode. Unfractionated TE and samples of unbound material at both stages of incubation with the ion exchange resins were mixed with [3H]DPPC and e"

The nature of this role, however, is unclear because a variety of apolipoproteins bind to SR-BI expressed in transfected cells. In this study the role of apoA-I in SR-BI-mediated HDL CE-selective uptake was tested via analyses of the biochemical properties ofapoA-I−/− HDL and its interaction with SR-BI on adrenocortical cells, hepatoma cells, and cells expressing a transfected SR-BI. apoA-I−/− HDL are large heterogeneous particles with a core consisting predominantly of CE and a surface enriched in phospholipid, free cholesterol, apoA-II, and apoE. Functional analysis showed apoA-I−/− HDL to bind to SR-BI with the same or higher affinity as compared withapoA-I+/+ HDL, butapoA-I−/− HDL showed a 2–3-fold decrease in the V max for CE transfer from the HDL particle to adrenal cells. These results indicate that the absence of apoA-I results in HDL particles with a reduced capacity for SR-BI-mediated CE-selective uptake. The reduced V maxillustrates that HDL properties necessary for binding to SR-BI are distinct from those properties necessary for the transfer of HDL CE from the core of the HDL particle to the plasma membrane. The reduced V max for HDL CE-selective uptake likely contributes to the severe reduction in CE accumulation in steroidogenic cells of apoA-I−/− mice.

The premise that HDL and apoA-I are protective against atherosclerosis is supported by studies showing that expression of human apoA-I in transgenic mice protects against the development of aortic lesions (3Ruben E.M.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2263-2267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most widely accepted model explaining the anti-atherogenic properties of apoA-I is reverse cholesterol transport (7Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, poorly lipidated apoA-I first removes excess free cholesterol from peripheral cells through a mechanism dependent on ABCA1 (8Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). ApoA-I then acts as a co-factor for LCAT, which catalyzes formation of cholesteryl ester (CE), resulting in the conversion of the poorly lipidated apoA-I to a spherical HDL particle. After being remodeled by cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, and phospholipid transfer protein, HDL delivers its CE either to the liver, where it can be excreted or repackaged into new lipoproteins, or to ovaries, testes, and adrenal glands, where it can be used in the production of steroid hormones. The importance of apoA-I in reverse cholesterol transport has been confirmed by the creation of mice deficient in this apolipoprotein. Compared with apoA-I+/+ mice,apoA-I−/− mice have an ∼70% reduction in total plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol (9Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, LCAT activity in the plasma of the apoA-I−/− mice is 75% lower than in apoA-I+/+ mice. Reduced LCAT activity is directly linked to the absence of apoA-I because addition of apoA-I to apoA-I−/− plasma restores LCAT activity to near normal levels (12Parks J.S., Li, H. Gebre A.K. Smith T.L. Maeda N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 349-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the decrease in plasma HDL levels, apoA-I−/− mice have a dramatic decrease in CE accumulation in the cortical cells of the adrenal gland, luteal and interstitial cells of the ovary, and Leydig cells of the testis (13Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This reduction appears to reflect the absence of apoA-I and not simply the reduced HDL levels becauseapoA-II−/− mice have near normal CE levels in steroidogenic cells despite having plasma HDL and HDL CE levels equivalent to those in the apoA-I−/− mice (13Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This result suggests a specific effect of apoA-I on CE accumulation in steroidogenic cells. HDL provides cholesterol to cells via a selective uptake pathway in which HDL CE and free cholesterol (FC) are taken into the cell without the uptake and lysosomal degradation of the HDL particle (14Glass C.

The selective delivery of HDL cholesterol to cells differs from the classical LDL receptor pathway in which lipoprotein particles are degraded in lysosomes to release the constituent lipids for use by the cell (20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). The selective uptake pathway is the major route for the delivery of HDL CE to the liver and steroidogenic cells of rodentsin vivo and in vitro (14Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

Recent studies indicate that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is the cell surface receptor responsible for HDL CE-selective uptake (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

These studies are complemented by studies in which hepatic SR-BI was overexpressed by either an adenovirus vector (37Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M.

Taken together, these data indicate that SR-BI plays a key role in mediating HDL CE-selective uptake by cells of the liver and steroidogenic organs and in determining the plasma levels of HDL cholesterol in mice. The severe depletion of CE in steroidogenic cells ofapoA-I−/− mice suggests that apoA-I plays a specific role in the HDL CE-selective uptake process mediated by SR-BIin vivo.

Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we tested the role of apoA-I in SR-BI-mediated HDL CE-selective uptake by analyses of the biochemical properties ofapoA-I−/− HDL and the functional interaction of these particles with SR-BI on adrenocortical cells, hepatoma cells, and cells expressing a transfected SR-BI. The results show that large CE-rich apoA-I−/− HDL bind to SR-BI with the same affinity as apoA-I+/+ HDL. In contrast,apoA-I−/− HDL show a reducedV max for CE transfer from the HDL particle to the cell. These results indicate that the absence of apoA-I results in HDL particles with a reduced capacity for SR-BI-mediated CE-selective uptake. The reduced V max for HDL CE transfer likely contributes to the severe reduction in CE accumulation in steroidogenic cells of apoA-I−/− mice. The following reagents used for culturing the ldlA[mSR-BI], Fu5AH, and Y1-BS1 cells were purchased from the listed venders: poly-d-lysine (BD PharMingen), EMEM (Bio-Whittaker), heat-denatured fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen), 6- and 12-well plates (Costar), Cortrosyn (Organon), and Ham's F-10 medium, Ham's F-10-HEPES medium, and heat-denatured horse serum (Sigma). Sodium [125I]iodide and [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether were acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. C57BL/6J-Apoa1tm1Unc (10Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and “wild type” apoA-I+/+ C57BL/6J were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, and colonies were established at the Scripps Research Institute and, subsequently, at the La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine. At the State University of New York (Stony Brook, NY), the C57BL/6J-Apoa1tm1Unc mice were cross-bred withapoA-I+/+ FVB/N mice to overcome the reproductive deficiency of the C57BL/6J-Apoa1tm1Unc mice (small litter size and low survival rate). This was necessary to obtain sufficient HDL for these studies. Progeny heterozygous for the mutated apoA-I allele were then mated with apoA-I+/+ FVB/N mice for 3 generations. The genotypes of all offspring were determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA as described (10Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Heterozygotes having a 8:1 FVB/N:C57BL/6 background were then mated to generate mice carrying either two normal (apoA-I+/+ ) or two mutated copies of the apoA-I allele (apoA-I−/− ).apoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/− animals were mated within their respective genotype to achieve the numbers of animals necessary for the experiments listed below. Additional FVB/N apoA-I+/+ mice were obtained from Taconic and maintained as a separate colony. All mice were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with standard rodent chow and waterad libitum. Housing and experimental procedures were approved by the State University of New York at Stony Brook Committee on Laboratory Animal Resources and the Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated by heart puncture. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. If not used immediately, plasma was frozen at −80 °C after adding sucrose to a final concentration of 10%. Prior to isolation of lipoproteins, 0.05% NaN3, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm EDTA (final concentrations) were added. Lipoproteins in the 1.02–1.21 g/ml density range were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation using KBr at 1.02 and 1.21 g/ml, respectively. Following dialysis against PBS-E (150 mmNaCl, 10 mmK x H x PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), an equal amount ofapoA-I+/+ or apoA-I−/− lipoprotein total cholesterol was fractionated by HPLC using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Using the Cholesterol CII enzymatic assay (Wako), the total cholesterol concentration was determined for 40 0.4-ml fractions collected from 10 to 50 min after sample injection. Equal volumes of fractions 20–30 from the Superose column were diluted with 5× SDS sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue), heated for 5 min at 90–100 °C, and analyzed by 8–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis followed by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For structural and compositional analysis of the HDL,apoA-I+/+ fractions 24–30 andapoA-I−/− fractions 22–30 were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon 50 (Millipore), and dialyzed against PBS-E. Total cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipid, and triglyceride concentrations were measured using commercially available enzymatic kits (Wako). Cholesteryl ester concentration was calculated by multiplying the difference between total cholesterol and free cholesterol by 1.68 to account for the mass of the esterified acyl chain. A modified Lowry assay using horse IgG as a standard (Pierce) was used for protein measurement (43Markwell M.A. Hass S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). HDL (25 μg of protein) was analyzed by 4–25% nondenaturing gradient gel (16 cm × 14 cm × 1.5 mm) electrophoresis at 4 °C. After pre-running the gel at 125 V for 30 min, samples were loaded in 0.045 m Tris borate/0.001 m EDTA, pH 8.3, 10% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue and run as follows: 25 V for 15 min, 50 V for 15 min, 75 V for 15 min, 125 V for 15 min, and 250 V for 24 h. Proteins were then visualized using 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. HDL radiolabeled with 125I was overlaid on 1 ml of 1.30 g/ml KBr. A step gradient was created by sequentially adding the following KBr solutions: 3 ml of 1.21 g/ml, 4 ml of 1.12 g/ml, 3 ml of 1.063 g/ml, 1 ml of 1.02 g/ml. The gradient was centrifuged in a SW41 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 24 h at 15 °C. After collecting 17 0.7-ml fractions from the top to the bottom of the gradient, the samples were counted for 125I activity and weighed to determine density. For each HDL sample, particle diameters were determined optically by dynamic light scattering analysis with a Microtrac Series 150 Ultrafine particle analyzer fitted with a flexible conduit-sheathed probe tip (UPA-150, Microtrac, Clearwater, FL) (44Walzem R.L. Davis P.A. Hansen R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1354-1366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particles were assumed to be transparent and non-spherical with a density of 1.16 g/ml and a refractive index of 1.46. Raw particle-size distributions were converted to population percentiles, which were used to calculate median particle diameter for each decile of lipoprotein size distribution. Under a stream of N2, 100 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether ([3H]COE) was dried onto a 4-ml glass scintillation vial. To the vial was added 4–5 mg of 1.02–1.21 g/ml lipoprotein and 50 μg of recombinant cholesteryl ester transfer protein (provided by Ron Clark, Pfizer). After bringing the final volume to 1.5 ml with PBS-E, the reaction was gently stirred at 37 °C for 3 h. The radiolabeled lipoprotein was concentrated using a Centricon 50 and separated on a Superose 6 column. The labeling of the [3H]COE HDL with [125I]dilactitol tyramine ([125I]DLT) was as described (45Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the [3H]COE-[125I]DLT HDL ranged from 4 to 20 dpm/ng protein for 3H and from 90 to 200 cpm/ng protein for 125I. apoA-I−/− HDL used for the competitive binding assay was radiolabeled with Na125I using the iodine monochloride method (46Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 125I-apoA-I−/− HDL was 500–2600 cpm/ng of protein. All cell lines were maintained in a 37 °C humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. Y1-BS1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 complete medium (12.5% heat-denatured horse serum, 2.5% heat-denatured fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 or 1.5 × 106 cells/well into 12- or 6-well plates, respectively, which had been treated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. After 48 h, medium was replaced with Ham's F-10 complete medium plus 100 nm Cortrosyn, a (1–24)-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) synthetic analogue. Experiments were conducted 24 h later. Fu5AH cells were cultured in EMEM complete medium (5% heat-denatured fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Experiments were conducted 48 h after plating. ldlA[mSR-BI] cells, which stably express murine SR-BI (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM/F-12 complete medium (5% heat-denatured fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml G418). Experiments were conducted 24 h after plating. Y1-BS1 cells were washed twice with 1 ml of serum-free Ham's F-10-HEPES medium (4 °C). HDL was added such that the final concentration was 5 μg/ml protein for125I-apoA-I−/− HDL and 5, 10, 25, or 75 μg/ml protein for unlabeled human HDL3,apoA-I+/+ HDL, andapoA-I−/− HDL. After 2 h at 4 °C, cells were washed three times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, pH 7.4 and one time with PBS, pH 7.4 (4 °C). Cells were lysed with 0.1n NaOH, and the lysate was passed three times through a 28-gauge needle. Protein was determined (43Markwell M.A. Hass S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar), and 125I was measured in a Packard Cobra-II γ counter. Y1-BS1, Fu5AH, and ldlA[mSR-BI] cells in six-well plates were washed, the medium was replaced with serum-free Ham's F-10 medium, EMEM, or DMEM/F-12, respectively, and [3H]COE-[125I]DLTapoA-I+/+ or [3H]COE-[125I]DLTapoA-I−/− HDL was added to the indicated concentration. Following a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, one time with PBS, pH 7.4, lysed with 0.1 n NaOH, and passed five times through a 28-gauge needle. The lysate was then processed to determine trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble125I radioactivity and organic solvent-extractable3H-radioactivity as described (45Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 125I radioactivity represents cell-associated HDL apolipoprotein, which is the sum of cell surface-bound apolipoprotein and endocytosed apolipoprotein that is not yet degraded. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity represents endocytosed and degraded apolipoprotein that is trapped in lysosomes because of the dilactitol tyramine label (45Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48Glass C.K. Pittman R.C. Keller G.A. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sum of the 125I-degraded and125I-cell-associated undegraded apolipoprotein expressed as CE equivalents was subtracted from the CE measured as extractable3H radioactivity to give the selective uptake of HDL CE (45Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Values for these parameters are expressed as nanograms of HDL CE/mg of cell protein. Binding and kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the data to a one-site model using GraphPad Prism 3.00 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Prior to functional analysis ofapoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/− HDL, the structural and compositional properties of the particles were defined because previous studies were unclear as to the effect of apoA-I deficiency on particle size and the content of CE and TG (9Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,11Plump A.S. Azrolan N. Odaka H., Wu, L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of lipoproteins within the density range of 1.02–1.21 g/ml by gel filtration chromatography showed thatapoA-I−/− HDL was larger thanapoA-I+/+ HDL (Fig.1 A) as noted previously (9Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Similar results were seen by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A, inset) and by dynamic laser light scattering (Fig. 1 B). apoA-I+/+ HDL was mainly composed of particles approximately 11 nm in diameter. In contrast, apoA-I−/− HDL had a mean size of 13.1 nm with a broader distribution of particles, ranging from 10 to 17 nm in diameter, and with no evident lipoprotein subclasses. Consistent with these properties, density gradient ultracentrifugation showedapoA-I−/− HDL to have a broader distribution with a peak density of 1.075 g/ml compared with 1.10 g/ml forapoA-I+/+ HDL (data not shown). Compositional analysis of the FVB/N HDL showed thatapoA-I−/− HDL had significantly more FC and phospholipid (PL) compared with apoA-I+/+ HDL but very similar percent compositions of the core lipids, primarily CE. Because a previous analysis with C57BL/6 mice indicated thatapoA-I−/− HDL had a lipid core of mainly TG (11Plump A.S. Azrolan N. Odaka H., Wu, L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HDL from mice with a C57BL/6 genetic background was also examined (Table I). Like FVB/NapoA-I−/− HDL, the C57BL/6apoA-I−/− HDL was enriched in FC and PL compared with apoA-I+/+ HDL with a core that was primarily CE and not TG. The reason for the discrepancy in CE and TG content with the previous report is unclear (11Plump A.S. Azrolan N. Odaka H., Wu, L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J.

The targeted cells did not contain any inducible SSAT activity, and the SSAT protein was not present. The SSAT-deficient cells proliferated normally and appeared to maintain otherwise similar polyamine pools as did the wild-type cells, with the possible exception of constantly elevated (about 30%) cellular spermidine. As expected, the mutated cells were significantly more resistant toward the growth-inhibitory action of polyamine analogues, such asN 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine. However, this resistance was not directly attributable to cellular depletion of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, as the analogue depleted the polyamine pools almost equally effectively in both wild-type and SSAT-deficient cells. Tracer experiments with [C14]-labeled spermidine revealed that SSAT activity is essential for the back-conversion of spermidine to putrescine as radioactive N 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine were readily detectable inN 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine-exposed wild-type cells but not in SSAT-deficient cells. Similar experiments with [C14]spermine indicated that the latter polyamine was converted to spermidine in both cell lines and, unexpectedly, more effectively in the targeted cells than in the parental cells. This back-conversion was only partly inhibited by MDL72527, an inhibitor of polyamine oxidase. These results indicated that SSAT does not play a major role in the maintenance of polyamine homeostasis, and the toxicity exerted by polyamine analogues is largely not based on SSAT-induced depletion of the natural polyamines. Moreover, embryonic stem cells appear to operate an SSAT-independent system for the back-conversion of spermine to spermidine.

Cytosolic SSAT N 1 acetylates both spermidine and spermine whereafter they serve as substrates for peroxisomal PAO (1Hölttä E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As PAO strongly prefers acetylated polyamines to the unmodified polyamines as its substrates, SSAT is generally considered as the rate-controlling enzyme in the back-conversion of spermidine and spermine (2Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The final product of the catabolism of spermidine is putrescine whereas the oxidation of spermine orN 1-acetylspermine yields spermidine. In addition to the polyamines, PAO action also generates acetamido propanal and hydrogen peroxide. During recent years considerable attention has been paid to SSAT as a target for cancer chemotherapy. A number of compounds, among them natural polyamines and their alkylated derivatives, strikingly induce SSAT and subsequently deplete cellular polyamine pools resulting in overt cytotoxicity (2Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A large number of studies suggest that depletion of polyamines and growth inhibition by polyamine analogues are closely related to the extent of SSAT induction (3Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 4Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2003-2008PubMed Google Scholar). These relationships, however, are complicated by the comparison of paired cell lines with different genetic backgrounds. To make more direct comparisons in this sense, we recently isolated fetal fibroblasts from transgenic mice overexpressing SSAT (8Pietilä M. Alhonen L. Halmekytö M. Kanter P. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and their syngenic littermates. We thus established paired cell lines with identical genetic background except for SSAT gene copy number (9Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V.-P. Halmekytö M. Kramer D.L. Hines R. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An exposure of these cell lines to a polyamine analogue revealed that the transgenic fibroblasts were much more sensitive to the growth inhibition exerted by the drug than their non-transgenic counterparts (9Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V.-P. Halmekytö M. Kramer D.L. Hines R. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The more intense growth inhibition of the transgenic fibroblasts was associated with a distinctly faster depletion of cellular spermidine and spermine pools (9Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V.-P. Halmekytö M. Kramer D.L. Hines R. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). McCloskey and Pegg (10McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28708-28714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed recently that altered SSAT activity and/or regulation because of point mutation rendered a Chinese hamster ovary cell line remarkably resistant to a polyamine analogue. The sensitivity to the drug was again restored through an expression of wild-type SSAT in the resistant cells (10McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28708-28714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have now generated a mouse embryonic stem cell line with targeted disruption of SSAT gene. As SSAT gene is located at the X chromosome, and the embryonic stem cells used were of the XY karyotype, a single homologous recombination event resulted in a null phenotype. The targeted cells did not contain any SSAT activity or enzyme protein even when exposed toN 1,N 11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM), one of the most powerful inducers of SSAT. The SSAT-deficient cells were much more resistant to the growth inhibition by the latter drug than the wild-type cells. However, the analogue-induced depletion of cellular spermidine and spermine pools occurred at a very much similar rate in both parental and targeted cell lines. Unlike the parental cells, the SSAT-deficient cells were unable to convert spermidine to putrescine but converted spermine to spermidine even at an enhanced rate in comparison with the wild-type cells. An 18-kb fragment of mouse SSAT gene was isolated from a mouse strain 129/SvJ genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The library was screened by a probe amplified from reverse-transcribed mouse brain RNA. The probe covered nucleotides 137–744 of mouse (Mus domesticus) SSAT cDNA. For the construction of the targeting vector, anEcoRI and BamHI fragment containing all six exons of SSAT gene was inserted into pTV-O vector. A SmaI fragment containing part of exon 1 was deleted and replaced by neomycin phosphotransferase from pMC1Neo (Stratagene). The structure of the targeting vector is depicted in Fig. 1 A. Mouse embryonic stem cell line RW-4 (Genome Systems Inc., St Louis, MO) was grown at the undifferentiated state on mitomycin-inactivated mouse fetal fibroblasts (feeder fibroblasts) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, murine leukemia inhibitory factor (1000 units/ml) (ESGRO; Invitrogen), and 15% fetal bovine serum. Targeting vector was linearized with EcoRI and purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Thirty μg of linearized DNA was introduced into RW-4 embryonic stem cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad). Clones that survived from G-418 and ganciclovir (Syntex AG Research) selection were analyzed by PCR using primers 5′-ATACAAGAATAGCAGGCTGTGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCCAATGACAAGACG-3′. The correct targeting of PCR-positive clones was confirmed by Southern blot analyses. For Southern blot analysis, 10 μg of DraI-digested DNA was subjected to electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membranes. Blots were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probe external to the targeting vector (see 5′ probe in Fig. 1), and chemiluminescence detection was carried out according to Engler-Blum et al. (11Engler-Blum G. Meier M. Frank J. Müller G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The blots were also hybridized with neomycin phosphotransferase-specific probe to verify the absence of additional random integration of the targeting vector. Parental RW-4 and SSAT-deficient embryonic stem cells were adapted to grow without feeder fibroblasts in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded 24 h prior to the treatments. The cultures were screened regularly for mycoplasma and found contamination-free using PCR with a mixture of primers annealing sequences for evolutionary conserved 16 S rRNA of nine different mycoplasma species including those most commonly found in cell cultures, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma arginini, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma fermentas, Mycoplasma orale, Mycoplasma pirum, Acholeplasma laidlawii, and Spiroplasma mirum. Western blot analysis of the SSAT protein was carried out using the C-terminal antibody to SSAT as described earlier (9Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V.-P. Halmekytö M.

Concentrations of polyamines and their acetylated derivatives were determined with the aid of high performance liquid chromatography essentially as described by Hyvönen et al. (14Hyvönen T.

The concentration of DENSPM was determined as described (15Vujcic S. Halmekytö M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Parental and SSAT-deficient cells were plated in six-well culture plates in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). The cells were let to adhere for 24 h before drug exposure. The cells were then exposed to 50 μm DENSPM for 48 h whereafter the inhibitors of amine oxidases were added for 24 h with 50 μm DENSPM. Before pulse labeling with [14C]spermidine (specific radioactivity 112 mCi/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) or with [14C]spermine (specific radioactivity 110 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) the growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, replenished with DMEM without serum, and incubated with the tracers for 3 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS, detached with trypsin, counted, and subjected to further analyses. The polyamines were determined after sulfosalicylic acid precipitation from the supernatant fractions. A sample of 20 μl of the supernatant fraction was injected into high performance liquid chromatograph, and fractions were collected and counted for radioactivity. N 1,N 11-Diethylnorspermine was synthesized as described (16Alhonen L. Parkkinen J.J. Keinänen T. Sinervirta R. Herzig K.H. Jänne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Semicarbazide and aminoguanidine were purchased from Sigma. Two-way and one-way (with Dunnett'spost hoc multiple comparison test) analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student's two-tailed t test, when appropriate, were used for statistical analyses with the aid of a software package, GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The wild-type allele of SSAT, the targeting vector, and the targeted allele are presented in Fig.1 A. Altogether 16 clones resistant both to G-418 and ganciclovir were isolated from the selection plates. From these clones, seven appeared to be correctly targeted and contained no additional integrations. Southern blot analysis of some of the clones is presented in Fig. 1 B. As indicated, clones 5, 6, and 7 were targeted correctly and showed only the mutated allele (5.4 kb). Clone 3 in Fig. 1 B in all likelihood represents a mixture of targeted and wild-type clones. Fig.2 A depicts Western blot analysis of two SSAT-deficient clones and the parental cell line. As the amount of uninduced SSAT protein is extremely low, the cells were exposed to 100 μm DENSPM prior to the analysis. As shown, there were no signs indicating the presence of SSAT protein in the targeted cells, yet the protein band was clearly seen in the parental cells. The positive control (+) was from liver of a DENSPM-treated transgenic mouse overexpressing SSAT. A further piece of evidence indicating that the targeted cells were also devoid of SSAT activity is presented in Fig. 2 B. In this experiment, both wild-type and targeted cells were exposed to DENSPM for 5 days. As seen in the figure, the parental cells responded to the drug with immense induction of SSAT activity whereas the targeted cells did not show virtually any activity during the whole period of observation. As SSAT is believed to function as an integral part of the machinery maintaining polyamine homeostasis and possibly also protect the cells from the toxicity of excess polyamines, we exposed wild-type and SSAT-deficient cells to exogenous polyamines. The cells were grown in the presence of 100 μm putrescine, spermidine, or spermine for 24 h. The exposure to the polyamines did not have any effect on the viability of any of the cell lines. TableI lists the cellular concentrations of the polyamines after the exposure. As indicated in the table, both cell lines accumulated exogenous polyamines in a very similar fashion. The basal levels of putrescine and spermidine were significantly higher and that of spermine significantly lower in the SSAT-deficient cells (TableI).Table IEffect of exogenous polyamines on polyamine pools in wild-type (Wt) and SSAT-deficient (SSAT KO) cellsTreatmentPolyamine poolsPutrescineSpermidineSpermine pmol/10 6 cellsWt25 ± 214200 ± 1003280 ± 68Wt + put102 ± 84970 ± 883120 ± 45Wt + spd0 ± 04510 ± 2302980 ± 117Wt + spm0 ± 01041 ± 335010 ± 180SSAT KO188 ± 121-ap < 0.001.5480 ± 671-ap < 0.001.2990 ± 211-bp < 0.01; comparison between wild-type and SSAT KO cells.SSAT KO + put522 ± 235970 ± 353040 ± 90SSAT KO + spd129 ± 146450 ± 253510 ± 82SSAT KO + spm30 ± 262540 ± 64980 ± 172Means ± S.D. were obtained from triplicate cultures.

An induction of SSAT by polyamine analogues and the subsequent depletion of cellular spermidine and spermine pools are supposed to be the major mediators of the cytotoxicity exerted by the latter drugs. Fig.3 depicts an experiment where wild-type cells and SSAT knock-out cells were exposed to DENSPM, one of the most potent inducers of SSAT. As indicated in the figure, SSAT-deficient cells grew at a somewhat slower rate (p < 0.001; ANOVA) than the parental cells in the absence of the drug, yet they were significantly more resistant (p < 0.001; ANOVA) to the analogue in comparison with their parental counterparts, whose proliferation practically was halted already at 24 h. The same phenomenon is likewise obvious in the dose-response curve presented in Fig. 4. In fact, IC50 of DENSPM for the SSAT-deficient cells was at least 50 times higher (p < 0.001; ANOVA) than for the wild-type cells. To exclude the possibility that the analogue was differently taken up by the two cell lines, we measured the intracellular concentrations of DENSPM over a period of 5 days. Even though the levels of the drug fluctuated, there was no significant difference between the two curves (data not shown). Fig. 5 depicts the DENSPM-induced depletion of cellular spermidine (Fig. 5 A) and spermine (Fig. 5 B) pools. As shown, the SSAT-deficient cells appeared to maintain higher (p < 0.001; ANOVA) spermidine levels (Fig. 5 A) than their parental counterparts in the absence of the drug. Exposure to DENSPM resulted in a rapid and near complete depletion of spermidine in both cell lines though in the parental cells the spermidine pool appeared to decrease faster (p < 0.01; ANOVA) than in the mutated cells. However, based on the shape of the curves and on the fact that by day 4 both cell lines were depleted equally, the contribution of SSAT to the cellular depletion of spermidine can be considered marginal. Both the maintenance of spermine pools in the absence of analogue and the depletion of spermine pool in response to DENSPM were identical in both cell lines (Fig. 5 B). It thus appears that, at least in the case of spermine, SSAT activity was not necessary for the rapid depletion of intracellular polyamines, but it rather represents a replacement of the natural polyamines from their intracellular binding sites by the analogue.Figure 4Growth inhibition by DENSPM of wild-type and SSAT-deficient ( SSAT KO) cells.

The cell were grown for 3 h in the presence of labeled polyamine in a serum-free (to avoid extracellular amine oxidases) medium whereafter the formation of radioactiveN 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine (from spermidine) and radioactive spermidine (from spermine) was measured. The back-conversion of spermidine toN 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine in the absence or presence of DENSPM, an inducer of SSAT, and MDL72527, a potent inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, is depicted in Fig.6. In the absence of the analogue, the back-conversion rate of spermidine was very low in the wild-type cells and at the background level in the SSAT-deficient cells. An exposure to DENSPM enhanced dramatically the formation ofN 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine in the parental cells whereas the products of spermidine remained at the background level in the mutated cells. An inclusion of MDL72527 prevented any putrescine formation and more than tripled the level ofN 1-acetylspermidine in the wild-type cells, which is in full agreement with a total inhibition of PAO by the latter drug. In the SSAT-deficient cells, the products remained at hardly detectable levels (Fig. 6). It thus appears that SSAT is indispensable for the back-conversion of spermidine to putrescine (via the formation of N 1-acetylspermidine) and that PAO cannot convert spermidine to putrescine without a prior acetylation. Fig. 7 depicts the results of a similar tracer study with radioactive spermine. The situation now strikingly differed from that found for spermidine. As indicated in the figure, spermine was converted readily to spermidine (but not to acetylspermine) in both cell types. In fact, the SSAT-deficient cells converted spermine to spermidine about four times (p < 0.001) more efficiently than did the parental cells. The enhanced conversion of spermine to spermidine in SSAT-deficient cells was not attributable to stimulated PAO activity, as in the wild-type cells PAO activity was 273, and in the targeted cells it was 316 pmol/106 cells per 60 min. The apparently slower conversion of spermine to spermidine in the wild-type cells was not because of a further metabolism of spermidine to acetylspermidine and putrescine, as all samples were monitored for the whole range of metabolites, and no detectable amounts of labeled acetylspermidine or putrescine were found. In striking contrast to the spermidine back-conversion, the inclusion of DENSPM did not change the rate of spermine conversion in the parental cells but significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the conversion or facilitated the efflux of spermidine in the mutated cells (Fig. 7). DENSPM has no effect, whatsoever, on PAO activity in either of the cell lines. MDL72527, which completely prevented the conversion of acetylspermidine to putrescine (Fig. 6), only partially (40 to 50%) inhibited the conversion of spermine to spermidine (Fig. 7). Inclusion of the known amine oxidase inhibitors, aminoguanidine and semicarbazide, only marginally affected the conversion of spermine to spermidine in both cell lines. We also checked whether the cells contained spermine-specific acetylase activity by measuring SSAT activity using spermine as the substrate. Only DENSPM-exposed wild-type cells showed spermine acetylation, which was about one-fourth of spermidine acetylation. It thus appears that spermine can be converted to spermidine by an SSAT-independent system that is not inducible by polyamine analogues and is not particularly sensitive to the PAO inhibitor, MDL72527. The acetylation of spermidine and spermine by SSAT is considered to play a central role in the maintenance of polyamine homeostasis in mammalian cells. The reduction of the positive charge of the polyamines through acetylation is believed to facilitate their excretion and hence prevent any toxic overaccumulation of the polyamines. The enzyme likewise facilitates the back-conversion of spermidine and spermine as acetylated polyamines are much better substrates for PAO than unmodified spermidine and spermine (2Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A large number of studies has shown convincingly that the cytotoxicity of polyamine analogues is closely correlated with their ability to induce SSAT in a given cell type (3Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 4Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2003-2008PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the studies carried out in cultured cell lines, we have shown that transgenic mice overexpressing SSAT in most of their tissues are much more sensitive to the general toxicity exerted by polyamine analogues than their syngenic littermates (17Alhonen L. Pietilä M. Halmekytö M. Kramer D.L. Jänne J. Porter C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 693-698PubMed Google Scholar). The present results with SSAT-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells raise some reservations as regards the central role of SSAT in polyamine homeostasis and their back-conversion reactions. As shown here, the SSAT-deficient cells appeared to maintain their polyamine homeostasis very much like their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, the mutated cells did not show any overt toxicity upon exposing them to extracellular polyamines, and the cellular accumulation of external polyamines occurred in a similar fashion in both parental cells and SSAT-deficient cells. However, the targeted cells were distinctly more resistant to the cytotoxic action exerted by the polyamine analogue, DENSPM, as the IC50 was increased at least by a factor of 50 (Fig. 4). The cytotoxicity of polyamine analogues is believed to be based mainly on a rapid depletion of intracellular polyamines upon SSAT induction. However, the present result indicated that the contribution of SSAT activity to the depletion of cellular polyamines by DENSPM is rather marginal, as the depletion of spermine was identical in both wild-type and mutated cells, and that of spermidine was only initially slightly slower in the SSAT-deficient cells (Fig. 5). Thus the enhanced resistance of the SSAT-deficient cells toward the polyamine analogue was not attributable to a more efficient polyamine depletion in the parental cells. An alternative possibility to explain the reduced sensitivity of the targeted cells toward the analogue is the lack of an SSAT/PAO system able to generate hydrogen peroxide and potentially cytotoxic aldehydes from acetylated polyamines. In fact, it has been reported that polyamine analogue-induced programmed cell death can be partly prevented by inhibition of PAO and hence the formation of hydrogen peroxide (18Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero R.A., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found that fetal fibroblasts derived from transgenic mice overexpressing SSAT are remarkably sensitive to DENSPM-induced cytotoxicity, which is not alleviated by PAO inhibitor (9Alhonen L. Karppinen A. Uusi-Oukari M. Vujcic S. Korhonen V.-P. Halmekytö M. Kramer D.L. Hines R. Jänne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1964-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the contribution of reactive oxygen species generated by PAO or polyamine depletion to the cytotoxicity exerted by polyamine analogues varies depending on the cell type. Mouse embryonic stem cells may belong to the first category, i.e. to cells in which the generation of reactive oxygen species, and not polyamine depletion, is largely responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. It is also possible that polyamine analogues exert direct cellular toxicity not dependent on SSAT or polyamine depletion. The contribution of SSAT to the back-conversion reactions of spermidine and spermine is an interesting issue. The present results with radiolabeled polyamines showed unambiguously that SSAT is absolutely necessary for the conversion of spermidine to putrescine (viaN 1-acetylspermidine), as SSAT-deficient cells, unlike parental cells, failed to form any detectable amounts of radioactive putrescine from labeled spermidine under any experimental conditions. On the other hand, the wild-type cells appeared to operate the classic SSAT/PAO pathway, i.e. the formation ofN 1-acetylspermidine and putrescine was strikingly induced by the polyamine analogue and an inclusion of the PAO inhibitor, MDL72527, totally abolished the formation putrescine and gave rise to marked accumulation ofN 1-acetylspermidine (Fig. 6). The conversion of spermine to spermidine, however, seemed to be carried out by an entirely different system, as SSAT-deficient cells converted spermine to spermidine even at an enhanced rate in comparison with the parental cells (Fig. 7). Instead of an induction, DENSPM appeared to inhibit the conversion of spermine to spermidine in the targeted cells. Moreover, unlike in spermidine back-conversion, equimolar concentrations of the PAO inhibitor only partially blocked the formation of spermidine from spermine in both parental and SSAT-deficient cells (Fig. 7). It is possible that the conversion of spermine to spermidine was catalyzed by PAO, which can use unmodified spermine as a substrate (19Libby P.R. Porter C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, this view is not supported by our findings indicating that PAO activity was not enhanced in the SSAT-deficient cells, yet the latter cells converted spermine to spermidine four times faster than the parental cells. Wang et al. (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero R.A., Jr. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar) reported recently the cloning and partial characterization of a putative human PAO. They confirmed that recombinantly generated human PAO uses unmodified spermine as the substrate with a reasonably low K m of 18 μm (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero R.A., Jr. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). However, cloned human PAO shows features that are not in line with our present results. The transcription and the activity of the human PAO were induced by polyamine analogue 5- and 3-fold, respectively (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero R.A., Jr. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Wang et al. (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero R.A., Jr. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar) reported virtually a complete inhibition of PAO activity by the polyamine oxidase inhibitor, MDL72527. Unfortunately, the concentration of the inhibitor was not stated nor was the substrate specificity mentioned (20Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero R.A., Jr. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). According to our results, the conversion of spermine to spermidine occurred at an enhanced rate in the SSAT-deficient cells but was not induced by the polyamine analogue in either cell types. The enzyme or system apparently did not use spermidine as a substrate, and the polyamine oxidase inhibitor, MDL72527, at concentrations fully preventing putrescine formation from spermidine, only partially (by 40 to 50%) blocked the conversion of spermine to spermidine in wild-type and SSAT-deficient cells. It thus appears that at least embryonic stem cells operate a back-conversion system for spermine that is independent of SSAT and may even represent a new enzyme system. The significantly higher spermidine concentration in SSAT-deficient cells (see Table Iand Fig. 3) may, in fact, reflect both a blockage of spermidine catabolism (Fig. 6) and enhanced conversion of spermine to spermidine (Fig. 7). Our present results appear to indicate that (i) SSAT may not play that central role in the maintenance of polyamine homeostasis; (ii) cytotoxicity of polyamine analogues may, in certain circumstances, be based on mechanisms other than the depletion of cellular polyamines; and (iii) spermidine and spermine appear to have different pathways for their degradation of which only spermidine catabolism is SSAT-dependent.

Both pectin lyase (EC 4.2.2.10) and pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2) are able to depolymerize the smooth region of pectin by β-elimination resulting in the formation of a Δ4,5 unsaturated bond at the newly formed non-reducing end. Although pectate lyase cleaves between two α-1,4-d-GalpA residues and pectin lyase cleaves between two methyl-esterified α-1,4-d-GalpA residues, this distinction on substrate specificity is not strict. Pectate lyase is generally active on pectin with a moderate degree of methyl esterification (DM) (0–50%), whereas pectin lyase activity often increases with increasing DM. The only discriminating property is that pectate lyases characterized to date need Ca2+ ions for their activity (5Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Parenicova L. Visser J.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), all from Aspergillus niger. They all have the same topology: the enzymes consist of a right-handed parallel β-helix (7Mayans O. Scott M. Connerton I. Gravesen T. Benen J. Visser J. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J.

Only for pectate lyase has a three-dimensional structure in complex with a (GalpA)5 been solved (9Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.M.C. Visser J.

Scavetta R.D. Visser J. Jurnak F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8762-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As mentioned above the activity of PLA depends on the DM of the substrate. However, a polymeric substrate with an average DM is a very heterogeneous substrate in which the distribution of the methyl-esters determines the activity of pectin lyases (11Voragen A.G.J. Characterization of Pectin Lyases on Pectins and Methyl Oligogalacturonates.Ph.D thesis. Wageningen, The Netherlands1972Google Scholar). The absence or presence of methyl esterification plays a crucial role in substrate recognition by PLA. We have therefore embarked on a detailed investigation into the structural requirements/chemical nature of substituents at the carboxylic function for substrate recognition. For this purpose oligogalacturonides (oligoGalpA) with defined degree of polymerization (DP) were purified and derivatized at the C6positions (Fig. 1). Thus, oligoGalpA (Fig. 1 A) were fully methyl-esterified (Fig. 1 B) or ethyl-esterified (Fig. 1 C) (12Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2000; 43: 39-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subsequently, partially methyl-esterified oligoGalpA were prepared using limited alkaline de-esterification. In addition, amidated oligoGalpA using either ammonia (Fig. 1 D) or methylamine (Fig. 1 E) were made (13Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 46: 311-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we report the activity of PLA on the various substrates and the mode of action on those substrates where significant activity was observed carried out by newly developed techniques like high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and mass spectrometry (14Körner R.

Polygalacturonic acid was purchased from ICN. 70% DM apple pectin was a kind gift of Obipectin (Bischofszell, Switzerland). 93% DM apple pectin was prepared by acidic methanol incubation as described before (16Heri W. Neukom H. Deuel H. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1961; 44: 1945-1949Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mono- and digalacturonic acid were from Sigma. Pectin lyase and polygalacturonase 1 for oligoGalpA production were a gift (NOVO Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Pectin lyase A (Aspergillus niger strain 4 M-147) was purified as described by Limberget al. (17Limberg G. Körner R. Buchholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E. Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). H+-Dowex 50W X8 50–100 mesh was acquired from Fluka. H+-Dowex AG 50W X8 100–200 mesh (biotechnological grade) was from Bio-Rad and used for the preparation of ammonium-loaded Dowex (18Körner R. Limberg G. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 33: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2,4,6-Trihydroxy acetophenone was bought from Acros chimica. Pure nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Bio-Rad. Saturated oligoGalpA (DP 3–10) were purified from a polygalacturonase 1 digest of polygalacturonic acid. Δ4,5 Unsaturated oligoGalpA were purified from a saponified pectin lyase digest of a 1% (w/v) 70% DM pectin solution. The oligoGalpA were separated on a source Q column and isolated as described before (12Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2000; 43: 39-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 35: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purity of the oligoGalpA (DP2-10) was determined using HPAEC, pH 12, equipped with PAD detection (12Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2000; 43: 39-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and found to be in the range of 90–99% based on area percentages. Esterification of the (un)saturated oligoGalpA (DP3–10) was performed with acidic methanol (12Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2000; 43: 39-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Partially methyl-esterified oligoGalpA were prepared by carefully controlled de-esterification through stepwise addition of 0.1 n sodium hydroxide at 4 °C. Amidated saturated oligoGalpA were prepared from methyl-esterified oligoGalpA using either ammonia or methylamine as described before (13Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 46: 311-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A degree of methyl amidation of 95 was reached using methylamine, whereas saturated oligoGalpA could be amidated up to a degree of 60 using ammonia. Pectin lyase A activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 235 nm using 93% DM pectin (ε235 nm = 5500 m−1 cm−1) (19Edstrom R.D. Phaff H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2403-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in McIlvaine buffer (0.1 m citrate, 0.2m phosphate buffer, pH 6) or 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6. All (derivatized) oligoGalpA were tested at 1 mm final concentration in McIlvaine buffer, pH 6. After preincubation at 30 °C the reactions were started with an appropriate amount of enzyme. Alternatively, PLA incubations were performed in acetate buffer because McIlvaine buffer interferes in the HPAEC analysis of the reaction products. A typical reaction mixture (250 μl) contained 2 mm (derivatized) oligoGalpA in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 6, buffer. After pre-incubation at 30 °C the reaction was started through the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme. Samples (40 or 50 μl) were taken at different time intervals (0–8 h maximum). To stop the reaction 8 μl (or 10 μl) of 1m acetic acid or H+- Dowex were added to lower the pH value. Samples were frozen until analyzed by HPAEC (acetate stopped reactions) and occasionally by MALDI-TOF MS (H+-Dowex stopped reactions). Prolonged PLA incubations with partially methyl-esterified oligoGalpA were stopped by separation of the enzyme from the substrate and products by vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience; polyethersulfone membrane, 5 kDa cuttof). HPAEC at pH 12 was performed as described before (20Daas P.J.H. Arisz P.W. Schols H.A., De Ruiter G.A. Voragen A.G.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on a CarboPac PA-1 column preceded by a CarboPac PA-1 guard-column. A 40-min linear gradient of 0.2–0.7 m sodium acetate in 0.1 nsodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used, followed by a 5-min gradient to 1 m sodium acetate. After 5 min of washing with 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 n sodium hydroxide the column was equilibrated in 15 min with 0.3 msodium acetate in 0.1 n NaOH. Due to the high pH (12.7) all methyl-esters were removed and a separation of individual (Δ4,5 unsaturated) oligoGalpA was achieved. Δ4,5 Unsaturated oligoGalpA were selectively detected with UV detection at 235 nm (UV1000, Thermo Separation Products), whereas both saturated and Δ4,5 unsaturated oligoGalpA were detected using a pulsed amperometric detector (Electrochemical Detector ED40, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Pure saturated oligoGalpA (DP1–7) and Δ4,5 unsaturated oligoGalpA (DP2–7) were used as standards for external calibration of the system. In general one desalting step of the sample using H+-Dowex AG 50W X8 was sufficient for good MS analysis. Whenever the salt concentration appeared too high an additional treatment with NH4+-loaded Dowex AG 50W X8 prepared as described was carried out (18Körner R. Limberg G. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 33: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the samples were freeze-dried and dissolved in water. For determination of the distribution/location of methyl-esters, freeze-dried samples were labeled at the reducing end by dissolving in 18O-water containing 0,5% formic acid. After 48–72 h of incubation at room temperature the acid-catalyzed exchange was more than 90% complete and samples were ready for analysis (14Körner R. Limberg G. Christensen T.M.I.E. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF MS was performed as described before (13Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 46: 311-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2,4,6,-Trihydroxy acetophenone/nitrocellulose was used as a matrix (18Körner R. Limberg G. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 33: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As soon as the matrix was applied (0.2 μl) to the sample plate it formed a thin layer. On top of this layer a 0.2-μl sample was applied (containing 2–8 μmol of oligogalacturonides). After application the sample plate was dried under a stream of air. Whenever appropriate, an extra 0.2 μl of 10 mm NaCl was added to the sample to improve ionization in the positive mode. The samples were analyzed with the Voyager DETM-RP MALDI-TOF MS (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) as described before (13Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 46: 311-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS was performed on18O-labeled samples to determine the position of the methyl-esters. Dynamic nanospray was performed on a LC-Q Ion-trap (Finnigan MAT 95, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nano-source. Sample ran through a transferring capillary (100-μm internal diameter) and a spraying capillary (20-μm internal diameter) at a flow rate of 0.1 μl/min. MS analysis was carried out in the positive mode using a spray voltage of 3 kV and a capillary temperature of 190 °C. The capillary voltage was set at 85 V, and the tube lens voltage at 40 V. MS2 and higher were performed on18O-labeled compounds or 18O-labeled fragments thereof using a window of 1.5–2 m/z and a 40–45% relative collision energy. The apparatus and the data were controlled by Xcalibur software. The accuracy of the mass determinations is ± 0.3 Da. Prior to analysis on the LCQ Ion-trap18O-labeled samples were diluted with water to a concentration of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml, and an appropriate amount of sodium acetate, pH 6, was added to improve ionization in the positive mode. The mode of action of pectin lyase is influenced by the identity of the carboxyl function of the galacturonic acid residues present in the homogalacturonan backbone. In nature, this carboxyl group can either be free or methyl-esterified (Fig.1, A and B, respectively). To determine the specificity of pectin lyase in more detail oligoGalpA were purified and derivatized as described before (11Voragen A.G.J. Characterization of Pectin Lyases on Pectins and Methyl Oligogalacturonates.Ph.D thesis. Wageningen, The Netherlands1972Google Scholar, 12Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Zabotina O. Beldman G. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2000; 43: 39-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Pectin lyase A (strain 4 M-147) was purified to homogeneity as described before (17Limberg G. Körner R. Buchholt H.C. Christensen T.M.I.E. Roepstorff P. Mikkelsen J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric analysis demonstrated that PLA activity in McIlvaine buffer, pH 6, appeared to be 32 units/mg using highly esterified pectin (0.1% (w/v); DM 93) as a substrate, whereas the activity was only 8.9 units/mg in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 6. This difference in activity can be attributed to a difference in ionic strength as has been demonstrated before for PLB (21Kester H.C.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 120: 63-68Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and will be corroborated hereafter. PLA degradation of fully methyl-esterified saturated oligoGalpA (DP 3–10) was monitored on HPAEC using pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) and UV detection. A typical set of time-dependent elution patterns of fully esterified pentamer digested by PLA is presented in Fig. 2. The PAD elution profiles (A) clearly demonstrate a gradual decrease of the pentamer in time, with a simultaneous increase of saturated monomer and dimer and Δ4,5 unsaturated trimer and tetramer. The elution profiles of the Δ4,5 unsaturated oligogalacturonides are specifically detected by UV (B) and show an increase in predominantly the Δ4,5 unsaturated trimer and minor amounts of the Δ4,5 unsaturated tetramer and dimer. Using these profiles the amounts of saturated oligoGalpA (PAD) and Δ4,5 unsaturated oligoGalpA (UV detection) produced, were calculated resulting in progression profiles as shown in Fig. 2 C for (6-O-CH3-GalpA)5 degradation. (6-O-CH3-GalpA)3 appeared to be resistant for PLA digestion under the conditions used. For none of the methyl-esterified oligoGalpA used complete degradation was observed. Up to 25% conversion, linear kinetics were observed, which were used to calculate the reaction rate and the bond cleavage frequency (BCF). For (6-O-CH3-GalpA)9 and (6-O-CH3-GalpA)10 secondary attack was significant. The BCFs and reaction rates are listed in TableI. The specific activities as calculated from PAD or UV agree very well and increased with increasing DP up to a DP of 10. Generally the activity will increase with increasing substrate length for each additional subsite filled until all subsites are occupied. This suggests that PLA contains at least eight subsites. The BCFs clearly indicate a preference for the production of Δ4,5 unsaturated trimer. In general the preference for this bond decreases with increasing DP and for DP 9 and 10 shifts toward formation of Δ4,5 unsaturated tetramer. Δ4,5 Unsaturated monomer is never produced, whereas Δ4,5 unsaturated dimer is produced from the tetramer but decreases with increasing DP.Table IBond cleavage frequencies and rate of β-elimination on fully methyl-esterified saturated oligogalacturonidesBond cleavage frequencies are calculated from the Δ4,5 unsaturated products detected by UV, whereas reaction rates were determined using the Δ4,5 unsaturated products detected by UV or the corresponding saturated oligogalacturonides detected by PAD.

The reducing end is indicated with boldface typescript (G). Fully methyl-esterified Δ4,5 unsaturated oligoGalpA (DP 3–7) were also used as a substrate for PLA. Progression profiles were made (not shown), and initial activities were determined (Table II). Bond cleavage frequencies could not be determined because no difference could be made between the old and newly formed non-reducing end. Specific activities on methyl-esterified Δ4,5 unsaturated oligoGalpA were in the same order of magnitude as the methyl-esterified saturated oligoGalpA.Table IIEffect of the carboxyl substituent on the pectin lyase A activitySubstrateEnzyme activity (milliunits/mg)UV detectionPAD detectionUV assay(GalpA)4000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)44.53.714(6-O-C2H5-GalpA)400—(6-NH2-GalpA)4000(6-N-CH3-GalpA)4000Δ4,5-(6-O-CH3-GalpA)43.6——(GalpA)5000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)57160129(6-O-C2H5-GalpA)500—(6-NH2-GalpA)5000(6-N-CH3-GalpA)500—Δ4,5-(6-O-CH3-GalpA)560——(GalpA)6000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)65385431112(6-O-C2H5-GalpA)63——(6-NH2-GalpA)6000(6-N-CH3-GalpA)6000Δ4,5-(6-O-CH3-GalpA)6492——(GalpA)7000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)7282133439783(6-NH2-GalpA)7000(6-N-CH3-GalpA)7000(GalpA)8000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)89115890029209(6-NH2-GalpA)8000(GalpA)9000(6-O-CH3-GalpA)995461058742005Activities are determined either spectrophotometrically or by means of HPAEC (UV and PAD) as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures.” Dashes indicate activities which could not be determined.

Based upon the BCFs, a provisional subsite map was constructed for PLA according to the method outlined by Thomaet al. (22Thoma J.A. Brothers C. Spradlin J. Biochem. 1970; 9: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The difference in binding affinity, ΔΔG, for a particular pair of productive binding modes of an oligoGalpA (e.g.(GalpA)6), the pair of non-common sites can be calculated according to Equation 1,ΔGi+1−ΔGi+1−n=RTln([Pi,m]/Pi+1,m+1])Equation 1 where i and i + 1 correspond to the position occupied by the reducing end residue, m and m + 1 are products of length m and m + 1, respectively, and [P] is the amount of the product. The ΔΔG was calculated for each pair of binding modes (Table III). Subsequently, subsite +4 was used as a reference site and set at ΔG = 0, which allows the construction of a relative subsite map (Table III). The subsite affinities for subsite +3, +5, +6, and +7 are the average values of at least three pairs of binding modes. The subsite affinities of subsite +4 to +7 and −6 to −7 all have a similar low value, suggesting that these are imaginary subsites. The average of these subsite affinities (−0.02) was used to correct the ΔG values of the subsites and provide the provisionary subsite map on an absolute scale. From Table III it can be seen that PLA contains eight subsites covering subsites −5 to +3. Subsite +3 has the highest binding affinity, followed by subsites −2 and −4. Subsites −5 and −3 have the lowest affinities. No value could be calculated for subsite +2 to −1 because these subsites need to be occupied to have a productive enzyme substrate complex.Table IIIProvisional subsite affinities of PLADPΔΔGΔG relativeΔG absolutesubsitem+1mkJ/molsubsitekJ/molsubsitekJ/mol4−2, +388125.0−70.5−75−3, +38457.1−60.4−65−2, +41184−5.1−5−2.3−5−2.36−4, +36595.0−4−3.8−4−3.86−3, +42165−2.8−3−2.8−3−2.86−2, +5521−3.6−2−5.1−2−5.17−5, +37266.3−1−17−4, +41672−3.8+1+17−3, +5516−2.9+2+28−6, +36165.8+3−9.4+3−9.48−5, +42461−2.3+40.0+48−4, +5624−3.5+5−0.1+58−3, +636−1.7+6−0.4+69−7, +33627.3+7−0.5+79−6, +442360.49−5, +51542−2.69−4, +6415−3.39−3, +714−3.510−7, +433270.510−6, +52533−0.710−5, +6925−2.610−4, +749−2.010−3, +824−1.7Provisionary subsite affinities were calculated according to the method outlined by Thoma et al. (22Thoma J.A. Brothers C. Spradlin J. Biochem. 1970; 9: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Provisionary subsite affinities were calculated according to the method outlined by Thoma et al. (22Thoma J.A. Brothers C. Spradlin J. Biochem. 1970; 9: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The influence of the carboxyl substituent was investigated (Table II). Removal of the methyl-esters (Fig. 1 A) resulted in a complete loss of PLA activity. Replacement of a methyl-ester for an ethyl-ester resulted in a complete loss of activity for the tetramer and pentamer, whereas only 1% activity remained on the hexamer, indicating that the length of the ester is restricted to a methyl group (Fig. 1 C). Introduction of an amide or methyl-amide group (Fig. 1, D and E) resulted in a complete loss of PLA activity as well. All these data were confirmed by the spectrophotometric UV assay. Only the methyl-esterified oligoGalpA resulted in activities, which were higher due to the higher ionic strength of McIlvaine buffer used in the spectrophotometric assay (21Kester H.C.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 120: 63-68Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). So the enzyme has a high preference for the methyl-ester. Because pectin has a variable degree of methyl esterification and is never fully methyl-esterified, the effect of the degree of methyl esterification on PLA activity was investigated. Partly methyl-esterified (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6 were prepared by controlled alkaline de-esterification of the fully methyl-esterified equivalent. The DM was determined using MALDI-TOF MS as described before (13Van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Schols H.A. Voragen A.G.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 2001; 46: 311-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The DM was lowered to 80 and 74 for the pentamer and to 86 and 79 for the hexamer, respectively (Table IV), which corresponds to 1–1.3 free carboxyl groups per molecule on average. As a consequence the oligoGalpA with one free carboxyl group was the main component, but the fully esterified oligoGalpA as well as those with two and three free carboxyl groups were present in this mixture (Fig. 3 A). To determine the position of the free carboxyl groups both partly methyl-esterified (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6 were 18O-labeled at the reducing end and subjected to dynamic nanospray ESI-MS n . The spectra revealed that almost every isomer of (GalpA)5 (not shown) and (GalpA)6 (Fig. 3 B) with one free carboxyl group was present in the mixture. Several of the (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6with two free carboxyl groups were identified as well. For some isomers definite assignment, in addition to one or two methyl groups, could only be assigned to two or three adjacent GalpA residues. From this we conclude that de-esterification using sodium hydroxide proceeds in a random manner. Both de-esterified (GalpA)5 (DM 80) and (GalpA)6 (DM 86) were incubated with different amounts of PLA: a low amount to monitor the reaction in time and a high amount to determine the end point situation. Analysis on HPAEC was performed to determine the influence of the DM on the activity and BCF (Table IV). The presence of 1 free carboxyl group lowered the initial rates by a factor 10 for partly methyl-esterified (GalpA)6, whereas for partly methyl-esterified (GalpA)5 no activity could be determined due to a too-low rate. For fully methyl-esterified penta- and hexamer the BCFs at early stages in the reaction appeared the same as after 24 h of incubation. However for the partially de-esterified counterparts (80 and 86 DM, respectively) a strong increase in Δ4,5 unsaturated (GalpA)2 formation was recorded toward the end of incubation. Furthermore, compared with the fully esterified oligomers, at the initial stages of the reaction a preference for the formation of Δ4,5 unsaturated (GalpA)4 was observed. When the DM was further lowered (74 and 79 DM, respectively) the BCFs were different again, and it turned out that only a minor fraction of the substrates was converted.Table IVEffect of degree of esterification on bond cleavage frequencies and rate of β-elimination on saturated oligogalacturonidesBond cleavage frequencies were based on the Δ4,5 unsaturated products detected by UV, whereas reaction rates were determined using the Δ4,5 unsaturated products detected by UV or the corresponding saturated oligogalacturonides detected by PAD.

The BCF as determined from alkaline HPAEC analysis only reveals the ratio of the products formed but does not give insight into the number and position of methyl-esters present on the products. Therefore, PLA-digested (GalpA)5 (DM 74) and (GalpA)6 (DM 79) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS as well (not shown). The spectra allowed for determination of the relation of for example Δ4,5 unsaturated (GalpA)3 containing either 1, 2 or 3 methyl-esters. For the determination of the positions of the methyl-esters the above samples were 18O-labeled at the reducing end and subjected to dynamic nanospray ESI-MS n . The Δ4,5 unsaturated products could be elucidated as shown for (GalpA)6 (DM 79) and appeared to be very specific (Fig.4 A) as for each product found in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum only one isomer was found. All Δ4,5 unsaturated products contain a methyl-ester on the non-reducing end. If one free carboxyl group was present in an Δ4,5 unsaturated product it was always located on the second residue counting from the non-reducing end. The second free carboxyl group was predominantly located at the reducing end. The relative amounts of the Δ4,5 unsaturated products could be determined using the BCF and the calculated ratio based on the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. Using (GalpA)6 (DM 79) as a substrate results in the production of Δ4,5 unsaturated (GalpA)3 and (GalpA)4with one free carboxyl group as major products. PLA-digestion of (GalpA)5 (DM 74) results in the same Δ4,5 unsaturated products only in another ratio. Structural analysis of the saturated products revealed a totally different picture (Fig.4 B). Not one specific isomer could be determined. It seems that every residue in the products could either be methyl-esterified or free of methyl esterification. Also the reducing end residue, which is located at subsite −1 during catalysis shows this feature. The relative amounts of the saturated products were calculated according to the method outlined above. The fully methyl-esterified dimer and trimer were the major products, followed by the dimer and trimer containing one free carboxyl group. A thorough analysis of the mode of action of PLA from A. niger on differently C6-substituted oligogalacturonides is described. PLA appeared to be very specific for fully methyl-esterified oligogalacturonides. PLA activities determined by HPAEC as well as spectrophotometrically both indicated the presence of at least eight subsites in the substrate-binding cleft of PLA ofA. niger. Based upon the bond cleavage frequencies a provisional subsite map was calculated revealing the subsite affinities for each of the individual subsites. No affinities could be calculated for subsite −1 to +2, because all productive enzyme substrate complexes cover these subsites. The subsite affinity for subsites +3 and −2 to −5 and the imaginary character of subsites beyond −5 and +3 are in perfect agreement with the number estimated from the reaction rates. The high binding energy for subsite +3 fits nicely with the predominant product, Δ4,5 unsaturated trimer. Comparison of the subsite affinities with those calculated for other enzymes, like polygalacturonases (23Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and amylase (22Thoma J.A. Brothers C. Spradlin J. Biochem. 1970; 9: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), reveal similar values indicating that the values are in the same range. Until now these subsites have unfortunately not been corroborated by a three-dimensional structure of PLA in complex with a substrate or an inhibitor. However, a fully methyl-esterified tetramer has been modeled into the structure of PLB (10Herron S.R. Benen J.A.E. Scavetta R.D. Visser J. Jurnak F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8762-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) covering subsite −1 to +3 (Fig.5). Because PLA is highly homologous to PLB (65% AA sequence identity) (24Kusters-van-Someren M. Flipphi M. de Graaff L. Van den Broeck H. Kester H. Hinnen A. Visser J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a direct comparison to this model seems justified. According to this model subsites −1, +1, and +3 form hydrophobic pockets, which bind the methyl-esters very specifically, whereas subsite +2 does not have such a hydrophobic pocket. The catalytic residue arginine 236 is located between subsite −1 and +1 and specifically interacts with the residue located at subsite +1. Our results demonstrate that PLA shows the highest activity when all subsites are occupied with a methyl-esterified residue. As soon as another substrate is provided the enzyme shows severely reduced activity (ethyl-ester) or no activity at all ((methyl)-amide or carboxylic acid). The ethyl-ester might be too big to fit accurately in the hydrophobic pockets. Removal of the methyl-esters generates a highly negatively charged substrate. Because a negative electrostatic potential surrounds the substrate-binding cleft, such a substrate would probably be repelled (7Mayans O. Scott M. Connerton I. Gravesen T. Benen J. Visser J. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Structure. 1997; 5: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic amidated oligoGalpA would not be repelled and should be able to enter the substrate-binding cleft. However, no products were detected using these substrates. So apparently no productive enzyme-substrate complex is formed, and these compounds could well serve as an inhibitor, although this has not been demonstrated yet. Partly methyl-esterified (GalpA)5 and (GalpA)6 (DM 74–86) still could function as a substrate, even though the rate was 10 times lower for (GalpA)6 and even lower for (GalpA)5. Even after 24 h of incubation fully methyl-esterified oligoGalpA was still present. From this it can tentatively be concluded that unproductive enzyme-substrate complexes are formed, which reduce the overall activity enormously. Product analysis revealed that the structure of the partly methyl-esterified Δ4,5 unsaturated products is very specific. In all cases the Δ4,5 unsaturated residue was methyl-esterified, proving that the residue at subsite +1 has to be methyl-esterified to form a productive enzyme-substrate complex. More than 50% of the Δ4,5 unsaturated products contained a GalpA residue adjacent to the Δ4,5 unsaturated residue, which demonstrates that subsite +2 tolerates a carboxyl group readily. This tolerance is in accordance with the model (Fig. 5) because this is the only subsite lacking a hydrophobic pocket. The next subsite (+3) was always occupied with a methyl-esterified GalpA residue. According to the model, this subsite also contains a hydrophobic pocket in which the methyl-ester would fit nicely. Structural analysis of the saturated products, corresponding to the negative subsites, demonstrated the presence of almost any isomer. Each of the negative subsites showed tolerance for a carboxyl group. So even the hydrophobic pocket at subsite −1, adjacent to the scissile bond, can tolerate a carboxyl group as was indicated before by Körner et al. (14Körner R. Limberg G. Christensen T.M.I.E. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Summarizing, it is clear that the binding at the positive subsites has to be very specific to result in a productive enzyme-substrate complex, whereas this binding specificity is much less for the negative subsites. This means that partially esterified (GalpA)5 or (GalpA)6could bind easily to the negative subsites (−1 to −5) without covering the cleaving site, thus forming a non-productive enzyme-substrate complex. As a consequence the overall reaction rate diminishes. The mode of action of PLA on pectins is reflected best by its action on partly methyl-esterified oligoGalpA. Therefore, the activity on low DM pectin will be reduced strongly by the presence of unesterified GalpA residues compared with high DM pectin. However, the distribution of the methyl-esters, randomversus blockwise, is very important as well, which was already demonstrated by Voragen (11Voragen A.G.J. Characterization of Pectin Lyases on Pectins and Methyl Oligogalacturonates.Ph.D thesis. Wageningen, The Netherlands1972Google Scholar). Pectin lyase activity on blockwise de-esterified pectins and random de-esterified pectins with varying DM were compared. For all pectins the sameV max values were found, but theK m values increased with decreasing DM. This increase was much stronger for the random de-esterified pectins compared with the blockwise de-esterified pectins. Blocks of methyl-esters will still function as a good substrate for pectin lyase, but because the amount of “real” substrate is decreased activity will go down. When the methyl-esters are randomly distributed, the effect of unesterified GalpA residues is stronger as a stretch of ideal substrate is hardly available. As a consequence, activity will be reduced more than it will be using the same low DM pectin with blockwise methyl-ester distribution. We thank Jacques Benen for critical reading of the manuscript."

Multiple hormones including glucagon (via cAMP), thyroid hormone (T3), glucocorticoids, and retinoic acid increase PEPCK gene expression (2Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hormonal induction of the PEPCK gene by T3 and glucocorticoids is mediated through the binding of nuclear receptors to weak hormone response elements in the PEPCK promoter (3Park E.A. Jerden D.C.

Endocrinol. 1998; 4: 482-491Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The full induction by these hormones requires accessory factors associated with the PEPCK promoter. Our studies and those of others have shown that CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) are accessory factors required for the stimulation by cAMP, T3, and glucocorticoids (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A.

We have defined two critical sites in the PEPCK promoter that are required for stimulation by T3 (6Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A thyroid hormone response element (TRE) (−330/−320) binds the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In addition, a site called P3(I) (−250/−234) binds C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (7Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both sites are required for T3 to stimulatePEPCK gene expression. The induction of PEPCKtranscription by cAMP involves multiple sites in the promoter including a cAMP response element (CRE) (−90/−82) and the P3(I) site (2Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PEPCK CRE can bind both CREB and C/EBP proteins with similar affinity (10Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.L. Cao Z. Hakimi P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P3(I) site is involved in both the T3 and cAMP induction of the PEPCK gene. Glucocorticoids induce PEPCK gene expression through two weak glucocorticoid response elements, but multiple accessory factors are involved in the glucocorticoid induction of the PEPCKgene including C/EBPβ bound to the CRE (8Yamada K.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, C/EBP proteins are centrally involved in regulating multiple hormone responses of PEPCK gene expression. C/EBP proteins also contribute to the tissue-specific expression and developmental regulation of the PEPCK gene (12Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y. Darlington G.J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26306-26312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins consist of a family of bZIP proteins. The transactivation domain is contained in the amino terminus, while the DNA binding domain and leucine zipper are contained within the carboxyl-terminal region (13Croniger C. Leahy P. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31629-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). C/EBPα and β have been shown to have important roles in directing the expression of many genes encoding metabolic enzymes in the liver. In addition, C/EBP isoforms have prominent roles in adipocyte differentiation (14Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, these isoforms are not redundant. C/EBPα is a terminal differentiation factor that is associated with inhibition of cell division (15Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 4: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (294) Google Scholar). C/EBPα stimulates expression of the PEPCK gene at birth. Both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ knockout mice have impaired expression of the PEPCK gene (12Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y. Darlington G.J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol.

The T3 induction of gene transcription is mediated through the binding of the liganded TR to hormone response elements (17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The TR binds to TREs primarily as a heterodimer with RXR (18Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). T3 is not required for DNA binding and in the absence of ligand the TR generally acts as a repressor of gene expression. Without T3, the TR is associated with nuclear corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT (17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). When ligand is added, various coactivators may be recruited to the nuclear receptors including steroid receptor coactivator (SRC-1/NcoA-1), CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300), and thyroid receptor accessory proteins (TRAP/DRIP/PBP) (17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 19Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 96: 1959-1964Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SRC-1 can interact with many liganded nuclear receptors and with orphan receptors such as HNF-4 and COUP-TF through a conserved LXXLL peptide motif (20Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CBP is associated with SRC proteins and liganded nuclear receptors. CBP was initially described as a coactivator for CREB and enhancer of cAMP responsiveness (21Chriva J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Haglwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). CBP is able to interact with a variety of proteins and therefore offers the potential for mediating the interactions between receptors and accessory factors (22Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In these studies, we have defined specific regions within C/EBP that are involved in the T3 induction of PEPCKtranscription. In addition, we provide evidence that CBP can participate in the T3 induction of PEPCK gene transcription. The ligation of the PEPCK promoter from −490 to +73 to the CAT reporter gene (−490-PCAT) has been described (3Park E.A. Jerden D.C. Bahouth S.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The introduction of the Gal4 binding site into the P3(I) site of the PEPCK promoter to create −490-P3G4-CAT was described previously (6Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The −490 to +73 region of the PEPCK promoter was ligated in front of the luciferase reporter gene by removing the PEPCK promoter fragment from −490-PCAT by digestion with KpnI andBglII and ligating into the polylinker of pGL3 basic (Promega). The Gal4 site was introduced into the TRE region of −330-PTRE/G4-CAT by PCR amplification with the 5′-primer, ccctctagatcggaggtactgtcctccgtctgac, containing the altered nucleotides and a 3′-primer, ttagatctcagagcgtctcgcc (+73 to +52), which includes the BglII site at +73. The 5′-primer introduced anXbaI site. The amplified promoter fragment was digested with XbaI and BglII and ligated in front of the CAT reporter gene. The sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis at the St. Jude Center for Biotechnology (Memphis, TN). The Gal4-C/EBPβ vectors with alanine substitutions were constructed by two-step PCR amplification. The initial PCR reactions contained the forward primer, which contained an EcoRI site, and the first 18 nucleotides of the rat C/EBPβ cDNA (tccgaattcatgcaccgcctgctggcctgggac) and a reverse primer with the alanine switches M27,28 (ggcagtcggggctcgtaggcggcgttggccacttccatg), M57,58,59 (gaagtcgatggcgcgcgcggccgcgccaatggccggctc), or M61,62 (ccaggtaggggctgaaggcggcggcgcgcgtgtgctcg). Additional PCR reactions contained forward primers with the alanine substitutions M27,28 (catggaagtggccaacgcccgcctacgagcccgactgcc), M57,58,59 (gagccggccgattggcgcggccgcgcgcgccatcgacttc), or M61,62 (cgagcacgagcgcgccgccgccttcagcccctacctgg) and reverse primers containingPstI sites and the nucleotides representing amino acids 108–102 (gagctgcaggtaaccgtagtcggccggcttc). The PCR reactions were conducted using the PCR kit from CLONTECH and consisted of 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. All PCR reactions contained 10% GC melt buffer (CLONTECH) as this region of mouse C/EBPβ is extremely GC rich. The mouse C/EBPβ cDNA was the template (23Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified from agarose gels. The PCR products encompassing approximately amino acids 1–70 and 60–108 were mixed along with the outside primers, and the PCR reactions were repeated. The appropriate 330-base pair DNA fragment was isolated from an agarose gel and subcloned into TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) as outlined by the manufacturer. The C/EBPβ fragment was removed from TOPO-TA by digestion with EcoRI and PstI. This DNA fragment was ligated into the mammalian Gal4 DNA expression vector called pM (CLONTECH). To create the Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–100) and the Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–100)-M86,87 vectors, PCR reactions were conducted with the forward primer encompassing nucleotides 1–18 and a reverse primer encoding either the wild-type sequence (cggctgcaggctcggcttggcgccgtagtcg) or containing mutations in the amino acids 86 and 87 (cggctgcaggctcggcttggcgccgtcgtcgtcggcgaagaggtcggagccgccgtcgtggtgcg). PCR conditions and subcloning into TOPO-TA were conducted as described above. Construction of the Gal4-C/EBPα vectors was described elsewhere (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol.

To construct the C/EBPα prey vectors for the mammalian two-hybrid assays, the C/EBPα fragment was isolated from the Gal4-C/EBPα vector by digestion with EcoRI andPstI. These C/EBPα fragments were ligated into the VP16 vector (CLONTECH). HepG2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (6Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CAT assays were conducted with [3H]chloramphenicol and n-butyryl coenzyme A using the xylene phase extraction method (6Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated 3–6 times. Luciferase assays were conducted with the luciferin reagent as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega). We used a modification of the technique described by Shang et al. (25Shang Y., Hu, X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). A 1% solution of formaldehyde prepared in buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) was added to hepatocytes for 5 min at 4 °C to cross-link DNA and its associated proteins. Hepatocytes were prepared as we have described previously (26Deng X. Cagen L.M. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A. Raghow R. Elam M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine. Cross-linked cells were then recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were resuspended with 1 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) plus protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated at 4 °C for 10 s at maximum setting. The sonication was repeated five times after 30 s intervals at 4 °C. The sonicated cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and each supernatant was diluted up to a final volume of 1.5 ml with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors. Each supernatant was precleared by adding 50 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-Sepharose (for rabbit antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose (for mouse antibodies). These mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking, and precleared supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and finally transferred to prechilled microcentrifuge tubes. Immunoprecipitation was performed with specific antisera raised against C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, TRβ1, and CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a control, monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.) was used. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by isolation of antibody-protein-DNA complexes with 50 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, and the resins were washed sequentially three times for 3 min with wash buffer 1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100); wash buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100); and wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25m LiCl, 1% Igepal, 1% deoxycholate). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and extracted two times by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 250 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and 30 μl of 5 mNaCl were added and heated at 65 °C for 3 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. Proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the heating continued at 65 °C for 3 h. DNA fragments were purified with pellet paint kit (Novagen). Precipitated DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried for 10 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of sterile water. Bound DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR using AmpliTaq Gold Kit (Applied Biosystems Group), 2 μmof each primer, and 5 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA per reaction. Cycling parameters were: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 9 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The primers used for amplification of promoter rat PEPCK were: forward TRE (−479/−459), 5′-cacgtctcagagctgaattcccttc-3′ and reverse TRE (−290/−314), 5′-actataggctcttgccttaattgtc-3′. Amplified PCR products were electrophoresed through a 3% Nusieve/agarose gel in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In previous studies, we found that mutation of the C/EBP binding site called P3(I) in the PEPCK promoter eliminated the T3 induction of the PEPCK gene (6Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A model of some of the key regulatory elements in the PEPCK promoter is shown in Fig. 1 A. Our first experiments were designed to demonstrate that the P3(I) site could function as an enhancer of T3 responsiveness out of the context of the PEPCK gene. One copy of an idealized thyroid hormone response element (DR4) was ligated in front of a minimalPEPCK promoter from −68 to +73 that contains only a TATA box but no hormone response elements in order to create DR4X1 −68PLuc. A schematic of the luciferase vectors used in these studies is shown in Fig. 1 B. Addition of three copies of the P3(I) element (DR4X1 P3WTX3 −68PLuc) greatly enhanced the T3 induction from 0.3- to 2.4-fold (Table I). We added three copies of the P3(I) site because there are three C/EBP binding sites in this region of the PEPCK gene including P3(I), P4(I), and P4(II) (2Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A Gal4 site was ligated in front of the enhancerless SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene to generate Gal4X1 SV40-Luc. Cotransfection of this vector with Gal4-TRβ allowed a strong 8.1-fold induction by T3. Addition of three P3(I) sites in the Gal4X1 P3WTX3 SV40-Luc increased this stimulation to 61-fold. This induction could be reduced either by cotransfection with a dominant negative C/EBP vector (A-C/EBP) or the introduction of mutations into the P3(I) site (P3Mut243 or P3Mut247) that eliminated the ability of C/EBP to bind the P3(I) site (27Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardener K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (TableI). The A-C/EBP vector will inhibit the binding of all C/EBP isoforms (27Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardener K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These results indicate that C/EBP can enhance the T3induction through a TRE and that this enhancement does not require it in the context of the PEPCK promoter.Table IThe C/EBP binding site in the PEPCK promoter enhances the induction of transcription by thyroid hormoneReporter genesCotransfected vectorsFold induction by T3DR4X1–68 PLucRSV-TRβ0.35 ± 0.02Gal4X1–68 PLucRSV-TRβ0.31 ± 0.04DR4X1 P3WTX3–68 PLucRSV-TRβ2.4 ± 0.3Gal4X1 P3WTX3–68 PLucRSV-TRβ0.3 ± 0.03Gal4X1 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ8.1 ± 0.9Gal4X1 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ+A-C/EBP7.6 ± 1.06Gal4X1 P3WT X3 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ61.2 ± 10.5Gal4X1 P3WT X3 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ+A-C/EBP12.1 ± 1.5Gal4X1 P3Mut 243 X3 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ5.1 ± 0.5Gal4X1 P3Mut 237 X3 SV40-LucGal4-TRβ5.3 ± 0.5HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter genes. Each transfection contained 3 μg of luciferase gene, 1 μg of RSV-TRβ or Gal4-TRβ, 0.5 μg of the dominant negative C/EBP vector (A-C/EBP) and 0.5 μg of TK-Renilla. Transfected cells were exposed to 100 nm T3 for 16 h. The data are expressed as luciferase activity corrected for protein content and transfection efficiency. Open table in a new tab HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter genes. Each transfection contained 3 μg of luciferase gene, 1 μg of RSV-TRβ or Gal4-TRβ, 0.5 μg of the dominant negative C/EBP vector (A-C/EBP) and 0.5 μg of TK-Renilla. Transfected cells were exposed to 100 nm T3 for 16 h. The data are expressed as luciferase activity corrected for protein content and transfection efficiency. The next experiments were designed to identify domains within C/EBPα or C/EBPβ that were involved in the enhancement of T3responsiveness. To test the ability of the TR and C/EBP to synergize, one copy of an idealized TRE and one copy of a Gal4 site were ligated in front of the −68PEPCK-Luc reporter gene. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors for RSV-TRβ and Gal4-C/EBPα as well as the DR4X1 Gal4X1 −68PLuc reporter gene. In the absence of C/EBP, a single TRE was unable to confer T3responsiveness to the minimal PEPCK promoter (Fig.2). The Gal4-C/EBPα-(6–217) vector that contains the transactivation domain allowed a 4.1 ± 0.2-fold induction by T3. Deletion of amino acids 175–217 diminished the T3 induction. Likewise deletion of the first 50 amino acids in the Gal4-C/EBPα-(50–217) reduced the T3 response. Three amino acids, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and leucine, at positions 67, 77, and 78 in C/EBPα had been found to be critical for the induction of basal expression (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 2, mutation of these amino acids in the vector called Gal4-C/EBPα-TM reduced but did not eliminate the induction by T3. We had reported previously that these amino acids were not required for the cAMP induction of PEPCK gene expression (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our next studies examined the possibility that TRβ and C/EBPα could physically interact. To conduct these studies, we utilized several approaches including GST pull-downs and mammalian two-hybrid assays. We tested whether bacterially expressed GST-C/EBPα could pull-down35S-labeled TRβ in GST pull-down assays. In these experiments, we found that GST-C/EBPα interacted with [35S]TRβ although only a small percentage of the input [35S]TRβ was retained by the GST-C/EBPα (data not shown). Addition of T3 or His-tagged RXRα did not strengthen the interaction. For the mammalian two-hybrid experiments, the Gal4X4 −68PLuc reporter gene was used. The Gal4-TRβ was the bait and C/EBPα-VP16 was the prey. In the absence of T3, coexpression of the C/EBPα-VP16 did not increase luciferase expression (data not shown). Addition of T3 caused a 26.5 ± 5.8-fold increase in luciferase activity, while cotransfection of C/EBPα-VP16 increased the T3 induction to 37.5 ± 12.0 (data not shown). Overall, our results suggested that while C/EBPα could interact with TRβ, these interactions were quite weak and most likely did not form the basis for the C/EBP enhancement of T3 action. Because both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are present in rat liver nuclei and can bind to the P3(I) element in the PEPCK promoter, we tested whether Gal4-C/EBPβ could enhance the T3 induction of the DR4X1 Gal4X1 −68PLuc (Fig. 2). Cotransfection with Gal4-C/EBPβ-(3–181) or Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–100) increased the T3 induction by 2-fold. However, cotransfection with a Gal4-CREB vector did not enhance the T3 induction, indicating that this effect was mediated by C/EBP proteins (Fig. 2). These data indicate that regions within the first 100 amino acids of C/EBPβ could increase the T3 response. We examined the first 100 amino acids of the transactivation domains of the rat C/EBPα and mouse C/EBPβ and found that several amino acid regions are conserved as is shown in Fig. 3. In particular, the phenylalanine and leucine amino acids are highly conserved. We introduced a mutation in the Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–100) expression vector in which the FL amino acids 86 and 87 were switched to alanine. Interestingly, mutation of amino acids 86 and 87 (C/EBPβ M86,87), which are conserved between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ did not decrease the induction by T3 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that there is an additional domain within the first 100 amino acids of C/EBPβ that participates in the T3 induction ofPEPCK transcription. We tested whether the FL to alanine switch would affect the ability of C/EBPβ to stimulate basal expression. The Gal4-C/EBPβ vectors were cotransfected with either Gal4X3 −68PLuc (Fig.4 A) or −490-P3G4-PLuc (Fig.4 B). Mutation of amino acids 86/87 decreased the stimulation of basal expression by C/EBPβ from 15.2 ± 3.7 to 2.4 ± 0.3, indicating that these amino acids are critical in both the C/EBPα and C/EBPβ isoforms in the stimulation of basal expression (Fig. 4 A). We altered several additional amino acids in the transactivation domain of C/EBPβ. The amino acids 54–70 of the mouse C/EBPβ are partially conserved in the rat C/EBPα in amino acids 55–71 as well as a region of homology in the amino-terminal regions of these proteins (Fig. 3). Mutation of amino acids 56, 57, and 58 or 61 and 62 reduced the ability of Gal4-C/EBPβ to stimulate basal transcription of a Gal4X3 −68PLuc reporter gene, but the expression of the −490-P3G4-PLuc was not reduced as compared with the Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–108) (Fig. 4). The difference in the response to these Gal4-C/EBPβ vectors indicates that promoter context as well as transactivation domains contribute to the ability of C/EBPβ to stimulate transcription. The −68PLuc vector has a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box, while the −490 PEPCK promoter has a number of binding sites for other factors. Alteration of amino acids 27 and 28 in C/EBPβ did not affect the ability of C/EBPβ to stimulate basal expression. Previously, we had demonstrated that the P3(I) site was required for the full induction of the PEPCK gene by cAMP (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of these C/EBPβ vectors to restore protein kinase A (PKA) responsiveness by cotransfecting −490-P3G4-PLuc with the Gal-C/EBPβ vectors. The P3G4 vector has a Gal4 site substituted for the P3(I) site in the −490PLuc (Fig. 1 B). Mutation of amino acids 61 and 62 and to a lesser extent 56, 57, and 58 in the Gal4-C/EBPβ vectors decreased the PKA response. Amino acids 60–72 of C/EBPα have been implicated in the cAMP induction of thePEPCK gene (28Wilson H.L. McFie P.J. Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the conserved amino acids between 55 and 71 in C/EBPα and C/EBPβ may be important in the contribution of these proteins to cAMP responsiveness. C/EBPβ M86,87 was as effective as the Gal4-C/EBPβ-(1–100) in mediating a PKA induc"

We expressed PKCα fused to green fluorescent protein (PKCα-GFP) and examined its translocation in living and permeabilized cells of the human parotid cell line, HSY-EB. ATP induced an oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP to and from the plasma membrane that paralleled the appearance of repetitive Ca2+ spikes. Staurosporine attenuated the relocation of PKCα-GFP to the cytosol and caused a stepwise accumulation of PKCα-GFP at the plasma membrane during ATP stimulation. Diacylglycerol enhanced the amplitude and duration of the ATP-induced oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP. Ionomycin induced a transient translocation of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane despite the continuous elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. The ionomycin-induced transient translocation of PKCα-GFP was prolonged by staurosporine, diacylglycerol, and phorbol myristate acetate. Experiments using permeabilized cells showed that staurosporine or the elimination of ATP and Mg2+ decreases the rate of dissociation of PKCα-GFP from the membrane. Diacylglycerol slowed the dissociation of PKCα-GFP from the membrane regardless of the Ca2+ concentration. The effect of diacylglycerol was attenuated by ATP plus Mg2+ at low concentrations of Ca2+ (<500 nm) but not at high concentrations of Ca2+ (>1000 nm). These data suggest a complex interplay between Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phosphorylation in the regulation of the membrane binding of PKCα.

All of the isoforms identified to date share in common an amino-terminal regulatory domain linked to a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Based on their cofactor dependence, which is dictated by the structure of the regulatory domain, PKCs are generally classified into three groups: conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ subtypes), novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ subtypes), and atypical PKCs (ζ, ι, and λ) (3Newton A.C.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Conventional PKCs (cPKCs) are activated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG), whereas novel PKCs are activated by DAG alone. The activation of atypical PKCs is not well understood. Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies have indicated that the biological activities of PKCs are closely regulated by their subcellular localization (2Nishizuka Y.

The C1 domain binds DAG or phorbol esters, whereas the C2 domain binds acidic lipids such as phosphatidylserine in a Ca2+-dependent manner (6Oancea E. Meyer T.

In addition it has been found that phosphorylation plays an essential role in the activation and translocation of these enzymes (8Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr.

Recently, GFP and its variants have been used as expressed fluorescent tags for signaling proteins and their mutants. The development of GFP-tagged PKCs makes it possible to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of PKC translocation through real-time visualization in living cells (14Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S.

This new strategy has revealed that the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane occurs transiently and reversibly in response to physiological stimuli such as the activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (6Oancea E.

Here we express GFP-tagged human PKCα (PKCα-GFP) in HSY-EB cells and examine the roles of Ca2+, DAG, and kinase activities in the dynamics of this enzyme during agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillation. We have also used permeabilized cells to more directly and quantitatively analyze the interplay of Ca2+, DAG, and phosphorylation in the membrane binding of PKCα-GFP. 1,2-Dihexanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC6) was obtained from Sigma. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Staurosporine and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Ionomycin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. These reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as 200× stock solutions and diluted to the desired final concentrations shortly before the experiment. [γ-32P]ATP was from Institute of Isotopes Co. (Budapest, Hungary). Hanks' balanced salt solution with Hepes (HBSS-H) contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.41 mmMgSO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmNaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Intracellular-like medium (ICM) contained 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 μg/ml saponin, EGTA, and appropriate concentrations of CaCl2. ICM-250S and ICM-1000S solutions consisted of ICM containing 250 and 1000 nm free Ca2+([Ca2+]m), respectively. The 3× stop solution contained 120 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 3 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mmEDTA, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 15 mmNa2ATP, 600 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 μm tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 30 μm pepstatin A, 30 μm leupeptin, 300 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 3% Triton X-100. The 1× stop solution was a 1:2 mixture of 3× stop solution and ICM-250S. The HSY human parotid cell line, a generous gift from Dr. Mitsunobu Sato (Tokushima University, Japan), was subcloned by using a dilution plating technique, and six clones were obtained. One of these subclones, HSY-EB, was used for imaging experiments in which the cells were cultured for 1 day in sample chambers consisting of 7 × 7-mm plastic cylinders glued to round glass coverslips with silicone rubber adhesive. Transient transfections were performed using a CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with 0.4 μg/ml plasmid (pPKCα-EGFP or pEGFP-C3; CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfections of HSY-EB cells with the pPKCα-EGFP vector were established using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). G418 selection (0.5 mg/ml) was initiated 24 h after the transfection. After 1 week, cells were expanded for an additional week without G418. Colonies of PKCα-GFP-expressing cells were screened by fluorescence microscopy. One of the stable HSY-EB transfectants (PKCα-GFP/EB2 cells) was used in phosphorylation experiments. All cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) as described previously (17Moran A. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1405-C1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out on cells cultured for at least 3 days after transfection. Cells were incubated with 3 μm Fura Red/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in HBSS-H for 30 min at room temperature. After loading Fura Red, the cells were washed and incubated in HBSS-H without BSA. Drug addition was performed by replacing HBSS-H buffer with experimental buffers containing various reagents. The distribution of PKCα-GFP and [Ca2+]i were monitored simultaneously with confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP system (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a 40× PL Fluotar objective. Confocal images were obtained by excitation at 488 nm and dual emission wavelengths at 495–550 nm for GFP and at 600–700 nm for Fura Red. Time series of 50–150 confocal images were recorded for each experiment at time intervals of between 2.5 and 10 s. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were performed independently on at least four different occasions, and in each experiment, recordings were obtained from 2–10 cells. The dissociation of PKCα-GFP was assessed using saponin-permeabilized HSY-EB cells in ICM. The concentration of free Ca2+ in the medium ([Ca2+]m) was calculated from the pH and the amount of potassium, sodium, calcium, EGTA, ATP, and magnesium by the method of Fabiato and Fabiato (18Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment, PKCα-GFP-transfected cells first were permeabilized with ICM-1000S. Cells were then exposed to test media consisting of ICM with variable [Ca2+]m. The time course of the dissociation of PKCα-GFP from the permeabilized cells was monitored at room temperature by confocal microscopy with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 495–550 nm. The data were then analyzed by a nonlinear least-squares fit to a monoexponential equation, PKC dissociation = A × (1 − exp−kt), where A is the maximum amplitude of PKC dissociation (fractional PKC dissociation) for that particular experimental condition, t is time, andk is the rate constant for PKC dissociation. PKCα-GFP/EB2 cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and cultured for 3 days. Cells were washed with HBSS-H and then permeabilized with ICM-1000S for 5 min and kept for 5 min in ICM-250S containing 100 μmMgCl2. Permeabilized cells were then incubated with 800 μl of phosphorylation medium (ICM-250S containing 100 μm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 50 μCi/ml of [γ-32P]ATP) at room temperature. After a 10-min incubation, the medium was corrected and mixed with 400 μl of ice-cold 3× stop solution. The cells remaining on the dish were suspended in 400 μl of ice-cold 3× stop solution and then added to 800 μl of phosphorylation medium. Both samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. A 1000-μl sample aliquot was supplemented with 100 μl of 1% BSA and 10 μl (2.5 μg) of anti-human PKCα monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The amount of antibody used in this experiment is sufficient to immunoprecipitate ∼20% of the PKCα-GFP protein expressed by confluent PKCα-GFP/EB2 cells in a 60-mm dish. Protein A beads (Sigma) were prewashed with 1× stop solution plus 0.1% BSA and added to the samples (10 μl of protein A beads/tube). After an additional hour of incubation, beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 1× stop solution. The tube was changed for the last spin. Protein retained by the washed beads was then eluted with 30 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and 20 μl of each sample were subjected to electrophoresis on 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels (Novel Experimental Technology). Gels were silver-stained, dried, and visualized by autoradiography using x-ray films. The stimulation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors results in the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+signals and DAG signals. Our previous study demonstrated that the activation of P2-purinoceptors induces a typical Ca2+ oscillation in HSY cells (19Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ca2+ and DAG are known as regulators for the translocation of cPKCs. We therefore examined the dynamic translocation of PKCα-GFP during ATP-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Earlier studies have shown that a C-terminal GFP tag does not affect the catalytic activity or the cofactor dependence of PKCα (15Maasch C. Wagner S. Lindschau C. Alexander G. Buchner K. Gollasch M. Luft F.C. Haller H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vallentin A. Prévostel C. Fauquier T. Bonnefont X. Joubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6014-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To monitor the [Ca2+]i and the translocation of PKCα-GFP simultaneously, a calcium indicator, Fura Red, was loaded into PKCα-GFP-expressing HSY-EB cells. Fig. 1 shows typical images and time courses of the translocation of PKCα-GFP versus the calcium spikes. In unstimulated cells, PKCα-GFP was evenly distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 1, a1), but stimulation with 10–100 μm ATP resulted in oscillations in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, b1–b4 andc) and simultaneous oscillatory translocations of PKCα-GFP to and from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, a1–a4 andc). The extent of the ATP-induced translocation of PKCα-GFP was 15–30% of the maximal translocation induced by ionomycin (Fig. 1, a5). Oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP was also observed when the cells were stimulated with 10–100 μm carbachol (data not shown). When HSY-EB cells expressing a control plasmid, EGFP, were loaded with Fura Red, the GFP fluorescence patterns were not changed by ATP, carbachol, or ionomycin (data not shown). Similar oscillatory translocation of fluorescent PKCα fusion proteins has been reported in human embryonic kidney cells stimulated with histamine (16Schaefer M. Albrecht N. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. FASEB J. May 29, 2001; 10.1096/f.00–0824fjeGoogle Scholar). The subcellular localization of cPKCs is known to be affected by DAG (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the kinase activity of PKC itself plays an essential role in the relocation of PKCβII (12Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of a membrane-permeable DAG, DiC8, and the PKC inhibitor staurosporine on the ATP-induced oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP. Staurosporine itself had no effect on the distribution of PKCα-GFP (Fig.2 b), but when cells were pretreated with staurosporine, PKCα-GFP accumulated at the plasma membrane in a stepwise manner in response to the repetitive ATP-induced Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP is driven by the interplay of Ca2+ signals and kinase activities. The addition of DiC8 to the cells decreased the frequency of the ATP-induced repetitive Ca2+ spiking. This effect of DiC8 is probably due to suppression of phosphoinositide metabolism through the activation of PKCs (19Tojyo Y. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1539: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). DiC8 markedly increased the extent of the translocation of PKCα-GFP (Fig. 3,a–g). The traces in Fig. 3, i andj, clearly demonstrate that externally added DiC8 enhanced the amplitude of the oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP (Fig.3 i) without any enhancement in the amplitude of the Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 3 j). DiC8 alone did not change the localization of PKCα-GFP (Fig. 5 c). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the lipid mediator DAG can act as an amplitude modulator for the oscillatory translocation of PKCα. The expanded time course revealed that in the absence of DiC8, PKCα-GFP rapidly dissociated from the plasma membrane when each Ca2+ spike was terminated (Fig.3 k). In contrast, after the addition of DiC8, the dissociation of PKCα-GFP was delayed after the Ca2+ spike (Fig. 3 l). In the presence of DiC8, the half-maximal relocation (recovery of PKCα-GFP fluorescence in the cytosol) was delayed by 5–10 s after the half-maximal drop in [Ca2+]i (recovery of Fura Red fluorescence).Figure 5Effect of staurosporine, DiC8, and PMA on ionomycin-induced translocation of PKC α-GFP. PKCα-GFP-expressing HSY-EB cells were loaded with Fura Red. Control cells (a) and cells pretreated for 30 s with 1 μm staurosporine (b), 100 μm DiC8 (d), and 1 μm PMA (f) were exposed to 5 μmionomycin in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. Confocal images of PKCα-GFP were obtained before (a1, b1, d1, and f1) and 30 s (a2,b2, d2, and f2), 120 s (a3, b3, d3, andf3), and 220 s (a4, b4,d4, and f4) after stimulation with 5 μm ionomycin (Iono). Extracellular Ca2+ was removed 180 s after stimulation. In control experiments, images were acquired before (c1 ande1), and 2 (c2 and e2) and 20 min (c3 and e3) after treatment with DiC8 (c) and PMA (e). Scale bar: 20 μm.

The presence of ionomycin and Ca2+ is indicated by thehorizontal bars at the top of the panel. The ionomycin-induced transient translocation of PKCα-GFP was observed in 16 of 18 cells. The results of staurosporine, DiC8, or PMA in ionomycin-treated and untreated cells are representative of 10–23 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of DiC8 on the ATP-induced Ca2+oscillation and the oscillatory translocation of PKCα-GFP were analyzed quantitatively (Fig. 4). DiC8 increased the intervals between Ca2+ spikes (Fig.4 a), but the amplitude (Fig. 4 b) and duration (Fig. 4 c) of each Ca2+ spike was not altered even with the highest concentration (100 μm) of DiC8. These results clearly demonstrate that DiC8 did not alter the pattern of each Ca2+ spike. On the other hand, the amplitude and duration of the PKCα-GFP translocation were increased by DiC8 in a concentration-dependent manner. The delay of the half-maximal relocation of PKCα-GFP after the half-maximal recovery of Fura Red fluorescence was increased by DiC8 at concentrations above 3 μm (Fig. 4 d). Similar effects were also observed with another DAG analog, DiC6 (data not shown). To clarify the effect of Ca2+ on the translocation of PKCα-GFP, we manipulated the Ca2+ response using ionomycin-treated cells. The treatment of ionomycin continuously elevated [Ca2+]i, and if extracellular Ca2+ was removed, the ionomycin treatment lowered [Ca2+]i to below the resting level (Fig.5 a5, closed circles). Unlike the [Ca2+]i response, ionomycin induced a transient translocation of PKCα-GFP; the maximal translocation occurred within 30 s (Fig. 5 a2), and 50–90% of the translocated PKCα-GFP relocated to the cytosol within 2 min after the stimulation (Fig. 5 a3). This implies the presence of a specific mechanism by which PKCα-GFP relocates to the cytosol during [Ca2+]i elevation. Subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the complete recovery of PKCα-GFP to the cytosol (Fig. 5 a4). We next examined the effect of staurosporine and DAG on ionomycin-induced translocation of PKCα-GFP. When cells were pretreated with staurosporine, PKCα-GFP translocated to the plasma membrane in response to the ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]i elevation but did not relocate to the cytosol until the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.5 b). These results confirm that the relocation of PKCα is dependent on PKC kinase activity. Treatment with DiC8 alone did not change the localization of PKCα-GFP (Fig. 5 c). However, in DiC8-pretreated cells that were then stimulated with ionomycin, PKCα-GFP translocated to the plasma membrane and remained there during the period of [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 5 d), relocating to the cytosol only when Ca2+ had been removed. These results indicate that Ca2+ is required for DiC8 to exert its influence on the translocation of PKCα-GFP. Unlike DiC8, PMA alone induced a slow translocation of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane; the PMA-induced translocation became detectable at 5 min or later and was completed at 10–15 min (Fig. 5 e). When ionomycin was added 30 s after application of PMA, PKCα-GFP was translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 f) and did not relocate even after the removal of extracellular Ca2+. The fact that the PMA-mediated stable binding of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane was established within 2 min in ionomycin-treated cells (compared with 10 min in the absence of ionomycin) suggests that the binding of PMA to PKCα-GFP was markedly accelerated by Ca2+. Recent studies on PKCγ have proposed that cPKC isoforms are sequentially activated by Ca2+ and DAG (6Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Based on this well established “sequential model,” our results can be explained as follows. The initial binding of Ca2+ to the C2 domain of PKCα-GFP recruits the enzyme to the plasma membrane and makes the C1 domain accessible to DAG. The subsequent binding of DAG to the C1 domain enables the continuous binding of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane. Although PMA is a functional analog of DAG, its action is persistent because of its slow dissociation from cell membranes and its metabolic stability (22Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27159-27162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented above suggest that kinase activities and/or DAG modulate the Ca2+-dependent translocation of cPKCs. The interaction of these regulatory mechanisms, however, is largely unresolved. To explore the question of how kinase activities and DAG modulate the Ca2+-dependent binding of PKCα-GFP to biological membranes, we initially attempted to directly examine the effect of Ca2+ on the binding of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane using saponin-permeabilized cells. As the Ca2+ concentration within permeabilized cells quickly equilibrates to the Ca2+ concentration of the ICM ([Ca2+]m), we expected that PKCα-GFP would translocate to the plasma membrane upon the permeabilization. In fact, 50–70% of the PKCα-GFP fluorescence translocated to the membrane upon permeabilization in ICM containing 1000 nmCa2+ and 100 μg/ml saponin (Fig.6, a, b, andf). The translocated PKCα-GFP stably bound to the membrane for at least 10 min (Fig. 6, c and f) but was rapidly released and lost into medium with the subsequent exposure to “Ca2+-free” ICM (Fig. 6, d–f) in which [Ca2+]m was calculated to be ∼1.5 nm. This Ca2+-dependent fraction of the change in fluorescence (depicted as dF) directly demonstrates the Ca2+-dependence of PKCα-GFP in its binding to cell membranes. We then tested the effect of PMA (Fig.7 a) and staurosporine (Fig.7 b) on the release of PKCα-GFP from the membrane. When permeabilized cells were pretreated for 30 s with 1 μm PMA, the dissociation of PKCα-GFP in the Ca2+-free ICM was strongly blocked. Similar results were also obtained when cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O (data not shown). This result is expected, given the experiment using intact ionomycin-treated cells (Fig. 5 e) where PMA blocked the relocation of PKCα-GFP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and strongly suggests that the PMA-dependent binding between the C1 domain of PKCα-GFP and the plasma membrane is preserved in permeabilized cells. Because the effect of PMA on the binding is mediated by the C1 domain of PKCα-GFP, we expected that the effect of DiC8 on PKCα-GFP could also be examined in this permeabilized cell system. PKCα-GFP was not released from the permeabilized cells in ICM containing 250 nm [Ca2+]m lacking ATP and Mg2+ but was readily released by the addition of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig. 7 b). The addition of either ATP or Mg2+ did not release PKCα-GFP at 250 nm[Ca2+]m (data not shown). The ATP/Mg-dependent release of PKCα-GFP was strongly blocked by staurosporine (Fig 7 b). These data directly indicate that the kinase activities accelerate the release of PKCα-GFP. It has been suggested that Ca2+-mediated membrane binding of cPKCs is attenuated by autophosphorylation (12Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the ATP/Mg-dependent release of PKCα-GFP is due to its phosphorylation. To directly determine the phosphorylation of PKCα-GFP, released and membrane-bound PKCα-GFP were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCα antibody (Fig.8 A), and their incorporation of the 32P from radioactive ATP was analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 8 B). Although the phosphorylation of membrane-bound PKCα-GFP was detected, the additional phosphorylation of the released PKCα-GFP was not recognized. This result suggests that the ATP/Mg2+-dependent release of PKCα-GFP is not directly mediated by the phosphorylation of PKCα-GFP. The experiments depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 clearly indicate that the effect of Ca2+ and PMA on PKCα-GFP membrane binding and the role of kinase activities in facilitating the release are preserved in saponin-permeabilized cells. To further analyze the interplay of Ca2+, DiC8, and the kinase activities for the binding of PKCα-GFP to cell membranes, permeabilized cells were exposed to various test media, and the resulting time courses of the release of PKCα-GFP were analyzed quantitatively. As shown in Fig. 9,A and B, the time courses conform well to a single exponential decay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Accordingly, we have used least-squares curve-fitting techniques to determine the initial rate of PKC release, thereby quantitating our results. The calculated initial rates are plotted as a function of [Ca2+]m in Fig. 9 C. In the absence of ATP/Mg, the release rate gradually decreased as the [Ca2+]m increased (Fig. 9 A,a–c), and release was blocked almost completely by 100 or 250 nm [Ca2+]m (Fig. 9 A,d and e). The addition of DiC8 slowed the release of PKCα-GFP in the presence of 1.5, 25, and 50 nm[Ca2+]m (Fig. 9 A, a–c, andC). The half-maximal Ca2+ conc"

ADH4 is predominantly expressed in the mucosa of the upper digestive tract (21Yin S.-J. Liao C.-S., Wu, C.-W., Li, T.-T. Chen L.-L. Lai C.-L. Tsao T.-Y.

The tissue distribution is compatible with involvement of the local retinoic acid in epidermal differentiation and spermatogenesis. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of ADH4 appear to coincide with the synthesis of retinoic acid during embryogenesis in mice (28Ang H.-L. Deltour L. Hayamizu T.F. Žgombić-Knight M. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9526-9534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Ang H.-L. Duester G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ADH4 gene knockout mice subjected to vitamin A deficiency during gestation show decreased newborn survival compared with wild-type mice (30Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This implies that ADH4 may function in the metabolism of retinol to retinoic acid known to be needed for normal development. It has been thought that interference with retinoic acid synthesis via the ADH pathway by ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol syndrome, a birth defect characterized by craniofacial, limb, and brain malformations (31Duester G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The evidence in support of this concept includes the fact that ethanol competitively inhibits retinol oxidation catalyzed by the human ADH family with apparent K i values ranging from 37 μm to 11 mm, indicating that retinoic acid formation in the embryo can be effectively impeded by physiologically attainable levels of blood alcohol during moderate to heavy drinking (16Han C.-L.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Correlation of expression of ADH4 and the synthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid in developing mouse embryos points to a potential perturbation with ethanol (33Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S.

Res. 1998; 22: 1607-1613PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism of retinol for human ADH was not documented in the literature, although the horse enzyme with ethanol has long been established as a prototype of the ordered sequential mechanism (35Theorell H. Chance B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1951; 5: 1127-1144Crossref Google Scholar, 36Dalziel K. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2850-2858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wratten C.C. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Structurally, human ADH4 is unique in having a deletion of residue 117, which shortens the loop comprised of residues 114–120 and widens the outer part of the cylinder-shaped substrate-binding pocket as revealed in x-ray studies (38Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Molecular dockings show that the β-ionone ring of retinol binds at the widened entrance of the substrate pocket such that an extended conformation of retinol can be accommodated (38Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The recombinant ADH4 with an insertion of Gly117 exhibits decreased catalytic efficiencies for oxidation of both all-trans-retinol and 9-cis-retinol (39Crosas B. Allali-Hassani A. Martı́nez S.E. Martras S. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Farrés J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25180-25187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the x-ray structure of horse ADH1S also shows that compared with the ethanol-active ADH1E, a widening of the substrate channel that facilitate access of bulky steroid substrate to the active-site zinc can be attributed to the deletion of Asp115 in addition to other amino acid exchanges lining the substrate pocket (40Adolph H.-W. Zwart P. Meijers R. Hubatsch I. Kiefer M. Lamzin V. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12885-12897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functional role of ADH in the metabolism of retinoids as well as to assess the potential influence by ethanol consumption in the cell, it is important to understand complete steady-state kinetic mechanism with all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal. Both are major metabolites of β-carotene and precursors of all-trans-retinoic acid, a ligand for retinoic acid receptors in the retinoid signaling pathway (41Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). The human recombinant ADH4 was expressed inEscherichia coli as described previously (38Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The resulting enzyme was initially isolated from the lysate supernatant by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (DE52, Whatman; 10 ml of DEAE/liter of culture) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. The unbound proteins were eluted in a batch procedure. The eluate was concentrated and then dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a 1.6 × 9-cm 5′-AMP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol to 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The active fractions were dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and applied to a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl in same buffer and then dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in the absence of reducing agent for subsequent kinetic and equilibrium binding studies. The recombinant enzyme exhibited a single protein-staining band with a molecular weight of 40,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by a PhastSystem according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Total protein concentration was determined by a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was assayed in 0.1 m glycine, pH 10.0, containing 2.4 mm NAD+ and 100 mm ethanol at 25 °C. The specific activity of the purified ADH4 was determined to be 68 μmol min−1 mg−1. The enzyme (>1 mg/ml) appeared stable for at least 1 week in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, when it was kept in an ice bath. The sodium salt of (4R)[4-2H]nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was prepared from NAD+ and ethanol-d 5 as described previously (43Dalziel K. Biochem. J. 1962; 84: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the prepared coenzyme exhibited anA 260/A 340 of 2.35. NAD+ (grade I) and NADH (grade I) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, all-trans-retinol ( ≥ 99% purity) was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinoic acid were from Sigma, and ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethanol-d 6, and Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate) were from Merck. The acetaldehyde was redistilled before use. Kinetic measurements were made in 0.1m sodium phosphate containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The mixture was incubated for 3 min in the presence of retinoid substrate/inhibitor and coenzyme before adding enzyme to initiate the reaction. Initial velocities were determined by monitoring the formation (ε400 = 29.5 mm−1 cm−1) or reduction (ε425 = 14.6 mm−1cm−1, which was the wavelength used to avoid interference of NADH in the assay mixture) of all-trans-retinal with a Varian Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer and fitting the progress curves to a line, which calculates the initial slope. In each assay, the accumulated change of absorbances were ≥0.0030 for a duration of 2–5 min or longer if needed. All-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal, or all-trans-retinoic acid was dissolved in degassed acetonitrile as stock solution, stored at −70 °C in small screw-capped vials filled with the solvent leaving no air space, and used within 1 week of storage. The concentration of the working solution was determined using ε328 = 39.5 mm−1 cm−1 for all-trans-retinol, ε400 = 29.5 mm−1 cm−1 for all-trans-retinal, and ε345 = 31.2 mm−1 cm−1 for all-trans-retinoic acid. The working retinoid solution was prepared every 4 h during longer sets of experiments. All of the experiments were conducted in a dark room under dim red light. The concentration of Tween 80 employed in the assay buffer, i.e.0.02%, had minimal effect on the activities of all-trans-retinal reduction for horse and rat ADHs (44Zachman R.D. Olson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2309-2313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the detergent principally affects the dispersion of retinoid substrate rather than enzyme (44Zachman R.D. Olson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2309-2313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of acetonitrile (2%) and Tween 80 (0.02%) to the assay buffer appeared not to affect the K m and k catvalues for ethanol oxidation for human ADH (16Han C.-L. Liao C.-S., Wu, C.-W. Hwong C.-L. Lee A.-R. Yin S.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To eliminate possible interference with kinetic measurements, the final concentrations of Tween 80 and acetonitrile in the assay mixtures remained fixed except that 3% acetonitrile was used for those experiments in which all-trans-retinol was added as a product inhibitor against either all-trans-retinal or NADH because of the higher inhibition constants and the limitation of retinol solubility. Steady-state kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the programs of Cleland (45Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) or the formulating equations that were written according to the statistical package program of SigmaPlot (version 7.0). Initial velocity data were fit with either the HYPER program to the Michaelis-Menten equation in Equation 1 or with the SEQUEN program to the kinetic equation for a two-substrate sequential reaction in Equation 2.v=VAKm+AEquation 1 v=VABKiaKmb+KmaB+KmbA+ABEquation 2 where V is the maximum velocity; A and B are the coenzyme and substrate concentrations, respectively;K m a andK m b are the Michaelis constants for A and B, respectively; and K i a is the dissociation constant of A from the free enzyme E. Maximal activity is expressed as turnover number (min−1) based on a subunit molecular weight of 40,000. To assess the validity of the assumption of rapid equilibrium, the initial velocity data were fit with Equation 3(the EQORD program) for an obligatory order sequential reaction.v=VABKiaKb+KbA+ABEquation 3 where K i a andK b are the dissociation constants of A from the free enzyme E and of B from the binary EA complex, respectively. The data from dead-end and product inhibition studies were fit with one of the linear inhibition equations, the COMP program for competitive inhibition (Equation 4), the NONCOMP program for noncompetitive inhibition (Equation 5), or the UNCOMP program for uncompetitive inhibition (Equation 6).v=VAKm(1+I/Kis)+AEquation 4 v=VAKm(1+I/Kis)+A(1+I/Kii)Equation 5 v=VAKm+A(1+I/Kii)Equation 6 where I is the inhibitor concentration, andK i s andK i i in Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 are the dissociation constants of a dead-end inhibitor from the EI binary complex and EAI ternary complex, respectively. However, when EquationsEquation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 were used to fit the data from the product inhibition experiment,K i s andK i i are the apparent slope inhibition constant and intercept inhibition constant of the product inhibitor, respectively. The best fit was determined by evaluating the standard errors of the parameters and the residual variance (45Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). All of the kinetic measurements were run in duplicate. The values represent the means ± S.E. The binding of coenzyme and substrate to the enzyme was examined by measuring the induced changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ADH4 upon binding. The changes in the fluorescence were measured at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength between 330 and 370 nm for the quenching of the protein fluorescence or an emission wavelength of 460 nm for the enhancement of the NADH fluorescence, which is attributed to a resonance energy transfer from tryptophan to the bound reduced coenzyme (47Theorell H. Tatemoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to horse ADH1E, human ADH4 contains two tryptophan residues per subunit, Trp15 and Trp313(equivalent to Trp314 in the horse enzyme) (3Duester G. Farrés J. Felder M.R. Holmes R.S. Höög J.-O. Parés X. Plapp B.V. Yin S.-J. Jörnvall H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Trp15 is at the surface of the protein, on the outer edge of the catalytic domain, and Trp313 is part of the coenzyme-binding domain, buried in the subunit interface (38Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous studies with the horse enzyme indicate that Trp314 is primarily responsible for the quenching/enhancement of fluorescence in the formation of the enzyme-coenzyme binary complexes or the enzyme-coenzyme-dead-end inhibitor ternary complexes (48Eftink M.R. Selvidge L.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 49Eftink M.R. Hagaman K.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6631-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of the fluorescence measurements were conducted in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 2% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 at 25 °C and using a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. The binding studies were conducted by adding coenzyme/retinoid substrate in small increments to a 110–2,000 nn enzyme solution in a volume of 1 ml. After the addition of ligand, the mixture was incubated for 2–3 min, and then the fluorescence spectrum was recorded from 300–500 nm. The normality of the enzyme was calculated based on a subunit molecular weight of 40,000. The concentrations of the ligand employed in fluorescence titration ranged within 0.06–6 K d . For determination of dissociation constants, the changes of the protein fluorescence quenching or NADH fluorescence enhancement were fit with a modified Stern-Volmer equation (50Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar).ΔF=FmaxLKd+LEquation 7 where F max is the maximal change in fluorescence when all of the free enzyme or the binary enzyme complex is bound by ligand, L is the ligand concentration, andK d is the dissociation constant. The all-trans-retinol oxidation and all-trans-retinal reduction were studied by varying the substrate concentrations at different fixed corresponding coenzyme concentrations. Examples of the double-reciprocal plots are shown in Fig. 1. For oxidation of retinol, the double reciprocal plots for either NAD+ or retinol were linear and intersected above the abscissa and to the left of the ordinate, which is consistent with a sequential kinetic mechanism. The data for both the substrates fit well to the sequential bireactant mechanism (Equation 2). TableI shows the calculated kinetic constantsK a, K b,K i a, and V 1 with standard errors less than 13%. The double reciprocal plots for NADH or retinal in the reverse reaction were linear, and the former intersected above the abscissa and to the left of the ordinate, whereas the latter intersected on the ordinate and above the abscissa (Fig.1 B). The data did not fit Equation 2 as revealed by a large standard error (> 100%) of the calculated K m for NADH. This is because of very small intercept effect observed in the double reciprocal plot. But the data fit well to Equation 3, which uniquely illustrates a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism. The standard errors of the resulting kinetic constantsK p, K i q, andV 2 were 16% or less (Table I). A rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism is expected to show a slope approaching 0 in double reciprocal plot of the first reactant if using a highly saturating concentration of the second reactant. This experiment was not carried out because of solubility limitation of retinal in the assay buffer.Table IKinetic constants for human class IV alcohol dehydrogenase determined from initial velocity and product inhibition studiesKinetic constantsInitial velocityProduct inhibition K a(μm)280 ± 261-aFrom fitting the data to Equation 2 or 9 (see Fig. 1 A).

https://openalex.org/W1997744060,"A functional retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is required for adipose conversion of preadipocyte cell lines and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) in response to treatment with standard adipogenic inducers. Interestingly, lack of functional pRB in MEFs was recently linked to elevated Ras activity. Ras-dependent signaling plays a significant, although incompletely understood, role in adipocyte differentiation, because activated Ras has been reported to either promote or inhibit adipogenesis depending on the cellular context. In various cell types activation of Ras leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, which exert opposing effects on adipogenesis, with ERK1/2 inhibiting and PKB/Akt promoting terminal differentiation. Here we report that the levels of activated ERK1/2 and PKB/Akt are significantly increased in pRB-deficient MEFs both before and after the addition of adipogenic inducers. Consistently, we detected higher levels of activated Ras in MEFs lacking pRB. Suppression of ERK1/2 activation by the MEK inhibitor UO126 restored the ability of pRB-deficient MEFs to undergo adipocyte differentiation, as manifested by expression of adipocyte marker genes and lipid accumulation. Furthermore and reflecting the elevated levels of activated PKB/Akt in the pRB-deficient MEFs, differentiation proceeded in an insulin-independent manner. In conclusion, we suggest that pRB plays a pivotal role in adipogenesis by suppressing MAPK activity."

By subtractive hybridization experiments performed on the RCCD1 cortical collecting duct cell line, we identified calcyclin as an early AVP-induced gene (1 h). Calcyclin is a calcium-binding protein involved in the transduction of intracellular signals. In the kidney, calcyclin was localized at the mRNA level in the glomerulus, all along the collecting duct, and in the epithelium lining the papilla. In RCCD1 cells and in m-IMCD3 inner medullary collecting duct cells, calcyclin was evidenced in the cytoplasm. Calcyclin mRNA levels were progressively increased by AVP treatment in RCCD1(1.7-fold at 4 h) and m-IMCD3 (2-fold at 7.5 h) cells. In RCCD1 cells, calcyclin protein levels were increased by 4 h of AVP treatment. In vivo, treatment of genetically vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats with AVP for 4 days induced an increase in both calcyclin and aquaporin-2 mRNA expression. Finally, introduction of anti-calcyclin antibodies into RCCD1 cells by permeabilizing the plasma membrane prevented the long-term (but not short-term) increase in short-circuit current induced by AVP. Taken together, these results suggest that calcyclin is an early vasopressin-induced gene that participates in the late phase of the hormone response in transepithelial ion transport.

In the collecting duct, AVP coordinately increases water and NaCl reabsorption by a two-step mechanism. The first mechanism is responsible for the short-term effects of AVP. These effects consist of the translocation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels and amiloride-sensitive sodium channels from intracellular pools to the apical membrane, promoting an increase in both sodium and water entry (1Schafer J.A.

This long-term effect may involve the genomic pathway by activation of cAMP-responsive elements in the promoter region of these genes and may ensure a sustained increase in sodium, chloride, and water transport in this segment of the nephron. A recent study has focused on the effects of 4 h of treatment with vasopressin on the transcriptome of a mouse kidney cortical collecting duct cell line (16Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Statistical comparison of the SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries revealed 48 vasopressin-induced transcripts and 11 vasopressin-repressed transcripts. A selection of the differentially expressed vasopressin-specific transcripts has been validated by Northern blot hybridization and by reverse transcription. Hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor-3α (VIT39 (vasopressin-induced transcript)) and receptor activity-modifying protein-3 (VIT48) have been suggested to be candidate proteins playing a role in physiological responses to vasopressin. In this study, we have searched for mRNA induced by AVP treatment using the subtractive hybridization technique in the vasopressin-responsive RCCD1 cell line. Results show that the calcium-binding protein calcyclin is an AVP-induced protein. Interestingly, in the kidney, calcyclin is mainly expressed in the collecting duct and appears to be regulated by AVP in coordination with AQP2. Finally, calcyclin appears to be indispensable in allowing the long-term (but not short-term) response of the hormone in RCCD1 cells. The RCCD1 rat cortical collecting duct cell line (17Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the m-IMCD3 mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (a generous gift from Dr. P. Gascard, Berkeley University, Berkeley, CA) were used between passages 10 and 25. Cells were grown either on Transwell or Snapwell (Costar Corp.) filters coated with collagen (type 1 from rat tail; Institut Jacques Boy, Reims, France). The defined culture medium for RCCD1cells was Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), 14 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 5 × 10−8m dexamethasone, 3 × 10−8m sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 × 10−8m triiodothyronine, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Les Ulis, France). The culture medium for m-IMCD3 cells was Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every other day. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used forin situ hybridization experiments. In addition, 16 male Brattleboro rats (250–300 g) were used for Northern blot experiments aimed at determining the effects of AVP on calcyclin mRNA expression. In these experiments, animals were treated with AVP (Sigma) using different protocols: either with a single intramuscular injection of AVP (2 μg in 0.9% NaCl) 3 h before killing or with an osmotic minipump (500 ng/day in 0.9% NaCl) for 4 days. Control rats were treated similarly, except that only 0.9% NaCl was used. Animals had free access to tap water and were anesthetized with pentobarbital before killing. To determine the mRNAs differentially expressed after vasopressin treatment in the cortical collecting duct, subtractive hybridization was performed on RCCD1 cells grown on Transwell filters in defined culture medium for 4 days, incubated overnight in minimum medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), 14 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then treated or not for 1 h basolaterally with 10−8m AVP. Poly(A) mRNAs were extracted from RCCD1 cells treated or not with AVP using oligo(dT)25 covalently bound to magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Double-stranded cDNA was then synthesized and digested with RsaI. To identify up-regulated sequences, these two pools of cDNA fragments derived from control and AVP-treated cells were submitted to PCR-based subtractive hybridization and suppression PCR (PCR-SelectTM cDNA Subtraction kit, CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adaptors were linked to the AVP-treated cDNA pool, and two successive hybridizations followed by extension to fill in ends were performed in the presence of an excess of cDNA without linkers from the untreated cells. A first PCR amplification using suppression PCR amplified exponentially only differentially expressed sequences. A second PCR amplification reduced the background and further enriched differentially expressed cDNA fragments. “Forward” subtraction was performed when linkers were added to cDNA fragments obtained from hormone-treated cells, whereas “reverse” subtraction was performed when linkers were added to cDNA fragments obtained from control cells. PCR products were cloned into the pT-Adv vector using the AdvanTAgeTM PCR cloning kit (CLONTECH). Differential screening of the subtracted library was performed to eliminate false positives by hybridization with 32P-labeled probes prepared from forward and reverse subtracted cDNAs (PCR-Select Differential Screening kit, CLONTECH). Clones showing signal ratios of >5:1 (forward versus reverse subtracted probe) were further analyzed by DNA sequencing. For in situ hybridization studies, kidneys from Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde with 5 mm MgCl2 and then kept at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. In situ hybridization experiments were performed as previously described (18Farman N. Corthesy-Theulaz I. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, sections were covered with an autoradiography emulsion (NTB2, Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed at −20 °C for 10 days before development (Kodak D19 film). Cells were then stained with toluidine blue and examined under bright-field using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Calcyclin cDNA (nucleotides 51–327) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the Bluescript KS vector. Sense and antisense cRNAs were synthesized after linearization using35S-labeled UTP (specific activity of 1000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) and the Riboprobe® Combination System T3/T7 kit (Promega). Other reagents used for the experiments (adenosine, guanosine, cytosine 5′-triphosphate, ribonucleasin, dithiothreitol, and RNA polymerases) were from Promega. Immunocytochemical experiments were performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-calcyclin antibody (Swiss Swant Laboratories, Bellinzona, Switzerland) diluted 1:200. RCCD1and m-IMCD3 cells were grown to confluence on collagen-coated Transwell filters (12-mm diameter) and then fixed in paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the anti-calcyclin antibody. A secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Fab fraction (1:200); Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) coupled to the fluorochrome Cy3 (red fluorescence) was used to visualize the signal. In these experiments, the nucleus was stained with Sytox (green fluorescence; Molecular Probes, Inc.). xz sections of cells were realized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS4D apparatus). Total RNA (10–20 μg) was extracted from RCCD1 or m-IMCD3 cells cultured on 24-mm diameter Transwell filters or from Brattleboro rat kidneys, run on a 0.8% denaturing glyoxal-agarose gel, and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (19Djelidi S. Beggah A. Courtois-Coutry N. Fay M. Cluzeaud F. Viengchareun S. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1805-1818PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were then hybridized with random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes for the clone encoding calcyclin (276 bp, nucleotides 51–327), AQP2 (330 bp, nucleotides 638–968), or GAPDH (851 bp, nucleotides 20–871) as an internal control. The membranes were exposed to Biomax MR films (Kodak) and analyzed with an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Cells were plated on 24-mm Transwell filters and cultured for 3 days in defined culture medium before incubation overnight in minimum medium. Cells were then treated or not basolaterally for 4 h at 37 °C with 10−8m AVP. Cells from each filter were rinsed and scraped at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline before addition of lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (after centrifugation at 12,000 × g) corresponding to each filter were submitted to SDS-PAGE (15%) using the Laemmli buffer system before transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (AmershamBiosciences). The membrane was then pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the anti-calcyclin antibody (1:250) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (1:20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using the ECL or ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Results were normalized to the signal obtained by Western blotting of β-actin in the same cell samples. To this end, the membrane was stripped and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and then for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-β-actin antibody (1/10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) before incubation with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000) for 1 h at room temperature and ECL visualization. To examine the influence of calcyclin on the response of RCCD1cells to AVP, anti-calcyclin antibodies were introduced into the cells by permeabilizing their plasma membrane, and the effect of the hormone on transepithelial transport was examined by short-circuit current experiments. Indeed, in a previous study (20Okazaki K. Niki I. Iino S. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6149-6152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was shown that anti-calcyclin antibodies could block the activity of the protein and that introduction of these antibodies into the cells prevented the transduction of cellular processes in response to a hormonal stimulus. In our experiments, RCCD1 cells were grown on Snapwell filters coated with collagen. The development of confluence was monitored by measuring the transepithelial voltage (mV) and the transepithelial resistance (ohms/cm2) across the filters using a World Precision Instruments epithelial volt-ohm meter connected to sterile electrodes. When high transepithelial voltage and transepithelial resistance were recorded (5–8 days after seeding), filters were incubated overnight in minimum medium. The short-circuit current (I sc) was then determined on these cells, which had been treated or not for two different times with AVP (15 min and 7.5 h), after permeabilization of the cells in the presence of the anti-calcyclin antibody or nonspecific IgG. Two different protocols for cell membrane permeabilization were used. Cell membranes were permeabilized either by a freeze/thaw procedure as already described for RCCD1 cells (14Djelidi S. Fay M. Cluzeaud F. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Blot-Chabaud M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or with digitonin (21Guerrero M.L. Beron J. Spindler B. Groscurth P. Wallimann T. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C697-C706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both protocols, the apical medium of the cells (500 μl) was removed and replaced with the same volume of either minimum medium supplemented with 5 μl of anti-calcyclin antibody (freeze/thaw procedure) or phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 40 μm digitonin and 5 μl of anti-calcyclin antibody (digitonin procedure). In the freeze/thaw procedure, filters were placed on a bath of ethanol at –30 °C, and after rapid freezing of the cells, they were rapidly thawed by incubation at 37 °C. In the digitonin procedure, cells were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C with the digitonin medium. The medium was then removed and replaced with minimum medium. Preliminary experiments using trypan blue as a marker of cell permeabilization showed that >95% of the cells were permeabilized under these conditions. In control experiments, the same protocol was performed, except that rabbit IgG was used in place of the anti-calcyclin antibody. To study the short-term effects of AVP (15 min), cells were permeabilized after incubation in minimum medium, incubated for 4.5 h at 37 °C to allow membrane resealing, and then mounted in the voltage-clamp system (Costar Corp. and World Precision Instruments, Inc.). To study the long-term effects of AVP (7.5 h), cells were first treated with AVP. After 3 h of incubation, cells were permeabilized and then further incubated for 4.5 h, always in the presence of AVP, at 37 °C before mounting in the voltage-clamp system. In this system, cells were bathed on each side with 8 ml of minimum medium that was thermostatted at 37 °C and that was circulated by a gas lift (95% O2 and 5% CO2mixture). I sc (μA/cm2) was measured by clamping the transepithelial voltage to 0 mV for 1 s. To study the short-term effects of AVP, I sc was determined before and after 15 min of incubation with 10−8m AVP. To study the long-term effects of AVP,I sc was determined in cells treated or not with 10−8m AVP for 7.5 h. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest for unpaired data according to the experiments. PCR-based subtractive hybridization was used to establish a library of cDNAs representing early (1 h) vasopressin-regulated mRNAs in RCCD1 cells. To this end, mRNAs corresponding to 24-mm diameter filters treated or not for 1 h with 10−8m AVP were prepared with the poly(A) isolation kit and used in a PCR-based suppression/subtractive hybridization experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”). The selected clones were sequenced and analyzed by homology searches using the BLAST program. Among these sequences, we have identified a clone highly homologous to calcyclin (GenBankTM/EBI accession Number AJ132717), which was further studied. To examine the expression of calcyclin in the kidney,in situ hybridization experiments were performed on kidneys from Sprague-Dawley rats. The results are presented in Fig.1. Calcyclin mRNA was expressed all along the collecting duct and also in the glomerulus and in the epithelium lining the papilla. In the collecting duct, calcyclin mRNA was expressed at low levels in the cortical part, with a progressive increase along the medulla and the papilla. The expression of calcyclin was examined in two different models of collecting duct cells: the RCCD1 cell line, corresponding to cortical collecting duct cells, and the m-IMCD3 cell line, corresponding to papillary collecting duct cells. Calcyclin was expressed in both models and appeared to be present essentially in the cytoplasmic compartment (Figs. 2 and3, respectively).Figure 3Confocal localization of calcyclin in m-IMCD3 cells. Calcyclin was localized in m-IMCD3 cells (in red). The nuclei were stained in green. Experiments were performed under the same conditions as described for RCCD1 cells (see the legend to Fig. 2). No staining was observed in the absence of the anti-calcyclin antibody (data not shown). In its presence, a clear signal was evidenced (A) in the cytoplasm of the cells (B).Bars = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.4 A shows a representative Northern blot experiment aimed at determining the time course of calcyclin mRNA induction by 10−8m AVP in RCCD1 cells. Whereas GAPDH mRNA expression was not modified, calcyclin mRNA expression increased progressively with the time of AVP exposure. Fig. 4 Billustrates the mean values of five different experiments. Calcyclin mRNA induction significantly increased as soon as 1 h after AVP addition, with a maximal effect after 4 h (∼70% increase). Thereafter, calcyclin mRNA expression returned to the control level (at 24 h). Fig. 5 shows the time course of calcyclin mRNA induction by 10−8m AVP in m-IMCD3 cells as measured by Northern blotting. As noted for RCCD1 cells, GAPDH mRNA expression was not modified, and calcyclin mRNA expression progressively increased after AVP exposure. Fig. 5 B shows the mean values of four different experiments. The calcyclin mRNA induction was significant after 30 min of AVP exposure. A 100% increase was observed at 7.5 h of treatment with the hormone. Thereafter, calcyclin mRNA expression returned to the control level at 24 h. Fig.6 A shows a representative Western blot experiment aimed at determining the effect on calcyclin expression of 4 h of treatment with 10−8m AVP in RCCD1 cells. Calcyclin protein expression was largely increased by AVP treatment. Fig. 6 Billustrates the mean values of three different experiments, taking into account the expression of β-actin in each sample. Calcyclin expression was significantly increased by 4 h of treatment with 10−8m AVP. To examine the in vivo effect of AVP on the expression of renal calcyclin mRNA, Northern blot experiments were performed with RNA obtained from Brattleboro rat whole kidneys treated or not for 3 h or 4 days with AVP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The expression of AQP2 mRNA was also examined as a positive control, and the effects were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. Whereas no significant effect was observed at 3 h on either AQP2 or calcyclin mRNA expression (data not shown), a clear effect was observed after 4 days of treatment. Fig. 7 Ashows a representative experiment using four different animals. Treatment of the animals for 4 days with AVP using osmotic minipumps resulted in a significant increase in mRNA encoding both AQP2 and calcyclin. Fig. 7 B shows the quantification of the increase in AQP2 and calcyclin mRNA expression in four AVP-treated Brattleboro rats compared with that in four control Brattleboro rats. Entry of an antibody inside the cell can be yielded by transient permeabilization procedures; thereafter, the cells recover and develop electrical properties similar to those of non-permeabilized cells (14Djelidi S.

To test the effect of anti-calcyclin antibodies on the AVP-induced increase in ion transport, two different cell permeabilization techniques were used to ensure antibody entry into the cells. Both the short- and long-term effects of AVP were examined by the short-circuit current (I sc) technique in the presence of anti-calcyclin antibodies or rabbit IgG. The results are illustrated in Fig. 8. Anti-calcyclin antibodies introduced into the cells by the freeze/thaw procedure (Fig.8 A) blunted the long-term AVP-induced increase inI sc. The permeabilization procedure per se did not alter the effect of AVP on I sc. When the digitonin procedure was used (Fig. 8 B), the same effect was observed, which was not reproduced by nonspecific rabbit IgG. In addition, experiments showed that the short-term effect of AVP on I sc was not blocked by anti-calcyclin antibodies or by rabbit IgG. The short-term effects of AVP on renal ion and water transport have been widely documented (5Canessa C.M. Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F454-F461PubMed Google Scholar, 6Reif M.C.

By contrast, very limited information is available on the long-term effects of this hormone. In addition to the long-term effects of AVP on water transport associated with an increase in AQP2 synthesis (12Yasui M. Zelenin S.M. Celsi G. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F443-F450PubMed Google Scholar, 26Christensen B.M. Marples D. Jensen U.B. Frokiaer J. Sheikh-Hamad D. Knepper M. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F285-F297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have recently shown that AVP exerts a delayed stimulation of sodium and chloride transport in collecting duct cells (13Djelidi S. Fay M. Cluzeaud F. Escoubet B. Eugene E. Capurro C. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32919-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Djelidi S. Fay M. Cluzeaud F. Thomas-Soumarmon A. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Blot-Chabaud M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This effect depends on transcription of several transporters of sodium and chloride, in particular ENaC, Na-K-ATPase, and CFTR. As a matter of fact, the cAMP and intracellular Ca2+ pathways have been shown to exert transcriptional effects in different systems, in addition to their short-term actions as second messenger on several cell functions. In particular, the cAMP- or intracellular Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of nuclear proteins such as the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and the cAMP-responsive element modulator is responsible for transcriptional effects via cAMP- or Ca2+-responsive elements present in the promoter of genes (27Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we have searched for proteins induced by 1 h of AVP treatment in a rat cortical collecting duct cell line. Using the subtractive hybridization technique, we have identified calcyclin as an early AVP response gene, and we have shown that AVP increased both the level of mRNA encoding calcyclin and calcyclin expression in RCCD1 cells. Altogether, these results and those reported by Robert-Nicoud et al. (16Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D.

A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) obtained by SAGE analysis of AVP-induced genes show that, in addition to the previously described effects on AQP2, ENaC, Na-K-ATPase, and CFTR, the long-term functional response to vasopressin depends on transcription and translation of numerous proteins in the cortical collecting duct. Calcyclin is a 10.5-kDa protein that belongs to the family of calcium-binding proteins (28Ferrari S. Calabretta B. deRiel J.K. Battini R. Ghezzo F. Lauret E. Griffin C. Emanuel B.S. Gurrieri F.

Filipek A. Heimann P. Kaczmarek L. Kaminska B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Calcium-binding proteins are divided into two groups: the first group is constituted by annexins, and the second group by EF-hand proteins such as calmodulin. Calcyclin belongs to this second group. It was first identified as a cell cycle-dependent protein highly induced by growth conditions (28Ferrari S. Calabretta B. deRiel J.K. Battini R. Ghezzo F. Lauret E. Griffin C. Emanuel B.S. Gurrieri F. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8325-8332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its precise role remains unknown. Different studies have shown that calcyclin is expressed only in fibroblasts and epithelial cells and that it can associate with other proteins, in particular annexins (annexin-2, -6, and -11) (32Sudo T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6351-6357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Mizutani A. Usuda N. Tokumitsu H. Minami H. Yasui K. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13498-13504Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Calcyclin, as annexins, may be involved in exocytosis phenomena. In this way, it has been shown in numerous studies that modulation of intracellular calcium plays an important role in the regulation of exocytosis and that calcium-binding proteins can act as transducing proteins in coupling stimulus to exocytosis. It has also been shown that, in vitro, calcyclin can bind actin-binding proteins such as caldesmon, tropomyosin, and calponin (34Mani R.S. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6658-6663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Golitsina N.L. Kordowska J. Wang C.L. Lehrer S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data obtained by in situ hybridization show that calcyclin was localized mainly in the collecting duct cells in the kidney, with additional staining in the glomerulus and in the epithelium lining the papilla. In a previous study, Lewington et al. (37Lewington A.J. Padanilam B.J. Hammerman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F380-F385PubMed Google Scholar) showed that calcyclin is present in glomeruli and distal tubules. Our results are compatible with those data. At the cellular level, it has been suggested that calcyclin could be localized in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cells under basal conditions and that it could be targeted to two different membranous compartments, the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane, in response to an increase in intracellular calcium (38Stradal T.B. Gimona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31593-31596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our experiments performed in RCCD1 and m-IMCD3 cells incubated under basal conditions (Figs. 2 and 3), calcyclin was localized in the cytoplasmic compartment. Further studies will be necessary to examine whether AVP treatment or modifications of the intracellular Ca2+concentration modify this localization. Only a few studies concerning the hormonal regulation of calcyclin have been reported. The promoter of calcyclin has been reported to contain a serum-responsive element (39Ghezzo F. Lauret E. Ferrari S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4758-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calcyclin is generally considered to be a growth-regulated gene (28Ferrari S. Calabretta B. deRiel J.K. Battini R. Ghezzo F. Lauret E. Griffin C. Emanuel B.S. Gurrieri F. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8325-8332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat kidney, it has been shown that calcyclin is induced after ischemic injury (37Lewington A.J. Padanilam B.J. Hammerman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F380-F385PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that AVP increased the amount of mRNA encoding calcyclin in RCCD1 cells, in m-IMCD3 cells, and in Brattleboro rat kidney. In addition, we have shown that calcyclin protein expression was increased in RCCD1 cells after 4 h of treatment with 10−8m AVP. Interestingly, the time course of the phenomenon appears to be different in the two cell lines and in the rat kidney. In RCCD1 cells derived from the cortical collecting duct, as in m-IMCD3 cells derived from the inner medullary collecting duct, calcyclin mRNA was rapidly and transiently increased. A significant effect was observed as soon as 0.5–1 h after AVP treatment (Figs. 4 and 5). This result is in accordance with the fact that calcyclin mRNA was evidenced as an AVP-induced gene in RCCD1 cells by subtractive hybridization after 1 h of AVP treatment. The time course shows that the maximal increase was observed after 4–7.5 h of treatment and then declined at 24 h. After 24 h of treatment with AVP, the amount of mRNA encoding calcyclin was not different between control and AVP-treated cells. In contrast, the results obtained with Brattleboro rat whole kidneys showed no increase in calcyclin mRNA 3 h after injection of AVP, but a clear effect after 4 days of AVP treatment (Fig. 7). In the same way, note that AQP2 mRNA was not significantly increased after 3 h of AVP treatment, but largely increased after 4 days. The differences observed in the time course and in the magnitude of the AVP effect between cell models and Brattleboro rat kidneys might be related to differences between in vitro and in vivomodels. The complexity of animal models, the delay in the response to the hormone when administrated intramuscularly, and the presence of several complementary hormonal regulatory systems might explain a delayed effect on calcyclin and AQP2 mRNA expression in the rat. In this way, it should be noted that hormonal effects on the amount of mRNA encoding newly synthesized proteins are often delayed when studied in animal models rather than in cell lines. The precise role of calcyclin in epithelial cells is unknown. In a previous work (20Okazaki K. Niki I. Iino S. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6149-6152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calcyclin has been described to be involved in the Ca2+-dependent secretion of insulin in pancreatic cells. Interestingly, it was shown that introduction into pancreatic beta-cells of anti-calcyclin antibodies by permeabilizing the plasma membrane prevented insulin secretion, a result that clearly defined calcyclin as a key protein in the exocytosis process. In our study, introduction of anti-calcyclin antibodies into permeabilized RCCD1 cells supported a specific role of calcyclin in the long-term regulation of ion transport (Fig. 8). Indeed, anti-calcyclin antibodies prevented the AVP-induced increase inI sc observed after 7.5 h of treatment, whereas it was without effect on the short-term effect of the hormone (15 min). The localization of calcyclin in the cytoplasmic compartment of RCCD1 cells and the possibility that it could move to the nucleus upon certain stimuli as described in other studies (38Stradal T.B. Gimona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31593-31596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggest different hypotheses concerning its role. In the first hypothesis, calcyclin could be implicated in the process leading to the transcription of other genes (transcriptional role). In this way, by binding calcium, calcyclin could play a role in the Ca2+-induced activation of Ca2+-responsive elements through nuclear kinases such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (40Yordy J.S. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6503-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Alternatively, or additively, the established interaction of calcyclin with the calcium signaling pathways suggests that calcyclin could be involved in the delivery of newly synthesized proteins (due to the transcriptional effect of AVP) to the apical and/or the basolateral membrane of the cells (exocytotic role) (41Hutton J.C. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further experiments will be necessary to test these hypotheses. In conclusion, we have identified calcyclin as a new AVP-induced gene in the collecting duct. In addition, our experiments suggest that calcyclin could play an important role in the long-term response of the hormone in transepithelial ion transport."

According to the present model, the expression level of any αβ complex is regulated by the availability of the specific α subunit, whereas β1 subunit is constantly present in a large excess. The expression of several heterodimers containing the αVsubunit seems to be regulated by an identical mechanism. The fact that many cells express αVβ1 heterodimer, and that this fibronectin/vitronectin receptor may be selectively regulated, compromises the present model of the regulation of β1 and αV integrins. We have tried to solve this problem by assuming that distinct αβ heterodimers are formed with different tendency. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed WM-266-4 melanoma cells transfected with a cDNA construct coding for an intracellular single-chain anti-αV integrin antibody. We could see 70–80% reduction in the cell surface expression of αV subunit. However, the only one of the αVintegrins reduced on the cell surface was αVβ1. This suggests that the cell surface expression level of αVβ1 is dependent on the number of αV subunits available after the formation of other αV-containing heterodimers. Thus, there seems to be a hierarchy in the complex formation between αV and its different β-partners. These observations explain how αVβ1 can be specifically regulated without concomitant changes in the expression of other αV or β1 integrins.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium matrix metalloproteinase monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline fetal calf serum endoplasmic reticulum variable heavy chain variable light chain The members of the integrin family that form receptors for various extracellular matrix proteins can be divided into two major subgroups according to the subunits present in the receptors. Integrin β1 can form a complex with 12 different α subunits. The β1-containing heterodimers are receptors for collagens, laminins, tenascins, and fibronectin. The other subset, the αV integrins, are fibronectin and vitronectin receptors, some of which also have the ability to bind various other matrix and plasma proteins. In many cells the two promiscuous subunits, αV and β1, can form a heterodimer with each other. αVβ1 was originally described as a fibronectin or vitronectin receptor (1Bodary S.C. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5938-5941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vogel B.E. Tarone G. Giancotti F.G. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5934-5937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may also have a capacity for binding to osteopontin and to the latent form of transforming growth factor-β (3Hu D.D.

Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Some viruses, including parechovirus 1, adenovirus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus, use αVβ1 as their cellular receptor (5Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Takada Y. Fernandez N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5856-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Jackson T. Mould A.P. Sheppard D. King A.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Li E. Brown S.L. Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5405-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of αVβ1 is mostly unknown because of the lack of a specific antibody against αVβ1 complex. For the same reason the function of αVβ1 integrin in many human cell types is unknown, or the published information is based on cell transfections or on the use of combinations of function blocking antibodies against different αV and β1integrins. In αV-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, αVβ1 integrin has been found to function as a fibronectin receptor while not supporting cell migration on fibronectin (8Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in squamous carcinoma cells derived from head and neck tumors, αVβ1 integrin contributes to migration on fibronectin (9Koivisto L. Grenman R. Heino J. Larjava H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that αVβ1 integrin promotes the migration of oligodendrocyte precursors on composite extracellular matrix containing laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin (10Milner R. Edwards G. Streuli C. Ffrench-Constant C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7240-7252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In avian neural crest cells, αVβ1 participates in adhesion to vitronectin, whereas it may have a less important role in cell migration (11Delannet M. Martin F. Bossy B. Cheresh D.A. Reichardt L.F. Duband J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of αVβ1 as a vitronectin receptor has been emphasized in studies on smooth muscle cells, suggesting that vitronectin-mediated contractility of smooth muscle is mediated by αVβ1 integrin (12Dahm L.M. Bowers C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar). There is some evidence that the cell surface level of αVβ1 integrin can be specifically regulated, for example, during development (13Milner R. Ffrench-Constant C. Development. 1994; 120: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selective regulation of the number of αVβ1 integrins on the cell surface cannot be explained simply by assuming that the expression of αV or β1 genes or the synthesis rate of the corresponding proteins is changed. That would lead to concomitant changes in the numbers of all αV or β1integrins. The regulation of both αV and β1integrins has been studied in detail, and their regulation seems to be based on the same principle; the promiscuous subunit (β1or αV) is synthesized in an excess, and the formation of any αβ heterodimer is dependent on the availability of the other subunit (14Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sheppard D. Cohen D.S. Wang A. Busk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17409-17414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell surface copy number of, for example, α1β1 and αVβ3 integrin is dependent on the synthesis rate of α1 and β3 subunits, respectively. The presence of αVβ1 heterodimers challenges this model. To address this controversy, we hypothesized that there is a hierarchy in the formation of distinct αβ heterodimers and that αVβ1 complex is formed only in the presence of sufficient excesses of αVand β1 subunits in relation to their other partners. To test this hypothesis, we used a previously constructed cDNA coding for an intracellular, single-chain anti-αV antibody and analyzed stably transfected WM-266-4 melanoma cell clones. The antibody could significantly reduce the expression level of αVsubunit and selectively diminish the cell surface expression of αVβ1 integrin. However, it could not affect the cell surface expression of another prominent αVintegrin, namely αVβ3. Thus, the experimental data support our theory, explaining the mechanism of selective regulation of αVβ1 integrin expression on cell surface. Melanoma cell line WM-266-4 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)1 supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Anti-αVintegrin intracellular single-chain antibody was constructed as described previously (16Marasco W.A. Bagley J. Zani C. Posner M. Cavacini L. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Clin.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells of hybridoma line L230 expressing anti-αV integrin monoclonal antibody (obtained from the ATCC) by using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotex Laboratories, Inc.). This RNA was used to prepare cDNA by using primers B (TGM GGA GAC GGT GAC CRW GGT CCC T) and D (ATT TGC GGC CGC TAC AGT TGG TGC AGC ACT). The primer sequences were from Richardson et al.(18Richardson J.H. Sodroski J.G. Waldmann T.A. Marasco W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3137-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL) were amplified from the cDNA by PCR using primers A (TTT AAG CTT ACC ATG GAA AGG CAC TGG ATC) and B or C (GAG CTC GTG CTC ACM CAR WCT CCA) and D. A DNA segment coding for the interchain linker was amplified from an anti-tat 3 gene (a gift from Wayne A. Marasco, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston) by PCR using primers E (GGG ACC TGC GTC ACC GTC TCC TCA) and F (TGG AGA CTG GGT GAG CAC GAG CTC AGA TCC). The single-chain antibody gene was assembled from the VH, VL, and interchain linker fragments by overlap extension (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D., Ho, S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), followed by PCR amplification with primers A and I (TTT TCT AGA TTA TTA CAG CTC GTC CTT TTC GCT TAC AGT TGG TGC AGC ATC). The complete sequence of the assembled intracellular single-chain anti-αV antibody gene was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar). The construct was digested withHindIII and XbaI and ligated into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which carries the neomycin resistance gene. Transfections were performed by electroporation. Neomycin analogue G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. G418-resistant cell clones were selected for 2–3 weeks, isolated, and analyzed for their expression of αVintegrin. Control cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid only. Transfected cells were cultured in 10% FCS/DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Expression of the mRNA coded by the intracellular antibody construct in transfected cells was confirmed by RT-PCR of the total RNA isolated from both anti-αV plasmid and vector control cells. RT-PCR was performed by the GeneAmp® RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using primers A and D.Tm was 68 °C. Coating of 96-well immunoplates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) was done by exposure to 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 22 μg/ml type XVII collagen (human recombinant COL 15 domain of type XVII collagen from Dr. Kaisa Tasanen, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland) (22Tasanen K.

Before coating, COL 15 was denatured for 20 min at 56 °C. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.1%) was used to measure the nonspecific binding or spreading. Residual protein absorption sites in all wells were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Confluent cell cultures were detached by using 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, rinsed in DMEM containing 10% FCS, and then washed twice with DMEM.

Nonadherent cells were removed by rinsing the wells with medium; adherent cells were fixed with 8% formalin and 10% sucrose and then washed with distilled water. A spread cell was characterized as one having a clearly visible ring of cytoplasm around the nucleus. The portion of spread cells was expressed as percentage of the number of adherent cells. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS for 24 h. The total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and mRNA levels of specific genes were measured by Northern blot hybridization. RNAs were separated in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad), and hybridized with 32P-labeled (Amersham Biosciences) cDNA probes.

[32P]cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were grown to early confluence, detached with trypsin-EDTA, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and then incubated with PBS containing 1% FCS for 30 min at 4 °C.

For labeling, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse (1:20 dilution), rabbit anti-rat (1:100 dilution), or swine anti-rabbit (1:20 dilution) IgG coupled to fluorescein (all from DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in the same buffer. Relative amounts of cell surface integrins were determined by comparison of fluorescent emission intensity data as collected using a FACScan apparatus (BD PharMingen). Control samples were prepared by treating cells without primary antibodies. Cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) for 16 h in methionine-free minimum essential medium. Cell monolayers were rinsed on ice with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then detached by scraping. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min. Cells were solubilized in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 100 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) on ice with occasional vortexing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 1 × 104 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity in cell lysates was counted, and equal amounts of radioactivity was used in each sample. Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) were added to the supernatants, which were then precleaned by incubation with 50 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with αV integrin or β1 integrin antibody (L230 or R-322, correspondingly) for 12 h at 4 °C. After incubation with secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse, DAKO), immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein A-Sepharose and washing the beads four times with 25 mm Tris-buffered isotonic saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and twice with 0.5m NaCl and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing 6% polyacrylamide gels under reducing (immunoprecipitation with anti-β1) or nonreducing (immunoprecipitation with anti-αV) conditions, followed by autoradiography. In pulse-chase assays, cells were metabolically labeled for 1 h and harvested 0, 2, 4, and 8 h after pulse. To examine the amount of αVβ1 heterodimer, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-β1 (R-322) (14Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and the gel was transferred to a nylon membrane (HybondTM ECLTM, AmershamBiosciences). Nonspecific adsorption sites were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween by incubating the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. A saturating concentration (1:100) of polyclonal αV integrin antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) was added to the blocking solution. The membrane was rinsed twice, washed twice for 15 min, and washed three times for 5 min. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody was diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween containing 5% milk (1:100), and the membrane was incubated for 1 h. Washing was performed as above. β1 integrin-linked αV integrin was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Coating of 24-well immunoplates (MaxiSorp) was done by exposing each well to 0.3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 27.0 μg/ml (5 μg/cm2) of fibrinogen, fibronectin (human plasma fibronectin, Chemicon), or COL 15 domain of type XVII collagen (22Tasanen K.

Residual protein absorption sites in all wells were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. The trypsinized cells were rinsed with DMEM plus 10% FCS or 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor and washed twice and resuspended in DMEM or Opti-MEM® (Invitrogen, Inc.). Steel cylinders were placed in each well, and cells were added (2 × 104cells/well). After 3 h the cylinders were removed, 1 ml of either DMEM or Opti-MEM® was added, and cells were allowed to migrate for 3 days. Cells were fixed with 10% sucrose and 8% formalin in PBS and stained with 0.1% crystal violet and 0.2 mboric acid. Migration was determined by measuring the increase of the cell colony area. Cell culture inserts (BD PharMingen) contained polyethylene terephthalate membranes of 8 μm pore size. Membranes were coated with human plasma fibronectin (Chemicon), type I collagen gel (Cellon S.A.), or Matrigel® (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). In fibronectin invasion assays, a concentration of 20 μg/ml was used, and the total volume was 80 μl/insert. Inserts were allowed to air-dry in a cell culture hood overnight. In Matrigel® and type I collagen invasion assays, 30 μg of Matrigel® and 35 μl of Cellon gel, respectively, were used for each insert. Inserts were used with 24-well cell culture plates (Costar). Cells from cultures in early confluence were trypsinized, and one volume of 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor or 10% FCS/DMEM was added to inhibit trypsin activity. Cells were then washed twice in DMEM, resuspended in 0.1% BSA/DMEM, and added to inserts (1 × 105 cells in 200 μl). 700 μl of 10% FCS in DMEM was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. Cells were allowed to invade at 37 °C for 8–9 h through fibronectin and 2 days through Cellon gel and Matrigel®. Upper chamber was wiped clean with a swab, and the invaded cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet and 0.2 m boric acid. Invaded cells on the lower side of the membrane were counted under a light microscope with a 10× lens. Three representative fields were counted from each insert. The result was reported as the number of invaded cells in three fields. Sixteen stable cell clones transfected with a cDNA construct coding for an intracellular anti-αV antibody (Fig.1 A) and 6 vector control cell clones were tested for expression levels of αV integrin. In anti-αV cDNA-transfected clones, the cell surface expression level of αV was reduced up to 80% when compared with vector control clones (Fig. 1 B). Three anti-αV cDNA-transfected cell clones (a3, a11, and a15) and three vector control clones (v3, v4, and v5) were selected for further experiments. In these clones the presence of mRNA derived from intracellular antibody construct was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig.1 C). Surprisingly, there were no significant decreases in the expression levels of β3 or β5 integrins (Fig. 2 A). A third partner of αV subunit, β6, was not detected on these cells (Fig. 2 A). To confirm the unreduced expression level of αVβ3, metabolically labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-β3 antibody. The results did not indicate a decrease in the number of β3-connected, mature αV integrin subunits in anti-αV-expressing cell clones (Fig.3 A). Immunoprecipitations from anti-αV-expressing cell clones had an extra band with an approximated molecular size of 140 kDa, corresponding to the precursor form of αV integrin described in previous papers (15Sheppard D. Cohen D.S. Wang A. Busk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17409-17414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Koistinen P. Pulli T. Uitto V.J. Nissinen L. Hyypiä T. Heino J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The higher molecular mass form represents an integrin with a complex-type N-linked oligosaccharide, whereas the lighter precursor form represents an integrin that is still inside the endoplasmic reticulum with high mannose-type oligosaccharides (14Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the maturation process was studied by pulse-chase experiments followed by immunoprecipitations with anti-αV antibody. Maturation occurred in 8 h in vector control clones (data not shown) in accordance with our previous studies with Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (19Koistinen P. Pulli T. Uitto V.J. Nissinen L. Hyypiä T. Heino J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of the larger intracellular pool of precursor αV may indicate a decelerated maturation process of the αV integrins because of the intracellular antibodies.Figure 2Cell surface expression of αV and αV-related β subunits of three selected anti-αV- (●) and vector-transfected (○) cell clones.

Cell lysates of selected WM-266-4 cell clones were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-β1integrin antibody. The precipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL membrane. The membrane was then incubated with monoclonal anti-αV antibody and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The β1-linked αV integrin was visualized by ECL reaction. C, the suggested model for the hierarchy in αV integrin heterodimer formation in WM-266-4 melanoma cells. When the amount of αV integrin, which is not bound to β subunit (αV(free)), exceeds the combined amount of β3 and β5 integrins in ER, αVβ1 heterodimer can be seen on the cell surface. When the amount of αV(free) is reduced to the level of combined amount of β3 and β5integrins in the ER, αVβ1 integrin cannot be seen on the cell surface because all the αV(free) is bound to β3 and β5 integrins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The diminished cell surface expression of the αV subunit was not accompanied by a similar reduction of the β3 subunit, leading us to the hypothesis that the expression of αVβ1 heterodimer must be affected. In the absence of a specific antibody for αVβ1, we first immunoprecipitated the total cell lysate with an anti-β1 antibody and then Western-blotted the immunoprecipitates with anti-αVintegrin antibody. Nearly all β1-bound αVintegrin was in its precursor form in anti-αVantibody-transfected cell clones, whereas in vector control clones β1-associated αV was in the mature form only (Fig. 3 B). Thus, our data indicate that, when the amount of αV subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum is reduced, very little αVβ1 ends up on the cell surface. Importantly, we have also tested the mechanism of overexpression of an αV-associated β subunit, β6 (9Koivisto L. Grenman R. Heino J. Larjava H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the αVβ1-related binding to fibronectin was dramatically reduced in a β6-transfected cell clone derived from cells in which αVβ1 was a major fibronectin receptor (9Koivisto L. Grenman R. Heino J. Larjava H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The obvious hierarchy in the formation of different αV-containing heterodimers suggests that the amount of αVβ1 integrin can be regulated selectively and independently of other integrin heterodimers. In simplified terms, this model proposes that the number of αVβ3 and αVβ5heterodimers is regulated at the level of the β3 and β5 genes, respectively, but the activity of the αV gene dictates the number of αVβ1 heterodimers (Fig. 3 C). Selective reduction of αVβ1 levels in experimental clones allowed direct observations about its functions to be made. To control for integrin-mediated characteristics, expression levels of other integrins in the experimental clones were tested (Fig.4). In one of the antibody-expressing clones (a3), the expression of β1 integrin was higher than in any other clone. This can be attributed to simultaneously higher expression of collagen-binding integrins α1 and α2. The expression of α5, another fibronectin-binding integrin, was slightly reduced in one of the clones when compared with vector control clones. One vector control clone (v4) did not have any α4 integrin on its surface. Platelet integrin αIIb was not detected on the cell surface of any of the clones. The expression levels of β3 and β5 subunits were equal in all cell clones. Because of small variations in the levels of α4 and α5 integrins, only clones that had the same numbers of these receptors were selected and tested for adhesion. On fibronectin, cell spreading of the selected anti-αV and vector control clones was equal (Fig. 5 A). The spreading of both clones could be reduced but not completely prevented when the fibronectin receptors β3, α4, and α5 were blocked by monoclonal antibodies. Treatment with antibodies revealed differences in the spreading behavior of the anti-αV-expressing and vector control cells; in the presence of antibodies, their average spreading was 50 and 30%, respectively. The number of attached cells within each well was counted with similar results (in the presence of antibodies: 75 versus 55%) (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that αVβ1 integrin can contribute to adhesion and spreading on fibronectin but does so preferentially in the absence of other fibronectin receptors. On vitronectin cell adhesion and spreading was much slower than on fibronectin. No αVβ1-related differences in spreading behavior were observed for any of the clones when they were plated on vitronectin. Recently, we have suggested that in keratinocytes αVβ1 contributes to cell spreading on type XVII collagen (COL 15 domain) (29Nykvist P. Tasanen K. Viitasalo T. Käpylä J. Jokinen J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38673-38679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, we did not find any αVβ1-dependent differences in adhesion or spreading of WM-266-4 melanoma cells on COL 15 domain (data not shown). Likewise, similar results were obtained for spreading and adhesion assays on fibrinogen (data not shown). Fibrinogen has previously been reported to function as a ligand for RGD-binding integrins (30Gailit J. Clark R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 102-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We also tested whether the lack of αVβ1integrin has an influence on WM-266-4 melanoma cell migration. Three antibody-transfected and three vector control clones were allowed to migrate on fibronectin for 3 days in serum-free DMEM. Two independent experiments were performed, each of which comprised two or three parallel wells of each clone (Fig. 5 C). Lateral migration was measured as an increase in the surface area covered by the cells. The area covered by the vector control clones increased on average 75–115% more when compared with anti-αV-transfected clones (p < 0.0001; two-way analysis of variance). These results indicate that αVβ1 integrin participates in the lateral migration of WM-266-4 cells on fibronectin. Importantly, the small variation in the expression levels of α4 and α5 integrins did not play a role in these experiments. Similar to adhesion and spreading assays, there were no αVβ1-related differences in lateral migration on COL 15 domain of type XVII collagen or fibrinogen (data not shown). Our finding that αVβ1 integrin is a low affinity fibronectin receptor is in accordance with the previous data (8Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells may try to compensate for this low affinity with a high expression level. Spreading and adhesion on fibronectin were approximately the same in anti-αV antibody-expressing and control clones. This indicates that α4β1, α5β1, and αVβ3are mainly responsible for spreading and adhesion on fibronectin. When these receptors were blocked, we could see the influence of αVβ1 integrin. Moreover, the depletion of αVβ1 integrin could markedly reduce the lateral migration of WM-266-4 cells. Previously it has been shown that αVβ1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary-B2 cells that lack α5 integrin are unable to migrate on fibronectin (8Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that αVβ1 integrin is involved in cell migration on fibronectin, but, to migrate, the cells need another fibronectin-binding integrin such as α4β1or α5β1. The low affinity/high expression of αVβ1 integrin may be an advantage for cancer cells in such a dynamic process as cell migration, where continuous formation and dissolution of adhesion sites plays a major role. In addition to fibronectin, αVβ1 integrin has been suggested to show some binding to vitronectin. However, in our experiments with melanoma cells, we found that cell spreading on vitronectin was not affected by αVβ1integrin. The main receptor responsible for spreading on vitronectin seemed to be αVβ3 integrin. However, on vitronectin αVβ3 integrin did not have an effect on primary adhesion, whereas blocking of αVβ5 from αVβ1-depleted cells clearly reduced the number of adherent cells (data not shown). These results stress the diversity of integrin functions on different substrates. There are a number of studies in which connections between the expression of specific integrin receptors and the production of MMPs have been proposed (31Gouon V. Tucker G.C. Kraus-Berthier L. Atassi G. Kieffer N. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Riikonen T. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Broberg A. Kähäri V.M. Heino J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In the published papers, αVβ1 integrin has not been studied. We made several invasion assays with type I collagen gels, the basement membrane analog Matrigel®, and fibronectin, but no αVβ1-dependent differences were observed. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 were not αVβ1-dependent. Based on these results, αVβ1 does not play a major role in the invasion process or in the expression of metalloproteinases. To conclude, previous studies have shown that αVβ1 might be selectively regulated during development (35Milner R. Relvas J.B. Fawcett J. Ffrench-Constant C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that it is an important fibronectin receptor that is abundant on some cancer cells. Furthermore, we propose a molecular mechanism that explains the selective regulation of αVβ1expression. We thank Drs. T. Hyypiä, W. A. Marasco, and T. Pulli for the cDNAs; J.

Recent studies suggest that nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation has an important role in bone resorption. We assessed whether the N-terminal fragment of PTHrP, and its C-terminal region, unrelated to PTH, can activate NF-κB, and its relationship with IL-6 gene induction in different rat and human osteoblastic cell preparations. Here we present molecular data demonstrating that both PTHrP (1–36) and PTHrP (107–139) activate NF-κB, leading to an increase in IL-6 mRNA, in these cells. Using anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies, we detected the presence of both proteins in the activated NF-κB complex. This effect induced by either the N- or C-terminal PTHrP domain in osteoblastic cells appears to occur by different intracellular mechanisms, involving protein kinase A or intracellular Ca2+/protein kinase C activation, respectively. However, the effect of each peptide alone did not increase further when added together. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that the C-terminal domain of PTHrP, in a manner similar to its N-terminal fragment, might stimulate bone resorption. These studies also provide further insights into the putative role of PTHrP as a modulator of bone remodeling.

A variety of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the N-terminal PTH-like region of PTHrP appears to affect osteoblastic function mainly through cAMP activation (7Partridge N.C. Bloch S.R.

Thus, this cytokine appears to be an important regulator of bone remodeling. Studies using IL-6 promoter fragments transfected into various types of osteoblastic cells indicate that the intracellular mechanisms regulating IL-6 expression in these cells appear to be complex (24Franchimont N.

As in other cell types, IL-6 up-regulation by a variety of osteolytic cytokines in osteoblasts has been shown to depend at least in part on the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity (22Kurokouchi K.

NF-κB is a ubiquitous family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of various genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses as well as cell proliferation and/or apoptosis (27Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). The most common form of NF-κB consists of a heterodimer of one p50 subunit and one p65 subunit, which resides in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells bound to its inhibitor IκB. Cell stimulation with a variety of agents, including cytokines, induces IκB phosphorylation and degradation, allowing active NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to DNA and regulates gene expression. NF-κB activation has an essential role in osteoclastic differentiation and function, and it might be involved in the pathogenesis of the increased osteoclastogenesis associated with estrogen deficiency and inflammation-related bone loss (28Franzoso G.

There is also recent evidence that NF-κB activation might have a regulatory role in osteoblasts because bone-resorptive agents, such as tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and PTH, induce NF-κB activation in these cells (22Kurokouchi K.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We and other investigators have demonstrated that the N-terminal PTH-like region of PTHrP stimulates IL-6 expression in human osteoblastic (hOB) cells and rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma UMR 106 cells (16De Miguel F.

Bijvoet O.L.M. Aarden L.A. Papapoulos S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). PTHrP (107–139) was also found to stimulate IL-6 in both cell types; but in contrast to N-terminal PTHrP, this effect of the C-terminal PTHrP appears to depend on PKC activation (16De Miguel F. Martı́nez-Fernández P. Guillén C. Valı́n A Rodrigo A. Martı́nez M.E. Esbrit P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar, 17Valı́n A. Guillén C. Esbrit P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further assessed the putative intracellular mechanisms involved in IL-6 induction by both PTHrP domains in osteoblasts. We examined whether each PTHrP domain can induce NF-κB activity and whether this activation is associated with an increased IL-6 expression in different osteoblastic cell types. Human PTHrP (1–36) and human PTHrP (38–64) were kindly supplied by Dr. A. F. Stewart (Division of Endocrinology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). Human PTHrP (107–139), ionomycin, dexamethasone, nifedipine, and parthenolide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Calphostin C, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, MG-132, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). RpcAMPS was from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). Poly(dI-dC) was from Amersham Biosciences. The double-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′, containing consensus sequences specific for NF-κB and Sp1, respectively, were supplied by Promega (Madison, WI) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. T4 polymerase was supplied by Promega. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from AmershamBiosciences. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for p50 (sc-1190X), p65 (sc-372X), and IκB-α (sc-371) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Verapamil was from Knoll (Madrid, Spain). UMR 106 cells (ATCC CRL 1661) and hOB cells MG-63 (ATCC CRL 1427) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, as described (14Valı́n A., De Miguel F. Garcı́a-Ocaña A. Esbrit P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 65: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16De Miguel F. Martı́nez-Fernández P. Guillén C. Valı́n A Rodrigo A. Martı́nez M.E. Esbrit P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 796-803PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 90% confluence were FBS depleted for 48 h before agonist stimulation for various time periods. hOB cells were isolated from trabecular bone explants obtained from hip or knee samples discarded at the time of surgery on osteoarthritic patients, as described previously (13Martı́nez M.E. Garcı́a-Ocaña A. Sánchez M. Del Campo M.T. Valı́n A. Sánchez-Cabezudo M.J. Esbrit P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The patients (three women and one man, ages 63–79 years) had no evidence of metabolic bone disorders. Subcultured cells at the first passage from the bone fragments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% FBS and antibiotics were grown to confluence, and they display features of functional osteoblasts (13Martı́nez M.E. Garcı́a-Ocaña A. Sánchez M. Del Campo M.T. Valı́n A. Sánchez-Cabezudo M.J. Esbrit P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These cells were preincubated for 48 h in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter of glucose) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and antibiotics (differentiation medium), and then the test agents were added for various time periods. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a commercially available procedure (NE-PER®, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer's instructions. This procedure is based on the method of Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with 50 μl of a hypotonic buffer for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended and incubated in a hypertonic buffer for 40 min. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min and kept at −20 °C until assay. All centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was 5′-end-labeled with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polymerase. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 200,000 dpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 μg poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide and 0.25× TBE gels. Gels were then dried and exposed to radiosensitive film. As controls for specificity of the binding reaction, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 100-fold excess of either unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide or another oligonucleotide having an Sp1 binding site, for 20 min at 4 °C before addition of the labeled probe. In some experiments, nuclear extracts from hOB cells were preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of the anti-p50 antibody. Nuclear (10 μg of protein) and cytosolic (20 μg of protein) extracts were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% defatted milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated overnight with either the anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies referred to above, at a 1:2,000 dilution (nuclear extracts) or with the antibody to the IκB-α isoform at a 1:500 dilution (cytosolic extracts). After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The corresponding fluorogram bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning (ImageQuant, AmershamBiosciences). MG-63 cells grown on multiwell chambers (Labtek; Nunc, Naperville, IL) were stimulated with the agonists for 10 min in FBS-depleted medium. Then they were fixed with 64% isopropyl alcohol and 15% polyoxyethylene (Cell-fixx™, Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After treatment with 10% bovine serum in PBS for 30 min for blocking, the anti-p65 antibody referred to above was added at a 1:500 dilution in the blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. Then, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) at a 1:200 dilution in blocking solution was added for 30 min. After extensive washing, cells were mounted in 70% glycerol in PBS, and immunofluorescence analysis was then performed with a Leica DM-IRB confocal microscope. Cell total RNA was isolated using guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (Tri-Reagent©, MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Semiquantitative reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out with the Access RT-PCR System (Promega), as described (16De Miguel F. Martı́nez-Fernández P. Guillén C.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar); 200 ng of total RNA was incubated in a 10-μl reaction mixture for 45 min at 48 °C followed by 32 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 58–60 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C, with a final extension of 7 min at 68 °C, using specific primers for rat or human IL-6. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Values obtained after densitometric scanning of the IL-6 PCR product were normalized against those of the corresponding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) PCR product (a constitutive control) (16De Miguel F.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The response of IL-6 mRNA to the PTHrP domains was analyzed by Northern blot in MG-63 cells, which express both IL-6 and the type 1 PTH/PTHrP receptor (32Bilbe G. Roberts E. Birch M. Evans D.B. Bone. 1996; 19: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15–20 μg) was size fractionated on 1% agarose gel containing 1.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C for 3 h and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 106 dpm/ml of a32P-labeled human IL-6 cDNA probe. This probe was synthesized by RT-PCR using human IL-6 primers, as described above, and it was then purified by QIAquick silica gel columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Filters were subsequently washed in 2× SSPE, 0.3% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min, followed by 1× SSPE, 0.3% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min. Filters were then exposed on Kodak X-Omat film at −20 °C, and bands were quantified by densitometric scanning. The filters were stained with ethidium bromide to visualize 18 S and 28 S RNA as RNA loading controls. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by either ttest or analysis of variance, when appropriate. We first examined the putative role of NF-κB activation on the induction of IL-6 gene expression by N- and C-terminal PTHrP in UMR 106 cells. We found that each peptide, at 100 nm, induced an increase of IL-6 mRNA (assessed by RT-PCR) within 1 h, and this effect was abolished by 25 μm pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and 1 μm dexamethasone, two NF-κB inhibitors (27Ghosh S.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G1290-G1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in these cells (Fig. 1). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were subsequently isolated from UMR 106 cells to assess NF-κB activation after PTHrP stimulation. We found that PTHrP (107–139), in a manner similar to PTHrP (1–36), at 100 nm, stimulated NF-κB·DNA binding in these nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A). This was associated with a rapid (observed at 5 min) and transient disappearance of IκB-α in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig.3). Pretreatment with parthenolide or MG-132, at 10 μm, which prevent IκB degradation by inhibiting IκB phosphorylation or proteasome activity, respectively, and thereby NF-κB activation (27Ghosh S.

FBS-depleted cells were stimulated with each PTHrP peptide, at 100 nm, for different time periods. Nuclear extracts were obtained, and cell total RNA was isolated, after this stimulation. A, NF-κB activity in the nuclear extracts was measured by EMSA; B, RT-PCR was performed with total RNA and IL-6-specific primers, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GAPDH mRNA is shown as a constitutive control.

FBS-depleted cells were stimulated with each PTHrP peptide, at 10 nm, for different time periods. Cytosolic extracts were then obtained, and they were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using a specific anti-IκB-α antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preincubation with either parthenolide or MG-132, at 10 μm, for 1 h, followed by incubation with each PTHrP peptide for 10 min, induced the accumulation of IκB-α, a ∼40 kDa band indicated by thearrow. The figure represents the results of three independent experiments. C, nonstimulated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The maximal stimulatory effect of these peptides on NF-κB activation occurred at an earlier time period (within 5 min) than that at which each peptide maximally increased IL-6 mRNA in UMR 106 cells (Fig.2, A and B). In addition, NF-κB activation in response to each PTHrP domain persisted for up to 1 h, a time frame corresponding to the maximal induction of IL-6 mRNA triggered by these peptides (Fig. 2, A and B). The effect of each PTHrP domain on NF-κB activity was dose-dependent, being maximal with a 100 nm concentration of each peptide in UMR 106 cells (Fig.4 A). As EMSA controls, competition experiments were performed, showing that the retarded bands in cell extracts from either nonstimulated (Fig. 4 A) or PTHrP-stimulated (not shown) cells disappeared with an excess of unlabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide, but not by a noncompetitive oligonucleotide containing binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1, an unrelated nuclear protein. This indicates the NF-κB specificity of the binding in UMR 106 cells. This dose-response pattern was similar to that observed for IL-6 mRNA induction by each peptide in these cells (Fig. 4 B). The addition of both peptides together at a dose (10 nm) inducing a submaximal effect on either NF-κB activity or IL-6 mRNA failed to induce a higher effect in these cells (Fig. 4,C and D). We assessed the possible involvement of p50 and p65 proteins in PTHrP-induced activation of NF-κB in UMR 106 cells by Western blot analysis. Both NF-κB subunits were increased about 2-fold by 100 nm PTHrP (107–139) within 15 min, and at least up to 1 h (the longest time tested) in these cells (Fig.5, A and B). A similar maximal increase in both p50 and p65 at 15 min was observed after stimulating UMR 106 cells with N-terminal PTHrP (Fig.5 B). Additional studies were performed to characterize further the mechanism(s) involved in NF-κB activation by both PTHrP (107–139) and PTHrP (1–36) in UMR 106 cells. We found that 25 nm BIM, a PKC inhibitor (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J.

Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Science. 1992; 253: 1132-1135Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar), eliminated NF-κB activation by 100 nm PTHrP (107–139) in UMR 106 cells (Fig. 6 A). In addition, the calcium channel blocker nifedipine or verapamil (not shown), at 50 μm, abolished the PTHrP (107–139)-induced NF-κB activation in these cells (Fig. 6 A). The effects of these inhibitors were consistent with those observed previously on the PTHrP (107–139)-induced increase in IL-6 mRNA in these cells (17Valı́n A. Guillén C. Esbrit P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, the pentapeptide PTHrP (107–111) and PMA, two PKC stimulators in another osteoblastic cell line (15Gagnon L. Jouishomme H. Whitfield J. Durkin J.P. MacLean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Chakravarthy B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), at 100 nm and 1 μm, respectively, increased both NF-κB activation (Fig. 6, A and C) and IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 6 B) in these cells. The calcium ionophore ionomycin, at 100 nm, also stimulated NF-κB activation in UMR 106 cells, an effect that was abrogated by 25 nm BIM (Fig. 6 C). This ionophore, in a manner similar to PMA, also increased IL-6 mRNA in UMR 106 cells, and this effect of both stimulators was abolished by 50 nm calphostin C, another PKC inhibitor (37Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the stimulatory effect of PTHrP (1–36) on either NF-κB·DNA binding activity or IL-6 mRNA was inhibited by RpcAMPS but not by BIM in these cells (Fig. 7, A andB).Figure 7The effect of N-terminal PTHrP on NF-κB activation depends on cAMP in UMR 106 cells.

NF-κB activity was assayed in nuclear extracts at 15 min (A), and RT-PCR was performed with cell total RNA isolated at 1 h after stimulation with PTHrP (1–36), using IL-6- and GAPDH-specific primers (B).

The specific structural requirements that enable conversion of ligand binding to the extracellular domain to an activated conformation of the cytoplasmic domain are poorly understood.Hematopoietic cytokine receptors share common features in the extracellular domain such as four spaced cysteines near the N terminus and a Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS) motif located proximal to the cell membrane (for a review, see Refs. 1Constantinescu S.N.

The cytoplasmic domain of hematopoietic cytokine receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and therefore require recruitment of cytoplasmic kinases to promote signal transduction. A simple prototype of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family is the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)1 that is essential for the development of mature erythrocytes. Crystallographic evidence suggests that in the absence of ligand, the EpoR exists as a preformed dimer in an open scissors-like conformation (3Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L.

Signaling pathways activated in response to ligand binding to the EpoR have been studied in detail, but it is unresolved how activation of JAK2 is communicated to phosphorylation of the eight tyrosine residues localized in the membrane-distal cytoplasmic domain.Here we present a set of EpoR-GFP fusion proteins that are 1) ER-retained and signaling-incompetent, 2) surface-expressed but signaling-incompetent, and 3) surface-expressed and signaling-competent. Our analysis shows that the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR can tolerate a large insertion separating the JAK2-activating segment from the respective tyrosine residues and yet coordinate biological responses supporting proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells.DISCUSSIONSignal conversion through cytokine receptors relies on intricate communication between the extracellular ligand binding domain and the cytosolic domain that mediates recruitment of signaling molecules. Here, we demonstrate that signal transduction via the EpoR, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, can occur despite physical separation of the JAK2 binding site from the cytosolic tyrosine residues, which are phosphorylated upon stimulation with Epo.Insertion of GFP at the junction between the extracellular and TM domains results in a chimeric receptor not transported to the cell surface and unable to bind ligand. This phenotype is reminiscent of mutations in the WSXWS motif in the EpoR extracellular domain, since deletion or alterations in the WSXWS motif resulted in receptors that were retained in the ER and unable to interact with the ligand (22Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1990; 348: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The WSXWS motif is conserved in the extracellular domain of cytokine receptors and was initially believed to be involved in ligand binding. However, the crystal structures of the extracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor (23de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

The phenotype of the WSXWS mutants rather suggested that the intact motif is necessary for correct trafficking of the receptor. Our results indicate that not only the amino acid sequence of the motif but also the spatial localization in close proximity to the cell membrane could be critical for successful transport of the EpoR to the cell surface.Recent evidence suggests that JAK2 recruitment to the EpoR mediated by a continuous block of residues in the membrane-proximal segment of the cytoplasmic domain is required for EpoR cell surface expression (6Huang L.J.

Our analysis of EpoR-GFP2 shows that increasing the distance between the JAK2 binding motif in the cytoplasmic part of the EpoR and the cell membrane does not disturb the surface prevalence of the EpoR. However, physical separation of the JAK2 binding sites from the precisely oriented hydrophobic motif in the juxtamembrane segment (5Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol.

This suggests that the ligand binding domain, the TM domain, the membrane-proximal hydrophobic patch, and the JAK2 binding sites are organized in a structurally rigid entity that requires precise spatial alignment to activate signal transduction.The major part of the cytosolic domain encompassing box 2 and the eight tyrosine residues is contained in exon 8 of the EpoR genomic locus, suggesting a conserved functional entity. Yet we show that insertion of GFP in the middle of the cytoplasmic domain results in a chimeric receptor (EpoR-GFP3) capable of initiating signal transduction and biological responses comparable with wild type EpoR. The cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR is partially unfolded in the absence of JAK2 (25Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W.

Our results demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain is maintained despite physical separation of the JAK2-activating domain from the segment harboring the tyrosine residues.

Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The possibility that another kinase can compensate for JAK2 is rather unlikely, since JAK2 null mice show a dramatic phenotype with fetal anemia and embryonic lethality at day 12.5 comparable with the EpoR null mice (26Neubauer H.

However, the EpoR that contains GFP fused to the C terminus (EpoR-GFP4) is expressed at reduced levels and has a decreased capacity to promote the formation of CFU-E colonies.

Indeed, further separation of Tyr479 and GFP improved signal transmission and the capacity to support the biological functions, although the overall expression levels remained reduced. 2R. Ketteler and U. Klingmüller, manuscript in preparation.In summary, we show by marking a hematopoietic cytokine receptor with a GFP insertion that the extracellular, transmembrane, and membrane-proximal domains form a rigid structure whose specific orientation is essential for initiating signal transduction in response to ligand binding. However, we propose that additional coordinating mechanisms exist, since long range activation of the membrane-distal part is possible, providing a novel concept how ligand binding is converted to receptor activation. Ligand binding to membrane-spanning receptors supports signaling networks within cells. The specific structural requirements that enable conversion of ligand binding to the extracellular domain to an activated conformation of the cytoplasmic domain are poorly understood. Hematopoietic cytokine receptors share common features in the extracellular domain such as four spaced cysteines near the N terminus and a Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS) motif located proximal to the cell membrane (for a review, see Refs. 1Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and 2Klingmüller U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of hematopoietic cytokine receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and therefore require recruitment of cytoplasmic kinases to promote signal transduction. A simple prototype of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family is the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)1 that is essential for the development of mature erythrocytes. Crystallographic evidence suggests that in the absence of ligand, the EpoR exists as a preformed dimer in an open scissors-like conformation (3Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, a conformational switch facilitated by self-interaction of the transmembrane domains is induced, permitting the activation of an intracellular signal transduction cascade (4Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmuller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This process is supported by a conserved hydrophobic motif localized in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of the EpoR (5Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A continuous stretch of residues in the membrane-proximal domain of the EpoR mediates binding of the Janus kinase JAK2 and ensures transport of the EpoR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (6Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The precise orientation of critical residues in the juxtamembrane motif is essential for JAK2 activation.

In addition, JAK2 is involved in activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 by the EpoR, as shown by the use of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 (11Kirito K.

The possibility that another kinase can compensate for JAK2 is rather unlikely, since JAK2 null mice show a dramatic phenotype with fetal anemia and embryonic lethality at day 12.5 comparable with the EpoR null mice (26Neubauer H.

However, the EpoR that contains GFP fused to the C terminus (EpoR-GFP4) is expressed at reduced levels and has a decreased capacity to promote the formation of CFU-E colonies. In this chimeric protein, GFP is localized in close proximity to Tyr479, a residue that has been shown to be important for the recruitment of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (12Klingmüller U., Wu, H.

In summary, we show by marking a hematopoietic cytokine receptor with a GFP insertion that the extracellular, transmembrane, and membrane-proximal domains form a rigid structure whose specific orientation is essential for initiating signal transduction in response to ligand binding. However, we propose that additional coordinating mechanisms exist, since long range activation of the membrane-distal part is possible, providing a novel concept how ligand binding is converted to receptor activation.

The concentration of TAFI in plasma varies in the human population and thus may constitute a risk factor for thrombotic disorders. In addition, TAFI has been reported to be a positive acute phase reactant in mice. We have initiated molecular analysis of the human TAFI promoter to understand the mechanisms underlying regulation of TAFI gene expression. We identified a putative C/EBP-binding site between −53 and −40 of the promoter. Mutations in this site that abolish C/EBP binding decrease TAFI promoter activity in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells by ∼80%. Gel mobility shift analyses indicated that C/EBP-β present in HepG2 nuclear extracts and C/EBP-α and -β present in adult rat liver nuclear extracts bind to the C/EBP site. C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ isoforms are all capable of binding to the C/EBP site and activating the TAFI promoter.

Imbalances lead to a tendency to bleed, as in hemophilia, or to thrombose, as in myocardial infarction, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis. Both the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades feature inherent regulatory mechanisms that allow for localization, amplification, and subsequent attenuation of the respective activities of the cascades. In addition, regulatory pathways that communicate between the cascades influence the balance between their activities.A novel example of the latter regulatory mechanism is provided by the recent identification of thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)1 (1Bazaar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TAFI, which is also known as plasma procarboxypeptidase B (2Eaton D.L.

Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar), is a plasma zymogen that is activated by thrombin, the terminal enzyme of the coagulation cascade. Activation of TAFI by thrombin is accelerated over 1000-fold in the presence of the endothelial cell membrane protein thrombomodulin (5Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Plasmin, the terminal enzyme of the fibrinolytic cascade, has also been identified as an activator of TAFI (6Mari S.S. Cooper C.M. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35046-35052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Activated TAFI (TAFIa) is a basic carboxypeptidase that inhibits fibrinolysis by removing carboxyl-terminal lysine and arginine residues from partially degraded fibrin thereby inhibiting the development of positive feedback in the fibrinolytic cascade (7Sakharov D.V.

Rev. 2001; 180: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), thus suggesting additional roles for the TAFI pathway beyond regulation of hemostasis.It has been determined that the concentration of TAFI antigen in human plasma varies considerably (up to 10-fold) in the population (reviewed in Ref. 13Boffa M.B. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Hematol. Disorders. 2001; 1: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), largely as a result of genetic factors (14Juhan-Vague I.

Indeed, many sequence polymorphisms have been identified throughout the TAFI gene, including in the 5′-flanking region and regions encoding the protein sequence and 3′-untranslated region (15Franco R.F.

Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although a direct functional role for the polymorphisms remains to be demonstrated. Because the plasma concentration of TAFI is likely to impact directly the rate of TAFIa generation in response to activation of the coagulation cascade (3Campbell W. Okada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,19Mosnier L.O. von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), variation in plasma concentrations of TAFI may constitute a risk factor for the development of thrombotic disorders (15Franco R.F.

In addition, studies in mice have identified TAFI as a positive acute phase reactant (21Sato T. Miwa T. Akatsu H. Matsukawa N. Obata K. Okada N. Campbell W. Okada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); indeed, studies in humans have demonstrated associations between plasma TAFI concentrations and markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (22Silvera A. Schatteman K. Goossens F. Moor E. Scharpé S. Strömqvist M. Hendriks D. Hamstem A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 2P. Crainich, Z. Tang, E. M.

Tracy, unpublished data. However, the molecular bases for these observations remain to be elucidated because no information currently exists concerning the mechanisms by which expression of the gene encoding TAFI may be regulated. Accordingly, following from our characterization of the human gene encoding TAFI (23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have initiated investigations into the molecular architecture of the TAFI promoter. We report here the identification of a functional C/EBP-binding site in the TAFI promoter, which represents the first description of a cis-acting sequence in this promoter and which may have important implications for regulation of TAFI gene expression.DISCUSSIONIt has been demonstrated that plasma concentrations of TAFI vary considerably in the human population (reviewed in Ref. 13Boffa M.B. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Hematol. Disorders. 2001; 1: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The largest contributor to this variation is genetic factors (16Henry M. Aubert H. Morange P.E. Nanni I. Alessi M.C. Tiret L. Juhan-Vague I. Blood. 2001; 97: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); in this context, many polymorphisms in the human TAFI gene have been identified that are strongly associated with plasma TAFI concentrations (15Franco R.F. Fagundes M.G. Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Lourenco D. Morelli V. Maffei F.H. Ferrari I.C. Piccinato C.E. Silva W.A., Jr. Zago M.A. Haematologica. 2001; 86: 510-517PubMed Google Scholar, 16Henry M.

Blood. 2001; 98: 1992-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), including polymorphisms in the 5′-flanking region that may alter TAFI promoter activity. It remains to be determined what, if any, direct effect the known polymorphisms have on TAFI gene expression or if as yet undiscovered mutations play a role. It is likely that TAFI gene expression can also be altered by a variety of physiological stimuli to effect an alteration in the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. TAFI has been demonstrated to be a positive acute phase reactant in mice (21Sato T. Miwa T. Akatsu H. Matsukawa N. Obata K. Okada N. Campbell W. Okada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and elevated plasma TAFI concentrations in humans may be associated with elevations in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein2 (22Silvera A. Schatteman K. Goossens F. Moor E. Scharpé S. Strömqvist M. Hendriks D. Hamstem A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indicating that TAFI gene expression may be under the control of inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines and glucocorticoid hormones. In addition, plasma TAFI concentrations in women rise as a function of age (14Juhan-Vague I. Renucci J.F. Grimaux M. Morange P.E. Gouvernet J. Gourmelin Y. Alessi M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Haemostasis. 2001; 83: 902-905Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and may be influenced by oral contraceptive or climacteric hormone use (14Juhan-Vague I. Renucci J.F. Grimaux M. Morange P.E. Gouvernet J. Gourmelin Y. Alessi M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,20van Tilburg N.H. Rosendaal F.R. Bertina R.M.

Haematol. 2001; 115: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for sex hormones in regulation of TAFI gene expression. Collectively, these emerging data imply a role for control of TAFI gene expression, and particularly TAFI transcription, in mediating the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis and the interplay between coagulation and inflammation. Our functional analysis of the human TAFI promoter has resulted in the identification of a functional C/EBP-binding site, which may have important implications for the control of TAFI gene expression.We identified a potential C/EBP-binding site between −53 and −40 of the TAFI 5′-flanking region by computer analysis of the sequence of the TAFI gene (23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutations in the putative C/EBP site that would be expected to abolish C/EBP binding markedly decreased TAFI promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2) and inhibited binding of C/EBP to this site in gel mobility shift assays (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). We found that C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ were all able to bind to andtrans-activate through the C/EBP site (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7); C/EBP-β present in nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells as well as C/EBP-α and -β present in nuclear extracts prepared from adult rat liver nuclei were able to bind to the C/EBP-binding site (Figs. 3and 4). It has been shown that HepG2 cells are deficient in expression of C/EBP-α (32Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because the TAFI promoter is active in HepG2 cells, and the endogenous TAFI gene is expressed by these cells, 4M. B. Boffa, J. D. Hamill, D. Brown, M. L. Scott, M. E. Nesheim, and M. L. Koschinsky, unpublished data. it is clear that C/EBP-α is not absolutely required for TAFI promoter activity.The TAFI promoter lacks a consensus TATA box, and its transcription is initiated from multiple sites (23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these respects the TAFI gene is similar to those encoding several of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, including factors VII, IX, X, and XII as well as protein C (see Ref. 23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and references therein). Of these genes, functional C/EBP sites have been identified only in the promoter of the factor IX gene (33Crossley M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), although some evidence exists for a role for C/EBP in the protein C promoter (34Tsay W. Lee Y.-M. Lee S.-C. Shen M.-C. Chen P.-J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 5: 569-577Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A mutation in a C/EBP site in the factor IX promoter has been implicated in defective C/EBP binding and hence impaired factor IX expression in some patients with hemophilia B Leyden (33Crossley M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas functional cooperation between C/EBP and D-site-binding protein has been linked to the post-pubertal recovery in factor IX expression in hemophilia B Leyden patients (35Picketts D.J. Liilicrap D. Mueller C.R. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C/EBP sites have also been identified in the promoters of the genes encoding factor VIII (36McGlynn L.K. Mueller C.R. Begbie M. Notley C.R. Lillicrap D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1936-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Aα-, Bβ-, and, possibly, γ-chains of fibrinogen (37Hu C.-H. Harris J.E. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28342-28349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Anderson G.M. Shaw A.R. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); although all of these genes are induced in the acute phase, C/EBP only appears to play a major role in the induction of the factor VIII promoter under these conditions (36McGlynn L.K. Mueller C.R. Begbie M. Notley C.R. Lillicrap D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1936-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Liu Z. Fuller G.M. J. Biol.

TAFI is closely related to the pancreatic procarboxypeptidases A and B and mast cell procarboxypeptidase A, sharing up to 40% amino acid identity as well as common genomic structures (23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although a role for C/EBP in expression of these respective genes has not been studied, their promoters show no nucleotide sequence homology to the TAFI promoter, are transcribed from a unique transcription start site, and apparently contain TATA boxes (see Ref. 23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar for references).The ability of respective C/EBP isoforms to trans-activate promoters is a complex function of their site of synthesis and relative levels of expression, the expression of activating and inhibitory variants from the same mRNA by a process of leaky ribosome scanning, and the promoter context of the C/EBP-binding site (43Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Our findings from ectopic expression of C/EBP isoforms indicate some differences in the ability of C/EBP isoforms totrans-activate the TAFI promoter. It is reasonable to hypothesize that physiological signals and circumstances mediated by changes in the expression and activity of C/EBP isoforms will result in changes in TAFI gene expression.It has been demonstrated that both C/EBP-α and -β are first expressed in the fetal liver relatively late in gestation (13–15 days post-coitum (dpc)) (44Darlington G.J. Wang N. Hanson R.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Studies of TAFI gene expression during fetal development in mice reveal that TAFI mRNA is detectable as early as 7.5 dpc (45Ong K. Horsfall W. Conway E.M. Schuh A.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), before the development of the vascular system or liver. However, TAFI mRNA levels remain low to undetectable through 13.5 dpc (45Ong K. Horsfall W. Conway E.M. Schuh A.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); TAFI mRNA abundance is increased, although perhaps not to adult levels, at 14.5 dpc (45Ong K. Horsfall W. Conway E.M. Schuh A.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), at which point C/EBP-α and -β expression should be well established in the fetal liver. Although it is tempting to speculate that the onset of C/EBP expression is required for TAFI expression in liver, more information is required as to the other liver-specific factors that regulate TAFI transcription (see below). It has been found that C/EBP-α and -β expression in liver transiently peaks in the perinatal period (44Darlington G.J. Wang N. Hanson R.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), although no information currently exists as to the pattern of TAFI gene expression during this time. Of note, analysis of mice in which the TAFI gene has been knocked out by homologous recombination revealed no defects in fetal and neonatal growth, development, or viability (46Nagashima M. Yin Z.-F. Zhao L. White K. Zhu Y. Lasky N. Halks-Miller M. Broze G.J., Jr. Fay W.P. Morser J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The potential ability of different isoforms of C/EBP to complement each other in regulating TAFI gene expression may be relevant in the context of liver regeneration and liver disease. It is well known that there is a reciprocal down-regulation of C/EBP-α and up-regulation of C/EBP-β and -δ during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (47Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30843-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is not known if this process results in changes in plasma TAFI concentrations, although we would speculate that the ability of the TAFI promoter to be activated by all three C/EBP isoforms might result in minimal alteration of TAFI gene expression. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that plasma TAFI levels are greatly decreased in the setting of various forms of advanced liver disease (48Van Thiel D. George M. Fareed J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 49Lisman T. Leebeek F.W.G. Mosnier L.O. Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C.M. Janssen H.L.A. Nieuwenhuis K. de Groot P.G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 131-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which may be relevant to the bleeding tendency seen in patients with these conditions. The mechanism underlying these observations, including the potential role of altered expression of C/EBP isoforms, remains to be determined.TAFI expression in adult humans is restricted to the liver (23Boffa M.B. Reid T.S. Joo E. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6547-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and possibly megakaryocytes (50Bouma B.N. Marx P.F. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C.M. Thromb. Res. 2001; 101: 329-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, because C/EBP-α and -β are expressed in other tissues besides the liver in adults (43Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), the C/EBP site in the TAFI promoter does not alone account for the restricted expression of this gene in liver. Our computer analysis of the TAFI 5′-flanking region sequence also identified an excellent match for the consensus binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor HLF between −52 and −42. However, a mutation (T−49G) that would be expected to abolish HLF binding did not decrease TAFI promoter activity, suggesting that this factor does not play a role in basal expression of TAFI. Our earlier deletion analysis of the human TAFI promoter revealed a key role for sequences between −140 and −73 in hepatic transcription of the TAFI promoter. Within this region, computer analysis revealed the presence of good matches to the consensus binding site sequences for the c-Ets-1 and RFX1 transcription factors. The ubiquitous Ets factor GABPα/β has been shown to cooperate with HLF in transcription of the factor IX promoter in HepG2 cells (51Boccia L.M. Lillicrap D.P. Newcombe K. Mueller C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but in accordance with a lack of a role for HLF in TAFI promoter activity, mutations that would be expected to abolish c-Ets-1 binding also did not decrease TAFI promoter activity. RFX1 is also a ubiquitous factor that has been shown to be important for liver-specific activity of the hepatitis virus B enhancer, presumably in concert with liver-specific factors (52Siegrist C. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, our mutational analysis also serves to rule out a role for this factor in TAFI promoter activity in the liver. Clearly, additional work is required to fully elucidate the basis for liver-specific expression of the TAFI gene.It is noteworthy that elimination of the C/EBP-binding site between −53 and −40 does not completely abolish TAFI promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). It is possible that a lower level of promoter activity can occur without the involvement of C/EBP binding to this site or that another, less potent, C/EBP-binding site exists in the TAFI promoter. It is noteworthy that mutations in site II that abolish C/EBP binding decrease, but do not eliminate, the ability of C/EBP to activate the TAFI promoter (Fig. 7). Computer analysis using Matinspector reveals that within the TAFI 5′-flanking region fragment contained within TAFI[−1128]-luc, four additional potential C/EBP-binding sites exist (−1098 to −1085; −833 to −820; −423 to −410; and −321 to −308).It has recently been demonstrated that injection of mice with bacterial lipopolysaccharide results in increased hepatic TAFI mRNA abundance and plasma TAFI antigen concentrations, thus identifying TAFI as a positive acute phase reactant (21Sato T. Miwa T. Akatsu H. Matsukawa N. Obata K. Okada N. Campbell W. Okada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is well established that C/EBP isoforms are critical mediators of immune and inflammatory responses, including the acute phase response (53Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Although the potential role for C/EBP in the acute phase response of the TAFI gene remains to be elucidated, numerous mechanisms by which it may occur are possible. The acute phase mediators IL-1 and IL-6 up-regulate C/EBP-β and -δ expression (54Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may in turn give rise to increased transcription of the TAFI gene. IL-6 signaling may also increase phosphorylation of C/EBP-β on Thr-235, thus increasing its trans-activating potential (55Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids are required for the maximal stimulation of many acute phase genes; instances of functional cooperation between C/EBP and the glucocorticoid receptor have been described, which either do (56Christoffels V.M. Grange T. Kaestner K.H. Cole T.J. Darlington G.J. Croniger C.M. Lamers W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6305-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or do not (57Boruk M. Savory J.G.A. Haché R.J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1749-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) require DNA binding by the receptor. Interestingly, we have identified a functional glucocorticoid response element in the human TAFI promoter, ∼40 bp upstream of the C/EBP-binding site described in this study.4 Lipopolysaccharide treatment of mice also alters the relative abundance of the differently sized C/EBP-α and -β variants that result from leaky ribosome scanning (58An M.R. Hsieh C.-C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP has been shown to be able to interact directly with NF-κB transcription factors, which are mediators of the effects of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (59Stein B. C"
https://openalex.org/W2116492700,"We have previously found that retinoic acid stimulates the expression of protein kinase Cα (PKC) in B16 mouse melanoma cells. Because it has been reported that PKC can phosphorylate retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and alter its function, we determined whether changes in the level and/or activity of PKC could affect the expression or function of the RAR in B16 melanoma. Using in vivo phosphorylation and band shift techniques, we could not demonstrate that altering PKC activity and/or protein level changed thein vivo phosphorylation of RARα. However activation of PKC resulted in increased RARα protein. Increased receptor protein correlated with a phorbol dibutyrate-stimulated increase in receptor activation function-2 (AF-2)-dependent transcriptional activity. Use of enzyme inhibitors and dominant-negative PKCs indicated that enzyme activity was required for elevation in the RARα. The PKC-mediated increase in RARα was due to a 2.5-fold increase in the half-life of this protein. In contrast, the down-regulation of PKC diminished RARα protein half-life and markedly inhibited AF-2-dependent transcriptional activity. The down-regulation of PKC also inhibited the binding of RAR to a retinoic acid response element and the retinoic acid induction of RARβ expression. These findings suggest that PKC can influence retinoic acid signaling by altering the stability of RAR protein without directly phosphorylating this receptor.

This vitamin is important for normal growth and development, especially during embryogenesis where a three-dimensional gradient of RA determines pattern formation (1Hofmann C. Eichele G. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 387-441Google Scholar). It is also an important regulator of reproduction (2Wilson J.G. Roth C.B. Warkany J. Am. J. Anat. 1953; 92: 189-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), differentiation (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (4Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, RA has been found to inhibit the growth of malignant cells (5Lotan R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 605: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 6Lupulescu A. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr.

A. 1980; 77: 2936-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, of all these effects are mediated though retinoid nuclear receptors. There are two families of retinoid nuclear receptors: RARs and RXRs. Each family of nuclear retinoic acid receptors consists of α, β, and γ subtypes (8Mattei M.-G. Riviere M. Krust A. Ingvarsson S.

Liu Q. Howard T.A. Linney E. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1992; 14: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators, with RXR being activated by 9-cis-RA, whereas RAR are activated by either all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA (11Crettaz M. Baron A. Siegenthaler G. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 91-99Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C.

Lovey A. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). RXR can form homodimers with a number of other type II nuclear receptors, including RAR (14Kliewer S.A. Umensono J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 335: 446-449Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 15Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In contrast, RAR only forms heterodimers with RXR (16Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshari H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, RXR·RAR heterodimers bind to the promoter of target genes and stimulate their transcription (17Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). In B16 mouse melanoma cells RARα and RAR γ are constitutively expressed, whereas RARα expression can be induced by incubation of cells with RA (18Xiao Y. Desai D. Quick T.C. Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nuclear retinoic acid receptors are phosphoproteins. RARα is phosphorylated in vivo by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (19Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.-P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cyclin-activating kinase (CAK) (20Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RARα by PKA in F9 cells is required for RA-induced parietal endoderm differentiation (21Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.-L. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1398-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, proline-directed phosphorylation sites (such as those phosphorylated by CAK) in RARγ were required for RA induction of primitive endoderm differentiation (22Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PKA phosphorylation site in RARγ was dispensable for this biological activity of RA (21Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.-L. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1398-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) is a serine/threonine protein kinase and plays a role in the regulation of growth, differentiation, and other cellular functions (23Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). The PKC family includes at least 11 different enzymes that are classified into three families based on requirement for phospholipids, diacylglycerol, or Ca2+ for their activation (24Ohno S. Akita Y. Hata A. Osada S.I. Kubo K. Konno Y. Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Saido T. Kuroki T. Suzuki K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Following activation, PKC is translocated to different cellular compartments where it phosphorylates substrate proteins. In addition, PKC has been shown to transverse the nuclear membrane and phosphorylate targets in the nucleus (26Yuan L.W. Gambee J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40946-49851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The transcription complex activating protein 1 is activated by PKC (27Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 1-77PubMed Google Scholar), which provides a means for PKC to influence gene expression. It has been proposed that there is an interaction between PKC and retinoic acid receptors. PKC has been shown to phosphorylate RARin vitro (28Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 29Delmotte M.-H. Tahayato A. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38225-38231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, one group has reported that RA binds to PKC in a specific manner and inactivates its enzymatic activity (30Radominska-Pandya A. Chen G. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Samckyszyn V.M. Carter C.A. Nowak G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22324-22330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that treatment of B16 melanoma cells with RA increases the amount of PKCα mRNA and protein (31Rosenbaum S. Niles R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In light of the purported interaction between PKC and RAR, we investigated whether the increased amount of PKCα in B16 cells might phosphorylate the RAR and alter its function. We found, in B16 mouse melanoma cells, that RARα is not a target for PKC-directed phosphorylation. However, we discovered that activation of PKC in these cells resulted in an increase in RARα protein. The increase in RARα was due to an increase in the half-life of this protein, which correlated with an increase in AF-2 activity. In contrast, down-regulation of PKC through prolonged phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) treatment led to a large decrease in AF-2 activity, which cannot be totally accounted for by diminished RAR stability. Our studies suggest that there exists a significant cross-talk between the PKC and RAR signal transduction pathways. B16 mouse melanoma cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2/95% air, humidified atmosphere. Cells were treated for the periods described in each experiment with 10 μmphorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or 10 μm all-trans-RA (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). All manipulations involving RA were conducted under subdued lighting or yellow light to prevent photo-oxidation. A mRARα cDNA fragment encoding the complete open reading frame, except for the last three C-terminal amino acids was produced by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGACTGGCCAGCAACAGC-3′ (upstream primer) and 5′-GGCCGGGCTGCTTCTGTT-3′ (downstream primer) using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The template for this reaction was mRARα in pSG5 that was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Celluaire, CNRS/INSERM, Strasbourg, France). PCR was conducted by incubating at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 20 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min, and ending with incubation at 68 °C for 3 min. Following authentication of the PCR product by DNA sequencing, it was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5/ His-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) producing RARα-His. In vitro transcription/translation of this construct resulted in a protein that was about 5 kDa larger than wild type RARα. Histidine-tagged RARα had the same ligand binding and DNA binding properties as wild type RARα (data not shown). Two plasmids expressing enzymatically inactive PKCα were gifts from Dr. S. Ohno, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan. One of these constructs (PKCα-Kn-SM) has a single K368R mutation in the ATP binding region. The other construct (PKCα-Kn-TM) has the same K368R mutation in addition to two amino acid mutations (R22A and A25E) in the pseudo-substrate region. Both PKCα mutants expressed from these constructs have no kinase activity. PKCα-Kn-SM is thought to be in a “closed” conformation, because it lacks the ability to autophosphorylate to achieve the mature conformation. PKC-Kn-TM, in contrast, is thought to have an “open” conformation due to the mutation in the pseudo-substrate region. B16 clones expressing these mutant PKCα proteins were used to examine the requirement of PKC enzyme activity for its effect on RAR stability. RARα-His, pSG5 RARα, β, or γ (gifts from Dr. Chambon), RARE-tk-luciferase (gift from Dr. Ozato, Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and pSV-β-gal plasmids were transiently transfected into B16 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For reporter gene assays, transfected cells were treated with PDB and/or RA for the indicated times, and 48 h after transfection cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase or β-galactosidase activity using kits from Promega (Madison, WI). Cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3.28 μg/ml PMSF) by three consecutive 10-s sonications with a Tekmar sonic disrupter at power setting 60. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking gel; 10% separating gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separation, Inc., Westborough, MA) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were incubated with 10% nonfat dry milk overnight at room temperature. The membrane was then washed 3× with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 5 min each, at room temperature and then probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was washed as described above and further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (AmershamBiosciences). Intensity of the RARα-His immunoreactive bands was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA). B16 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding the RARα-His protein as described above, harvested in buffer A and disrupted by sonication. 50 μg of protein extract was treated with 100 units of λ-phosphatase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 20 μl for different time periods at 30 °C. B16 cells were transfected with the RARα-His expression vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was changed and cells were incubated overnight in phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were then incubated for 4 h in the same medium in the presence of 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 μm orthovanadate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). At the end of this incubation, cells were washed and harvested in cold PBS. RARα was purified by immunoprecipitation as described below and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel. The gel was dried and then exposed to x-ray film for 72 h. B16 cells were transfected with the RARα-His construct as described previously. At 44 h post-transfection, media was removed and replaced with methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) for 1 h. This medium was then replace with fresh methionine-free medium to which 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. At different times of experimental treatment, medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 0.9 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 30 μg of aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in PBS). Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precleared by the addition of 1 μg of mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) together with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was removed by centrifugation at 2500 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, 0.7 μg of anti-V5 epitope antibody was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times by resuspension in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer followed by centrifugation as described previously. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of SDS samples buffer, and 25 μl was loaded onto a 5% stacking/10% separating SDS gel for protein separation by electrophoresis. The gel was then dried using a Model 583 gel drier (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the RARα-His protein was detected by autoradiography. The amount of RARα-His was determined by densitometry. RNA was isolated by a single-step method as described previously (32Desai S.H. Boskovic G. Eastham L. Dawson M. Niles R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The RNA was then fractionated on 1% agarose containing formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Chicago, IL) by downward alkaline blotting. The transferred RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV light. The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h in 6× SSC and 2% SDS. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes (1 × 106dpm/ml) were then incubated with the membranes in fresh hybridization solution for 20 h. Blots were washed three times for 15 min each in 1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, and 0.2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS, respectively. The blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film in cassettes at −70 °C for 2–5 days. All the cDNA probes were labeled using the “prime-a-gene” labeling system from Promega (Madison, WI) plus 0.25 mCi of [α-32P]dCTP. The relative amount of the different RNA species was quantitated by imaging the autoradiogram with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer, making sure that the signals were within the linear range of the instrument. The data are expressed as the ratio of the specific mRNA to the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Two 33-bp DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to form a double-stranded oligonucleotide, which contained a retinoic acid response element corresponding to that found within the human RARβ gene promoter (33Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 68: 5392-5396Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This βRARE was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by end-filling of the 5′-protruding termini with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The labeled βRARE was purified using a Qiagen Tip-20, precipitated with 10 mg of glycogen carrier in ethanol:acetone (1:3, v/v) at −80 °C, and resuspended in double distilled H2O. Gel shift reactions typically contained B16 nuclear extract (25 μg) or Sf9 cell extracts from recombinant hRARα1 baculovirus-infected cells (1 μg), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10× reaction buffer (0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6 m KCl, 0.01m Na2EDTA, 0.1 m monothioglycerol, and 0.01 m PMSF), 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 2 × 104 cpm of [α-32P]βRARE in a 20-ml total volume. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 23–24 °C and immediately resolved at 20 mA at 23 °C in a 5% non-denaturing gel (60:1, acrylamide:bis) in 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.001 m Na2EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to film between intensifying screens at −80 °C. All experiments described under “Results” were repeated three separate times with similar qualitative results. Expression of endogenous RAR in B16 cells is very low and below the detection limit of Western blotting/immunoprecipitation techniques. Thus, for the studies reported here, we used recombinant histidine-tagged RARα transiently transfected and expressed in B16 cells. Histidine-tagged RARα protein had the same ligand binding and DNA binding properties as wild type RARα (data not shown). Expression of the recombinant RARα was confirmed by Western blotting, using an antibody directed against the histidine tag or an antibody to the V5 epitope, which is also part of the tagged protein. Three immunoreactive RARα bands were most often observed in extracts of transfected B16 cells, corresponding to 50–54 kDa. When these extracts were treated with λ-protein phosphatase for different periods of time, the two RARα bands of higher molecular mass collapsed into the lowest molecular mass band (Fig. 1) indicating that the His6-RARα protein is phosphorylated in B16 cells. Elsewhere, in data presented, multiple bands of RARα may not be apparent. This is due to different gel running conditions and signal detection conditions required to display these multiple bands. We have previously shown that incubation of B16 cells with phorbol dibutyrate for 1 or 24 h activates or down-regulates PKCα, respectively (34Gruber J.R. Desai S. Blusztajn J.K. Niles R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used these phorbol dibutyrate treatment times to determine whether activation/down-regulation of PKC altered the phosphorylation of RARα. Fig.2 A shows that treatment of B16 cells with phorbol dibutyrate did not change the number of the RARα-immunoreactive bands (although the amount of RARα protein was higher in the 1-h phorbol dibutyrate-treated cells, see below). Also, the ratio of the relative amount of the different bands within each treatment group was not altered. In addition, radioactive labeling of intact cells with 32Pi-orthophosphate did not reveal any change in the amount of incorporation of the label into His6-RARα in short or long term phorbol dibutyrate-treated cells when the signals were corrected for amount of receptor protein (Fig. 2 B). Even though changes in PKC activity/expression did not alter the phosphorylation of RARα, an increase in PKC activity did result in a consistent 2-fold elevation in RARα protein levels (Fig.2 A). In contrast, down-regulation of PKC activity did not markedly change the level of RARα protein when compared with the control. To explore this phorbol dibutyrate-induced change in RARα protein in more detail, B16 cells were incubated with phorbol dibutyrate for different periods of time and the amount of RARα protein was determined by Western blotting. A delay of 30 min was observed before a change in RARα protein levels could be detected. RARα protein levels reached a maximum, of about 3-fold over the control level, at 10 h following phorbol dibutyrate addition (Fig.3 A). Subsequently, RARα protein levels declined and reached control levels 24 h following addition of phorbol dibutyrate. These levels remained unchanged for the remainder of the 72-h treatment period. The change in RARα protein level as a function of phorbol dibutyrate concentration was also analyzed. A concentration of 0.1 μm phorbol dibutyrate was able to increase RARα protein levels by 2-fold following a 1-h treatment (Fig. 3 C). Further increases in phorbol dibutyrate concentration up to 50 μm did not substantially increase the level of RARα protein. A 50 μm concentration of phorbol dibutyrate increased the RARα protein level by an additional 50%. We investigated whether PKC enzyme activity was required for the observed increase in RARα protein by using both a chemical enzyme inhibitor and dominant-negative mutants of PKCα, which lack enzymatic activity. Bisindolylmaleimide, a selective PKC enzyme inhibitor, completely abolished the phorbol dibutyrate-induced increase in RARα protein (Fig.4 A). Clones of B16 cells stably expressing two different types of PKCα dominant-negative mutants were tested for the ability of phorbol dibutyrate to increase the amount of ectopically expressed RARα. Both of these clones have markedly less PKC-specific enzyme activity than wild type B16 cells (Table I). Short or long term phorbol dibutyrate treatment was not able to significantly change RARα protein levels in these clones of B16 cells further demonstrating the requirement for PKC enzyme activity to increase the amount of RARα protein (Fig. 4 B).Table IPKC enzyme activity in wild type and PKCα mutant-expressing B16 clonesCell typeEnzyme activity pmol of 32 P/min/mg proteinB16 wild type cells29.05Clone KR 233.73Clone RE 2.10.03Cells were lyzed via sonication on ice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin.

The PKC enzyme-dependent increase in RARα protein could be the result of either increased mRNA or increased stability of the protein. Because we observed the increase in RARα protein within 1 h of addition of PDB to the cells, we considered an effect at the RNA level unlikely, thus we examined the effect of PKC activation on the stability of RARα protein. The half-life of ectopically expressed RARα in B16 cells was determined to be 4 h. When B16 cells were treated with PDB for 1 h, the RARα protein half-life increased to somewhat greater than 8 h (Fig.5). In contrast, when PKC was down-regulated by a 24-h treatment with phorbol dibutyrate, the ha"

The conformation of dephosphorylated NFAT exposes the nuclear localization signal for translocation into the nucleus and masks the nuclear export sequence to keep the protein in the nucleus. It has been reported that deletion of some serine-rich motifs masking the nuclear localization signal results in the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus, but that the nuclear export sequence located at the N terminus also needs to be deleted for NFATx (NFAT4/NFATc3) to exert efficient transactivation function. Here, we report that deletion of the critical serine-rich motifs of NFATx leads to a conformation that efficiently exposes the nuclear localization signal and that has stronger transcription activity compared with the fully activated wild-type protein in the presence of the nuclear export sequence. This also suggests that the regulation of the transactivation domain by phosphorylation observed in NFAT1 may not contribute significantly to the transcription activity of NFATx. The expression of this constitutively nuclear form of NFATx in the CD4+CD8+ T cell line facilitates differentiation into the CD4 single-positive stage upon stimulation with phorbol ester.

Phospholipase Cγ1 catalyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (1Isakov N. Mally M.I. Scholz W. Altman A. Immunol. Rev. 1987; 95: 89-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate is a crucial messenger molecule in up-regulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations, whereas diacylglycerol activates the small G protein Ras through binding to the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein, the hematopoietic cell-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, via the diacylglycerol-binding domain and has a role as a protein kinase C activator (2Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C also contributes to the activation of Ras. The up-regulation of cytoplasmic calcium leads to the activation of various Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes, including the phosphatase calcineurin. One of the crucial targets of calcineurin is NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) family members (3Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar, 4Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of NFAT family proteins results in nuclear translocation (5Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol.

The activation of Ras and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade leads to the activation of AP-1 (activator protein-1). Many genes including those of various cytokines are induced by the collaborative activity of NFAT and AP-1. NFAT transcription activity is regulated by several steps. One important step is the regulation of intracellular localization. NFAT family members harbor two conserved nuclear localization signals (NLS),1 one in the calcium regulatory domain and the other in the DNA-binding domain. The location of the nuclear export sequence (NES) has been identified in both NFATx (NFAT4/NFATc3) and NFATc (NFAT2/NFATc1) (8Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NES of NFATx is located within the transactivation domain near the N terminus, whereas the NES of NFATc is mapped near the C terminus of the calcium regulatory domain. The calcium regulatory domains of NFAT family members harbor several conserved motifs containing many serine residues, the phosphorylation of which is regulated by calcineurin and various NFAT kinases (10Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 11Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J.

Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These serine-rich motifs are the calcineurin-regulated inhibitory sequence (CRI)/serine-rich region (SRR) and three serine-proline (SP) boxes/repeats (SP1, SP2, and SP3), which are located in the C terminus of the CRI/SRR region (13Masuda E.S.

Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Deletions or point mutations of serine residues in these conserved motifs result in increased nuclear translocation and transcription activation of the promoters carrying NFAT sites, suggesting that these serine-rich motifs mask NLS (12Zhu J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In the case of NFATx, removal of the NES in addition to deletion of serine-rich motifs has also been reported to be required to maintain the NFATx protein in the nucleus and for it to exert its transcription activity efficiently (8Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the case of NFAT1 (NFATp/NFATc2), the nuclear localization of the protein by exposing the NLS results in partial transcription activity (16Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of specific serine residues is also required within the transcription activation domain for the complete transcription activity of NFAT1. In this work, a constitutively nuclear localizing NFATx mutant with full transcription activity stronger than that of the wild-type protein in the absence of Ca2+signals was created by serially deleting the conserved serine-containing motifs of NFATx. This mutant harbors an intact NES, indicating that complete activation of nuclear import activity can overcome nuclear export activity to facilitate efficient transcription. Furthermore, in contrast to NFAT1, the regulation of the transcription activation domain by phosphorylation may not be required for the complete transcription activity of NFATx. NFAT family proteins have been suggested to play crucial roles in the development of T cells in thymus (17Sebzda E. Mariathasan S. Ohteki T. Jones R. Bachmann M.F. Ohashi P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 829-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Utilizing the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and FK506, the activity of calcineurin in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes has been shown to be important for positive selection and/or negative selection (18Anderson G.

Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Due to the critical role of NFAT family proteins in the activation of mature T cells, it has been speculated that the major targets of calcineurin in thymocytes are NFAT family proteins. Among NFAT family members, NFATx is most highly expressed in CD4+CD8+ cells (24Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar), and NFATx-defective mice show reduced numbers of CD4+CD8+ cells (25Oukka M., Ho, I.C. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 295-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This reduction of the CD4+CD8+ cell population is presumably due to the reduced level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression, leading to their susceptibility to apoptosis (25Oukka M., Ho, I.C. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 295-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This indicates that the role of NFATx in thymocytes is to up-regulate Bcl-2 expression in response to the selecting signal to facilitate thymocyte survival. RLm6 (RLmale6) cells, a CD4+CD8+ T lymphoma, and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes differentiate into CD4 single-positive cells upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore treatment (26Kuwata T.

We show that when the constitutively nuclear NFATx mutant was introduced into this cell line, differentiation into the CD4 single-positive stage was induced in the presence of PMA alone, suggesting that NFATx plays an important role in the positive selection by regulating the expression pattern of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors.

RLm6-ΔCN, an RLm6 transfectant expressing the Ca2+-independent form of calcineurin, was obtained as previously described (26Kuwata T. Asada A. Ohoka Y. Mukai M. Miyaike M. Iwata M. Biochem. Biophys.

This plasmid contains full-length murine NFATx1 (mNFATx1) cDNA under the control of the SRα promoter in the pME18S vector and was used for the construction of plasmids containing various deletions in NFATx1 based on standard recombinant techniques and PCR methods. To construct pMEmX-Δ(CRI) and pMEmX-Δ(CRI·SP12), the XbaI-ScaI fragment in mNFATx1 cDNA (positions 440–995) was replaced by PCR fragments generated from pMEmNFATx1, yielding in-frame truncation at positions 446–616 and 446–814, respectively. pMEmX-Δ(CRI·SP1) was constructed by removing an XbaI-AvrII fragment (positions 440–716), followed by direct self-ligation. pMEmX-Δ(CRI·SP12) was processed for further truncation by replacing the 186-bp XbaI-ScaI fragment in this plasmid with a 117-bp PCR-generated fragment derived from pMEmNFATx1, generating pMEmX-Δ(CRI·SP123) containing an additional truncation corresponding to positions 869–937 in the mNFATx1 sequence. Nucleotide sequences of junctions and PCR-derived fragments were verified in all of the plasmids by DNA sequencing. Deduced amino acid sequences in the corresponding regions of the plasmids are summarized in Fig. 1.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar). pRL-SV40, a co-reporter plasmid for the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). pMKITmNFATx and pMKITmNFAT-Δ(CRI·SP12) contain wild-type mNFATx cDNA from pMEmNFATx1 and mNFATx lacking CRI, SP1, and SP2 from pMEmX-Δ(CRI·SP12), respectively. Transient transfection in COS-7 and Jurkat cells was carried out by a DEAE-dextran method as described previously (24Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar, 28Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RLm6 cell transfectants stably expressing wild-type or truncated forms of NFATx1 were generated as follows. EcoRI-XhoI fragments encoding the full-length or truncated forms of NFATx1 cDNA were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pMKIT-Neo) from which the MluI fragment had been excised. pMKITmNFATx, pMKITmNFAT-Δ(CRI), and pMKITmNFAT-Δ(CRI·SP12) were thus obtained. The linearized constructs were prepared by digestion withNluI. RLm6 cells were transfected with the linearized constructs or control pMKIT-Neo by electroporation and selected as previously described (24Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar). RLm6 or its transfectants were stimulated with PMA (Sigma) and/or ionomycin as previously described (24Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of FK506 as indicated. To prepare the whole cell extracts, cells were harvested at 48 h, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described (32Miyatake S. Sakuma M. Saito T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1816-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove debris. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as described previously (28Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and blotted with rabbit anti-NFATx antibody X-75 (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), followed by detection using an ECLTM kit (Amersham Biosciences). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and 1 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Luciferase assay was carried out according to the procedure described previously (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with minimal modification. Briefly, 3 × 106Jurkat cells were transfected with a pME18S-based expression vector (15 μg) and the pNFAT72-Luc reporter plasmid (3 μg) (31Imamura R. Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Imai S. Fujino T. Takano T. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar). For the control to monitor the efficiency of transfection, the pRL-SV40Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (0.25 μg) was also included for transfection. After 40 h of incubation, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA with or without 0.5 mmA23187(Calbiochem) for 8 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, and then the cells were harvested. EMSAs were conducted using a double-strand oligonucleotide probe containing the distal NFAT site from the human IL-2 promoter with 1 μg of transfected COS-7 cytosolic or whole cell extracts. Procedures for EMSAs and the double-strand oligonucleotides used in this study have been described previously (24Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells were incubated with 3 μm fura-2/AM (Texas Fluorescence Labs Inc., Austin, TX) for 20 min. Using a fluorometer (CAF-100, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), the emitted fluorescence (520 nm) in response to alternate pulses of excitation light at 340 and 380 nm was monitored for 15 min. Triton X-100 (0.1%) and EGTA (10 mm) were successively added to the cell suspension to determine the intracellular Ca2+ concentration according to an equation with a K d value of 224 nm as described (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In all tested cells under unstimulated conditions, the intracellular Ca2+concentration determined by the fura-2 method was ∼150 nm(range of 134–170 nm). It has been shown that the calcium regulatory domain includes critical motifs that regulate subcellular localization of NFAT proteins. In the case of NFATx, we have previously shown that when the CRI/SRR motif in its calcium regulatory domain was truncated, the NFATx protein showed not only enhanced nuclear localization, but also transactivation upon PMA-alone stimulation (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the extent of transactivation by CRI/SRR-deleted NFATx upon PMA-alone stimulation was very limited compared with that upon PMA plus calcium ionophore stimulation. This prompted us to further modify the calcium regulatory domain to create constitutively active forms that show strong transcription activity. Among conserved motifs in calcium regulatory domain, SP motifs (SPXXSPXXSPXXXXX(E/D)(E/D)) adjacent to the CRI/SRR domain are short sequences that have been suggested to be a target of stimulation-dependent serine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of NFAT proteins (5Loh C.

We first examined the function of NFATx molecules by serial truncation of the SP motifs in addition to CRI/SRR. Among the multiple isoforms of NFATx, NFATx1 is the one that is predominantly expressed in human and murine thymuses that might be involved in thymocyte differentiation (30Liu J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Amasaki Y. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Imai S. Takano T. Arai N. Yokota T. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Imamura R. Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Imai S. Fujino T. Takano T. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, murine NFATx1 was used for experiments in view of its application in murine cells. The residues of the CRI/SRR domain and SP motifs are almost completely identical between human and mouse NFATx homologs (30Liu J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Amasaki Y. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Imai S. Takano T. Arai N. Yokota T. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We first truncated the amino acid residues corresponding to the CRI/SRR region of murine NFATx. In addition to this construct, designated X-Δ(CRI), we generated additional constructs that had serially truncated SP motifs (Fig. 1,a and b). Residues covering SP1 and SP1/2 were serially truncated in X-Δ(CRI·SP1) and X-Δ(CRI·SP12), respectively. In X-Δ(CRI·SP123), SP3 was further truncated from X-Δ(CRI·SP12), leaving intact amino acid residues between SP2 and SP3 that have been predicted to contain an NLS (6Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The protein expression levels and subcellular distribution of these NFATx mutants were examined by transfecting the CRI/SP-truncated constructs into COS-7 cells, taking advantage of the efficient separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions from these cells. When crude whole cell extracts from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoblotting (Fig.2 a), the wild-type or mutant NFATx protein was detected using specific anti-NFATx antiserum, with different molecular sizes being consistent with the different lengths of truncation. It was also notable that truncated molecules, especially in the case of X-Δ(CRI·SP123), showed reduced amounts of protein expression compared with wild-type NFATx. To examine the subcellular distribution of the mutant NFATx1 proteins, we next prepared extracts from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from COS cells transfected with these constructs, followed by immunoblot analysis. As expected, the wild-type NFATx protein showed highly selective cytoplasmic sequestration (Fig. 2 b, second lane). In contrast, when using cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from cells transfected with X-Δ(CRI), truncated NFATx protein was detected both in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2 b,third lane), consistent with observations in human NFATx1 protein (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when one or more SP motifs were truncated, the resultant NFATx proteins were detected preferentially in the nuclear fraction, but barely in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2 b,fourth through sixth lanes). These results are consistent with the notion that SP motifs, in addition to the CRI/SRR region, are critical for the regulation of subcellular localization of the NFATx protein (15Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A., Ho, S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 16Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To analyze the intracellular distribution of the wild-type and mutant NFATx proteins in individual cells, we generated GFP-fused constructs of NFATx mutants in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of each NFATx mutant was replaced with cDNA encoding GFP (Fig.3 a). When COS cells were transfected with the wild-type NFATx-GFP plasmid, the resultant NFATx-GFP protein was localized completely in the cytoplasm of transfected COS cells (Fig. 3 a, upper left panel). In contrast, X-Δ(CRI) showed nuclear distribution, whereas some fluorescence was also observed in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 a, upper right panel). When X-Δ(CRI·SP1) was transfected, increased nuclear distribution was observed (Fig.3 a, lower left panel). Interestingly, transfection of the NFATx-GFP mutant lacking SP1 and SP2 or all three SP motifs resulted in highly selective nuclear localization (Fig.3 a, lower middle and right panels). These results were also obtained when cells were counted for cytoplasmic/nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 3 b). Thus, serial truncation of SP motifs enhances nuclear localization of the NFATx protein. Based on the observation that CRI-truncated NFATx shows PMA-alone-induced transactivation (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we examined the activities of these NFATx mutants in inducing calcium ionophore-independent transactivation (Fig.4). Expression plasmids for wild-type or mutant NFATx proteins were transfected into Jurkat T cells with a reporter plasmid carrying three tandem copies of NFAT/AP-1 sites, followed by stimulation using PMA or PMA plus A23187. Jurkat cells transfected with the control pME18S plasmid showed weak NFAT transactivation upon stimulation with PMA plus A23187, which might reflect endogenous NFAT activity. When cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding wild-type NFATx, increased NFAT activity was observed in the presence of both PMA and A23187 (Fig. 4, second bar). In contrast, when cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding X-Δ(CRI), transactivation driven through NFAT sites was observed even after PMA-alone stimulation, despite the low activity (Fig. 4,third group of bars). These results are consistent with our previous observations in human NFATx (13Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.I. Arai K.I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, truncation of SP motifs dramatically increased PMA-alone-induced transactivation of mutant NFATx constructs. When SP1 was truncated in addition to CRI/SRR, transactivation was increased (Fig. 4, fourth group of bars). However, when SP1 and SP2 or all three SP motifs were truncated, these mutant NFATx constructs induced significantly increased transactivation upon PMA-alone stimulation, comparable to the stimulation with both PMA plus A23187 (Fig. 4, fifth andsixth groups of bars). The activities of these mutants were much stronger than the wild-type activity. Thus, CRI/SP deletion in NFATx results not only in increased nuclear localization, but also in efficient transactivation in the absence of calcium/calcineurin signaling. The increased transactivation by CRI/SP-truncated mut"
