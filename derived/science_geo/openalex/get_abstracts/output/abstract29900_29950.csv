https://openalex.org/W2061464631,"Molecular excitation by the simultaneous absorption of two photons provides intrinsic three-dimensional resolution in laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged effector molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2058650902,"The development and maintenance of the nervous system depends on proteins known as neurotrophic factors. Although the prototypical neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF), has been intensively studied for decades, the discovery and characterization of additional such factors has been impeded by their low abundance. Sequence homologies between NGF and the recently cloned brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to design a strategy that has now resulted in the cloning of a gene encoding a novel neurotrophic factor, termed neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The distribution of NT-3 messenger RNA and its biological activity on a variety of neuronal populations clearly distinguish NT-3 from NGF and BDNF, and provide compelling evidence that NT-3 is an authentic neurotrophic factor that has its own characteristic role in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2041802997,"Several mutants derived from transformed human B cell lines are defective in expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. The failure to express a class II gene in at least one such mutant line has been mapped to the MHC class II X box, a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter region. A complementary DNA encoding a DNA-binding protein (human X box binding protein, hXBP-1) whose target is the human DR alpha X box and the 3' flanking region has now been cloned. This complementary DNA encoded a protein with structural similarities to the c-jun proto-oncogene product, and its target sequence was closely related to the palindromic target sequence of c-jun. Mutation of the hXBP-1 DNA target sequence decreased DR alpha promoter activity in vivo. These studies suggest that the hXBP-1 protein acts as a transcription factor in B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014661756,"Excitable media are spatially distributed systems characterized by their ability to propagate signals undamped over long distances. Wave propagation in excitable media has been modeled extensively both by continuous partial differential equations and by discrete cellular automata. Cellular automata are desirable because of their intuitive appeal and efficient digital implementation, but until now they have not served as reliable models because they have lacked two essential properties of excitable media. First, traveling waves show dispersion, that is, the speed of wave propagation into a recovering region depends on the time elapsed since the preceding wave passed through that region. Second, wave speed depends on wave front curvature: curved waves travel with normal velocities noticeably different from the plane-wave velocity. These deficiencies of cellular automation models are remedied by revising the classical rules of the excitation and recovery processes. The revised model shows curvature and dispersion effects comparable to those of continuous models, it predicts rotating spiral wave solutions in quantitative accord with the theory of continuous excitable media, and it is parameterized so that the spatial step size of the automation can be adjusted for finer resolution of traveling waves."
https://openalex.org/W2116355277,"N-cadherin is a calcium-dependent, cell adhesion molecule that has been proposed to play a role in morphogenesis that has been proposed to play a role in morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos. Throughout early neural development, N-cadherin is expressed during the morphogenetic changes that occur when ectoderm, in response to neural induction, forms a neural plate and tube. To study the role of N-cadherin in these processes, cDNA clones encoding Xenopus laevis N-cadherin were isolated and used to study the expression of N-cadherin in frog embryos. These studies showed that N-cadherin RNA is not expressed at detectable levels in early cleavage embryos or in isolated ectoderm in the absence of neural induction. However, N-cadherin RNA rapidly appeared in ectoderm exposed to a heterologous neural inducer, indicating that N-cadherin expression, as an early response to induction, precedes the morphogenetic events associated with early neural development. The role of N-cadherin in these morphogenetic events was studied by ectopically expressing N-cadherin in the ectoderm of embryos prior to induction. The ectopic expression of this protein in ectoderm led to the formation of cell boundaries and to severe morphological defects. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the morphogenetic changes associated with early neural development are controlled, in part, by the induced expression of N-cadherin in the neural plate."
https://openalex.org/W1608305635,"We studied the mechanism of uptake and metabolism of exogenous phospholipids in mouse peritoneal macrophages using vesicles composed of various phospholipids and cholesterol. Macrophages in culture were found to actively incorporate and metabolize phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol vesicles containing small amounts of acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidic acid and to store the fatty acyl chains and cholesterol in triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester form in their cytosol. These cells exhibited massive amounts of oil red O-positive lipid droplets, a typical feature of foam cells. The metabolism of exogenous phospholipid vesicles was completely inhibited by chloroquine and cytochalasin B, suggesting that vesicle uptake occurs by endocytosis. A similar type of metabolism was observed in guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, macrophage cell line J774.1, but not in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Competition studies using various ligands for the scavenger receptor showed that acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL), dextran sulfate, or fucoidan was able to compete for up to 60% of the binding of phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles, and that copper-oxidized LDL (oxidized LDL) competed for more than 90% of the vesicle binding. On the other hand, phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles was able to compete for more than 90% of the binding of acetyl-LDL. These results indicate that acidic phospholipids are recognized by the scavenger receptors on the surface of macrophages and that more than one scavenger receptor exists on mouse peritoneal macrophages, i.e. one capable of recognizing acetyl-LDL, oxidized LDL, and an array of acidic phospholipids on membranes, and the other recognizing both acidic phospholipids and oxidized LDL but not acetyl-LDL."

https://openalex.org/W1628785169,"Highly purified fractions of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were prepared from chicken pectoralis muscles (Saito, A., Seiler, S., Chu, A., and Fleischer, S. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 875-885) and analyzed for the presence of creatine kinase (CK). Vesicles derived from longitudinal SR contained 0.703 +/- 0.428 IU of CK/mg of (SR) protein. Immunogold localization of muscle-type MM-CK on ultrathin cryosections of muscle, after removal of soluble CK, revealed relatively strong in situ labeling of M-CK remaining bound to the M band as well as to the SR membranes. In addition, purified SR vesicles were also labeled by anti-M-CK antibodies, and the peripheral labeling was similar to that observed with anti-Ca2(+)-ATPase antibodies. Only some particulate CK enzyme was released from isolated SR membranes by EDTA/low salt buffer, and CK was resistant to extraction by 0.6 M KCl. Thus, some of the MM-CK present in muscle displays strong associative behavior to the SR membranes. The SR-bound CK was sufficient to support, in the presence of phosphocreatine plus ADP, a significant portion of the maximal in vitro Ca2+ uptake rate. The ATP regeneration potential of SR-bound CK was similar to the rate of Ca2(+)-stimulated ATP hydrolysis of isolated SR vesicles. Thus, CK bound to SR may be physiologically relevant in vivo for regeneration of ATP used by the Ca2(+)-ATPase, as well as for regulation of local ATP/ADP ratios in the proximity of the Ca2+ pump and of other ATP-requiring reactions in the excitation-contraction coupling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1973302955,"The ion distribution in an electrolyte solution in contact with a charged polymerized phospholipid membrane was directly measured with long-period x-ray standing waves. The 27-angstrom-thick lipid monolayer was supported on a tungsten/silicon mirror. X-ray standing waves were generated above the mirror surface by total external reflection of a 9.8-kiloelectron volt x-ray beam from a synchrotron undulator. The membrane surface, which contained negatively charged phosphate headgroups, was bathed in a dilute ZnCl2 solution. The concentration of Zn2+ in the condensed layer at the membrane surface and the Zn2+ distribution in the diffuse layer were measured as a function of headgroup charge. The Debye length of the diffuse layer varied between 3 and 58 angstroms. The results qualitatively agree with the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model."
https://openalex.org/W1985300178,"SCG10 is a growth-associated protein that is expressed early in the development of neuronal derivatives of the neural crest. We describe here the isolation of the SCG10 chromosomal gene and the identification of regulatory regions that control its expression. The SCG10 transcription unit spans approximately 40 kb. Like other neural-specific genes, SCG10 contains multiple transcription initiation sites. The gene contains a constitutive enhancer-like element in the promoter-proximal region and a silencer located farther upstream. This silencer preferentially suppresses the activity of the enhancer in nonneuronal cells. Furthermore, the silencer is able to confer such preferential suppression upon a heterologous promoter in an orientation-independent manner. These data suggest that the expression of SCG10 in neuronal cells depends predominantly upon specific derepression."
https://openalex.org/W2053670375,"The role of thymic epithelium in the establishment of tissue tolerance was analyzed with a murine chimeric system. All T cells differentiated from birth onward in a thymus comprising allogeneic epithelium and syngeneic hematopoietic cells. Embryonic thymic rudiments that contained no hematopoietic cells from C3H (H-2k) donors were grafted to newborn athymic (nude) BALB/c (H-2d) mice. Chimeras that had normal T cell numbers and function rejected third-party skin grafts, but permanently accepted grafts syngeneic to the thymic epithelium. In vitro functional assays did not always correlate with the state of tolerance in vivo. Thus, pure thymic epithelium induces tolerance to histocompatibility antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2053498848,"Neurons with oscillatory properties are a common feature of the nervous system, but little is known about how neural oscillators shape the behavior of neuronal networks or how network interactions influence the properties of neural oscillators. Mathematical models are used to examine the effect of electrically coupling an oscillatory neuron to a second neuron that is either silent or tonically firing. Models of oscillatory neurons with varying degrees of complexity show that this coupling can either increase or decrease the frequency of an oscillator, depending on its membrane potential wave form, the state of the neuron to which it is coupled, and the strength of the coupling. Thus, electrical coupling provides a flexible mechanism for modifying the behavior of an oscillatory neural network."
https://openalex.org/W2118887037,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. MHC molecules can also bind endogenous self peptides, to which T cells are tolerant. Normal mice contained CTLs specific for self peptides that were from proteins of ubiquitous or tissue-restricted expression. In vivo, these endogenous self peptides are not naturally presented in sufficient density by somatic cells expressing MHC class I molecules. They can, however, be presented if added exogenously. Thus, our data imply that CTLs are only tolerant of those endogenous self peptide sequences that are presented by MHC class I-positive cells in a physiological manner."
https://openalex.org/W2050491079,"The hypothesis that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the small intestine during feeding causes satiety was tested in rat pups, 9 to 12 days old. Intragastric administration of soybean trypsin inhibitor, a procedure that releases CCK from the small intestine, decreased the subsequent intake of a test meal. This effect was reversed by prior treatment with MK-329, a selective antagonist of CCK at alimentary-type CCK (CCK-A) receptors. Thus, endogenous, small intestinal CCK can cause satiety in the neonatal rat and this effect involves CCK-A receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1570618376,"The relationship between histone acetylation and the capacity of H1 histones to cause the 0.15 M NaCl-induced aggregation/precipitation of transcriptionally active/competent gene chromatin fragments was investigated. Previous studies have shown that transcriptionally active/competent, but not repressed, gene chromatin polynucleosomes, which were isolated from chicken erythrocytes, remained soluble in 0.15 M NaCl after being reconstituted with H1 histones. This result suggested that some component of the active/competent gene nucleosome altered the capacity of the H1 histones to condense the chromatin fiber. Recently, Hebbes et al. (Hebbes, T.R., Thorne, A.W., and Crane-Robinson, C. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1395-1402) demonstrated directly that active, but not repressed, gene chromatin of chicken erythroid cells contain high levels of acetylated histones. Here, we show that the solubility of active/competent gene chromatin fragments in 0.15 M NaCl is dependent on the level of acetylated histone species, with induction of hyperacetylation increasing the solubility of this gene chromatin. Also, we show that lowering the levels of the acetylated histone forms reduces the ability of the active/competent gene chromatin fragments to resist exogenously added H1-histone-induced 0.15 M NaCl aggregation/precipitation. These results suggest that histone acetylation alters the capacity of the H1 histones to form compact higher order chromatin structures such that active/competent gene chromatin is maintained in a less folded state than the bulk of chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1969244122,"The validation of NGF as a physiologically important neurotrophic factor has led to intense efforts to identify novel polypeptide growth factors for neurons. We report here the details of a >80,000-fold purification of a neurotrophic molecule, referred to as growth-promoting activity (GPA), from chicken sciatic nerves. The final product of the purification migrated as a protein band of 21.5 kd, its apparent pi was approximately 4.8, and the ED50 of the most active preparation was approximately 10 pg/ml. Amino acid sequence of a proteolytic digestion fragment of GPA revealed homology with the recently published sequences for rabbit and rat sciatic nerve CNTF Thus this molecule may be the chicken form of CNTF Analysis of the specificity of action of GPA showed that, in addition to E8 ciliary ganglion neurons, the factor was able to support short-term survival of E8 dorsal root ganglion and E12 sympathetic neurons. This range of specificities of biological action was also seen with both acidic and basic FGF in the presence of heparin. The biological activity of GPA differed from that of FGF in that it was not potentiated by heparin and did not stimulate mitogenesis in chick fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1503371679,"The results of a thermodynamic calculation of the excess heat capacity that is based on experimental observations and that incorporates the effects of ligand binding on the two-state, thermal denaturation of a protein are presented. For a protein with a single-binding site on the native species and at subsaturating concentrations of ligand, bimodal or unimodal thermograms were computed merely by assuming a larger or smaller ligand association constant, respectively. The calculated thermograms for this simplified case show the salient features of those observed by differential scanning calorimetry for defatted human albumin monomer in the absence and presence of three ligands for which the protein has higher, intermediate, and lower affinity (Shrake, A., and Ross, P. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15392-15399). The computation demonstrates that biphasic unfolding can result from a significant increase in the free energy of denaturation (and the transition temperature) during the course of unfolding due to a substantial increase in free ligand concentration caused by the release of bound ligand by denaturing protein. Such ligand-induced biphasic denaturation does not relate to macromolecular substructure but derives from a perturbation, during unfolding, of the ligand binding equilibrium, which is coupled to the equilibrium between the folded and unfolded protein species. Thus, this bimodality is not limited to thermally induced unfolding but is operative independent of the means used to effect denaturation and therefore must be considered when studying any macromolecular folding/unfolding reaction in the presence of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2017550212,"A strategy of iterative site-directed mutagenesis and binding analysis was used to incorporate the receptor-binding determinants from human growth hormone (hGH) into the nonbinding homolog, human prolactin (hPRL). The complementary DNA for hPRL was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and mutated to introduce sequentially those substitutions from hGH that were predicted by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and other studies to be most critical for binding to the hGH receptor from human liver. After seven rounds of site-specific mutagenesis, a variant of hPRL was obtained containing eight mutations with an association constant for the hGH receptor that was increased more than 10,000-fold. This hPRL variant binds one-sixth as strongly as wild-type hGH, but shares only 26 percent overall sequence identity with hGH. These studies show the feasibility of recruiting receptor-binding properties from distantly related and functionally divergent hormones and show that a detailed functional database can be used to guide the design of a protein-protein interface in the absence of direct structural information."
https://openalex.org/W2036017389,"SCG10 is a neural-specific, growth-associated protein that is broadly expressed in the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems. Transgenic mice harboring a chimeric gene containing 4 kb of SCG10 5′ flanking DNA fused to the bacterial CAT gene exhibit expression in brain but not in nonneuronal tissues. A low level of expression is detected in adrenal gland as well, consistent with the behavior of endogenous SCG10. Such a transgene is also activated at the same relative stage of embryonic development as its endogenous counterpart. Deletion of the 5′-most 3.7 kb of SCG10 sequence yields deregulated expression of the transgene in numerous nonneuronal tissues, although expression remains highest in brain. In contrast to other tissue-specific genes, therefore, the specificity of SCG10 expression appears to be achieved predominantly through selective repression in nonneuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2157892196,"Injection of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) into Limulus ventral photoreceptors elevates the concentration of intracellular calcium ions and as a consequence depolarizes the photoreceptor. This InsP3-induced elevation can be inhibited by a prior injection of calcium or InsP3 delivered 1 s earlier. Recovery from this inhibition has a half-time of between 1.5 and 5 s at 20 degrees C. Calcium released by InsP3 therefore inhibits further release of calcium from InsP3-sensitive calcium stores. This feedback inhibition may protect the calcium stores from depletion during prolonged bright illumination. Feedback inhibition, rather than periodic depletion of calcium stores, may also underlie the oscillatory bursts of InsP3-induced calcium release that have been observed in many cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2004147052,"Cell cycle-regulated gene expression is essential for normal cell growth and development and loss of stringent growth control is associated with the acquisition of the transformed phenotype. The selective synthesis of histone proteins during the S phase of the cell cycle is required to render cells competent for the ordered packaging of replicating DNA into chromatin. Regulation of H4 histone gene transcription requires the proliferation-specific promoter binding factor HiNF-D. In normal diploid cells, HiNF-D binding activity is regulated during the cell cycle; nuclear protein extracts prepared from normal cells in S phase contain distinct and measurable HiNF-D binding activity, while this activity is barely detectable in G1 phase cells. In contrast, in tumor-derived or transformed cell lines, HiNF-D binding activity is constitutively elevated throughout the cell cycle and declines only with the onset of differentiation. The change from cell cycle-mediated to constitutive interaction of HiNF-D with the promoter of a cell growth-controlled gene is consistent with, and may be functionally related to, the loss of stringent cell growth regulation associated with neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1627304319,"Cloned 15-lipoxygenase has been expressed for the first time in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Transfection of osteosarcoma cells with a mammalian expression plasmid containing the cDNA for human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase resulted in cell lines that were capable of oxidizing body arachidonic acid and linoleic acid. The lipoxygenase metabolites were identified by reverse-phase and straight-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and direct mass spectrometry, verifying that the cDNA for 15-lipoxygenase encodes an enzyme with authentic 15-lipoxygenase activity. Incubation of the transformed cells with arachidonic acid generated 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 12-HETE in a ratio of 8.6 to 1, demonstrating that 15-lipoxygenase can also perform 12-lipoxygenation. Lesser amounts of 15-keto-ETE, four isomers of 8,15-diHETE, and one isomer of 14,15-diHETE were observed. Incubation with linoleic acid generated predominantly 13-hydroxy linoleic acid. The reaction was inhibited by eicosatetraynoic acid but not by indomethacin. Antibodies to a peptide corresponding to a unique region of the predicted amino acid sequence were generated and shown to react with one major band of 70 kDa on immunoblots of human leukocyte 15-lipoxygenase. To obtain antibodies to the full length enzyme, the cDNA was subcloned into a bacterial expression vector and was expressed as a fusion with the CheY protein. The overexpressed protein was readily purified from bacteria and was shown to be immunoreactive to the peptide-derived antibody. Antibodies raised to this recombinant enzyme did not cross-react with human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase but did identify 15-lipoxygenase in rabbit reticulocytes, human leukocytes, and tracheal epithelial cells, suggesting that the 15-lipoxygenases from these different cell types are structurally related."
https://openalex.org/W1599355628,"The rat osteosarcoma cell line (UMR 106-01) synthesizes and secretes relatively large amounts of a sulfated glycoprotein into its culture medium (approximately 240 ng/10(6) cells/day). This glycoprotein was purified, and amino-terminal sequence analysis identified it as bone sialoprotein (BSP). [35S]Sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]tyrosine were used as metabolic precursors to label the BSP. Sulfate esters were found on N- and O-linked oligosaccharides and on tyrosine residues, with about half of the total tyrosines in the BSP being sulfated. The proportion of 35S activity in tyrosine-O-sulfate (approximately 70%) was greater than that in N-linked (approximately 20%) and O-linked (approximately 10%) oligosaccharides. From the deduced amino acid sequence for rat BSP (Oldberg, A., Franzen, A., and Heinegard, D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19430-19432), the results indicate that on average approximately 12 tyrosine residues, approximately 3 N-linked, and approximately 2 O-linked oligosaccharides are sulfated/molecule. The carboxyl-terminal quarter of the BSP probably contains most, if not all, of the sulfated tyrosine residues because this region of the polypeptide contains the necessary requirements for tyrosine sulfation. Oligosaccharide analyses indicated that for every N-linked oligosaccharide on the BSP, there are also approximately 2 hexa-, approximately 5 tetra-, and approximately 2 trisaccharides O-linked to serine and threonine residues. On average, the BSP synthesized by UMR 106-01 cells would contain a total of approximately 3 N-linked and approximately 25 of the above O-linked oligosaccharides. This large number of oligosaccharides is in agreement with the known carbohydrate content (approximately 50%) of the BSP."

https://openalex.org/W1671079963,"Human leuserpin-2 (hLS2) cDNA variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed in a transient COS cell system. Functional analysis of the mutants revealed two regions in the NH2-terminal half of hLS2 which are essential for glycosaminoglycan-enhanced thrombin inhibition by hLS2. One of these regions, which encompasses a dimeric structure enriched in basic amino acids, is required for both glycosaminoglycan binding and glycosaminoglycan-mediated acceleration of thrombin inhibition. Deletion of another dimeric region, which spans a sequence with a high negative charge density, resulted in a strong reduction in the glycosaminoglycan-enhanced activity of hLS2. This polyanionic region displays structural and functional similarities to the COOH-terminal end of hirudin, another potent thrombin inhibitor, indicating that both inhibitors may have a common binding site on thrombin. Based on our observations we propose a model for the activation of hLS2 by glycosaminoglycans. The key feature of this model is the suggestion that the glycosaminoglycan-enhanced reaction between hLS2 and thrombin is mediated by at least two regions of contact, involving both the reactive center region and the acidic domain of hLS2. Binding of glycosaminoglycans to hLS2 is suggested to result first in the release of the acidic region from intramolecular interactions. Then, amino acid sequences in thrombin are proposed to interact with the acidic dimer of hLS2."
https://openalex.org/W2061278626,"We have identified the initial synaptic contacts made onto the Mauthner (M) cell, an identified neuron that arises during early development of the zebrafish hind-brain. The contacts are made by a small bundle of pioneering trigeminal sensory axons onto the M cell soma before it forms dendrites. The sensory bundle is then partially enveloped by the M cell. The lateral dendrite appears at about the site of the contact, and eventually the trigeminal inputs are shifted to its trunk. As the dendrite elongates, other sensory contacts are made on its distal regions, sequentially from the acoustico-vestibular nerve and the lateral line nerves. To learn whether the earliest inputs induce the initial outgrowth of the M cell dendrite, we ablated the trigeminal neurons by laser irradiation before they contacted the M cell. Morphogenesis of the M cell, including its dendrite, appeared normal."

Each molecule bound one molecule of iron with a Kd of 9 X 10(-5). Dissociation of iron and the protein was accelerated at acid pH. Using an immunogold method, the protein was identified in the apical cytoplasm of proximal small intestinal cells and was not observed elsewhere in the intestinal mucosa and in other body organs.

https://openalex.org/W2022460161,"The number and metabolic stability of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at neuromuscular junctions of rat tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were examined after denervation, paralysis by continuous application of tetrodotoxin to the nerve, or denervation and direct stimulation of the muscle through implanted electrodes. After 18 days of denervation AChR half-life declined from about 10 days to 2.3 days (TA) or 3.6 days (SOL) and after 18 days of nerve conduction block to 3.1 days (TA). In contrast, the total number of AChRs per endplate was unaffected by these treatments. Denervation for 33 days had no further effect on AChR half-life but reduced the total number of AChRs to about 54% (SOL) or 38% (TA) of normal. Direct stimulation of the 33-day denervated SOL from day 18 restored normal AChR stability and counteracted muscle atrophy but had no effect on the decline in AChR number. The results indicate that motoneurons control the stability of junctional AChRs through evoked muscle activity and the number of junctional AChRs through trophic factors."

https://openalex.org/W1497861677,"Adh distal factor-1 (Adf-1) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity originally identified in Drosophila tissue culture cells and embryos. Adf-1 binds to upstream recognition elements in each of the two promoters of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh), and binding of Adf-1 to the Adh distal promoter site activates transcription. We have carried out a mutational analysis of the Adh distal promoter using both an in vitro transcription assay and a transient transfection assay in Drosophila tissue culture cells, and in both cases find that deletion of sequences required for Adf-1 binding leads to a 3-4-fold drop in transcription. We have purified Adf-1 and demonstrate by a sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel renaturation assay that it is a 34-kDa protein. Purified Adf-1 activates Adh distal promoter transcription in vitro in a binding site-dependent manner. DNase I footprint analysis shows that the purified protein binds not only to the two previously characterized sites in Adh but also to transcriptional regulatory elements in the dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and Antennapedia (Antp) P1 promoters. Thus, it appears that Adf-1 may play an important role not only in the regulation of Adh expression but also in the transcription of other Drosophila genes as well."
https://openalex.org/W1552139096,"Assembly of nucleosomes on a 5 S DNA plasmid with histone H3.H4-N1 complex and histone H2A-H2B dimers causes a marked, 30-300-fold repression of 5 S RNA transcription. This repression is a time-dependent process that parallels the process of nucleosome formation. At physiological histone levels, DNA plasmids carrying nucleosomes with only histones H3 and H4 are transcriptionally permissive. The histone H3-H4 chromatin becomes transcriptionally nonpermissive when histone H2A-H2B dimers complement the nucleosome assembly reaction. H3-H4-H2A-H2B nucleosomes, but not H3-H4 nucleosomes, displace a DNA-bound transcription factor IIIA. In contrast, a preassembled 5 S RNA transcription complex is refractory to inactivation by nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1564076854,"A recently isolated cDNA for human complement protein C2, C2HL5-3, has an unusually long 5'-untranslated region (UTR) containing four open reading frames upstream of the authentic initiation codon. Here we report that deletion of the 5'-UTR of C2HL5-3 resulted in a 10-fold enhancement in the translational efficiency of C2 in transient eukaryotic cellular assays. Elimination of the open reading frames in the 5'-UTR by site-directed mutagenesis of the initiation codons did not affect C2 synthesis in this assay system, indicating that other structural elements in this region are responsible for translational control. We also show that several C2 mRNAs of varying length in the 5'-UTR, including an alternative C2 mRNA expressing a considerably shorter 5'-UTR, are present in the liver and that the shorter C2 mRNA is the only C2 message found in U937 cells. These results suggest that tissue-specific utilization of alternative transcriptional start sites results in differential translational efficiencies of C2 and may provide insights into the tissue- and stimulus-specific regulation of eukaryotic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1594663316,"We have devised an in vitro assay system to study the transcriptional activity of native chicken progesterone receptor (cPR). Purified cPR added to cell-free extracts from HeLa cell nuclei stimulates accurate transcription from a promoter driven by two progesterone response elements. The transcriptional enhancement is entirely progesterone response element dependent and promoter specific. We have defined the appropriate conditions of template, nuclear extract, salt, and magnesium ion requirements for efficient transcriptional enhancement by cPR. Under optimized conditions, a synthesis rate of one transcript/20 promoters is achieved in the presence of saturating amounts of cPR. Kinetic studies suggest that the progesterone receptor can form a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors present in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extract. Following formation of this complex, transcription can commence rapidly upon addition of nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1605772581,"The structure of serine carboxypeptidase II from wheat bran has been determined to 3.5-A resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement, solvent flattening, and crystallographic refinement. The amino acid sequence has been fit to the electron density map and the model refined to a conventional crystallographic R factor of 20.9%. The molecule is an alpha + beta protein and contains a catalytic triad (Asp338, His397, and Ser146) similar in arrangement to those in chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The -fold of the polypeptide backbone is, however, completely different from those enzymes. This suggests that this is a third example of convergent evolution to a common enzymatic mechanism. The -fold is, on the other hand, surprisingly similar to that of the zinc proteinase carboxypeptidase A."
https://openalex.org/W1520479375,"Studies reported from this laboratory have demonstrated that O-glycosidic glycoproteins of salivary, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal origin are acylated by fatty acyltransferase residing in Golgi and microsome-enriched fraction (Slomiany, A., Liau, Y.H., Takagi, A., Laszewicz, W., and Slomiany, B.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13304-13308). Here we report on the successful purification of this enzyme from rough microsomal membranes of rat gastric mucosa and its identification in a number of diverse tissues and organs, such as heart, liver, pancreas, lung, kidney, salivary glands, and lymphoblasts. The enzymatic activity has been released from the stripped and salt-extracted microsomes with 0.5% Triton X-100 and recovered from 100,000 x g supernatant by affinity chromatography on Cibacron blue F3GA column. The retained fatty acyltransferase protein was selectively displaced from the column with 50 microM palmitoyl-CoA. On nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzymatic activity was associated with a 234-kDa complex, and on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the complex afforded 65- and 67-kDa protein bands. Incubation of microsomes with trypsin prior to enzyme extraction resulted in a 50% inactivation of the fatty acyltransferase and generation of 53- and 55-kDa protein bands, which also had affinity to Cibacron blue F3GA and were displaced from the column together with the active (intact) enzyme. We suggest that the fatty acyltransferase is an integral rough microsomal protein partially exposed to cytosol, which catalyzes the fatty acyl-CoA-protein reaction on the cytosolic site of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and that this enzyme is responsible for processing of the group of protein which are entering rough endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1505518040,"Having discovered that the A domain of diphtheria toxin exhibits intrinsic nuclease activity (Chang, M. P., Baldwin, R. L., Bruce, B., and Wisnieski, B. J. (1989) Science 246, 1165-1168), we proceeded to examine the requirements for optimal enzymic expression. In vitro assays with linear double-stranded DNA demonstrated that optimal activity occurs at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C. A characterization of the stringent cation-dependence of the reaction revealed increasing activity with increasing Mn2+ up to 30 mM. In contrast, activity levels with Ca2+ or Zn2+ alone peaked at 100 microM and with Mg2+ alone at 1 mM. The Zn2(+)- and Mg2(+)-stimulated activities appear to be dependent on trace amounts of Ca2+. Indeed, inclusion of 2 mM Ca2+ plus 3 mM Mg2+ in the reaction buffer promoted a high level of DNA cleavage even though very little cleavage was seen with either cation alone at 2-3 mM. Addition of 20-200 mM NaCl or KCl caused progressive inhibition. Detection of diphtheria toxin nuclease activity under physiologically relevant conditions suggests that it may be operative in vivo and supports our contention that diphtheria toxin-induced cytolysis is not a simple consequence of protein synthesis inhibition, but rather the final step in a cytolytic pathway linked to chromosomal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1637672472,"Adsorption of caltrin on a cation exchanger during purification transformed it from inhibitor to enhancer of calcium uptake. Ether extracts of acidified preparations of bovine seminal plasma transformed enhancer caltrin back to inhibitory caltrin; this capacity of the ether extracts was lost after incubation with an anion exchanger, indicating that anions in the extract could be responsible for the reversal of caltrin activity. Of the anions identified in the ether extract of acidified bovine seminal plasma, phosphatidylserine converted enhancer caltrin to the inhibitory form at pH 7.4. Citrate at millimolar concentrations lowered calcium uptake of sperm in the presence of enhancer caltrin to near control levels. Cardiolipin at concentrations comparable to its natural occurrence in the seminal plasma prevented enhancer caltrin from stimulating the sperm cells to take up calcium above their usual capacity. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine derived from bovine brain, phosphatidylethanolamine from bovine heart, and other phospholipids with transition temperatures higher than the assay temperature had no effect on the activity of enhancer caltrin, while dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine had an effect on enhancer caltrin similar to that of citrate. Phosphatidylinositol from soybean was also capable of lowering caltrin-stimulated calcium uptake in bovine sperm to control levels. Data on enhancer caltrin fluorescence in the presence of phosphatidylserine from bovine brain suggest conformational changes in the protein due to binding of the phospholipid. In comparison, the phosphatidylcholine from bovine brain appeared not to alter enhancer caltrin."
https://openalex.org/W2001327625,"Habituation was investigated in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells by measuring the decrease in cellular secretion of norepinephrine with repetitive stimulation by either membrane depolarization or acetylcholine. When these two types of repetitive stimulation were applied to the same cells, habituation occurred independently to each, showing that two pathways for habituation can be utilized simultaneously in single cells. The two pathways apparently process stimuli in parallel, without competition between common intermediates."

Since the 1970s, labor force growth in both countries is slowing even more than population growth, and both countries are aging. Economic effects of slowing growth can be compensated for by increased participation in the labor force and increased productivity and by adjustments in the military forces. Economic flexibility and policy choices will determine how successfully the trend to slower population growth will be accommodated."
