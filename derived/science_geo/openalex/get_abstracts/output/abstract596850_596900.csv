The results implicate new genes in CHD pathogenesis and highlight striking overlap between genes with damaging de novo mutations in individuals with CHD and autism. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality from birth defects. Here, exome sequencing of a single cohort of 2,871 CHD probands, including 2,645 parent–offspring trios, implicated rare inherited mutations in 1.8%, including a recessive founder mutation in GDF1 accounting for ∼5% of severe CHD in Ashkenazim, recessive genotypes in MYH6 accounting for ∼11% of Shone complex, and dominant FLT4 mutations accounting for 2.3% of Tetralogy of Fallot. De novo mutations (DNMs) accounted for 8% of cases, including ∼3% of isolated CHD patients and ∼28% with both neurodevelopmental and extra-cardiac congenital anomalies. Seven genes surpassed thresholds for genome-wide significance, and 12 genes not previously implicated in CHD had >70% probability of being disease related. DNMs in ∼440 genes were inferred to contribute to CHD. Striking overlap between genes with damaging DNMs in probands with CHD and autism was also found."
https://openalex.org/W2737053924,"Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have become a prominent cancer model system, as they are presumed to faithfully represent the genomic features of primary tumors. Here we monitored the dynamics of copy number alterations (CNAs) in 1,110 PDX samples across 24 cancer types. We observed rapid accumulation of CNAs during PDX passaging, often due to selection of preexisting minor clones. CNA acquisition in PDXs was correlated with the tissue-specific levels of aneuploidy and genetic heterogeneity observed in primary tumors. However, the particular CNAs acquired during PDX passaging differed from those acquired during tumor evolution in patients. Several CNAs recurrently observed in primary tumors gradually disappeared in PDXs, indicating that events undergoing positive selection in humans can become dispensable during propagation in mice. Notably, the genomic stability of PDXs was associated with their response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs. These findings have major implications for PDX-based modeling of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2763836527,"We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with replication in 36,180 Chinese individuals and performed further transancestry meta-analyses with data from the Psychiatry Genomics Consortium (PGC2). Approximately 95% of the genome-wide significant (GWS) index alleles (or their proxies) from the PGC2 study were overrepresented in Chinese schizophrenia cases, including ∼50% that achieved nominal significance and ∼75% that continued to be GWS in the transancestry analysis. The Chinese-only analysis identified seven GWS loci; three of these also were GWS in the transancestry analyses, which identified 109 GWS loci, thus yielding a total of 113 GWS loci (30 novel) in at least one of these analyses. We observed improvements in the fine-mapping resolution at many susceptibility loci. Our results provide several lines of evidence supporting candidate genes at many loci and highlight some pathways for further research. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the genetic architecture and biological etiology of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2762997972,"Chemotherapy side effects are often reported in clinical trials; however, there is little evidence about their incidence in routine clinical care. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency and severity of patient-reported chemotherapy side effects in routine care across treatment centres in Australia.We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals with breast, lung or colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Side effects were identified by patient self-report. The frequency, prevalence and incidence rates of side effects were calculated by cancer type and grade, and cumulative incidence curves for each side effect computed. Frequencies of side effects were compared between demographic subgroups using chi-squared statistics.Side effect data were available for 449 eligible individuals, who had a median follow-up of 5.64 months. 86% of participants reported at least one side effect during the study period and 27% reported a grade IV side effect, most commonly fatigue or dyspnoea. Fatigue was the most common side effect overall (85%), followed by diarrhoea (74%) and constipation (74%). Prevalence and incidence rates were similar across side effects and cancer types. Age was the only demographic factor associated with the incidence of side effects, with older people less likely to report side effects.This research has produced the first Australian estimates of self-reported incidence of chemotherapy side effects in routine clinical care. Chemotherapy side effects in routine care are common, continue throughout chemotherapy and can be serious. This work confirms the importance of observational data in providing clinical practice-relevant information to decision-makers."

Our results also suggest parallels between partial and/or biased agonism in RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as new therapeutic opportunities for correcting RTK signaling output. Structural understanding of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation has advanced greatly in recent years (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2010; 141: 1117-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar), with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) being among the most intensely studied (Kovacs et al., 2015Kovacs E.

Biochem. 2015; 84: 739-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A primary focus has been to understand how ligand binding drives RTKs from their inactive to active forms, assuming that a single ligand-induced dimeric species represents the active state. Although this assumption may be reasonable for RTKs with only one activating ligand, it breaks down when trying to explain how EGFR family RTKs signal differently in response to their multiple cognate ligands (Sweeney and Carraway, 2000Sweeney C.

Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), which fall into two groups based on receptor-binding affinity. The high-affinity ligands are EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), betacellulin (BTC), and heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which bind cell-surface EGFR with apparent Kd of 0.1–1 nM. The low-affinity ligands are epiregulin (EREG), epigen (EPGN), and amphiregulin (AREG), which bind 10- to 100-fold more weakly. Numerous studies report distinct EGFR-dependent cellular responses to the different ligands (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson K.J. Gilmore J.L. Foley J. Lemmon M.A. Riese 2nd, D.J.

It remains unclear from current mechanistic understanding how different ligands could promote distinct cellular signaling responses through the same RTK. Crystal structures have described how EGF or TGFα induce formation of activated EGFR dimers (Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J.

Our more recent work (Bessman et al., 2014Bessman N.J. Bagchi A. Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Complex relationship between ligand binding and dimerization in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1306-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), however, has argued that relationships between extracellular ligand binding and receptor dimerization are more complex than suggested by these models—allowing the possibility that different EGFR ligands induce distinct dimers (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson K.J. Gilmore J.L. Foley J. Lemmon M.A. Riese 2nd, D.J. Functional selectivity of EGF family peptide growth factors: Implications for cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 122: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here, we describe crystallographic and cellular studies that reveal how two EGFR ligands, epiregulin and epigen, do indeed drive the EGFR extracellular region into dimers with different structures. We show that the resulting ligand-induced dimers are weaker and more short-lived than those induced by EGF, altering signaling kinetics in a way that profoundly influences cellular outcome. Our findings suggest unexpected parallels with the biased agonism observed for some G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands (Lane et al., 2017Lane J.R. May L.T. Parton R.G. Sexton P.M.

How ligands illuminate GPCR molecular pharmacology.Cell. 2017; 170: 414-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and further suggest that kinetic proofreading might play an important role in controlling ligand discrimination and RTK signaling specificity (Swain and Siggia, 2002Swain P.S. Siggia E.D. The role of proofreading in signal transduction specificity.Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2928-2933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To ask whether individual EGFR ligands can stabilize different dimeric configurations of the EGFR extracellular region (sEGFR), we first determined the 2.9-Å structure (Figure 1A) of a complex between epiregulin and sEGFR501 (EREG/sEGFR501). The sEGFR501 construct was used for the earliest structural studies of EGFR (Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. et al.Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and contains both β helix/solenoid ligand-binding domains of the receptor (domains I and III) plus the complete cysteine-rich laminin-like domain II that includes the key dimerization arm. Most of domain IV (residues 482–618), which contributes very little to dimerization (Dawson et al., 2005Dawson J.P. Berger M.B. Lin C.C. Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Epidermal growth factor receptor dimerization and activation require ligand-induced conformational changes in the dimer interface.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7734-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), is absent from sEGFR501. As in every ErbB receptor dimer (Ferguson, 2008Ferguson K.M. Structure-based view of epidermal growth factor receptor regulation.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), dimerization of the EREG/sEGFR501 complex is mediated by domain II, with the dimerization arm at the center of the interface. Remarkably, however, as seen by comparing Figures 1A and 1B, the relationship between the two sEGFR501 protomers (gray and green) in the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer is strikingly different from that seen for TGFα/sEGFR501 (Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. et al.Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The EREG/sEGFR501 dimer (Figure 1A) displays a distinct asymmetry that contrasts with the 2-fold symmetry seen in TGFα/sEGFR501 (Figure 1B) and EGF/sEGFR dimers (Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. et al.Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2010Lu C. Mi L.Z. Grey M.J. Zhu J. Graef E. Yokoyama S. Springer T.A. Structural evidence for loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5432-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Ogiso et al., 2002Ogiso H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Yamanaka M. Kim J.H. Saito K. Sakamoto A. Inoue M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of the complex of human epidermal growth factor and receptor extracellular domains.Cell. 2002; 110: 775-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). As cartooned in the lower parts of Figures 1A and B, this asymmetry arises because domain II in the right-hand (green) epiregulin-bound sEGFR molecule has failed to undergo the “bend” usually observed upon wedging of ligand between domains I and III. As a result, the “unbent” domain II in the right-hand (green) receptor molecule of the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer projects beyond its (gray) neighbor at the top of the dimer interface by ∼7 Å (Figure 1C). Importantly, the fact that the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer differs in structure from other sEGFR dimers confirms the proposal that individual EGFR ligands can stabilize distinct EGFR conformations (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson K.J. Gilmore J.L. Foley J. Lemmon M.A. Riese 2nd, D.J. Functional selectivity of EGF family peptide growth factors: Implications for cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 122: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which might underlie differential signaling. It is appealing to hypothesize that the distinct conformation of epiregulin-activated EGFR allows it to engage a unique subset of downstream effectors—which would make this ligand a biased agonist (Lane et al., 2017Lane J.R. May L.T. Parton R.G. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. A kinetic view of GPCR allostery and biased agonism.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Alternatively, epiregulin might be a partial agonist that simply signals less strongly (but through the same effectors) at a given degree of receptor occupancy—as suggested in studies of other EGFR ligands (Macdonald-Obermann and Pike, 2014Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. Different epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands show distinct kinetics and biased or partial agonism for homodimer and heterodimer formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 26178-26188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The key structural differences responsible for asymmetry of the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer are clearest in the upper part of the dimer interface, detailed in Figure 1C. The bend in domain II of the left-hand (gray) molecule allows its N-terminal region to contact its unbent counterpart in the right-hand (green) molecule. The result is an intimate interface between the two sEGFR501 molecules in the upper part of Figure 1C, burying 641 Å2 of surface. The equivalent interface fails to form in the symmetric TGFα/sEGFR501 dimer (Figure 1D), with only 213 Å2 buried (Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. et al.Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Domain II residues engaged directly in the asymmetric epiregulin-induced sEGFR501 dimer interface (Q194, S196, P204, H209, P219, E221, and D238: bold in Figure 1C) do not participate in the interface of TGFα- or EGF-induced dimers (Figure 1D). Intriguingly, however, these residues are conserved in Drosophila EGFR (dEGFR), where they make almost identical sets of interactions (Figure S1) in the asymmetric dimer of the dEGFR extracellular region induced by its ligand Spitz (Alvarado et al., 2010Alvarado D. Klein D.E. Lemmon M.A. Structural basis for negative cooperativity in growth factor binding to an EGF receptor.Cell. 2010; 142: 568-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Formation of the asymmetric dimer shown in Figures 1A and S1 is therefore an evolutionarily conserved property of EGFR. The distinct sEGFR dimer structure induced by epiregulin led us to ask how such relatively small structural differences in the extracellular region might be propagated across the membrane to alter signaling. Studies using chemical biology tools have suggested that different EGFR ligands can stabilize distinct intracellular structures (Doerner et al., 2015Doerner A. Scheck R. Schepartz A. Growth factor identity is encoded by discrete coiled-coil rotamers in the EGFR juxtamembrane region.Chem. Biol. 2015; 22: 776-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Scheck et al., 2012Scheck R.A. Lowder M.A. Appelbaum J.S. Schepartz A. Bipartite tetracysteine display reveals allosteric control of ligand-specific EGFR activation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most other reports, by contrast, argue for loose or flexible linkage between extra- and intracellular regions of EGFR (Lu et al., 2010Lu C. Mi L.Z. Grey M.J. Zhu J. Graef E. Yokoyama S. Springer T.A. Structural evidence for loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5432-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2012Lu C. Mi L.Z. Schürpf T. Walz T. Springer T.A. Mechanisms for kinase-mediated dimerization of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 38244-38253Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Mi et al., 2011Mi L.Z. Lu C. Li Z. Nishida N. Walz T. Springer T.A. Simultaneous visualization of the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)—making straightforward conformational coupling mechanisms difficult to envision. We therefore also considered the possibility that EGFR dimers induced by different ligands might differ in their stability and/or lifetime. The increased buried surface in the N-terminal part of the domain II dimer interface (Figure 1C) initially suggested that EREG/sEGFR501 dimers might be stronger than TGFα/sEGFR501 dimers. At the same time, however, key intermolecular contacts involving the gray dimerization arm (Figure 1C, far right and bottom panel) are substantially compromised by the asymmetry of the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer. As a result, the surface area buried in the central dimerization arm region of EREG/sEGFR501 dimers (1,350 Å2) is ∼30% lower than in TGFα/sEGFR501 dimers (Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. et al.Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), and 40% lower than in EGF/sEGFR dimers (Lu et al., 2010Lu C. Mi L.Z. Grey M.J. Zhu J. Graef E. Yokoyama S. Springer T.A. Structural evidence for loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5432-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This reduction results primarily from loss of a key interaction between Y251 in the dimerization arm of the gray molecule and R285 in disulfide-bonded module m6 of its green dimerization partner (Figures 1C and 1D). In TGFα/sEGFR501 and EGF/sEGFR dimers, Y251 and R285 make key intermolecular cation-π interactions on both sides of the symmetric dimer (dotted lines in Figure 1D). Disrupting these by mutation abolishes ligand-induced receptor activation (Ogiso et al., 2002Ogiso H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Yamanaka M. Kim J.H. Saito K. Sakamoto A. Inoue M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of the complex of human epidermal growth factor and receptor extracellular domains.Cell. 2002; 110: 775-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The EREG/sEGFR501 dimer only retains this interaction on the left side of the dimer (Figure 1C). On the right side, by contrast, Y251 and R285 are separated by >12 Å (Figure 1C, lower panel) because the gray dimerization arm is displaced—failing to dock into its canonical site (involving modules m4, m5, and m6) and instead making only limited interactions with modules m6 and m7. EREG/sEGFR501 dimer asymmetry also distorts the “buttressed” module m6 interactions involving D279 and H280 (asterisk in Figure 1D), which are crucial for EGFR dimerization (Dawson et al., 2005Dawson J.P. Berger M.B. Lin C.C. Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Epidermal growth factor receptor dimerization and activation require ligand-induced conformational changes in the dimer interface.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7734-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, despite additional interactions in the N-terminal part of the EREG/sEGFR501 dimer interface, the distorted dimerization arm interactions suggest that the epiregulin-induced sEGFR dimer may actually be weaker than TGFα- or EGF-induced dimers. Reduced dimerization strength could be just as important for altered signaling as any specific structural differences, perhaps weakening signaling by the occupied receptor (epiregulin behaving as a partial agonist). A 3.0-Å resolution crystal structure of epigen bound to sEGFR501 (EPGN/sEGFR501) provides further weight to the argument that certain EGFR ligands induce weakened receptor dimers. Unexpectedly, the crystallized EPGN/sEGFR501 complex was monomeric (Figure 2A). The most extensive receptor/receptor interface in the EPGN/sEGFR501 crystals involves only limited domain III contacts, forming a dimer that is sterically infeasible in the membrane. The absence of domain II-mediated dimers in EPGN/sEGFR501 crystals cannot reflect incomplete ligand saturation, since epigen binds sEGFR501 with Kd = 2.8 μM (Figure S2A) yet was present at 280 μM during crystallization (and ∼13 mM in crystals). Moreover, clear electron density for epigen was seen in the ligand-binding site (Figure S3A). As in all other ligand-bound ErbB receptor extracellular regions, epigen bridges domains I and III, which adopt positions characteristic of the “untethered” receptor conformation (Ferguson, 2008Ferguson K.M. Structure-based view of epidermal growth factor receptor regulation.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Whereas all other ligand/sErbB complexes have crystallized as domain II-mediated dimers, the EPGN/sEGFR501 complex structure instead closely resembles the monomeric ErbB2 extracellular region (Figure 2B), which has no known ligand and does not homodimerize (Ferguson et al., 2000Ferguson K.M.

Since the domain arrangement in sEGFR501 is different when bound to epigen than to TGFα, we generated possible (symmetric) dimers in three ways, in order to assess the approximate nature of the dimer interface:Dimer 1 was generated using domain I to guide alignment. In this hypothetical dimer, dimerization arm interactions are disrupted, and there is minimal intermolecular interaction elsewhere in the dimer interface. This is likely to be a very weak dimer.Dimer 2 was generated using domain II alignment. In this hypothetical dimer, dimerization arm contacts form normally, but there is no intermolecular contact outside the dimerization arm. This dimer is also expected to be very weak.Dimer 3 was generated using domain III alignment. In this hypothetical dimer there are severe steric clashes between the two molecules, suggesting that it is highly unlikely to form.Collectively, these models argue that dimerization of the EPGN/sEGFR501 complex will be very weak (as we show experimentally) or will require significant conformational changes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S3Binding of Epiregulin and Epigen to sEGFR501, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Electron density for the two molecules in the EPGN/sEGFR501 crystal structure (chain A left, chain D right). A composite simulated annealing omit map (calculated using PHENIX) is shown contoured at 1.5σ. sEGFR501 is shown in ribbon view, with receptor density shown in light gray and sEGFR domains colored as follows: domain I (blue), domain II (green), domain III (yellow), domain IV (red). Density for the bound epigen (cyan) is evident in both molecules. In the right-hand molecule (chain D), ligand density near domain I is less clear, and this part of this epigen was not modeled. Note that the region containing (C-terminal) disulfide-bonded modules m7 and m8 in domain II (marked with an asterisk) has a different conformation between the two molecules, resulting in part from the involvement of this region of chain D in crystal packing contacts. The relative positions of domains I and III are also slightly different, possibly as a result of restraints in the domain II conformation of chain D that limit epigen contacts with domain I in this complex. Figures 2 and 3 both use sEGFR501 chain A coordinates.(B) The EREG/sEGFR501 dimer in ribbon view as in Figure 1A, colored by B factor – from blue (lowest values) to red (highest values).

Here we present a draft genome assembly of D. zibethinus, representing the third plant genus in the Malvales order and first in the Helicteroideae subfamily to be sequenced. Single-molecule sequencing and chromosome contact maps enabled assembly of the highly heterozygous durian genome at chromosome-scale resolution. Transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of sulfur-, ethylene-, and lipid-related pathways in durian fruits. We observed paleopolyploidization events shared by durian and cotton and durian-specific gene expansions in MGL (methionine γ-lyase), associated with production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). MGL and the ethylene-related gene ACS (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase) were upregulated in fruits concomitantly with their downstream metabolites (VSCs and ethylene), suggesting a potential association between ethylene biosynthesis and methionine regeneration via the Yang cycle. The durian genome provides a resource for tropical fruit biology and agronomy."
https://openalex.org/W2761651210,"Condensin protein complexes coordinate the formation of mitotic chromosomes and thereby ensure the successful segregation of replicated genomes. Insights into how condensin complexes bind to chromosomes and alter their topology are essential for understanding the molecular principles behind the large-scale chromatin rearrangements that take place during cell divisions. Here, we identify a direct DNA-binding site in the eukaryotic condensin complex, which is formed by its Ycg1Cnd3 HEAT-repeat and Brn1Cnd2 kleisin subunits. DNA co-crystal structures reveal a conserved, positively charged groove that accommodates the DNA double helix. A peptide loop of the kleisin subunit encircles the bound DNA and, like a safety belt, prevents its dissociation. Firm closure of the kleisin loop around DNA is essential for the association of condensin complexes with chromosomes and their DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. Our data suggest a sophisticated molecular basis for anchoring condensin complexes to chromosomes that enables the formation of large-sized chromatin loops."

However, these natural processes in materials fabrication are not readily programmable. Here, we use a synthetic-biology approach to assemble patterned materials. We demonstrate programmable fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) materials by printing engineered self-patterning bacteria on permeable membranes that serve as a structural scaffold. Application of gold nanoparticles to the colonies creates hybrid organic-inorganic dome structures. The dynamics of the dome structures' response to pressure is determined by their geometry (colony size, dome height, and pattern), which is easily modified by varying the properties of the membrane (e.g., pore size and hydrophobicity). We generate resettable pressure sensors that process signals in response to varying pressure intensity and duration."

https://openalex.org/W2761837169,"Competition among RNAs to bind miRNA is proposed to influence biological systems. However, the role of this competition in disease onset is unclear. Here, we report that TYRP1 mRNA, in addition to encoding tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), indirectly promotes cell proliferation by sequestering miR-16 on non-canonical miRNA response elements. Consequently, the sequestered miR-16 is no longer able to repress its mRNA targets, such as RAB17, which is involved in melanoma cell proliferation and tumour growth. Restoration of miR-16 tumour-suppressor function can be achieved in vitro by silencing TYRP1 or increasing miR-16 expression. Importantly, TYRP1-dependent miR-16 sequestration can also be overcome in vivo by using small oligonucleotides that mask miR-16-binding sites on TYRP1 mRNA. Together, our findings assign a pathogenic non-coding function to TYRP1 mRNA and highlight miRNA displacement as a promising targeted therapeutic approach for melanoma. Gilot et al. have found that TYRP1 mRNA, in addition to coding for TYRP1 protein, can promote melanoma by sequestering the tumour suppressor miR-16, thus de-repressing the mRNA transcription of miR-16 target RAB17, which is involved in melanoma cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2762874816,"Adrenergic stimulation promotes lipid mobilization and oxidation in brown and beige adipocytes, where the harnessed energy is dissipated as heat in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis. The signaling cascades and energy-dissipating pathways that facilitate thermogenesis have been extensively described, yet little is known about the counterbalancing negative regulatory mechanisms. Here, we identify a two-pore-domain potassium channel, KCNK3, as a built-in rheostat negatively regulating thermogenesis. Kcnk3 is transcriptionally wired into the thermogenic program by PRDM16, a master regulator of thermogenesis. KCNK3 antagonizes norepinephrine-induced membrane depolarization by promoting potassium efflux in brown adipocytes. This limits calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and dampens adrenergic signaling, thereby attenuating lipolysis and thermogenic respiration. Adipose-specific Kcnk3 knockout mice display increased energy expenditure and are resistant to hypothermia and obesity. These findings uncover a critical K+-Ca2+-adrenergic signaling axis that acts to dampen thermogenesis, maintain tissue homeostasis, and reveal an electrophysiological regulatory mechanism of adipocyte function."

The carboxylation rate is slow (kcatc = ∼1 to 5 reactions/s in plants) and often confines flux through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, hence limiting the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth.

The need to retain complementarity with ancillary proteins involved in the biogenesis and metabolic repair of Rubisco appears particularly pertinent for form I Rubisco, which comprises eight RbcL and eight RbcS subunits to form a L8S8 complex. Examples of Rubisco-dedicated components include the assembly chaperones BSD2, RbcX, Rubisco accumulation factors 1 and 2 (Raf1, Raf2), and the metabolic repair protein Rubisco activase (14Bracher A.

The protein-folding chaperonins of bacteria (GroEL), chloroplasts (Cpn60), and their protein co-factors GroES (bacteria) and Cpn10/Cpn20 (chloroplasts) are also essential components in Rubisco biogenesis (15Tsai Y.-C.

The need for Rubisco to maintain complementarity with these varied chaperone and chaperonin components appears to limit the span of Rubisco isoforms that can be produced in Escherichia coli, as well as those that can be bioengineered in the chloroplasts of vascular plants. For example, the chloroplasts of the model C3 plant tobacco can produce high levels of the RbcS-lacking bacterial form II Rhodospirillum rubrum L2 Rubisco and Methanococcoides burtonii archaeal L10 Rubisco (∼10–25 μmol active sites·m2) because of their simple biogenesis requirements (16Whitney S.M.

This contrasts with conventional RDE screens that simply express recombinant phosphoribulokinase (PRK) to produce RuBP, the 5-carbon substrate of Rubisco. As summarized in Fig. 1A, RuBP is unexplainably toxic to E. coli such that the rate of colony growth in RDE screens is dependent on the level of Rubisco activity. This type of selection has proved useful for evolving M. burtonii L10 Rubisco mutants with desired improvements in carboxylation rate (kcatc), CO2 affinity (lower Km for CO2, Kc) and specificity for CO2 over O2 (Sc/o) (17Wilson R.H.

Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A feature of RDE screens that limit their throughput and reliability (i.e. selection fidelity) is the high proportion of false positives selected (24Cai Z. Liu G. Zhang J. Li Y. Development of an activity-directed selection system enabled significant improvement of the carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco.Protein Cell. 2014; 5 (24870149): 552-56210.1007/s13238-014-0072-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Greene D.N.

J. 2007; 404 (17391103): 517-52410.1042/BJ20070071Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These arise from the inactivation of PRK function by transposon integration (Fig. 1A and Ref. 22Wilson R.H. Whitney S.M. Improving CO2 fixation by enhancing Rubisco performance.in: Alcalde M. Directed Enzyme Evolution: Advances and Applications. Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we present the development and implementation of a simple, faster, high-throughput screen called RDE2 that specifically selects for improvements in Rubisco activity, not PRK inactivation mutants. By eliminating false-positive selection, we demonstrate the versatility of the RDE2 screen in selecting for mutants of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (Te-) Rubisco that improve RbcL folding and assembly in E. coli (i.e. Te-Rubisco solubility), the enzyme carboxylation kinetics, or both. We subsequently reveal, using chloroplast genome transformation, how the specialized folding and assembly requirements of Te-Rubisco hinder its translational testing in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The outcomes demonstrate that Rubisco biogenesis in E. coli is not a reliable proxy for expression in chloroplasts. As a consequence, deciphering the crucial molecular partnerships required for Rubisco biogenesis is needed to optimize heterologous Rubisco expression in crop chloroplasts, as well as adapting the RDE2 for future evolution of eukaryotic form I Rubisco. Rubisco-directed evolution studies that have utilized either RDE or photosynthetic mutant screens have almost exclusively selected for one or more amino acid substitutions in RbcL that improve Rubisco biogenesis (solubility), not catalysis (12Mueller-Cajar O. Whitney S.M. Directing the evolution of Rubisco and Rubisco activase: first impressions of a new tool for photosynthesis research.Photosyn.

Directed Enzyme Evolution: Advances and Applications. Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Impeding success are the poor transformation efficiencies of photosynthetic hosts and the high proportion of false positives selected in RDE screens. As summarized in Fig. 1A, false-positive selection in RDE systems arises from terminating RuBP production via transposon silencing of PRK expression (22Wilson R.H. Whitney S.M. Improving CO2 fixation by enhancing Rubisco performance.in: Alcalde M. Directed Enzyme Evolution: Advances and Applications. Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To circumvent this impediment, a synthetic gene coding a fusion protein comprising S. elongatus PCC6301 PRK (Se-PRK) and a C-terminal neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) was made (Fig. 1B). The PRK–NPTII fusion protein was found to preserve the kanamycin resistance conferring properties of NPTII to E. coli in addition to retaining 70% the PRK activity (kcat = 95 ± 3 s−1) of unmodified Se-PRK (134 ± 6 s−1). The fidelity of the RDE and RDE2 screens were compared by plating XL-1Blue cells producing Se-PRK or the PRK–NPTII fusion, along with wild-type Te-Rubisco, on medium containing 0.2% (w/v) arabinose (high PRK inducing) and no kanamycin. Under these conditions, Te-Rubisco cannot support cell growth, meaning any colonies formed are false positives caused by transposon silencing of PRK activity (Fig. 1A and Ref. 22Wilson R.H. Whitney S.M. Improving CO2 fixation by enhancing Rubisco performance.in: Alcalde M. Directed Enzyme Evolution: Advances and Applications. Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More than 500 false-positive colonies/106 cells plated grew in the RDE screen, whereas only 28 ± 17 colonies/106 cells plated grew using the RDE2 screen. Inclusion of 100 μg/ml kanamycin in the growth medium of replica RDE2 cell platings resulted in no colony growth. This confirmed that the RDE2 screen is immune from generating false positives because transposon silencing of PRK–NPTII activity also confers the cells sensitive to kanamycin (Fig. 1A). The inability of E. coli to meet the folding and assembly requirements of plant and algae Rubisco currently prevents their directed evolution using RDE screens (10Whitney S.M. Baldet P. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Form I Rubiscos from non-green algae are expressed abundantly but not assembled in tobacco chloroplasts.Plant J. 2001; 26 (11439139): 535-54710.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01056.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mueller-Cajar O.

By contrast the biogenesis requirements of cyanobacteria L8S8 Rubisco can be partially met by E. coli. For example, only a small proportion (<2%) of the 52-kDa Se-RbcL produced in E. coli can assemble with the more soluble 14-kDa Se-RbcS into functional Se-Rubisco (20Mueller-Cajar O. Whitney S.M. Evolving improved Synechococcus Rubisco functional expression in Escherichia coli.Biochem. J. 2008; 414 (18484948): 205-21410.1042/BJ20080668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a consequence Se-Rubisco produced in E. coli only accounts for 1–2% (w/w) of the cell-soluble protein (CSP). RDE screens have therefore primarily only identified substitutions in RbcL that enhance the biogenesis of Se-Rubisco (i.e. improved its solubility) (22Wilson R.H. Whitney S.M. Improving CO2 fixation by enhancing Rubisco performance.in: Alcalde M. Directed Enzyme Evolution: Advances and Applications. Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland2017: 101-126Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Among these are the F140I, V189A, and F345I substitutions in RbcL (numbering relative to spinach and Te-Rubisco) that increase Se-Rubisco solubility between 3- and 14-fold in E. coli (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Notably these mutations all impair kcatc, contrary to that proposed previously (11DurΔo P. Aigner H. Nagy P. Mueller-Cajar O. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Opposing effects of folding and assembly chaperones on evolvability of Rubisco.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (25558973): 148-15510.1038/nchembio.1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By comparison the biogenesis requirements of Te-Rubisco, that already codes Ile-140, are more readily met in E. coli and expressed at ∼6% (w/w) CSP (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the apparent carboxylation efficiency under ambient O2 (kcatc/Kc21%O2) and specificity for CO2 over O2 (Sc/o) of Te-Rubisco are ∼40 and 18% higher, respectively, than Se-Rubisco (Table 1). Notably these favorable Te-Rubisco kinetics come at the expense of a slower carboxylation rate (kcatc) that is ∼40% less than Se-Rubisco (Fig. 2, A and B). The high solubility of Te-Rubisco in E. coli and distinctive kinetics made it a superior target for evolution testing using RDE2.Table 1E. coli L8S8 Rubisco content and catalytic parameters at 25 °CRubiscoMutant libraryAmino acid mutation(s)Expression (% (w/w) sol E. coli protein)kcatcKc21% O2kcatc/Kc21%O2SC/OTmaMeasurement of thermal stability (Tm) were made by circular dichroism spectroscopy as described (38).

Open table in a new tab The efficacy of RDE2 to select for increased Te-Rubisco activity was initially tested using a library of 2.7 × 105 Te-rbcL mutants with an average mutation rate of 2.5 nucleotides (1.6 amino acid substitutions) per variant. After 5 days at 25 °C, 18 faster-growing colonies were identified on plates containing 0.1% (w/v) arabinose (defined as moderate PRK–NPTII induction) and found to code either V300A, F345I, F345L, or P415A substitutions in RbcL. The kinetics of the slower growing V300A mutant resembled Te-Rubisco, suggesting that it improved RDE2 fitness possibly from the small (<10%) increase in the amount of soluble L8S8 made (Table 1). The faster-growing F345I, F345L, and P415A mutants produced significantly more Te-Rubisco, especially the F345I mutation that stimulated Te-Rubisco biogenesis to ∼14% (w/w) of the CSP (Fig. 2, A and B). When coupled with the P415A mutation, the solubility of the Te-F345I/P415A mutant increased to ∼17% (w/w) CSP (Fig. 2, A and B). This improvement came at a cost to the kinetics of each mutant that showed reductions in kcatc, kcatc/Kc21%O2, and Sc/o (Table 1). Sequence comparisons found that both Phe345 and Pro415 are highly conserved among cyanobacteria and higher plant form IB RbcL but are located in separate, unconnected α-helical regions (Fig. 2C).

Combining pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference revealed a polypharmacology mechanism involving the noncanonical targets IGF1R, FAK1, RSK1 and RSK2. Mutating the downstream signaling hub YB1 protected cells from ceritinib. Consistent with YB1 signaling being known to cause taxol resistance, combination of ceritinib with paclitaxel displayed strong synergy, particularly in cells expressing high FAK autophosphorylation, which we show to be prevalent in lung cancer. Together, we present a systems chemical biology platform for elucidating multikinase inhibitor polypharmacology mechanisms, subsequent design of synergistic drug combinations, and identification of mechanistic biomarker candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2761811615,"Alu sequences are the most abundant short interspersed repeated elements in the human genome. Here we show that in a cell culture model of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, we observe accumulation of Alu RNA that is associated with reduced DICER1 levels. Alu RNA induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-566. Moreover, Alu RNA accumulates as consequence of DICER1 deficit in colorectal, ovarian, renal and breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Alu RNA knockdown prevents DICER1 depletion-induced EMT despite global microRNA (miRNA) downregulation. Alu RNA expression is also induced by transforming growth factor-β1, a major driver of EMT. Corroborating this data, we found that non-coding Alu RNA significantly correlates with tumor progression in human CRC patients. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected DICER1-dependent, miRNA-independent role of Alu RNA in cancer progression that could bring mobile element transcripts in the fields of cancer therapeutic and prognosis."

The nuclear export signal of AR (NESAR) has an important role in AR intracellular trafficking and proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DHX15 as a novel AR co-activator using a yeast mutagenesis screen and revealed that DHX15 regulates AR activity by modulating E3 ligase Siah2-mediated AR ubiquitination independent of its ATPase activity. DHX15 and Siah2 form a complex with AR, through NESAR. DHX15 stabilized Siah2 and enhanced its E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity, resulting in AR activation. Importantly, DHX15 was upregulated in PCa specimens and its expression was correlated with Gleason scores and prostate-specific antigen recurrence. Furthermore, DHX15 immunostaining correlated with Siah2. Finally, DHX15 knockdown inhibited the growth of C4-2 prostate tumor xenografts in mice. Collectively, our data argue that DHX15 enhances AR transcriptional activity and contributes to PCa progression through Siah2."

During allosteric inhibition, agonist binding incudes uncoupling of structural changes from gating motions in the first transmembrane region. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are the main calcium-permeable excitatory receptors in the mammalian central nervous system. The NMDA receptor gating is complex, exhibiting multiple closed, open, and desensitized states; however, central questions regarding the conformations and energetics of the transmembrane domains as they relate to the gating states are still unanswered. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we map the energy landscape of the first transmembrane segment of the Rattus norvegicus NMDA receptor under resting and various liganded conditions. These results show kinetically and structurally distinct changes associated with apo, agonist-bound, and inhibited receptors linked by a linear mechanism of gating at this site. Furthermore, the smFRET data suggest that allosteric inhibition by zinc occurs by an uncoupling of the agonist-induced changes at the extracellular domains from the gating motions leading to an apo-like state, while dizocilpine, a pore blocker, stabilizes multiple closely packed transmembrane states."
https://openalex.org/W2761318636,"From 2012 to 2016, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, provided support for countries to conduct small-scale demonstration projects for the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine, with the aim of determining which human papillomavirus vaccine delivery strategies might be effective and sustainable upon national scale-up. This study reports on the operational costs and cost determinants of different vaccination delivery strategies within these projects across twelve countries using a standardized micro-costing tool. The World Health Organization Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Costing Tool was used to collect costing data, which were then aggregated and analyzed to assess the costs and cost determinants of vaccination. Across the one-year demonstration projects, the average economic and financial costs per dose amounted to US$19.98 (standard deviation ±12.5) and US$8.74 (standard deviation ±5.8), respectively. The greatest activities representing the greatest share of financial costs were social mobilization at approximately 30% (range, 6–67%) and service delivery at about 25% (range, 3–46%). Districts implemented varying combinations of school-based, facility-based, or outreach delivery strategies and experienced wide variation in vaccine coverage, drop-out rates, and service delivery costs, including transportation costs and per diems. Size of target population, number of students per school, and average length of time to reach an outreach post influenced cost per dose. Although the operational costs from demonstration projects are much higher than those of other routine vaccine immunization programs, findings from our analysis suggest that HPV vaccination operational costs will decrease substantially for national introduction. Vaccination costs may be decreased further by annual vaccination, high initial investment in social mobilization, or introducing/strengthening school health programs. Our analysis shows that drivers of cost are dependent on country and district characteristics. We therefore recommend that countries carry out detailed planning at the national and district levels to define a sustainable strategy for national HPV vaccine roll-out, in order to achieve the optimal balance between coverage and cost."

The cellular response to hypoxia involves a transcriptional program mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors, but translational control has emerged as a significant contributor. In this study, we demonstrate that a cell-cell adhesion molecule, cadherin-22, is upregulated in hypoxia via mTORC1-independent translational control by the initiation factor eIF4E2. We identify new functions of cadherin-22 as a hypoxia-specific cell-surface molecule involved in cancer cell migration, invasion and adhesion. Silencing eIF4E2 or cadherin-22 significantly impaired MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma and U87MG glioblastoma cell migration and invasion only in hypoxia, while reintroduction of the respective exogenous gene restored the normal phenotype. Cadherin-22 was evenly distributed throughout spheroids and required for their formation and support of a hypoxic core. Conversely, E-cadherin translation was repressed by hypoxia and only expressed in the oxygenated cells of U87MG spheroids. Furthermore, immunofluorescence on paraffin-embedded human tissue from 40 glioma and 40 invasive ductal breast carcinoma patient specimens revealed that cadherin-22 expression colocalized with areas of hypoxia and significantly correlated with tumor grade and progression-free survival or stage and tumor size, respectively. This study broadens our understanding of tumor progression and metastasis by highlighting cadherin-22 as a potential new target of cancer therapy to disable hypoxic cancer cell motility and adhesion."

https://openalex.org/W2763019644,"Emphasis on adolescent HIV has increased worldwide as antiretroviral treatment has greatly extended life expectancies of HIV-positive children. Few evidence-based guidelines exist on the optimal time to disclose to an adolescent living with HIV (ALHIV); little is known about the medical effects of disclosure. This study looked to determine whether disclosure is associated with improved medical outcomes in ALHIV. Prior work has tended to be qualitative, cross-sectional, and with an emphasis on psychosocial outcomes. This paper addresses the adolescent cohort retrospectively (longitudinally), building upon what is already known about disclosure.Retrospective, longitudinal clinical record reviews of ALHIV seen at Kericho District Hospital between April 2004 and November 2012 were performed. Patient demographics and clinical outcomes were systematically extracted. The student's t-test was used to calculate changes in mean CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and cotrimoxazole adherence pre- vs. post-disclosure. Linear regression modelling assessed for trends in those clinical outcomes associated with age of disclosure.Ninety-six ALHIV (54 female, 42 male) were included; most (73%) entered care through the outpatient department. Nearly half were cared for by parents, and 20% experienced a change in their primary caregiver. The mean time in the study was 2.47 years; mean number of visits 10.97 per patient over the mean time in the study. Mean disclosure age was 12.34 years. An increase in mean ART adherence percentage was found with disclosure (0.802 vs. 0.917; p = 0.0015). Younger disclosure age was associated with significantly higher mean CD4 counts over the course of the study (p = 0.001), and a nonsignificant trend toward a higher mean ART adherence percentage (p = 0.055).ART adherence and improved immunologic status are both associated with disclosure of HIV infection to adolescent patients. Disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to an adolescent is an important means to improve HIV care."

BET inhibitor treatment prevented this interaction, leading to a dramatic reduction of PGC-1α expression. Accordingly, BET inhibition diminished respiration and mitochondrial function in cells. In vivo, melanoma models with high PGC-1α expression strongly responded to BET inhibition by reduction of PGC-1α and impaired tumor growth. Altogether, our findings identify epigenetic regulatory elements that define a subset of melanomas with high sensitivity to BET inhibition, which opens up the opportunity to define melanoma patients most likely to respond to this treatment, depending on their tumor characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2763180891,"It has long been thought that vision is the most essential factor in maintaining stable quiet standing compared to other sources (i.e., vestibular and somatosensory inputs) of information. Specifically, several vision studies on postural control have shown evidence for the importance of the visual system, particularly peripheral vision rather than central vision, and optical flow. Nevertheless, to date, no study has manipulated both visual field and optical flow concurrently. In the present study, we experimentally manipulated both the visual field (the central and peripheral visual fields) and the occurrence of optical flow during quiet standing, examining the effects of the visual field and optical flow on postural sway measured in terms of the center of pressure (CoP). Stationary random dot stimuli were presented exclusively in either the central or peripheral visual field, while the occurrence of optical flow was manipulated using a desktop (DTD) or a head-mounted (HMD) display. The optical flow that occurred while using the DTD was a function of the postural sway during quiet standing, while for the HMD, no optical flow occurred even when the body/head swayed during quiet standing. Our results show that the extent of postural sway (e.g., CoP area) was smaller when visual stimuli were presented in the peripheral visual field than that in the central visual field; this was the case while using the DTD alone, with no effects of the peripheral vision on the extent of postural sway while using the HMD. It is therefore suggested that the optical flow occurring in the peripheral visual field is essential for stable quiet standing."

Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the 2-year recurrence and demographic, clinical, and radiological factors. To evaluate the impact of SVD and its components on recurrent stroke, we used the Kaplan-Meier analysis. SVD was defined as the presence of severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) or old lacunar infarction (OLI) or cerebral microbleeds (CMB). We also compared frequency and burden of SVD among recurrent stroke groups with different mechanisms.Among a total of 956 participants, 92 patients had recurrent events. Recurrence group showed a higher frequency of severe WMH, OLI, asymptomatic territorial infarction, and severe stenosis on the relevant vessel in multivariate analysis. The impact of SVD and its components on recurrent stroke was significant in any ischemic recurrent stroke, and the presence of SVD was continuously important in stroke recurrence regardless of its mechanism, including recurrent LAA stroke, recurrent small vessel occlusion stroke, and even recurrent cardioembolic stroke. Additionally, the recurrence rate increased in dose-response manner with the increased number of SVD components.Cerebral SVD is associated with recurrent stroke in patients with LAA. Additionally, it may affect any mechanisms of recurrent stroke and even with a dose response manner."
https://openalex.org/W2761930153,"Migraine is the sixth most common cause of disability in the world. Preventive migraine treatment is used to reduce frequency, severity and duration of attacks and therefore lightens the burden on the patients’ quality of life and reduces disability. Topiramate is one of the preventive migraine treatments of proven efficacy. The mechanism of action underlying the preventive effect of topiramate in migraine remains largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we examined the central effects of a single dose of topiramate (100mg) on trigeminal pain in humans, compared to placebo (mannitol). In this prospective, within subject, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study, 23 healthy participants received a standardized nociceptive trigeminal stimulation and control stimuli whilst being in the scanner. No differences in the subjective intensity ratings of the painful stimuli were observed between topiramate and placebo sessions. In contrast, topiramate significantly decreased the activity in the thalamus and other pain processing areas. Additionally, topiramate increased functional coupling between the thalamus and several brain regions such as the bilateral precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex. These data suggest that topiramate exhibits modulating effects on nociceptive processing in thalamo-cortical networks during trigeminal pain and that the preventive effect of topiramate on frequent migraine is probably mediated by an effect on thalamo-cortical networks."

https://openalex.org/W2763401075,"Objectives The study aimed to assess the usefulness of the determination of cytokines: IL-8, VEGF and its soluble receptors: VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2 in patients with endometrial cancer (EC). Material/Methods The study group consisted of 118 patients with EC subjected to surgical treatment. Before the treatment we determined the serum levels of cytokines IL-8, and VEGF as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors. For comparison, the concentration of CA 125 was also measured. VEGFR1 and CA 125 were determined in the COBAS e601 system using Roche Diagnostics kits, while IL-8, VEGF and VEGFR2 were measured by ELISA assay using R&D Systems kits. Results The concentrations of IL-8, VEGF, VEGFR1 and CA 125 allowed to distinguish patients for the control group. The highest diagnostic sensitivity has been shown for the concentrations of VEGF (AUC = 0.904) and IL-8 (AUC = 0.818). Among all studied parameters only CA125 concentrations increased with the clinical stage; being significantly higher in patients in FIGO III-IV, than FIGO I-IB. In patients at the FIGO stage I-IB, complementary determinations of CA 125 and VEGF resulted in the largest increase of diagnostic sensitivity. Patients with metastases to the para-aortic lymph nodes had significantly higher levels of VEGF compared to subjects without such lesions. The concentrations of IL-8 were an independent prognostic factor in the assessment of overall survival in patients with type I endometrial cancer, while the concentrations of VEGFR2 in those with type II. Conclusions In patients with endometrial cancer, the clinical usefulness of IL-8 and VEGFR2 measurements as the potential prognostic factors has been demonstrated. In type I, the concentrations of IL-8 determined before treatment can be helpful in predicting overall survival. In patients qualified to type II EC, the concentrations of VEGFR2 have the value of an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, this requires research on larger groups of patients. The increased levels of VEGF may be useful in the preoperative assessment of the status of para-aortic lymph nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2761555222,"Objective Reliable identification of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is of utmost importance, as it is associated with poor outcomes including dialysis withdrawal and death. High prevalence of cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in several studies using brief screening instruments or neuropsychological test batteries. However, the relevance of cognitive impairment as well as the accuracy of screening procedures have never been studied in this patient population. Methods 151 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 65.78 ± 14.88 years, 73,5% male) underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and, in a second step, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), an international standard to measure the severity of dementia. For calculating MoCA cut-off values on the basis of the CDR global score, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and c-statistic were applied. Results 49.0% of patients were categorized as 0.5 in the CDR global with memory being the predominantly affected domain (47.7% of patients scored ≥ 0.5). Youden’s Index led to a threshold of 23.5 points for the MoCA test for optimal differentiation between cognitively normal (CDR global < 0.5) and impaired patients (CDR global ≥ 0.5) based on a sensitivity of approximately 99% and a specificity of approximately 74%. Conclusion Interference of cognitive impairment with patients’ independence and daily life was shown using the CDR for the first time in hemodialysis patients. A MoCA score of 23.5 points turned out as optimal threshold to differentiate between patients with and without functional impairment in the CDR, thereby paving the way for implementation of the MoCA test as a quick and thus highly feasible screening instrument for periodic testing in clinical routine."
https://openalex.org/W2763690609,"Signal-transducing adaptor family member-2 (STAP-2) is an adaptor protein that regulates various intracellular signaling pathways and promotes tumorigenesis in melanoma and breast cancer cells. However, the contribution of STAP-2 to the behavior of other types of cancer cells is unclear. Here, we show that STAP-2 promotes tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells through up-regulation of EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling. Tumor growth of a prostate cancer cell line, DU145, was strongly decreased by STAP-2 knockdown. EGF-induced gene expression and phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and STAT3 were significantly decreased in STAP-2–knockdown DU145 cells. Mechanistically, we found that STAP-2 interacted with EGFR and enhanced its stability by inhibiting c-CBL–mediated EGFR ubiquitination. Our results indicate that STAP-2 promotes prostate cancer progression via facilitating EGFR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2762141139,"Background There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of primary interventions aiming to prevent excess weight gain among young children. Evaluating behavioral changes, such as physical activity (PA), may add to future development of efficient interventions. The objective was to evaluate the effect on PA outcomes of the 15 month Healthy Start intervention that focused on changing diet, PA, sleep and stress management among normal weight but obesity-prone preschool children. Children were defined as obesity-prone if they had a birth weight > 4,000 g, mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of > 28 kg/m2, or mothers with ≤ 10 years of schooling. Method From a baseline study population of 635 normal weight 2–6 year old preschool children from the greater Copenhagen area, parents of 307 children had given information on PA at both the baseline and follow-up examinations. PA was obtained from a 7 days recording in the Children’s Physical Activity Questionnaire. Time used for sport activities were combined with outdoor playing time to achieve a proxy of total PA level of moderate to vigorous intensity. Results Linear regression analyses revealed that at follow-up the intervention group spent more time on sports and outdoor activities combined per week than the control group (ITT analyses: intervention: 400 min/week; 95% confidence interval (CI): 341, 459 versus control: 321 min/week; 95% CI: 277, 366; p = 0.02), although no significant intervention effects were seen for each of the subcategories, e.g. sports participation, outdoor activities, screen time, or commuting frequency. Conclusion Our results suggest that the overall time spent on sports and outdoor activities combined was increased at follow-up among normal weight obesity-prone children, as a result of the Healthy Start intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2764093047,"Parent and teacher ratings of child behaviors are often discrepant, and these discrepancies may be correlated with parenting stress. The present study explored whether various parenting stress factors are associated with discrepancies between parent and teacher ratings of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as well as internalizing symptoms in preschool children. We recruited 299 Taiwanese preschool children (aged 4–6 years) from the community or via clinical referrals. A structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships among three factors derived from the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and informant discrepancies on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, ODD, and internalizing behaviors. Scores reported by parents were higher for each of the symptoms examined than those reported by teachers, and the degree of agreement between informants ranged from low to moderate. The parental distress factor of parenting stress was associated only with parent ratings, whereas other factors of parenting stress—parent-child dysfunctional interaction and parents’ stress resulted from their child’s temperament—were correlated with both parent and teacher ratings. Only parental distress factor predicted informant discrepancies for all behavioral symptoms assessed. Our findings suggest that parental distress should be considered when parent rating scores show significant discrepancies from that of teacher rating scores."

We identified treatment patterns and costs of care among RRHL patients in the United States (US) treated with BV. Methods A retrospective observational study of adults initiating BV for RRHL from 2011–2015, with ≥6 months of data prior to and following BV initiation, was conducted. Treatments were classified based on dispensations and chemotherapy administration. Median total and monthly costs were estimated based on all-cause healthcare resource use in 2015 US dollars (USD). Results The cohort comprised 289 patients (59% male; mean age at diagnosis, 42 years) with a mean follow-up of 250 weeks. Eleven percent had BV salvage therapy prior to ASCT, and 32% had BV for a relapse post-ASCT. 43% received treatment post-BV, most commonly allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and bendamustine (both 10.2%). Median (IQR) total costs from BV initiation to censoring were 294,790 (142,110–483,360) USD; and were highest among those treated with BV prior to ASCT (up to 421,900 [300,940–778,970] USD). Median monthly costs were almost 20,000 USD per month, and up to 25,000 USD per month among those with BV and ASCT. Medications were the greatest driver of median monthly costs. Conclusions Median total all-cause costs were almost 300,000 USD, and median monthly costs approximately 20,000 USD, per patient treated. Patients requiring treatment following BV continue to incur high costs, highlighting the economic burden associated with managing patients in the RRHL setting."

Atherosclerosis is the major pathological process behind this epidemic. We designed a novel model of atherosclerosis in swine. Briefly, the first group (11 pigs) received normal pig feed (balanced diet group—BDG) for 12 months, the second group (9 pigs) was fed a Western high-calorie diet (unbalanced diet group—UDG) for 12 months, the third group (8 pigs) received a Western type high-calorie diet for 9 months later replaced by a normal diet for 3 months (regression group—RG). Clinical measurements included zoometric data, arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ultrasonographic evaluation of femoral arteries. Then, the animals were sacrificed and the blood serum, urine and skeletal muscle tissue were collected and 1H NMR based metabolomics studies with the application of fingerprinting PLS-DA and univariate analysis were done. Our results have shown that the molecular disturbances might overlap with other diseases such as onset of diabetes, sleep apnea and other obesity accompanied diseases. Moreover, we revealed that once initiated, molecular changes did not return to homeostatic equilibrium, at least for the duration of this experiment."

Coronary collateral circulation protects cardiac tissues from myocardial infarction damage and decreases sudden cardiac death. So far, it is unclear how coronary collateralization varies by race-ethnicity groups and by sex.


Methods 
We assessed 868 patients with obstructive CAD. Patients were assessed for collateral grades based on Rentrop grading system, as well as other covariates. DNA samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping array. To evaluate genetic contributions to collaterals, we performed admixture mapping using logistic regression with estimated local and global ancestry.


Results 
Overall, 53% of participants had collaterals. We found difference between sex and racial-ethnic groups. Men had higher rates of collaterals than women (P-value = 0.000175). White Hispanics/Latinos showed overall higher rates of collaterals than African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (59%, 50% and 48%, respectively, P-value = 0.017), and especially higher rates in grade 1 and grade 3 collateralization than the other two populations (P-value = 0.0257). Admixture mapping showed Native American ancestry was associated with the presence of collaterals at a region on chromosome 17 (chr17:35,243,142-41,251,931, β = 0.55, P-value = 0.000127). African ancestry also showed association with collaterals at a different region on chromosome 17 (chr17: 32,266,966-34,463,323, β = 0.38, P-value = 0.00072).


Conclusions 
In our study, collateralization showed sex and racial-ethnic differences in obstructive CAD patients. We identified two regions on chromosome 17 that were likely to harbor genetic variations that influenced collateralization."

In the 1980's a highly effective and safe vaccine against HBV was developed, although breakthrough infection still occasionally occurs because of the emergence of escape mutants. The aim of this study was to identify HBV genotypes and escape mutants in children and their mothers in Amerindian communities of the Amazonas State, Southern Colombia.Blood specimens collected from children and mothers belonging to 37 Amerindian communities in Amazonas state, were screened for HBsAg and anti-HBc using ELISA. The partial region containing the S ORF was amplified by nested PCR, and amplicons were sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 5.05 software.Forty-six children (46/1275, 3.6%) and one hundred and seventy-seven mothers (177/572, 30.9%) were tested positive for the anti-HBc serological marker. Among them, 190 samples were tested for viral genome detection; 8.3% (2/31) serum samples obtained from children and 3.1% (5/159) from mothers were positive for the ORF S PCR. The predominant HBV genotype in the study population was F, subgenotype F1b; in addition, subgenotype F1a and genotype A were also characterized. Two HBV escape mutants were identified, G145R, reported worldwide, and W156*; this stop codon was identified in a child with occult HBV infection. Other mutations were found, L109R and G130E, located in critical positions of the HBsAg sequence.This study aimed to characterize the HBV genotype F, subgenotypes F1b and F1a, and genotype A in Amerindian communities and for the first time escape mutants in Colombia. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the frequency and the epidemiological impact of the escape mutants in the country."

This study was divided into two parts; a point-prevalence study on Dec 12th 2012 and a prospective cohort study from Dec 13th 2012 to Jan 9th 2013 were performed in six hospitals in Korea. All hospitalized patients with newly-placed IUCs were enrolled and monitored weekly for 28 days after IUC placement. In the point-prevalence study, the IUCs were present in median 14.9/100 hospitalized patients (1Q 14, 3Q 16) across the six hospitals. In the prospective cohort study, the median IUC-days per patient was 5 (1Q 3, 3Q 10) and the median CA-UTI prevalence per 1,000 catheter days was 1.9 (1Q 0.7, 3Q 3.8) with significant inter-hospital variation. The proportion of patients with inappropriate IUC maintenance increased with number of IUC-days (8.5% on day 7, 9.4% on day 14, 16.3% on day 21, and 23.1% on day 28). Urinary output monitoring (23/36, 63.9%) was the most common indication for inappropriate use after 1 week of ICU placement. In multivariate analysis, IUC-days was significantly associated with the development of CA-UTI (odds ratio 1.122, 95% confidence interval 1.074-1.173, P< 0.001). IUC-days and CA-UTI rates vary between hospitals. IUC-days is a risk factor for CA-UTI, and is correlated with inappropriate use."

In addition, a growing share of U.S. consumers proactively chooses nutritional supplements as an alternative preventative way of maintaining good health, a $25.5 billion industry in the United States. This paper investigates possible linkages between the economics of consumer supplement choices and the relationship to important dietary and health outcomes. We use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the impact of nutritional supplements intake on respondent’s body weight outcomes, controlling for diet quality.: The focus of this article is to determine whether nutritional supplements takers differ from non-takers with regard to their health outcomes when controlling for differences in diet quality, based on individual Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) score. The analysis applies treatment effects estimators that account for the selection bias and endogeneity of self-reported behavior and diet-health outcomes. The analysis demonstrates a negative association between supplement intake and BMI but no significant effect on an individual’s diet quality. Our findings suggest that individuals proactively invest into their health by taking nutritional supplements instead of improving diet quality through more nutritious food choices. Our results provide important contributions to the literature on a key food policy issue. Knowledge of the determinants of supplement demand in the context of strong diet-health trends should also be helpful to stakeholders in the U.S. produce sector in their competition over consumer market share."
https://openalex.org/W2761152050,"Self/non-self-discrimination by the innate immune system relies on germline-encoded, non-rearranging receptors expressed by innate immune cells recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor is a potent immune-activating receptor that binds human genome-encoded ligands, whose expression is negligible in normal tissues, but increased in stress and disease conditions for reasons that are incompletely understood. Here it is not clear how the immune system reconciles receptor binding of self-proteins with self/non-self-discrimination to avoid autoreactivity. We now report that increased expression of NKG2D ligands after virus infection depends on interferon response factors activated by the detection of viral double-stranded RNA by pattern-recognition receptors (RIG-I/MDA-5) and that NKG2D ligand up-regulation can be blocked by the expression of viral dsRNA-binding proteins. Thus, innate immunity-mediated recognition of viral nucleic acids triggers the infected cell to release interferon for NK cell recruitment and to express NKG2D ligands to become more visible to the immune system. Finally, the observation that NKG2D-ligand induction is a consequence of signaling by pattern-recognition receptors that have been selected over evolutionary time to be highly pathogen-specific explains how the risks of autoreactivity in this system are minimized."

Among 79 mental health teams in Quebec (Canada), this exploratory study aims to 1) determine the association between work role performance and a wide range of variables related to team effectiveness according to the literature, and to 2) using structural equation modelling, assess the covariance between each of these variables as well as the correlation with other exogenous variables. Work role performance was measured with an adapted version of a work role questionnaire. Various independent variables including team manager characteristics, user characteristics, team profiles, clinical activities, organizational culture, network integration strategies and frequency/satisfaction of interactions with other teams or services were analyzed under the structural equation model. The later provided a good fit with the data. Frequent use of standardized procedures and evaluation tools (e.g. screening and assessment tools for mental health disorders) and team manager seniority exerted the most direct effect on work role performance. While network integration strategies had little effect on work role performance, there was a high covariance between this variable and those directly affecting work role performance among mental health teams. The results suggest that the mental healthcare system should apply standardized procedures and evaluation tools and, to a lesser extent, clinical approaches to improve work role performance in mental health teams. Overall, a more systematic implementation of network integration strategies may contribute to improved work role performance in mental health care."
https://openalex.org/W2761764332,"Increased levels of systemic vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) in patients with diabetes are associated with increased risk of microvessel disease. On the other hand, low VEGF levels after intravitreal antibody application may be associated with acute cardiovascular complications and treatment failure. Individual levels of systemic VEGF vary in a wide range depending on analytical methods and quality of diabetes control. So far only limited information exists on intraindividual fluctuations over longer periods and circadian rhythms. We analysed the intraindividual variance of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and placental growth factor (PLGF) in CTAD (citrate-theophylline-adenine-dipyridamol) plasma as well as VEGF-A in serum over a period of 6 months in patients with stable controlled type 2 diabetes (10 M, 10 F) and age and sex matched subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Furthermore, circadian levels of VEGFs were controlled hourly from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. under standardized metabolic ward conditions. In addition, the relationship to metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory biomarkers was analyzed. VEGF-A, VEGF-C and PLGF remained stable in plasma and VEGF-A in serum over 6 months in both groups. No circadian change was observed in VEGF-A serum and plasma concentrations. A minor decrease of VEGF-C plasma levels was evident after 5 p.m. in both groups and a significant peak of PLGF concentrations occurred after lunch, which was more pronounced in T2DM. In multivariate analysis, only serum VEGF-A correlated to diabetes duration, whereas VEGF-C only correlated to HbA1c and fasting blood glucose. We did not observe significant intraindividual variances for VEGF-A in serum and VEGF-A, VEGF-C and PLGF in CTAD plasma over a period of 6 months. Taken together, a single morning measurement of systemic VEGF levels after 7:30 am appears to be a reliable parameter for the individual risk associated with abnormal VEGF concentrations in blood.NCT02325271."

https://openalex.org/W2761776138,"Invasive weeds threaten the biodiversity and forage productivity of grasslands worldwide. However, management of these weeds is constrained by the practical difficulty of detecting small-scale infestations across large landscapes and by limits in understanding of landscape-scale invasion dynamics, including mechanisms that enable patches to expand, contract, or remain stable. While high-end hyperspectral remote sensing systems can effectively map vegetation cover, these systems are currently too costly and limited in availability for most land managers. We demonstrate application of a more accessible and cost-effective remote sensing approach, based on simple aerial imagery, for quantifying weed cover dynamics over time. In California annual grasslands, the target communities of interest include invasive weedy grasses (Aegilops triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae) and desirable forage grass species (primarily Avena spp. and Bromus spp.). Detecting invasion of annual grasses into an annual-dominated community is particularly challenging, but we were able to consistently characterize these two communities based on their phenological differences in peak growth and senescence using maximum likelihood supervised classification of imagery acquired twice per year (in mid- and end-of season). This approach permitted us to map weed-dominated cover at a 1-m scale (correctly detecting 93% of weed patches across the landscape) and to evaluate weed cover change over time. We found that weed cover was more pervasive and persistent in management units that had no significant grazing for several years than in those that were grazed, whereas forage cover was more abundant and stable in the grazed units. This application demonstrates the power of this method for assessing fine-scale vegetation transitions across heterogeneous landscapes. It thus provides means for small-scale early detection of invasive species and for testing fundamental questions about landscape dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2761192713,"The Gram-positive pathogen Bacillus cereus is able to grow in chains of rod-shaped cells, but the regulation of chaining remains largely unknown. Here, we observe that glucose-grown cells of B. cereus ATCC 14579 form longer chains than those grown in the absence of glucose during the late exponential and transition growth phases, and identify that the clhAB2 operon is required for this chain lengthening phenotype. The clhAB2 operon is specific to the B. cereus group (i.e., B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis and B. cereus) and encodes two membrane proteins of unknown function, which are homologous to the Staphylococcus aureus CidA and CidB proteins involved in cell death control within glucose-grown cells. A deletion mutant (ΔclhAB2) was constructed and our quantitative image analyses show that ΔclhAB2 cells formed abnormal short chains regardless of the presence of glucose. We also found that glucose-grown cells of ΔclhAB2 were significantly wider than wild-type cells (1.47 μm ±CI95% 0.04 vs 1.19 μm ±CI95% 0.03, respectively), suggesting an alteration of the bacterial cell wall. Remarkably, ΔclhAB2 cells showed accelerated autolysis under autolysis-inducing conditions, compared to wild-type cells. Overall, our data suggest that the B. cereus clhAB2 operon modulates peptidoglycan hydrolase activity, which is required for proper cell shape and chain length during cell growth, and down-regulates autolysin activity. Lastly, we studied the transcription of clhAB2 using a lacZ transcriptional reporter in wild-type, ccpA and codY deletion-mutant strains. We found that the global transcriptional regulatory protein CodY is required for the basal level of clhAB2 expression under all conditions tested, including the transition growth phase while CcpA, the major global carbon regulator, is needed for the high-level expression of clhAB2 in glucose-grown cells."
https://openalex.org/W2762895054,"The growing interest in distributed generation (DG) in recent years has led to a number of generators connected to a distribution system. The integration of DGs in a distribution system has resulted in a network known as active distribution network due to the existence of bidirectional power flow in the system. Voltage rise issue is one of the predominantly important technical issues to be addressed when DGs exist in an active distribution network. This paper presents the application of the backtracking search algorithm (BSA), which is relatively new optimisation technique to determine the optimal settings of coordinated voltage control in a distribution system. The coordinated voltage control considers power factor, on-load tap-changer and generation curtailment control to manage voltage rise issue. A multi-objective function is formulated to minimise total losses and voltage deviation in a distribution system. The proposed BSA is compared with that of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) so as to evaluate its effectiveness in determining the optimal settings of power factor, tap-changer and percentage active power generation to be curtailed. The load flow algorithm from MATPOWER is integrated in the MATLAB environment to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem. Both the BSA and PSO optimisation techniques have been tested on a radial 13-bus distribution system and the results show that the BSA performs better than PSO by providing better fitness value and convergence rate."
