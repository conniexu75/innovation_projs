Reaction kinetics remain to be fully resolved, but certain features of wave behavior are determined by purely geometrical considerations. If a wave is broken, then spiral waves, resembling involutes of the circle, appear, persist, and eventually exclude all concentric ring waves."

Other effects included decreased optical transmissivity and increased temperature of the water, decreased amounts of dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and increased amounts of dissolved organic phosphorus, inhibition of Spirogyra, and replacement of one annelid, Chaetogaster, by another, Aeolosoma."

The blades represented 91 percent of the original weight (2.1 centimeters of acute cutting edge per gram of original material), thus demonstrating the efficiency of the pressure-blade techniques for the production of acute cutting edges."

During the early stage of hydration, areas between Ca(OH)(2) crystals which consist of Ca(3)SiO(5) particles bonded together by calcium silicate hydrate represent the high-porosity portion of the paste. Because of the presence of Ca(OH)(2), fracture in the hardened paste during this period propagates preferentially through the areas bonded by the calcium silicate hydrate phase and around the Ca(OH)(8), crystals. Calcium hydroxide also acts as a crack arrester. The influence of Ca(OH)(2) on fracture diminishes with increased hydration."

https://openalex.org/W2005775823,"Morphologic studies of single crystals of aragonite within Codiacean algae reveal characteristic crystal forms produced by two distinctly different modes of calcification. Diagnostic serrated crystals (1 micrometer in length) of aragonite originating within the extracellular sheaths of capitular filaments are incorporated into modern lime sediments and may serve as effective tracers for particles of algal origin. Intracellular calcification within Penicillus dumetosus, previously unreported, is represented by doubly terminated aragonite crystals ranging in size from 48 to 160 micrometers."

In some cells the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope curves toward the wall and continues without interruption around the cell periphery as the plasmalemma. Subject to its confirmation as a natural occurrence, this evidence appears to support Robertson's concept of cellular organization."

https://openalex.org/W4250354921,"We conclude, then, that large-scale importation of irrigation water into water-deficient areas in the United States should not be undertaken simply because it is technically feasible, the water and land are available, and water deficits now or in the foreseeable future can be documented. Rather, we believe that if there is a compelling reason for large-scale water importation, it is to prevent massive social and economic disruption in an established irrigated area."
https://openalex.org/W1979801764,"R ESULTS OBTAINED IN PHYSICAL chemistry and chemical crystallography yield a rather definite picture of the native protein which fits at many points with that emerging from the various fields of the biology of the proteins, i.e. enzymology, immunology, pharmacology, virus studies, and genetics. If we attempt to sum up the general impression derived from a study of various independent sources of information on the proteins, it can be broken down into the following parts: (1) Many proteins in solution are particles, not individual molecules (21). It is useful to use the term proteon to connote a native protein unit incapable of division into subunits also having the native protein character. Every native protein may then be regarded as a proteon or a system of proteons, alike or different. That a protein particle is not a mere conglomerate of proteons but an orderly aggregate, i.e. a molecular colony, follows from the finding that in many cases where ultracentrifugal studies show that a protein is uniform in size and shape under well-defined external conditions, the protein in question is capable of dissociation into subunits when the environmental conditions are modified (21). Much information has now been assembled concerning the particle status of many proteins, ranging from the very large tobacco mosaic nucleoprotein down to horse hemoglobin. The reversible dissociation of protein particles does not imply any change in the chemical status of the proteons. It is therefore to be sharply distinguished from denaturation. (2) Interproteon associations within particles depend upon the R-substituents of the amino acid backbones (N-CQ-C) which make up the proteon skeletons. Structure chemistry provides three types of association: direct polar, mediated polar, and less polar. Horse hemoglobin, which on dilution dissociates into two subunits, provides an illustration of the first type; the Helix hemocyanin particle whose dissociations in aqueous solution are affected by Ca++ and Mg++, an illustration of the first and second types (21). That the less polar R-substituents of aliphatic and aromatic types, as well as the more polar types, emerge from protein surfaces is indicated by many data, e.g. the higher solubility of insulin in propylene glycol than in water and the affinity of human serum albumin for the paraffin chains of fatty acid molecules (13). Thus, associations of the third type are also a possibility,"

The experimental tissues contained higher concentrations of sterols than the controls did. The ratio of campesterol to stigmasterol was greater than 1 in control tissues, but less than 1 in the experimental tissues after 3 weeks. High relative concentrations (17.1 to 22.2 percent) of an unidentified compound or compounds were found only in control tissues that were 3 to 9 weeks of age."
