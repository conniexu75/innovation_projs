https://openalex.org/W1491757243,"Human dermis was digested with pepsin under conditions that maintain the helical conformation of the bulk of the collagen. Molecules containing α1(III) chains were separated from [α1(I)]2α2 collagen by differential salt precipitation at pH 7.5, with the use of the peptides produced by CNBr cleavage to monitor the composition of each fraction. The isolated molecules are composed of three α1(III) chains, and these chains are cross-linked by disulfide bonds. Exposure to dithiothreitol liberates the three apparently identical chains, and these elute on carboxymethylcellulose chromatography at a position intermediate between α1(I) and α2. The pepsin-resistant portion of these chains is the same size as that of previously isolated collagen chains. Human dermis was also digested with CNBr, and resultant α1(I) and α1(III) peptides were separated chromatographically. The relative quantities of these peptides indicate that α1(III) chains predominate in early fetal skin, but by birth and in later life α1(I) chains are approximately 3 times as plentiful."

https://openalex.org/W1492288245,"Further studies were performed on the sequence of addition of proteins to 16 S RNA during the in vitro reconstitution of 30 S ribosomal subunits from Escherichia coli. Direct binding of protein S17 to 16 S RNA was studied in detail, and the following results were obtained: (a) under reconstitution conditions, a maximum of approximately 1 mole of S17 is bound per mole of 16 S RNA, either alone, or in the presence of all other 30 S proteins; (b) S17 binds only to 16 S RNA and not to 23 S RNA; and (c) radioactive S17–16 S RNA complexes are directly converted (without dissociation) to 30 S subunits by the addition of excess unlabeled total 30 S proteins. From these results, we conclude that the binding of S17 to 16 S RNA is specific. We have also determined the positions of S15, S16, S17, and S12 in the assembly map and have clarified subsequent interactions depending on these proteins. A revised assembly map is presented which incorporates the additional information obtained from these experimental results."

https://openalex.org/W1522467031,"Abstract Electron microscopic examination of growing spheroplasts prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed ribosome-like particles of 150 A diameter aligned along the outer mitochondrial membrane. Ribosome-like particles were also seen associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer nuclear membrane. Vacuolar and plasma membranes, however, did not appear to have attached particles. When incubated in an amino acid-incorporating system containing pH 5 fraction, mitochondria isolated in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ were capable of incorporating [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. About 80 % of the incorporation was inhibited by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, indicating that the majority of the amino acid-incorporating activity was due to cytoplasmic ribosomes associated with mitochondria. Mitochondria-bound cytoplasmic ribosomes were capable of vectorial release of nascent chains as shown by the distribution of puromycin-discharged polypeptides: half remain associated with the mitochondria and were releaseable by detergent, and half were released directly into the medium. These results are comparable to data reported for the distribution of puromycin-released nascent polypeptide chains with preparations of rough endoplasmic reticulum from rat liver. About one-third of the mitochondria-associated cytoplasmic ribosomes could be released by incubating mitochondria in a buffer of high ionic strength. The remaining two-thirds, however, were released only after reacting their nascent polypeptide chains with puromycin. This result suggests a role for the nascent polypeptide chains in the attachment of cytoplasmic polysomes to mitochondria. Cytoplasmic polysomes can be released intact from isolated mitochondria by extraction with Triton X-100."

The enzyme has now been extracted from the membranes with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and has been purified about 3600-fold to near homogeneity. The detergent was present throughout the purification, which includes steps of solvent fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and gradient centrifugation. Electrophoresis on disc gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed the presence of a single polypeptide estimated to be of molecular weight 35,000. The amino acid composition of this purified membrane protein is not strikingly different from that of the total protein of E. coli. The enzyme is completely dependent for activity on added detergent in the test system and is highly sensitive to inhibition by reagents that attack carbonyl groups.

https://openalex.org/W1494812770,"Abstract When highly stable binary complexes of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with T7 DNA are challenged with a mixture of rifampicin and the four ribonucleoside triphosphates, a major fraction of the enzyme molecules can initiate an RNA chain despite the presence of the drug. The exact fraction depends upon both the rifampicin concentration and the concentration of the ribonucleoside triphosphates: by raising the rifampicin concentration or lowering the ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration, the fraction of enzyme molecules inactivated by rifampicin progressively increases. Quantitatively, these results are most simply explained if RNA polymerase in a highly stable binary complex with T7 DNA is attacked by rifampicin at a constant rate in a second order reaction. The ability of enzyme molecules to initiate an RNA chain in such a challenge experiment is due to the relatively rapid rate of RNA chain initiation. There is no evidence that RNA polymerase in the highly stable binary complex can assume a conformation which is truly resistant to rifampicin prior to RNA chain initiation. This finding provides the basis for a specific assay for measuring the intrinsic rate of RNA chain initiation by E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme-T7 DNA binary complexes and for measuring the fraction of enzyme in such complexes which can initiate an RNA chain rapidly. The assay consists of varying the rifampicin concentration in a challenge experiment where both rifampicin and the ribonucleoside triphosphates are competing for RNA polymerase holoenzyme-T7 DNA complexes. At a given rifampicin concentration the half-life of a binary complex is limited to a known time interval, and consequently the intrinsic rate of RNA chain initiation can be measured. Under standard assay conditions, over 90 % of the holoenzyme molecules in binary complexes with T7 DNA initiate an RNA chain with an apparent first order rate constant for RNA chain initiation of 3.0 s-1 (t1/2 = 0.23 s). The fraction of enzyme molecules able to initiate an RNA chain rapidly (but not the rate of RNA chain initiation) depends on the amount of σ subunit in the enzyme preparation. Variation of the ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration in the RNA chain initiation assay, from 0.04 mm to 0.8 mm yields a linear relationship between the apparent first order rate constant for RNA chain initiation and the ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration."

Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 965–969). The gap in this strand relative to the viral circle has a unique location as judged by the following criteria: (a) a Haemophilus influenzae restriction enzyme preparation breaks the RF–II at one specific site near the gap, cleaving the complementary strand into one large and one small fragment; (b) a Haemophilus parainfluenzae restriction enzyme preparation cleaves the RF–I into at least nine fragments, one of which is missing from the RF–II and is restored when the gap is filled by DNA polymerase. These newly added deoxyribonucleotides are primarily associated with the small fragment after cleavage by H. influenzae enzyme, establishing the proximity of this cleavage site near the 3' end of the complementary strand; (c) pyrimidine tracts from the repaired region (and representing the gap) have a simple and distinctive composition, compared with the full complementary strand; and (d) cleavage of the RF–II at the gap by the single-strand-specific endonuclease S1 from Aspergillus oryzae yields linear molecules which after melting and re-annealing from linear rather than circular duplexes, demonstrating that the gap is at only one place relative to the viral strand."
https://openalex.org/W2073138658,"Abstract When binary complexes between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and T7 DNA are formed at 37° with a molar ratio of enzyme to DNA of three, a major fraction of the enzyme molecules is able to initiate an RNA chain rapidly (t1/2 = 0.23 s) when presented with the four ribonucleoside triphosphates. Initiation of T7 RNA chains from enzyme in these binary complexes is altered in two ways when the temperature of the reaction solution is lowered. With binary complexes formed at 37°, lowering the temperature of the solution to 15° during the initiation reaction results in a modest (1.7-fold) decrease in the rate of RNA chain initiation and does not alter the fraction of enzyme molecules which initiate an RNA chain rapidly. However, if binary complexes are formed at reduced temperatures, the fraction of enzyme molecules which can initiate an RNA chain rapidly decreases sharply over the range from 20° to 10°, even when subsequent RNA chain initiation takes place at 37°. Evidence is presented for two states of binary complexes. At low temperatures the majority of enzyme molecules are bound at or near the T7 early promoter region in a conformation or at a site from which rapid RNA chain initiation is not possible. Enzyme molecules in this state (I complex) are in equilibrium with enzyme molecules in a state (RS complex) which can rapidly initiate T7 RNA chains. The RS complex is favored at elevated temperatures. The I complex can rearrange into the RS complex in a first order process that does not involve dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA. The equilibrium between the two states is altered by the temperature in a manner characteristic of a highly cooperative process. An enthalpy of +57 Cal per mole is calculated for formation of the RS complex with T7 DNA, and a transition temperature of 18° is found. A model for the two kinds of binary complexes postulates that the I complex involves RNA polymerase bound at the promoter region, but that the DNA helix in this region remains in a helical conformation. In the RS complex, a limited strand separation (six to seven base pairs) has occurred in this region of the DNA helix which allows the enzyme access to the base pairing residues of the DNA template."

https://openalex.org/W1592166638,"Abstract A cell-free system for the study of bacteriophage T7 DNA replication has been developed. DNA synthesis in vitro requires the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates and an exogenous T7 DNA template. The rate of synthesis is increased 5- to 6-fold by the four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The products of the phage gene 4 and gene 5 (DNA polymerase), but not those of genes 2, 3, and 6, are required for DNA synthesis in vitro. The kinetics of synthesis is linear for 20 to 30 min, and 30 min after the start of the reaction the amount of DNA synthesized is 2 to 3 times the amount of template DNA added to the reaction. The product is not covalently attached to the template. Analysis by zone sedimentation through alkaline sucrose gradients indicates that the products of synthesis are short (11 S) DNA chains, suggesting that the sealing of Okazaki pieces into DNA of high molecular weight is inefficient in this in vitro reaction. Examination of the product in the electron microscope reveals many large, forked molecules, indicating that in some cases large portions of the T7 genome are replicated in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1495199976,"Photoinactivation of the β2 subunit of tryptophan synthetase is dependent on the presence of the coenzyme, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and results in the specific destruction of 1 histidyl residue per β monomer. The rate of photoinactivation is strikingly increased by the addition of a substrate, l -serine. Inactivation of the β2 subunit can also be achieved by the modification of 2 to 3 histidyl residues per monomer with diethylpyrocarbonate. β2 subunit modified by either procedure can still form a complex with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. The chemically modified β2 subunit can form some Schiff base intermediate between pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and l -serine but appears to be blocked in the further conversion of this intermediate. These results suggest that 1 of the chemically modified histidyl residues may serve a role in the abstraction of the α-proton of l -serine. This suggestion is supported by the finding that the Vmax for the conversion of l -serine to pyruvate is dependent on an ionizing group with a pK of 6.7."
https://openalex.org/W1606754761,"Abstract When highly stable binary complexes are formed between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and T7 DNA at low molar ratios of enzyme to DNA (fewer than three enzyme molecules per DNA) a major fraction of the enzyme molecules is able to initiate an RNA chain extremely rapidly (t1/2 ∼ 0.2 s) when presented with the four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The initiation of T7 RNA chains by binary complexes is altered in two ways when elevated concentrations of KCl are included in the reaction. For binary complexes formed in the absence of KCl, the presence of 0.2 m KCl during initiation lowers the rate of chain initiation about 5-fold but does not affect the fraction of enzyme molecules which can initiate an RNA chain rapidly. However when binary complexes are formed in the presence of increasing amounts of KCl, the fraction of enzyme molecules which can initiate an RNA chain is progressively decreased, even when initiation takes place after dilution to lower salt concentrations. Evidence is presented that binary complexes formed in the presence of KCl contain enzyme bound at or near the T7 early promoter region but that the enzyme is in a state (I complex) which is unable to initiate an RNA chain or can initiate only very slowly. The enzyme in the I complex is in equilibrium with enzyme in a state (RS complex) which can rapidly initiate T7 RNA chains."

https://openalex.org/W1594476483,"Abstract Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of water protons were measured as a function of temperature (1–40°) and frequency (6 to 48 MHz) for Mn(III)- and Fe(III)-containing superoxide dismutases. For the Mn(III) superoxide dismutase, the bulk of the molar relaxivity can be accounted for by 1 water molecule in the first hydration shell. In contrast, a portion of the water relaxivity for the Fe(III) superoxide dismutase comes from 1 proton in the first coordination shell and up to 50% from a water molecule in the second shell. For both enzymes a mechanism involving diffusion of O2- into the second coordination shell but probably not into the primary coordination shell is compatible with kcat = 3 x 109 m-1 s-1. These data are supported by the observation that KCN does not diminish the water relaxation rates for either the Mn(III) or Fe(III) enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1559266759,"Abstract Isolated rat pancreatic islets incubated in media containing glucose at 16.6 mm incorporate [3H]leucine into protein at twice the rate of islets incubated in glucose at 2.8 mm. Increased incorporation was independent of new RNA synthesis, so the effects of glucose on initiation and elongation rates were determined. The relative rates of elongation at 2.8 and 16.6 mm glucose were determined by pulsing islets in [3H]leucine for 6 min and measuring the ratio of incorporation into soluble (S) and polysome associate (P) peptides. At 2.8 mm glucose, S/P = 3.41 ± 0.28, and at 16.6 mm glucose, S/P = 4.72 ± 0.27, an apparent 28% increase in elongation at the higher glucose. The ratio method assumes that the size of the proteins synthesized is the same. Islets proteins were labeled with [14C]leucine at 16.6 mm glucose and with [3H]leucine at 2.8 mm glucose and subjected to co-electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, and the average molecular weight of proteins synthesized at the higher glucose concentration was found to be about 26% smaller. After correction for differences in the size of proteins synthesized, there was no significant effect of glucose on elongation. Evidence that glucose regulates total islet protein synthesis at the level of initiation includes: (a) increased [3H]leucine incorporation into nascent peptide with the distribution on heavier polysome aggregates indicating an increased number of ribosomes per mRNA, even when new RNA synthesis is blocked; (b) a reduction in the number of ribosomes per mRNA by aurintricarboxylic acid (10-5 m) at 16.6 mm glucose with no significant change at 2.8 mm glucose; (c) when elongation is partially inhibited with low doses of cycloheximide (2 µg per ml), ribosomes accumulate on mRNA at 2.8 mm glucose but not at 16.6 mm glucose; under these conditions the amount of protein synthesized is proportional to the amount of mRNA available for translation. Total islet mRNA appeared to be the same at both glucose concentrations, and the doubling of protein synthesis in the absence of changes in elongation is most likely due to a doubling of the over-all initiation rate. Glucose regulation of proinsulin-insulin synthesis appears to be more complex. When elongation was partially blocked, it was determined that in 16.6 mm glucose about 2 to 3 times more proinsulin mRNA was available for translation. There was a preferential utilization of the available mRNA for proinsulin in addition, since there was about a 5 to 6-fold increase in over-all translation of proinsulin mRNA. Methods are being developed to determine whether the glucose effect on translation of proinsulin mRNA is at the level of initiation, elongation, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1535979494,"Abstract The l-arabinose-binding protein was purified by conventional methods from Escherichia coli cell paste and crystallized using 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. A molecular weight of 38,000 was determined using both ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. The amino acid composition revealed high concentrations of aspartic and glutamic residues and nonpolar amino acids. The presence of 2 cysteine residues was also demonstrated. The addition of l-arabinose did not produce changes in the circular dichroism spectra or sedimentation velocity coefficients, indicating that no gross structural alterations occur when the ligand is bound. Studies involving fluorescence spectroscopy and N-bromosuccinimide reactivity have shown that a change in the environment of some tryptophan residues occurs concomitantly with l-arabinose binding."
https://openalex.org/W1579940374,"Abstract The β2 subunit of tryptophan synthetase of Escherichia coli catalyzes the pyridoxal-P-dependent conversion of l-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. In order to study the effect of substitution of deuterium for the α-hydrogen of serine on the rate of this reaction, a new method for the synthesis of α-deutero-dl-serine has been developed; analyses of the product by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are shown. The rate of pyruvate formation from α-deuteroserine is one-fourth of that from α-proteoserine in the absence of NH4+ ion. This kinetic isotope effect indicates that the dissociation of the α-C—H bond of l-serine is the rate-determining step in the formation of pyruvate under these conditions. The enzyme-substrate intermediate which accumulates before the rate-determining α-proton abstraction under these conditions can be observed by its absorption at 420 nm or by its fluorescence. We conclude that this intermediate must be the Schiff base formed between pyridoxal-P and l-serine. The disappearance of this intermediate formed from α-deutero-dl-serine and α-proteo-dl-serine has been measured by stopped flow experiments in the presence of NH4+ ion which increases the rate of this step. The results show a kinetic isotope effect of 4.6 on the rate constant for the forward reaction in which this intermediate disappears. These results are direct evidence that a proton is transferred in this step."

https://openalex.org/W1486355882,"Abstract The kinetic data of phosphoenolpyruvate formation catalyzed by crystalline bakers' yeast P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase were examined with regard to nucleotide and divalent cation absolute requirements. With Mn2+ as cation, the pH profile shows a peak at pH 8.3 with a shoulder in the vicinity of pH 6. There is no evidence to indicate that this is due to the presence of a second enzyme. The enzyme shows a rather high degree of specificity towards ATP (or deoxyadenosine triphosphate). When initial rate data from ATP saturation curve with Mn2+ as cation is analyzed in Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal form a biphasic plot, indicative of activation either by Mn-ATP2- or ATP4-, is obtained. Excess of ATP over MnCl2 is inhibitory. Regarding cation requirement, Mn2+ is the most effective at pH 8.1. On the other hand, at pH 5.9 Mn2+ and Cd2+ are equally effective. At pH 8.1 the curve for rate plotted against MnCl2 concentration is sigmoidal, and maximal activity is always reached at a 1:1 ratio between ATP and MnCl2 concentrations. Excess of MnCl2 over ATP is inhibitory. Addition of low concentrations of CdCl2 ( l 10-2 mm) shifts the sigmoidal shaped curves to hyperbolic ones. When the ratio of MnCl2 and ATP concentrations is kept constant and equal to one, the plot of rate versus cofactors concentration is hyperbolic both in the presence and absence of CdCl2. At pH 6.7 and 5.9 the kinetics of MnCl2 activation is hyperbolic. Addition of CdCl2 enhances enzyme activity greatly also at those pH values. From these results it is proposed that at least two binding sites, related to cation requirement, are present on the yeast enzyme, one binding a cation-nucleotide complex, the true substrate, and the other a free divalent cation. Binding of the free cation at the latter site greatly enhances the affinity of the former for the cation-nucleotide substrate. Apparently only Mn2+ and Cd+2 can fulfill the free divalent cation requirement."

https://openalex.org/W1538280095,"Abstract DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli catalyzes covalent attachment of ribonucleotides at 3'-hydroxyl termini of synthetic as well as naturally occurring DNAs. Incorporation of a single ribonucleotide occurs at 3'-hydroxyl termini of poly[d(A-T)] in the presence of ATP or UTP, at termini of poly[(dG)·(dC)] in the presence of CTP or GTP and at termini of nicked colicin E1 DNA (termini introduced by the action of pancreatic DNase) in the presence of each of the four ribonucleotides. This end addition reaction occurs optimally over a broad pH range (7 to 10) and differs from general transcription in a number of properties. It is more than 20 times less sensitive to the action of streptolydigin than RNA synthesis. Furthermore, it is inhibited only 80 % by 60 µg per ml of rifampicin while RNA synthesis is inhibited more than 95 % by 5 µ per ml of this drug. Ribonucleotide(s) can thus be attached at 3'-hydroxyl termini of DNA under conditions where synthesis of free RNA is inhibited. While the initiation reaction leading to RNA synthesis is specific for purines (ATP and GTP), the end addition reaction shows no preferences for purines. The salt sensitivity and the rate of incorporation of AMP on poly[d(A-T)] parallels that of CMP on poly[(dG)·(dC)] but not GMP. In the absence of the σ subunit of RNA polymerase AMP and UMP end addition on poly [d(A-T)] show identical kinetics. In the presence of the σ subunit, however, AMP incorporation ceases within 10 min and no further incorporation occurs for at least 30 min. On a molar basis, the amount of AMP incorporated is equal to approximately 30 to 50 % of the added RNA polymerase which, as previously shown, corresponds to the proportion of active enzyme molecules (Wickner, S., Hurwitz, J., Nath, K., and Yarbrough, L. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 619–627). Estimation of active RNA polymerase molecules can thus be obtained by end addition measurement. RNA chains are formed at 3'-hydroxyl termini of poly[d(A-T)] in the presence of ATP and UTP, and at the termini of nicked colicin E1 DNA in the presence of all four ribonucleotides. This covalently attached RNA, when isolated after heating in formaldehyde, Cs2SO4 banding, and removal of DNA by treatment with pancreatic DNase, shows a size distribution of 4 S for poly(A-U) and 4 to 10 S for RNA synthesized from nicked colicin E1 DNA. Formation of RNA covalently attached to nicked colicin E1 DNA is favored by the absence of the σ subunit of RNA polymerase, relatively low concentration of a single ribonucleoside triphosphate (20 to 50 µm), short incubation periods at 37° (less than 5 min), and a high ratio of DNA to RNA polymerase. While RNA polymerase holoenzyme catalyzes the synthesis predominantly of free RNA, the core enzyme preparations, depleted of σ subunit, synthesize predominantly covalently attached RNA at 3'-hydroxyl termini of DNA. Core enzyme preparations are also capable of initiating free RNA synthesis to a limited extent."

The compound inhibits the incorporation of [33P]phosphate into phospholipids. Phosphatidylglycerol accumulation is very strongly inhibited, while phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin accumulation are less significantly affected. Pulse labeling studies using [32P]phosphate indicate that phospholipid synthesis is inhibited to a much greater extent by 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate than is the synthesis of DNA or RNA. These studies also indicate that 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate severely inhibits phosphatidylglycerol synthesis and that phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis is inhibited less severely. Cardiolipin synthesis is only slightly affected. Studies on the rate of disappearance of [32P]phosphate from the phosphoglycerides of prelabeled cells indicate that 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate treatment does not alter the rate of turnover of the phospholipids. 3,4-Dihydroxy[3-3H]butyl-1-phosphonate was readily incorporated into a chloroform-extractable fraction of E. coli strain 8."

This reaction, however, occurred to a limited extent with poly(dA) substrates containing AMP residues at the 5' terminus in the presence of poly(dT). These results suggest that although DNA ligase from E. coli is incapable of joining RNA to RNA, it is capable of joining 5'-phosphate terminus of a DNA to the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of RNA in addition to the well known joining reaction between DNA to DNA.

The mixed ribodeoxyribo-oligomers are cleaved specifically at the points of ribonucleotide insertion, to give fragments with the expected sequence. Partial inhibition of the insertion of ribonucleotides occurs under the above incubation conditions which confine the incorporation of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides to the single-stranded cohesive ends. Calculations, based on the assumption that in a fixed percentage of cases no further ribonucleotide insertion occurs, give 10% blockage to ribocytidylate insertion, 30% blockage to riboguanylate insertion, and 60% blockage to riboadenylate insertion. This system has been studied for possible use in DNA sequence analysis, commencing at the ends of a duplex DNA molecule."
