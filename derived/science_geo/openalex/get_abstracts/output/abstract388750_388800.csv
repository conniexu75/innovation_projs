It is not yet established if the large reservoir of monocytes can develop into cells with critical features of DCs in vivo. We now show that fully differentiated monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) develop in mice and DC-SIGN/CD209a marks the cells. Mo-DCs are recruited from blood monocytes into lymph nodes by lipopolysaccharide and live or dead gram-negative bacteria. Mobilization requires TLR4 and its CD14 coreceptor and Trif. When tested for antigen-presenting function, Mo-DCs are as active as classical DCs, including cross-presentation of proteins and live gram-negative bacteria on MHC I in vivo. Fully differentiated Mo-DCs acquire DC morphology and localize to T cell areas via L-selectin and CCR7. Thus the blood monocyte reservoir becomes the dominant presenting cell in response to select microbes, yielding DC-SIGN(+) cells with critical functions of DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2135302954,"Once protein-coding, the X-inactivation center (Xic) is now dominated by large noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). X chromosome inactivation (XCI) equalizes gene expression between mammalian males and females by inactivating one X in female cells. XCI requires Xist, an ncRNA that coats the X and recruits Polycomb proteins. How Xist is controlled remains unclear but likely involves negative and positive regulators. For the active X, the antisense Tsix RNA is an established Xist repressor. For the inactive X, here, we identify Xic-encoded Jpx as an Xist activator. Jpx is developmentally regulated and accumulates during XCI. Deleting Jpx blocks XCI and is female lethal. Posttranscriptional Jpx knockdown recapitulates the knockout, and supplying Jpx in trans rescues lethality. Thus, Jpx is trans-acting and functions as ncRNA. Furthermore, ΔJpx is rescued by truncating Tsix, indicating an antagonistic relationship between the ncRNAs. We conclude that Xist is controlled by two RNA-based switches: Tsix for Xa and Jpx for Xi."

Here, we use a well-established mouse model of Burkitt's lymphoma to show that paracrine factors in the tumor microenvironment modulate lymphoma cell survival following the administration of genotoxic chemotherapy. Specifically, IL-6 and Timp-1 are released in the thymus in response to DNA damage, creating a “chemo-resistant niche” that promotes the survival of a minimal residual tumor burden and serves as a reservoir for eventual tumor relapse. Notably, IL-6 is released acutely from thymic endothelial cells in a p38-dependent manner following genotoxic stress, and this acute secretory response precedes the gradual induction of senescence in tumor-associated stromal cells. Thus, conventional chemotherapies can induce tumor regression while simultaneously eliciting stress responses that protect subsets of tumor cells in select anatomical locations from drug action.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxZDA4NGYxNDJhMzNjMWJmYTQyYTgzMjZjNDMwODI2YSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjQ0NzkyNjM3fQ.IWCXw3uskND-2z4ltl1RpuCpmjJGi83EaTySS1f_JyR1Tdr5dHht-qYDTXMmdSYnSDK-PDTzfm44NcIEJi8-VMHCc6F-2eOlaPpleRCHFGXOgq4BWRgx-B1OdOc69WQ2PlJpw39DHSPns-4GzZdKBEh4ITaZ8oSpQyxj6bXhvETqQKvzomuDvyxyqdxtfElnpbarDM9bxNcLLtTz_68VHoOOD7Bgy3IU6riOsMhqAN786Q0NrgTqBLJ0T5QHok8GipWftVqN1BV2vSjGqlBp_5RZL2kSmIA5VeuZ1O3AZlxTko9FeZRwHh4j9SxqKgH-Hmwjnoz1T2-r9vvkP5iRfA(mp4, (17.11 MB) Download video While numerous cell-intrinsic processes are known to play decisive roles in chemotherapeutic response, relatively little is known about the impact of the tumor microenvironment on therapeutic outcome.

Lymphoma cells in the thymus are protected from genotoxic chemotherapy DNA damage induces an acute p38-dependent release of prosurvival factors Paracrine signaling by IL-6 and Timp1 leads to survival of a residual tumor burden Inhibition of cytokine-induced signaling potentiates chemotherapeutic efficacy While significant progress has been made in the application of chemotherapy over the past 40 years, most chemotherapeutic regimens ultimately fail to cure cancer patients (Holen and Saltz, 2001Holen K.D. Saltz L.B.

Even tumors that show dramatic initial responses to therapy frequently relapse as chemoresistant malignancies. This chemoresistance is thought to arise as a consequence of cell intrinsic genetic changes including upregulation of drug efflux pumps, activation of detoxifying enzymes or apoptotic defects (Bleau et al., 2009Bleau A.M. Hambardzumyan D. Ozawa T. Fomchenko E.I. Huse J.T. Brennan C.W. Holland E.C.

However, recent data suggests that resistance to chemotherapy can also result from cell extrinsic factors such as cytokines and growth factors (Eckstein et al., 2009Eckstein N. Servan K. Hildebrandt B. Politz A. von Jonquieres G. Wolf-Kummeth S. Napierski I. Hamacher A. Kassack M.U. Budczies J. et al.Hyperactivation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor I signaling pathway is an essential event for cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2007Williams R.T. den Besten W. Sherr C.J. Cytokine-dependent imatinib resistance in mouse BCR-ABL+, Arf-null lymphoblastic leukemia.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Additionally, other studies have suggested that rare cancer stem cells are the source of eventual tumor relapse following therapy, as these cells are thought to be drug resistant due to increased genomic stability, decreased oxidative stress or the presence of multiple drug resistance transporters (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). Modern combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimes can reduce patient tumor burdens to undetectable levels, yet in many cases these tumors will relapse (Corradini et al., 1999Corradini P. Ladetto M. Pileri A. Tarella C. Clinical relevance of minimal residual disease monitoring in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: a critical reappraisal of molecular strategies.Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, even when a patient is classified as being in complete remission, surviving cancer cells can persist in particular anatomical locations. This remnant population of cancer cells has been described as minimal residual disease (MRD). MRD is generally not macroscopic and may not be at the site of the primary tumor, making this phenomenon difficult to dissect experimentally (Ignatiadis et al., 2008Ignatiadis M. Georgoulias V. Mavroudis D. Micrometastatic disease in breast cancer: clinical implications.Eur. J. Cancer. 2008; 44: 2726-2736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While MRD is a significant clinical problem, few models exist to study residual tumor burden following therapy. Thus, it remains unclear whether the cancer cells that compose the MRD burden are surviving following chemotherapy due to stochastic events, intrinsic drug resistance, or microenvironmental cues. Efforts to experimentally recapitulate the response of human tumors in vivo to chemotherapy have generally relied upon xenografts of human tumors transplanted into immunodeficient mice (Sharpless and Depinho, 2006Sharpless N.E. Depinho R.A. The mighty mouse: genetically engineered mouse models in cancer drug development.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). These models have proven ineffective in predicting drug efficacy, likely due to a failure to reproduce the complexity of a tumor with its associated complement of stromal, immune and endothelial cells. This autochthonous tumor microenvironment includes a complex mixture of pro- and antineoplastic factors (Hideshima et al., 2007Hideshima T. Mitsiades C. Tonon G. Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C. Understanding multiple myeloma pathogenesis in the bone marrow to identify new therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Both malignant and untransformed cells within a tumor influence the balance of growth factors, chemokines and cytokines found in the tumor microenvironment. These factors play key roles in regulating tumor cell proliferation, and survival through the activation of diverse signaling pathways, including the Jak/Stat, NFκB, Smad, and PI3K pathways (Nguyen et al., 2009Nguyen D.X. Bos P.D. Massague J. Metastasis: from dissemination to organ-specific colonization.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). While numerous studies have addressed the role of tumor-proximal factors in tumor growth or metastasis, relatively few have addressed the role of the tumor microenvironment in chemotherapeutic outcome (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21047) Google Scholar). Here we show that two cytokines, IL-6 and Timp-1, protect lymphoma cells from cell death induced by genotoxic chemotherapy, such that small molecule inhibition of cytokine-induced signaling potentiates chemotherapeutic efficacy. We further show that IL-6 release occurs as a result of p38 MAP Kinase activation in tumor-associated endothelial cells acutely following DNA damage. This acute cytokine release also occurs in treated human endothelial and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting that acute secretory responses may occur in numerous contexts. In the thymus, rapid cytokine release precedes the induction of senescence – a process recently shown to promote sustained cytokine release in cultured cells (Acosta et al., 2008Acosta J.C. O'Loghlen A. Banito A. Guijarro M.V. Augert A. Raguz S. Fumagalli M. Da Costa M. Brown C.

Thus, genotoxic drugs can, paradoxically, elicit prosurvival signaling in select anatomical sites, providing a reservoir of minimal residual disease that subsequently fuels tumor relapse. To investigate the dynamics of lymphoma response and relapse following chemotherapy, we used a well-established preclinical model of human Burkitt's lymphoma—the Eμ-myc mouse (Adams et al., 1985Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. The c-myc oncogene driven by immunoglobulin enhancers induces lymphoid malignancy in transgenic mice.Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Tumors from these mice can be transplanted into immunocompetent syngeneic recipient mice, and the resulting tumors are pathologically indistinguishable from autochthonous tumors (Burgess et al., 2008Burgess D.J. Doles J. Zender L. Xue W. Ma B. McCombie W.R. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Hemann M.T. Topoisomerase levels determine chemotherapy response in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9053-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Six to 8 week old mice were tail vein injected with GFP-tagged Eμ-myc p19Arf−/− B lymphoma cells. At tumor onset all mice displayed a characteristic disseminated pattern of disease with lymphoma cells in the peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and mediastinum. Mice were treated with the maximum tolerated dose of the front-line chemotherapeutic doxorubicin at the time of lymphoma manifestation. Three days after administration of doxorubicin, all mice displayed tumor regression and peripheral tumor clearance, measured by lymph node palpation. These mice were sacrificed at four days posttreatment and sites of minimal residual disease were identified by GFP imaging. Interestingly, the majority of surviving lymphoma cells were in the mediastinal cavity (Figure 1A ), a central component of the thoracic cavity that encapsulates the heart, esophagus, trachea and a large amount of lymphatic tissue including the mediastinal lymph nodes and the thymus. To analyze the effect of drug treatment on specific tumor niches, we harvested all primary lymphoid organs, including peripheral lymph nodes, thymus, spleen and bone marrow, following doxorubicin treatment. All tissues sampled showed extensive lymphoma cell apoptosis and restoration of normal organ architecture. Peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow exhibited nearly complete tumor clearance with rare surviving lymphoma cells (Figure 1C and Figure S1A available online). In contrast, many surviving B lymphoma cells could be seen in the thymus. To quantify this phenotype, cells were harvested from peripheral lymph nodes and the thymus following treatment, and the number of surviving GFP positive lymphoma cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The number of viable lymphoma cells in the thymus relative to the lymph nodes increased 6.5-fold following doxorubicin treatment (Figure 1B). Thus, the thymus represents a chemoprotective niche that protects lymphoma cells from doxorubicin-induced cell death. To rule out the possibility that the selective survival of tumor cells in the thymus was due to the specific exclusion of doxorubicin from the mediastinum, we sorted live GFP-positive tumor cells from the lymph nodes and thymus 12 hr after doxorubicin treatment and blotted for γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage (Morrison and Shen, 2005Morrison A.J. Shen X. DNA repair in the context of chromatin.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that cells in both anatomical locations undergo the same amount of DNA damage (Figure 1D). Additionally, flow cytometry of mediastinal lymphoma cells failed to identify any sub-population of lymphoma cells with decreased γ-H2AX fluorescence (Figure S1B). These data suggest that the thymus offers no physical barrier to drug delivery. Given the persistence of tumor cells in the thymus following chemotherapy, we next sought to determine whether tumor cells in the thymus contributed to lymphoma relapse. To this end, we examined therapeutic response in genetically and surgically athymic mice. We injected control or Rag1 deficient mice, which have severely atrophic thymuses, with lymphoma cells and then treated tumor-bearing recipient animals with doxorubicin. Overall survival and tumor free survival were significantly extended in tumor-bearing Rag1 deficient mice, relative to control animals, suggesting that the presence of a functional thymus promotes relapse and disease progression (Figure 1E and Figure S1C). Similarly, surgically thymectomized tumor-bearing mice also showed extended tumor-free and overall survival following therapy relative to control animals (Figure S1D and data not shown). Notably, overall survival in untreated tumor-bearing Rag1 deficient or thymectomized mice was indistinguishable from that in control animals (Figure S1E). Thus, the thymus harbors minimal residual disease that contributes to tumor relapse following therapy in this model. Preferential lymphoma cell survival in the thymus following doxorubicin treatment suggests that specific anatomical microenvironments may contain prosurvival factors absent in other lymphoid organs. There is precedence for this phenomenon in multiple myeloma, where the bone marrow microenvironment promotes myeloma cell survival (Hideshima et al., 2007Hideshima T. Mitsiades C. Tonon G. Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C. Understanding multiple myeloma pathogenesis in the bone marrow to identify new therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we derived conditioned media from the thymus (TM, for thymic media), bone marrow (BMM) and lymph nodes (LNM) of mice treated with doxorubicin. Cultured lymphoma cells were then treated with doxorubicin, along with TM, LNM or BMM. Addition of TM provided a significant survival advantage, with 10-fold more cells surviving 48 hr following treatment (Figure 2A ). This effect was specifically prosurvival, as opposed to proproliferative, as these same conditioned medias had little effect on lymphoma cell growth (Figure 2B). In contrast, conditioned media derived from peripheral lymph nodes had only a minimal effect on lymphoma cell survival (Figure 2A). Thus, soluble prosurvival factor(s) present in the thymic microenvironment protect tumor cells from genotoxic chemotherapy. To identify the factor(s) contributing to lymphoma cell survival in the thymus, we performed cytokine arrays analyzing the abundance of 40 cytokines and chemokines in conditioned media from doxorubicin treated and untreated tumors (Figure 2C and data not shown). Analysis of cytokine expression showed significant differences between the thymic and lymph node tumor microenvironments. Multiple factors related to cell migration and cell cycle control were acutely upregulated in thymic lymphomas, but not in peripheral lymphomas or cultured lymphoma cells, following doxorubicin treatment. These included the cytokines G-CSF, IL-1α, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-16, and the chemokines and growth factors KC, MCP-1, MCP-5, MIP-2, and Timp-1 (Figure 2C). Each of the upregulated factors was tested in vitro for the ability to promote doxorubicin resistance. Of the 10 recombinant proteins examined, only two produced a significant effect on lymphoma cell survival following doxorubicin treatment in vitro. Recombinant Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as a single agent, was able to promote a 2.8-fold increase in the number of surviving lymphoma cells 72 hr following doxorubicin treatment (Figure 3A and Figure S2A ). Similarly, addition of Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (Timp-1) resulted in a 3-fold increase in surviving lymphoma cells following doxorubicin treatment (Figure 3B). These factors had a combinatorial effect (Figure 3B), as addition of both recombinant IL-6 and Timp-1 resulted in a 4.5-fold increase lymphoma cell number following treatment (Figure 3B). Importantly, neither factor alone or in combination affected lymphoma cell growth, suggesting that this increase in cell number was not due to enhanced cell proliferation (Figure S2B). Additionally, recombinant IL-6 had no effect on lymphoma cell motility in this setting (Figure S2C).Figure S2Soluble Factors in the Thymic Tumor Microenvironment Modulate Doxorubicin-Induced Lymphoma Cell Death but Do Not Affect Growth, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) A bar graph depicting lymphoma cell survival following treatment with doxorubicin alone or doxorubicin and recombinant cytokines as indicated.

The p values for all Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated using a log rank test. While these data show that both Timp-1 and IL-6 promote chemoresistance in the thymus, we decided to focus our efforts on the contribution of IL-6 to therapeutic response. To determine whether IL-6 was acting to promote cell survival in an autocrine fashion following release from lymphoma cells or a paracrine fashion following release from surrounding thymic cells, we performed lymphoma transplant experiments in the presence or absence of IL-6. Specifically, IL-6+/+ lymphomas were transplanted into IL-6+/+ or IL-6−/− mice (Figure 3C and Figure S2D). Tumor-bearing recipient mice were then treated with the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin and monitored for tumor free survival and overall survival. Notably, while IL-6−/− and IL-6+/+ recipient mice developed pathologically indistinguishable tumors, IL-6−/− recipients displayed significantly longer tumor free survival and overall survival following treatment than their IL-6+/+ counterparts (Figure 3D and Figures S2F and S2G). Additionally, histological analysis confirmed the lack of surviving lymphoma cells in the thymus of IL-6−/− mice following treatment (Figure 3E). Thus, IL-6 release from the tumor microenvironment, rather than from the tumor itself, promotes tumor cell survival. To further interrogate the source of thymic IL-6, IL-6 levels were examined in thymic lymphomas from doxorubicin-treated IL-6+/+ and IL-6−/− recipient mice, as well as doxorubicin treated lymphoma cells in vitro (Figure 3C). No IL-6 was detected in either IL-6+/+ lymphoma cells in vitro or in thymic or peripheral tumors from IL-6−/− lymphoma-bearing mice (data not shown). This result strongly suggests that the IL-6 present in the tumor microenvironment following genotoxic stress is secreted in a paracrine manner from resident thymic cells. Recent work has shown that DNA damage can induce a secretory phenotype in cultured cells (Rodier et al., 2009Rodier F. Coppe J.P. Patil C.K. Hoeijmakers W.A. Munoz D.P. Raza S.R. Freund A. Campeau E. Davalos A.R. Campisi J. Persistent DNA damage signalling triggers senescence-associated inflammatory cytokine secretion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-6 is similarly induced as a consequence of genotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, we treated mice lacking tumors with the maximally tolerated dose of doxorubicin. 18 hr later we assayed IL-6 levels by ELISA in untreated and doxorubicin treated mice. As suggested by the cytokine array data, IL-6 was present at a constitutively higher level in the thymus versus the lymph nodes of mice (Figure 4A ). Additionally, doxorubicin treatment significantly increased the amount of IL-6 in the thymus but not in peripheral lymph nodes or the spleen (Figure 4A and Figure S3A ). Thus, genotoxic chemotherapy induces a stress response in the thymus that includes the release of IL-6, a prosurvival cytokine. Notably, IL-6 induction in the thymus occurred within 18 hr of treatment, much more acutely than has been reported for secretory phenotypes in cultured cells (Rodier et al., 2009Rodier F. Coppe J.P.

The p values for all Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated using a log rank test. To confirm that this acute DNA damage-induced secretory response also occurs in thymuses with substantial lymphoma infiltration, we examined IL-6 levels in tumor-bearing mice. Again, IL-6 was constitutively present at a higher level in the thymic tumor microenvironment versus the peripheral tumor microenvironment, and treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a rapid and significant increase in IL-6 levels in thymic lymphomas but not in peripheral lymphomas (Figure 4B). As chemotherapy rapidly induces apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies, these data are consistent with the idea that acute cytokine release following DNA-damage may directly impact therapeutic response. Both IL-6 and Timp-1 have been shown to signal through Jak2 and Stat3 (Heinrich et al., 1998Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L.

We tested this hypothesis by treating lymphoma cells with doxorubicin and TM or doxorubicin and TM plus a Jak2/Jak3 inhibitor. Addition of the Jak inhibitor completely ablated the protective effect of TM (Figure 4C). Importantly, the Jak inhibitor had a minimal effect on lymphoma cell growth in the presence of TM (data not shown). Thus, Jak2/Jak3 signaling promotes the chemoprotective effect of TM in vitro.

Here we show that ATRX binds to tandem repeat (TR) sequences in both telomeres and euchromatin. Genes associated with these TRs can be dysregulated when ATRX is mutated, and the change in expression is determined by the size of the TR, producing skewed allelic expression. This reveals the characteristics of the affected genes, explains the variable phenotypes seen with identical ATRX mutations, and illustrates a new mechanism underlying variable penetrance. Many of the TRs are G rich and predicted to form non-B DNA structures (including G-quadruplex) in vivo. We show that ATRX binds G-quadruplex structures in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which ATRX may play a role in various nuclear processes and how this is perturbed when ATRX is mutated."

From initial studies using RNA hairpin-tagged mRNAs for purification of messenger ribonucleoproteins assembled on transcripts with HIV-1 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) sequences, we uncover a two-step mechanism for Upf1-dependent degradation of mRNAs with long 3′UTRs. We demonstrate that Upf1 associates with mRNAs in a 3′UTR length-dependent manner and is highly enriched on transcripts containing 3′UTRs known to elicit NMD. Surprisingly, Upf1 recruitment and subsequent RNA decay can be antagonized by retroviral RNA elements that promote translational readthrough. By modulating the efficiency of translation termination, recognition of long 3′UTRs by Upf1 is uncoupled from the initiation of decay.

A characteristic that is common to many NMD decay substrates is an extended distance from the terminating ribosome to the mRNA 3′ end (i.e., 3′UTR length). Degradation of aberrant mRNAs by NMD can affect the progression of many human genetic disorders, an estimated one-third of which derive from PTCs (Kuzmiak and Maquat, 2006Kuzmiak H.A. Maquat L.E.

In addition, shortening of 3′UTRs has been proposed to relax regulation of mRNA stability and translation, promoting cellular transformation (Sandberg et al., 2008Sandberg R. Neilson J.R. Sarma A.

These findings underscore the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which 3′UTR length is sensed in the process of mRNA quality control. The well-conserved superfamily I RNA helicase Upf1 is a crucial component of the core NMD machinery. Like other RNA helicases, Upf1 exhibits nonspecific but robust RNA binding activity modulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis (Weng et al., 1998Weng Y. Czaplinski K. Peltz S.W.

USA. 1998; 95: 10009-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, Upf1 participates in a network of interactions with additional factors proposed to mediate its association with mRNA targets and regulate a cycle of Upf1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation required for establishment of translational repression and recruitment of RNA decay enzymes (reviewed in Nicholson et al., 2010Nicholson P.

Life Sci. 2010; 67: 677-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; see below). Within the context of a long 3′UTR, additional mRNA features and protein components of mRNPs can promote or inhibit decay. For example, the exon-junction complex (EJC), a multiprotein assembly deposited at exon-exon junctions in the process of splicing, acts through Upf1 to strongly activate decay (Le Hir et al., 2000Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J.

The competition between Upf1 and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1) for binding to the translation release factors eRF1 and eRF3 has been proposed to be a crucial factor in the decision to decay diverse transcripts (Ivanov et al., 2008Ivanov P.V. Gehring N.H. Kunz J.B. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E.

Upf1 binding to release factors at the terminating ribosome stimulates phosphorylation of Upf1 by the SMG-1 kinase, translational repression, and recruitment of decay factors (Kashima et al., 2006Kashima I.

Conversely, binding of PABPC1 to release factors is proposed to preserve transcript stability and translational competence. In support of this model, artificial tethering approaches and alterations in 3′UTR structure designed to mimic 3′UTR shortening by bringing PABPC1 in proximity to the termination codon can suppress Upf1-dependent decay (Amrani et al., 2004Amrani N.

Here, we use affinity purification of hairpin-tagged mRNAs to isolate and characterize endogenously assembled mRNP complexes. With this approach, we show that Upf1 assembles into mRNPs in a 3′UTR length-dependent manner. Upf1 copurifies to some extent with all transcripts tested but is highly enriched on mRNAs containing 3′UTRs derived from known NMD targets. The preferential association of Upf1 with mRNAs containing NMD-sensitive 3′UTRs is not affected by inhibition of translation and NMD. Together with our finding that the efficiency of Upf1 coimmunoprecipitation with 3′UTR-derived RNase H cleavage products correlates with fragment length, these observations suggest a direct role for Upf1 in 3′UTR length sensing. To further investigate the in vivo dynamics of 3′UTR length surveillance and decay, we use retroviral elements to induce translational readthrough of NMD-triggering termination codons. Surprisingly, periodic readthrough events can reduce steady-state Upf1 association with transcripts containing long 3′UTRs and robustly inhibit NMD. Moreover, we show that rare readthrough events permit steady-state Upf1 accumulation in mRNPs but prevent initiation of mRNA decay. Our data inform a model in which equilibrium binding of Upf1 senses 3′UTR length and establishes an RNP state primed for decay. The identification of potential decay targets by Upf1 is coupled to a subsequent commitment to decay, the rate of which is dependent on other aspects of mRNP structure and composition. Furthermore, our data indicate that the decision to decay takes place over a kinetic interval corresponding to many translation termination events. This separation between 3′UTR length sensing and initiation of decay provides a mechanism to prevent aberrant degradation of normal RNAs and presents an opportunity for transcripts to evade cellular mRNA surveillance. Retroviruses may exploit this opportunity by inducing translational readthrough or frameshifting to periodically disrupt the recognition of viral mRNAs as potential decay substrates. To better understand cellular mRNA biogenesis and decay, we have developed a generalizable technique for purification and characterization of endogenously assembled mRNP complexes. In this approach, we singly tag mRNAs with the naturally occurring Pseudomonas phage 7 coat protein (PP7CP) binding site, a 25 nucleotide (nt) stably folding hairpin (Figure 1A ; Lim and Peabody, 2002Lim F. Peabody D.S. RNA recognition site of PP7 coat protein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4138-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tagged RNAs are transiently or stably expressed in appropriate mammalian cell lines, allowing progression through endogenous RNA processing pathways. RNPs assembled on the tagged RNAs are then purified from extracts using a version of the PP7CP tagged with tandem Staphylococcus aureus protein A domains. Previously, a similar method was used to isolate complexes associated with several noncoding RNAs (Hogg and Collins, 2007aHogg J.R. Collins K. Human Y5 RNA specializes a Ro ribonucleoprotein for 5S ribosomal RNA quality control.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Hogg and Collins, 2007bHogg J.R. Collins K. RNA-based affinity purification reveals 7SK RNPs with distinct composition and regulation.RNA. 2007; 13: 868-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the process of adapting this methodology to the purification of mRNPs, we found that the use of traditional agarose-based resins afforded inefficient purification of tagged mRNP complexes. In contrast, nonporous magnetic resins allowed purification of tagged mRNAs to near homogeneity following a single step of purification (Figures 1A and 1C; additional data not shown). Recent work in our laboratory has shown that HIV-1 3′LTR sequences play a crucial role in the regulation of viral mRNA biogenesis (Valente and Goff, 2006Valente S.T. Goff S.P. Inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression by a fragment of hnRNP U.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Valente et al., 2009Valente S.T.

To identify proteins specifically associated with HIV 3′LTR sequences, we constructed a series of PP7-tagged RNAs containing the GFP open reading frame and alternative 3′UTRs (Figure 1B; see below). In our initial experiments, we used a version of the HIV 3′LTR containing a deletion in the U3 region (ΔU3 LTR). The bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (bGH pA) element of the pcDNA3.1 vector was used as a control, aiding discrimination of proteins specifically bound to HIV 3′LTR sequence-containing RNPs. Silver staining of complexes purified from whole-cell extracts of transiently transfected 293T cells revealed that, as expected, each tagged RNA associates with a large number of proteins (Figure 1C and data not shown). Mock purifications from extracts lacking tagged RNAs exhibited very few contaminating proteins, indicating that the vast majority of the proteins visible by silver staining were isolated via their association with tagged mRNPs. Many components of the purified mRNPs are found in all complexes purified, including general translation factors, ribosomes, hnRNP proteins, and other proteins that associate with common mRNA features (Figure 1C and data not shown). Tandem mass spectrometry of gel slices excised from HIV ΔU3 LTR and bGH copurifying material identified four peptides derived from the Upf1 protein in the ΔU3 LTR sample but none in the bGH control sample (Table S1 available online). Immunoblotting of PP7-purified RNPs confirmed that Upf1 was enriched on transcripts containing HIV 3′LTR sequences, using immunoblotting for PABPC1 as a control for RNP recovery (Figure 2A ). We detected Upf1 in association with RNAs containing the bGH pA element, but at much lower levels than those copurifying with RNAs containing the ΔU3 LTR sequence. Still higher levels of Upf1 were isolated using a full-length LTR (FLTR) comprising intact U3, R, and U5 LTR segments from the pNL4.3 reference HIV genome (Figure 1B and Figure 2A). In agreement with observations of human Upf1 cosedimentation with bulk polysomes and coimmunoprecipitation with diverse mRNAs (Pal et al., 2001Pal M. Ishigaki Y. Nagy E. Maquat L.E.

Importantly, we additionally observe substantial transcript-specific enrichment of Upf1 in mRNPs (see below).Figure 3Upf1 Preferentially Associates with Transcripts Containing 3′UTRs Known to Trigger NMDShow full caption(A) PP7-tagged GFP mRNAs containing the indicated 3′UTRs were transiently expressed in 293T cells and subjected to affinity purification.

Immunoblotting and northern blotting were performed as in (A). Inhibition of NMD by cycloheximide and persistence of Upf1 recruitment under conditions of translation inhibition by puromycin and 5′-proximal hairpins are illustrated in Figures S1C–S1F. To address the specificity of Upf1 association with RNPs containing HIV 3′LTR sequences, we first created tagged RNA constructs in which the ΔU3 or full-length LTR elements were cloned in the antisense orientation, with the bGH pA element provided downstream to ensure proper 3′ end maturation. The requirement for an additional 3′ end-processing element caused the antisense 3′UTRs to be ∼200 nt longer than their sense equivalents (Figure 2B, see northern blot). As above, we observed increasing Upf1 copurification with the bGH, ΔU3, and FLTR RNAs, respectively (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, the levels of Upf1 associated with the antisense LTR-containing RNAs were slightly higher than with the corresponding sense 3′UTRs. Thus, the observed recruitment of Upf1 to LTR-containing RNAs was not dependent on primary sequence or structural features. Instead, our data suggested that Upf1 accumulation in mRNPs might be dictated by 3′UTR length. Current models suggest that 3′UTR length is a crucial determinant of NMD susceptibility (Mühlemann, 2008Mühlemann O. Recognition of nonsense mRNA: towards a unified model.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen, 2009Rebbapragada I. Lykke-Andersen J. Execution of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: what defines a substrate?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which 3′UTR length is sensed remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that Upf1 associates with transcripts in a 3′UTR length-dependent manner, we generated a series of 5′ PP7-tagged RNAs consisting of the GFP ORF fused to the HIV FLTR, such that the fragment of the HIV nef ORF contained in the LTR was in frame with the GFP ORF (Figure 2C). This series of constructs contains single termination codons at ∼100 nt intervals, starting with the original GFP termination codon and ending with the nef termination codon ∼400 nt downstream. In this way, we varied 3′UTR length by making only one (ablation of the GFP TC) or two (ablation of the GFP TC combined with introduction of a new in-frame TC) point mutations to the RNA primary sequence. Using these constructs, we found that Upf1 copurification with tagged mRNAs increased with 3′UTR length (Figure 2C). The relationship between Upf1 copurification and 3′UTR length was strikingly linear, consistent with sequence-nonspecific recognition of long 3′UTRs by Upf1 (Figure 2D). Our observations suggested that Upf1 might accomplish 3′UTR length sensing by associating with 3′UTRs. To better understand the basis for 3′UTR length-dependent accumulation of Upf1 in mRNPs, we used RNase H and a series of oligonucleotides directed against HIV 3′LTR sequence to site-specifically cleave 5′-tagged GFP-FLTR mRNAs at sites ∼7, ∼211, and ∼305 nucleotides downstream of the GFP TC. Following RNase H digestion, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Upf1 and assayed mRNA recovery by northern blotting using a probe against HIV 3′LTR sequence. The RNase H cleavage conditions were designed to leave a substantial fraction of the mRNAs intact, allowing the use of full-length mRNAs as recovery controls. FLTR-containing mRNAs were recovered with an antibody against Upf1, but not nonspecific control goat IgG (Figure 2E and Figure S1A ). Consistent with our observations above, the efficiency of 3′UTR fragment coimmunoprecipitation increased with RNA length (Figures 2E and 2F). These data suggest that Upf1 association along the length of 3′UTRs accounts for the observed 3′UTR length-dependent accumulation in mRNPs. Our observation that Upf1 association correlates with 3′UTR length mirrors prior findings that 3′UTR extension causes progressive transcript destabilization in mammalian cells (Bühler et al., 2006Bühler M. Steiner S. Mohn F. Paillusson A. Mühlemann O. EJC-independent degradation of nonsense immunoglobulin-μ mRNA depends on 3′ UTR length.Nat. Struct. Mol.

A competition between stimulators and antagonists of Upf complex recruitment governs human nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e111Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To assess the functional significance of the enrichment of Upf1 on specific mRNAs, we used a series of long 3′UTRs shown by Singh and colleagues (2008) to either promote or evade decay. As representative NMD-insensitive long 3′UTRs, we used the human CRIPT1 (1515 nt) and TRAM1 (1494 nt) 3′UTRs. To model targets of 3′UTR length-dependent NMD, we used the human SMG5 3′UTR (1342 nt) and an artificial 3′UTR comprising a portion of the GAPDH ORF and the GAPDH 3′UTR (GAP; 846 nt). As above, we transiently transfected 293T cells with tagged RNA constructs containing model 3′UTRs and isolated mRNPs from whole-cell extracts with PP7CP. Immunoblotting of purified RNPs revealed that Upf1 association strongly correlated with NMD sensitivity (Figure 3A). Very low levels of Upf1 copurified with transcripts containing the NMD-insensitive CRIPT1 and TRAM1 3′UTRs. In contrast, transcripts containing the intronless GAP and SMG5 3′UTRs copurified high levels of Upf1, with the SMG5 3′UTR-containing mRNAs showing the greatest Upf1 recruitment. Likewise, antibodies against Upf1 coimmunoprecipitated mRNAs containing the GAP and SMG5 3′UTRs at higher efficiencies than mRNAs containing the CRIPT and TRAM 3′UTRs (Figure S1A). We did not observe the NMD factors SMG-1 or Upf2 in PP7-purified mRNPs, despite robust detection of the proteins in whole-cell extracts used for purification (Figure 3A). In similar experiments, comparable levels of Upf1 copurified with mRNAs containing the intronless GAP 3′UTR and a version of the GAP 3′UTR containing the adenovirus major-late intron (GAP AdML; Figure S1B). This observation suggests that 3′UTR length is a more significant determinant of Upf1 association than the presence of a spliced intron downstream of the TC. Together, these findings indicate that the extent of Upf1 association with a transcript is diagnostic of its NMD susceptibility, consistent with previous experiments in yeast, C. elegans, and human cells (Johansson et al., 2007Johansson M.J.O.

The scaffolding model proposes that endophilin's SH3 domain recruits essential endocytic proteins, whereas the membrane-bending model proposes that the BAR domain induces positively curved membranes. We show that mutations disrupting the scaffolding function do not impair endocytosis, whereas those disrupting membrane bending cause significant defects. By anchoring endophilin to the plasma membrane, we show that endophilin acts prior to scission to promote endocytosis. Despite acting at the plasma membrane, the majority of endophilin is targeted to the SV pool. Photoactivation studies suggest that the soluble pool of endophilin at synapses is provided by unbinding from the adjacent SV pool and that the unbinding rate is regulated by exocytosis. Thus, endophilin participates in an association-dissociation cycle with SVs that parallels the cycle of exo- and endocytosis. This endophilin cycle may provide a mechanism for functionally coupling endocytosis and exocytosis. Two models have been proposed for endophilin function in synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis.

In synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis, endophilin acts as a membrane-bending molecule Endophilin functions at the plasma membrane, acting prior to scission Endophilin is bound to SVs, with RAB-3 promoting the endophilin-SV association A soluble endophilin pool at synapses is provided by SV exocytosis Neurotransmitter released at synapses is drawn from a pool of recycling synaptic vesicles (SVs). SVs are consumed by exocytosis and are recycled by endocytosis. To maintain a releasable pool of SVs, the rates of exo- and endocytosis must remain in balance. Stimuli that increase SV exocytosis rates produce corresponding increases in endocytosis rates, whereas endocytosis is arrested following blockade of exocytosis (Dittman and Ryan, 2009Dittman J. Ryan T.A. Molecular circuitry of endocytosis at nerve terminals.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 133-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about how endocytosis is regulated or how the competing processes of SV exocytosis and endocytosis are coordinately regulated. To begin addressing these questions, we focused on the endocytic protein endophilin. Endophilin is a conserved protein harboring two functional domains: an N-terminal BAR (Bin–amphiphysin–Rvs) domain and a C-terminal SH3 (Src homology 3) domain. Inactivation of endophilin produces profound defects in SV endocytosis (Schuske et al., 2003Schuske K.R. Richmond J.E. Matthies D.S. Davis W.S. Runz S. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Jorgensen E.M.

Several studies suggest that endophilin acts primarily as a scaffold, recruiting other essential endocytic proteins via its SH3 domain (Dickman et al., 2005Dickman D.K. Horne J.A. Meinertzhagen I.A.

Endophilin's SH3 domain robustly binds to proline-rich domains (PRDs) in dynamin and synaptojanin. Antibodies or peptides that interfere with endophilin's SH3-mediated interactions impair SV recycling and cause accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at lamprey synapses. In flies and worms, mutants lacking endophilin have decreased synaptic abundance of synaptojanin (Schuske et al., 2003Schuske K.R. Richmond J.E. Matthies D.S. Davis W.S. Runz S.

Synaptojanin is recruited by endophilin to promote synaptic vesicle uncoating.Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Based on these data, endophilin was proposed to primarily function as a molecular scaffold. Analysis of endophilin's BAR domain suggests an alternative model. Recombinant BAR domains bind liposomes and induce positive curvature of their membranes, as evidenced by the conversion of spherical liposomes into elongated tubules (Farsad et al., 2001Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. Generation of high curvature membranes mediated by direct endophilin bilayer interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The endophilin BAR domain also alters membrane morphology in transfected cells (Itoh et al., 2005Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton cooperatively regulate plasma membrane invagination by BAR and F-BAR proteins.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Based on these data, endophilin (and potentially all BAR proteins) was proposed to function by bending membranes. Crystallographic studies suggested a potential mechanism for the endophilin membrane-bending activity (Gallop et al., 2006Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Masuda et al., 2006Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Homodimers of the endophilin BAR domain form a concave membrane-binding surface, and specific hydrophobic residues in the BAR domain are proposed to insert into the outer membrane leaflet. Both of these features are predicted to promote positive membrane curvature. Although these studies clearly demonstrate endophilin's membrane-bending ability, whether this activity is required for its endocytic function has not been tested. Although all BAR domains share these in vitro membrane-bending activities, each BAR protein regulates distinct steps in membrane trafficking. Relatively little is known about how BAR proteins are specifically targeted to distinct membrane-trafficking events. Here we examine the functional importance of the scaffolding and membrane-bending activities of endophilin. We show that the membrane-bending activity is essential for endophilin's function and that endophilin undergoes an association-dissociation cycle with SVs that parallels the cycle of exo- and endocytosis. We propose that this endophilin cycle provides an activity dependent mechanism for delivering endophilin to endocytic zones. Due to their endocytosis defects, unc-57 endophilin mutants have a smaller pool of SVs and a corresponding decrease in synaptic transmission (Schuske et al., 2003Schuske K.R. Richmond J.E. Matthies D.S. Davis W.S. Runz S. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Jorgensen E.M. Endophilin is required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis by localizing synaptojanin.Neuron. 2003; 40: 749-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We exploited three unc-57 mutant phenotypes as in vivo assays of endophilin function. First, unc-57 mutants had decreased locomotion rates (Figures 1A and 1B ; wild-type [WT] 147 ± 9 μm/s, unc-57 33 ± 3 μm/s; p < 0.001). Second, unc-57 mutants had a decreased rate of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at body muscle NMJs (Figures 1C and 1D; EPSC rates: WT 38 ± 2.1 Hz, unc-57 12 ± 0.9 Hz; p < 0.001). The mean EPSC amplitude was not significantly altered in unc-57 mutants (see Figure S1A available online; EPSC amplitudes: WT 22.7 ± 1.4 pA, unc-57 20.7 ± 0.6 pA; p = 0.25). Third, when endocytosis rates are diminished, the SV protein synaptobrevin becomes increasingly trapped in the plasma membrane. We utilized SynaptopHluorin (SpH) to measure changes in surface synaptobrevin (Dittman and Kaplan, 2006Dittman J.S. Kaplan J.M. Factors regulating the abundance and localization of synaptobrevin in the plasma membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SpH consists of a pH-sensitive GFP tag fused to the extracellular domain of synaptobrevin. In SVs, SpH fluorescence is quenched by the acidic pH of the vesicle lumen. Following SV fusion, SpH fluorescence on the plasma membrane is dequenched (Dittman and Ryan, 2009Dittman J. Ryan T.A. Molecular circuitry of endocytosis at nerve terminals.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 133-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Endophilin mutants had an 83% increase in SpH axon fluorescence compared to wild-type controls, consistent with a defect in SV endocytosis (Figures 1E and 1F).Figure S1Properties of Transgenic Animals Carrying UNC-57 Constructs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Summary data for endogenous EPSC amplitudes are shown for the indicated genotypes.

All constructs in this figure contain the snb-1 promoter. Using these assays, we tested the importance of the BAR and SH3 domains for endophilin's function. Full-length and truncated UNC-57 proteins were expressed in unc-57 mutants. Each construct was tagged with mCherry at the C terminus, to control for differences in transgene expression (Figure S1B). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that unc-57 transgenes were expressed at approximately twice the level of the endogenous unc-57 mRNA (Figure S1C). Mutant UNC-57 proteins lacking the SH3 domain fully rescued the locomotion, EPSC, and SpH defects (Figure 1). By contrast, UNC-57 proteins containing a BAR domain mutation that disrupts membrane binding (ΔN, deletion of N-terminal 26 residues; Gallop et al., 2006Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) lacked rescuing activity in all three assays (Figure 1) . Thus, UNC-57 endocytic function requires the membrane-binding BAR domain but does not require the SH3 domain. Although the SH3 domain was not required for rescuing activity (Figure 1), it remained possible that UNC-57 primarily functions as a scaffold molecule recruiting other endocytic proteins. We did several experiments to further test the scaffolding model. Consistent with prior studies (Schuske et al., 2003Schuske K.R. Richmond J.E. Matthies D.S. Davis W.S. Runz S. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Jorgensen E.M.

Synaptojanin is recruited by endophilin to promote synaptic vesicle uncoating.Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we found that the fluorescence intensity of GFP::UNC-26 synaptojanin puncta was slightly reduced in the unc-57 endophilin mutants (83% wild-type level; p < 0.01) (Figures S2A and S2B ). Photobleaching experiments demonstrated that approximately 50% of GFP::UNC-26 was immobile in wild-type animals and that this immobile fraction was unaltered in either unc-57 mutants or in mutants rescued with the BAR domain (Figures S2D–S2F). Consequently, synaptojanin must have additional binding partners beyond endophilin at synapses. Expressing mutant UNC-57 proteins lacking the SH3 domain rescued the unc-57 endocytic defects but failed to rescue the UNC-26 synaptojanin localization defects. In fact rescued animals had less UNC-26 puncta fluorescence than was observed in unc-57 mutants (50% and 80% wild-type levels, respectively, p < 0.001) (Figures S2A and S2B). Similarly, expressing a mutant UNC-26 protein lacking the PRD rescued the locomotion defects of unc-26 mutants (Figure S2C). These results agree with a prior study showing that mutations preventing the interaction of mouse synaptojanin and endophilin caused only modest endocytic defects (Mani et al., 2007Mani M. Lee S.Y. Lucast L. Cremona O. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Ryan T.A. The dual phosphatase activity of synaptojanin1 is required for both efficient synaptic vesicle endocytosis and reavailability at nerve terminals.Neuron. 2007; 56: 1004-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results support the notion that interactions between endophilin and synaptojanin do not play an essential role in SV endocytosis, although it remains possible that these interactions regulate endocytosis in some manner. These experiments also suggest that the modest changes in UNC-26 synaptojanin targeting are unlikely to account for the unc-57 endocytic defect. To further address the scaffolding model, we analyzed two additional endocytic proteins. GFP-tagged dynamin (DYN-1::GFP) and the AP2α-subunit (APT-4::GFP) were both localized to diffraction-limited puncta adjacent to presynaptic elements (labeled with mRFP::SNB-1), suggesting that these reporters are localized to perisynaptic endocytic zones. DYN-1 and APT-4 puncta intensities were significantly increased in unc-57 mutants (Figure S2), indicating increased synaptic abundance when endophilin was absent. Mislocalization of DYN-1 in unc-57 mutants could arise from the absence of DYN-1 interactions with the UNC-57 SH3. Contrary to this idea, expression of mutant UNC-57 proteins lacking the SH3 corrected the DYN-1 puncta defects, whereas those carrying mutations that prevent membrane binding (ΔN) abolished rescuing activity. These data suggest that the increased synaptic recruitment of DYN-1 and APT-4 observed in unc-57 mutants is a secondary consequence of the endocytic defect and do not support a role for endophilin as a molecular scaffold. To test the membrane-bending model, we analyzed mutations that disrupt various aspects of BAR domain function in vitro. For these experiments we used the BAR domain derived from rat endophilin A1 (rEndoA1) because the impact of these mutations on BAR domain activity and structure has only been analyzed for the mammalian proteins. Transgenes were expressed at similar levels (Figure S3A ). Expression of rEndoA1 BAR rescued the locomotion, SpH, and EPSC defects of unc-57 mutants (Figure 2 and Figure S3B). Mutations disrupting membrane binding [rEndoA1 BAR(ΔN)] failed to rescue both the locomotion and SpH defects of unc-57 mutants (data not shown), consistent with the results we obtained with the UNC-57(ΔN) mutant. These results indicate that the rEndoA1 BAR domain retains endocytic function in C. elegans neurons.Figure 2The Membrane-Bending Activity of Endophilin A BAR Domains Promotes SV EndocytosisShow full caption(A–C) Transgenes encoding wild-type and mutant BAR domains (1–247) from rEndoA1 BAR were analyzed for their ability to rescue locomotion rate (A), the surface Synaptobrevin (SpH) (Figure S3B), and EPSC rate (B and C) defects of unc-57 mutants.

(F) Rescuing activities of rEndo A1, A2, A3, and A3(Y64S) BAR domains for the unc-57 mutant locomotion defect are compared. All transgenes were expressed in all neurons using the snb-1 promoter.

Error bars, SEM. See also Figure S3. Endophilin's tubulation activity in vitro is diminished by mutations that prevent dimerization of the BAR domain (ΔH1I) and by mutations that replace hydrophobic residues in the H1 helix with polar residues (M70S/I71S double mutant) (Gallop et al., 2006Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Conversely, membrane-bending activity is enhanced by a mutation that increases hydrophobicity of the H1 helix (A66W) (Masuda et al., 2006Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Due to its increased membrane-bending activity, the A66W protein also lacks tubulation activity and, instead, promotes vesiculation of liposomes. None of these mutations significantly alters the membrane-binding activity of the BAR domain in vitro (Gallop et al., 2006Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. Mechanism of endophilin N-BAR domain-mediated membrane curvature.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Masuda et al., 2006Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Transgenes encoding mutant rEndoA1 BAR domains were expressed in unc-57 mutants. Both the dimerization mutant (ΔH1I) and the tubulation defective mutant (M70S/I71S) had significantly less rescuing activity for the unc-57 locomotion, SpH, and EPSC rate defects compared to the wild-type rEndoA1 BAR domain (Figure 2 and Figure S3B). Interestingly, the A66W mutant (which has enhanced membrane-bending activity) also exhibited decreased rescuing activity in all three assays (Figure 2 and Figure S3B). None of these tubulation mutants significantly altered endogenous EPSC amplitudes (Figures S3C and S3D). These results indicate that endophilin mutations altering membrane tubulation activity produce corresponding defects in SV endocytosis in vivo, consistent with the membrane-bending model. These results also suggest that decreased and increased membrane-bending activities are both detrimental to SV endocytosis. Membrane association and in vitro tubulation activities are common features of most if not all BAR domains; however, only a few BAR domain proteins have been implicated in SV endocytosis. Thus, BAR domains must have other features that confer specificity for their corresponding membrane-trafficking functions. To test this idea we analyzed BAR domains derived from two other proteins. The endophilin B and amphiphysin BAR domains both have in vitro tubulation activity (Farsad et al., 2001Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. Generation of high curvature membranes mediated by direct endophilin bilayer interactions.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, Peter et al., 2004Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. BAR domains as sensors of membrane curvature: the amphiphysin BAR structure.Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, neither BAR domain was able to rescue the unc-57 locomotion defects (Figure 2D), although both were well expressed and targeted to axons (data not shown). By contrast, efficient rescue was observed with transgenes expressing rat and lamprey endophilin A proteins. These results suggest that only endophilin A BAR domains can promote SV endocytosis. To compare their functional properties, we expressed the BAR domains derived from the three rat endophilin A proteins in unc-57 mutants. The rEndoA1 and A2 BAR domains fully rescued the unc-57 locomotion defect, whereas the A3 BAR domain had significantly less rescuing activity (Figure 2F). Comparing the H1 helix sequence of these isoforms suggested an explanation for this discrepancy. T"

Casein (18 per cent) prevented these dyscrasias, but crystalline L. casei factor (""folic acid"") did not prevent them. In the correction of granulocytopenia in rats fed protein-free diets, L. casei factor alone was only slightly effective, diets of higher casein content (18 or 30 per cent) were ineffective under the experimental conditions described. However, L. casei factor combined with an 18-per cent casein-containing diet or L. casei factor combined with a mixture of purified amino acids were found to be highly effective in correcting the granulocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2049501965,"IT has been shown previously1 that when radiation (for example, X-rays, a-particles, neutrons) is absorbed in aqueous solutions, an indirect chemical effect is produced due to the formation of free radicals and atoms: In general, this is followed by the recombination: and by interactions of these radicals with other acceptor substances (S, S1 S2) present, for example: This scheme of reactions must exist also in the aqueous systems of biological subjects. From the point of view of the older 'hit' theory2, reaction (3) corresponds to a single 'hit', while if, for example, one gets a successive change of the (starting) substrate (S) by 1,2 ' n interactions with, for example, OH radicals, which is equivalent to 1,2 n 'hits'. It can be shown that—under certain conditions—there is a complete formal analogy between the 'hit' theory, which is described by Poisson's formula, and the mathematical expression for the above system of equations (3, 3·1, 3·n)."

Whereas this selectivity is extremely marked in glycerides or other mixtures of unsaturated esters, it is much less prominent when corresponding mixtures of unsaturated acids are hydrogenated2. Further, Richardson et al.3 observed that selectivity is not so fully developed during hydrogenation of whale or other marine animal oils, wherein polyethenoid acids of the C18, C20 and C22 series are prominent ; and Harper, Hilditch and Terleski4 showed that up to a very late stage in the hydrogenation of whale oil or cod liver oil, definite proportions of unsaturated glycerides containing more than one ethenoid group persist."

Similar reactions take place with other monomeric vinylidene compounds, such as methyl methacrylate, if the fibres are first impregnated with ammonium persulphate as a catalyst2. It would obviously be a convenience, in practice, if polymers could be formed within wool fibres by treatment with aqueous dispersions of the corresponding monomers instead of with the mixed vapours of water and monomer.

ALLAN'S presidential address to the Museums Association on July 5 last is published in the Museums Journal (August 1945, pp. 73-80) under the title of “Museums Manpower”. Dealing with the qualifications to be looked for in candidates for administrative posts in museums, Dr. Allan emphasizes (1) the educational background (which is usually provided by a university course leading to a degree or diploma) ; (2) specialized training in the museum ; (3) ability for the work entailed ; and (4) personality (which is not least in importance). That these attributes are not always recognized as essentials to good curator-ship is evidenced by the numbers of small, dismal and neglected museums that are still to be found in various parts of Great Britain, and also by Dr. Allan's subsequent reference to the common contention that few museums can afford to employ holders of degrees or diplomas. In criticizing that attitude, he rightly points out that a local authority or public body which undertakes the provision of a public service (museum or otherwise) also undertakes the responsibility of maintaining it in efficiency. Referring specifically to local museums, he says: “If the local museum is merely a repository of curios, a caretaker is clearly all that is needed.... If the museum is to be an educational instrument... then it must be equipped and staffed accordingly-and the bill will be correspondingly higher.”"
