https://openalex.org/W2401866878,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid (AA) and endocannabinoid substrates, placing the enzyme at a unique junction between the eicosanoid and endocannabinoid signaling pathways. COX-2 is a sequence homodimer, but the enzyme displays half-of-site reactivity, such that only one monomer of the dimer is active at a given time. Certain rapid reversible, competitive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to inhibit COX-2 in a substrate-selective manner, with the binding of inhibitor to a single monomer sufficient to inhibit the oxygenation of endocannabinoids but not arachidonic acid. The underlying mechanism responsible for substrate-selective inhibition has remained elusive. We utilized structural and biophysical methods to evaluate flufenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid for their ability to act as substrate-selective inhibitors. Crystal structures of each drug in complex with human COX-2 revealed that the inhibitor binds within the cyclooxygenase channel in an inverted orientation, with the carboxylate group interacting with Tyr-385 and Ser-530 at the top of the channel. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching, continuous-wave electron spin resonance, and UV-visible spectroscopy demonstrate that flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid are substrate-selective inhibitors that bind rapidly to COX-2, quench tyrosyl radicals, and reduce higher oxidation states of the heme moiety. Substrate-selective inhibition was attenuated by the addition of the lipid peroxide 15-hydroperoxyeicosatertaenoic acid. Collectively, these studies implicate peroxide tone as an important mechanistic component of substrate-selective inhibition by flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2369724542,"Pancreatitis is associated with premature activation of digestive proteases in the pancreas. The lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B (CTSB) is a known activator of trypsinogen, and its deletion reduces disease severity in experimental pancreatitis. Here we studied the activation mechanism and subcellular compartment in which CTSB regulates protease activation and cellular injury. Cholecystokinin (CCK) increased the activity of CTSB, cathepsin L, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and caspase 3 in vivo and in vitro and induced redistribution of CTSB to a secretory vesicle-enriched fraction. Neither CTSB protein nor activity redistributed to the cytosol, where the CTSB inhibitors cystatin-B/C were abundantly present. Deletion of CTSB reduced and deletion of cathepsin L increased intracellular trypsin activation. CTSB deletion also abolished CCK-induced caspase 3 activation, apoptosis-inducing factor, as well as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein degradation, but these depended on trypsinogen activation via CTSB. Raising the vesicular pH, but not trypsin inhibition, reduced CTSB activity. Trypsin inhibition did not affect apoptosis in hepatocytes. Deletion of CTSB affected apoptotic but not necrotic acinar cell death. In summary, CTSB in pancreatitis undergoes activation in a secretory, vesicular, and acidic compartment where it activates trypsinogen. Its deletion or inhibition regulates acinar cell apoptosis but not necrosis in two models of pancreatitis. Caspase 3-mediated apoptosis depends on intravesicular trypsinogen activation induced by CTSB, not CTSB activity directly, and this mechanism is pancreas-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2475015499,"The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has recently been implicated in anoikis resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms that activate AMPK upon matrix detachment remain unexplored. In this study, we show that AMPK activation is a rapid and sustained phenomenon upon matrix deprivation, whereas re-attachment to the matrix leads to its dephosphorylation and inactivation. Because matrix detachment leads to loss of integrin signaling, we investigated whether integrin signaling negatively regulates AMPK activation. However, modulation of focal adhesion kinase or Src, the major downstream components of integrin signaling, failed to cause a corresponding change in AMPK signaling. Further investigations revealed that the upstream AMPK kinases liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) contribute to AMPK activation upon detachment. In LKB1-deficient cells, we found AMPK activation to be predominantly dependent on CaMKKβ. We observed no change in ATP levels under detached conditions at early time points suggesting that rapid AMPK activation upon detachment was not triggered by energy stress. We demonstrate that matrix deprivation leads to a spike in intracellular calcium as well as oxidant signaling, and both these intracellular messengers contribute to rapid AMPK activation upon detachment. We further show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium release-induced store-operated calcium entry contributes to intracellular calcium increase, leading to reactive oxygen species production, and AMPK activation. We additionally show that the LKB1/CaMKK-AMPK axis and intracellular calcium levels play a critical role in anchorage-independent cancer sphere formation. Thus, the Ca(2+)/reactive oxygen species-triggered LKB1/CaMKK-AMPK signaling cascade may provide a quick, adaptable switch to promote survival of metastasizing cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2383487144,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from the secretin-like (class B) family are key players in hormonal homeostasis and are important drug targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders and neuronal diseases. They consist of a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) with the GPCR signature of seven transmembrane helices. Class B GPCRs are activated by peptide hormones with their C termini bound to the receptor ECD and their N termini bound to the TMD. It is thought that the ECD functions as an affinity trap to bind and localize the hormone to the receptor. This in turn would allow the hormone N terminus to insert into the TMD and induce conformational changes of the TMD to activate downstream signaling. In contrast to this prevailing model, we demonstrate that human class B GPCRs vary widely in their requirement of the ECD for activation. In one group, represented by corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1R), parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R), and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide type 1 receptor (PAC1R), the ECD requirement for high affinity hormone binding can be bypassed by induced proximity and mass action effects, whereas in the other group, represented by glucagon receptor (GCGR) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), the ECD is required for signaling even when the hormone is covalently linked to the TMD. Furthermore, the activation of GLP-1R by small molecules that interact with the intracellular side of the receptor is dependent on the presence of its ECD, suggesting a direct role of the ECD in GLP-1R activation.

Although crystal structures of more than 20 class A GPCRs have been determined, currently no full-length structure of a class B receptor has been reported due to the inherent instability of these receptors and the limited availability of stabilizing high affinity small molecule agonists and antagonists. Although the TMDs of class B GPCRs are highly homologous, homology of the ECDs is limited to the six disulfide-forming cysteines and only about a dozen other conserved residues. Most ECD structures have been obtained only in complex with ligands, indicating that ligand binding stabilizes these proteins and, therefore, favors crystallization of ECD-ligand complexes. In contrast to endogenous peptide hormones, small molecule antagonists, such as CP-376395 (a CRF1R antagonist), which were discovered by high throughput screening, act allosterically within the TMD to block the binding and signaling of the peptide agonist ligands (14.Hollenstein K. Kean J. Bortolato A. Cheng R.K. Doré A.S. Jazayeri A. Cooke R.M. Weir M. Marshall F.H.

In this report we demonstrate that the ECDs of some class B GPCRs, such as CRF1R, PAC1R, and PTH1R, solely function as affinity traps, and hence, their requirement can be bypassed by mass action effects and hormone tethering, consistent with the prevailing model of peptide binding and activation of Class B GPCRs. In contrast to this prevailing model, activation of GCGR and GLP-1R is strictly dependent on the presence of their ECDs. We further provide comprehensive insights into the mechanism for the requirement of ECD in activation of GCGR and GLP-1R by small molecule ligands and by mutational studies. These results provide new mechanistic insights into activation of GCGR and GLP-1R, information that could be beneficial for the notoriously difficult development of high affinity small molecule agonists of these GPCRs and for the construct design for crystallizing the full-length receptors. To examine the requirement of the GCGR ECD for signaling, we transiently transfected four different FLAG-tagged constructs into HEK293 cells: the full-length receptor, TMD, TMD-interacting N terminus of glucagon (1–15) fused to the TMD, and a fusion in which glucagon (1–15) and the TMD are separated by a thermostabilized cytochrome b562 variant, BRIL, which has been used for facilitating GPCR crystallization (16.Chun E.

If the ECD only functions as an affinity trap to increase the local concentration of the glucagon N terminus, we reasoned that a high concentration of exogenous glucagon may bypass the requirement for the ECD. We, therefore, studied the activation of a cAMP-responsive CRE-luciferase reporter to monitor GCGR signaling in the presence and absence of 500 nm glucagon whose physiological concentration in blood is ∼25 pm (17.Ruiter M. La Fleur S.E. van Heijningen C. van der Vliet J. Kalsbeek A. Buijs R.M.

Metab. 2001; 86: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, the TMD was well expressed but remained inactive under either condition. As expected, full-length GCGR was active in the presence, but not the absence, of the hormone. Although pioneering work by the Vale laboratory demonstrated that directly fusing CRF to the CRF1RΔECD generated a constitutively active receptor (19.Nielsen S.M. Nielsen L.Z. Hjorth S.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Constitutive activation of tethered-peptide/corticotropin-releasing factor receptor chimeras.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a chimeric fusion between glucagon and the GCGR TMD with or without BRIL linker was inactive (Fig. 1C). Next, we extended this analysis to four other members of class B GPCRs; GLP-1R, PTH1R, CRF1R, and PAC1R. GLP-1R behaved in a manner similar to GCGR in that activity required both the full-length receptor and free peptide hormone (Fig. 1E), even though the GLP-1R TMD and GLP-1-TMD fusions were well expressed (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the ECDs for PTH1R, CRF1R, and PAC1R were not required in the presence of high concentrations of their respective hormones, and their requirements could also be bypassed by directly fusing the N-terminal, TMD-interacting hormone fragments to their respective TMDs (Fig. 2), resulting in constitutive receptor activation. The results of the chimeric receptor experiments are in agreement with previous reports on CRF1R (19.Nielsen S.M. Nielsen L.Z. Hjorth S.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Constitutive activation of tethered-peptide/corticotropin-releasing factor receptor chimeras.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fusion of glucagon and GLP-1 to their full-length receptors, separated by 5 repeats of a Gly-Ser-Ala linker (15 amino acid linker = GSA5), constitutively activated the CRE-luciferase reporter (Fig. 3), indicating that fused glucagon and GLP-1 in the presence of their respective ECD can productively interact with the TMD.FIGURE 3Tethering of GCG and GLP-1 to their full-length receptors constitutively activates receptor signaling.

In this approach proximity occurs by membrane co-localization, i.e. without directly fusing hormone and receptor and thereby avoiding potential steric constraints impeding the interaction between covalently linked binding partners. In these experiments, we fused glucagon and GLP-1 to a long flexible linker and the single membrane-spanning helix of CD8 (20.Fortin J.P. Zhu Y. Choi C. Beinborn M. Nitabach M.N. Kopin A.S.

Consistent with the previous report (20.Fortin J.P. Zhu Y. Choi C. Beinborn M. Nitabach M.N. Kopin A.S. Membrane-tethered ligands are effective probes for exploring class B1 G protein-coupled receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8049-8054Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), membrane-anchored glucagon and GLP-1 constitutively activated their full-length receptors (Fig. 4). However, they failed to stimulate signaling through GCGR and GLP-1R lacking respective ECDs (Fig. 4). Collectively, we conclude that class B GPCRs vary in the extent of their ECD requirements for receptor activation and that the receptors can be divided into two functionally distinct subgroups: one group including PTH1R, CRF1R, and PAC1R, in which the ECD only functions as affinity trap and is, therefore, dispensable when the affinity requirement is bypassed, and the other group including GCGR and GLP-1R that requires the ECD for receptor activation. This conclusion is further supported by full-concentration curves of GCG and GLP-1 to their respective receptors (Fig. 5). Both GCG and GLP-1 activate their respective full-length receptor at low nm concentrations, but they cannot activate their TMDs lacking the ECD even at 10 μm of peptides.FIGURE 5Concentration curves of GCG (A) and GLP-1 (B) in activation of their full-length and TMD receptors. For the full-length (FL) receptor, the EC50 value for GCG is 3.4 nm and the EC50 value for GLP-1 is 7.0 nm. For TMD, there is no activation up to 10 μm GCG or GLP-1. All data are presented as cAMP signal (RLU); n = 3, error bars = S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the ECD requirement for activation of GCGR, we carried out mutational studies of the ECD and the fused hormone peptide in the context of the GCG-GSA5-GCGR fusion protein. We first mutated residues in the glucagon part of the protein. Tyr-10 and Tyr-13 in the N terminus of glucagon have been predicted to make key interactions with the GCGR TMD (12.Siu F.Y.

Structure of the human glucagon class B G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2013; 499: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Their replacements with arginine residues (Y10R and Y13R) strongly reduced activity of the hybrid receptor, but activity could be fully recovered in the presence of 500 nm exogenous glucagon (Fig. 6A). This indicates that the intramolecular interaction with the fused mutant peptide can be efficiently displaced by exogenous native peptide, suggesting that the glucagon-ECD interaction is an important contributor for the overall affinity of glucagon-GCGR binding and activation. Replacement of Trp-25 in the ECD-interacting C terminus of the fused glucagon had a partial signaling defect even though the fusion positions the hormone in the vicinity of the TMD independent of an ECD interaction. We subsequently introduced 27 single amino acid alterations into the fusion proteins that collectively span the entire length of the ECD: W36A, D63A, P86S, F31R, E34R, K37R, L38R, D41R, H45R, L49R, L56R, N74R, T76R, N78R, W83R, H89R, V91L, F95R, F97R, R99E, D103R, V107R, P114R, W115R, D117N, S119R, and Q120R (Fig. 6, B and C). Three groups of mutant proteins stood out. The first group of mutations included Trp-36, Asp-63, and Pro-86, which were previously identified as glucagon binding residues in a structure model of the full-length glucagon-GCGR complex (12.Siu F.Y.

The corresponding fusion proteins were expressed at levels comparable with those of the wild type fusion protein (Fig. 7) but almost abolished receptor activation both in the presence or absence of exogenously added glucagon (Fig. 6B). Second, seven well expressed mutant proteins (N74R, T76R, W83R, V91L, F95R, F97R, D103R Q120R; marked with asterisks in Fig. 6C) had activities that were reduced by ≥2-fold compared with the wild type yet whose activity defect could be rescued by 500 nm exogenous glucagon. We mapped the corresponding residues on the crystal structure of the structurally highly homologous GLP-1R ECD in complex with GLP-1 (6.Underwood C.R. Garibay P. Knudsen L.B. Hastrup S. Peters G.H.

Surprisingly, none of these residues was in bonding distance to the peptide hormone, and none was on the long α1-helix, which is thought to interact with the TMD under basal conditions but not in the presence of glucagon (22.Koth C.M.

Instead, all of them were exposed on the third accessible surface of the complex (the other two surfaces are formed by the hormone and the α1-helix). Therefore, a substantial set of residues required for GCGR activity did not appear to be involved in ligand binding but likely formed an inter- or intramolecular interaction surface. Third, six mutations mapped to the α1-helix (E34R, K37R, L38R, D41R, H45R, and L49R; Figs. 6C and 8) and showed moderately higher activity than the wild type fusion protein, except for L49R, which displayed the same activity as the wild type. This observation is consistent with the proposed inhibitory effect of the α1-helix on basal GCGR activity (22.Koth C.M. Murray J.M. Mukund S. Madjidi A. Minn A. Clarke H.J. Wong T. Chiang V. Luis E.

Here, we report that modulating these sequences can tune the steady-state abundance of proteins over 2 orders of magnitude in cells. This is the same dynamic range as seen for inducing ubiquitination through a classic N-end rule degron. The stability and abundance of His3 constructs dictated by the initiation site affect survival of yeast cells and show that variation in proteasomal initiation can affect fitness. The proteasome's sequence preferences are linked directly to the affinity of the initiation sites to their receptor on the proteasome and are conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human cells. These findings establish that the sequence composition of unstructured initiation sites influences protein abundance in vivo in an evolutionarily conserved manner and can affect phenotype and fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2408318651,"Copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A is essential for mammalian copper homeostasis. Loss of ATP7A activity is associated with fatal Menkes disease and various other pathologies. In cells, ATP7A inactivation disrupts copper transport from the cytosol into the secretory pathway. Using fibroblasts from Menkes disease patients and mouse 3T3-L1 cells with a CRISPR/Cas9-inactivated ATP7A, we demonstrate that ATP7A dysfunction is also damaging to mitochondrial redox balance. In these cells, copper accumulates in nuclei, cytosol, and mitochondria, causing distinct changes in their redox environment. Quantitative imaging of live cells using GRX1-roGFP2 and HyPer sensors reveals highest glutathione oxidation and elevation of H2O2 in mitochondria, whereas the redox environment of nuclei and the cytosol is much less affected. Decreasing the H2O2 levels in mitochondria with MitoQ does not prevent glutathione oxidation; i.e. elevated copper and not H2O2 is a primary cause of glutathione oxidation. Redox misbalance does not significantly affect mitochondrion morphology or the activity of respiratory complex IV but markedly increases cell sensitivity to even mild glutathione depletion, resulting in loss of cell viability. Thus, ATP7A activity protects mitochondria from excessive copper entry, which is deleterious to redox buffers. Mitochondrial redox misbalance could significantly contribute to pathologies associated with ATP7A inactivation in tissues with paradoxical accumulation of copper (i.e. renal epithelia)."

Here we show that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-ylation of VCP is a normal stress response inhibited by the disease-causing mutations in the N-domain. Under oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, the SUMOylation of VCP facilitates the distribution of VCP to stress granules and nucleus, and promotes the VCP hexamer assembly. In contrast, pathogenic mutations in the VCP N-domain lead to reduced SUMOylation and weakened VCP hexamer formation upon stress. Defective SUMOylation of VCP also causes altered co-factor binding and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Furthermore, SUMO-defective VCP fails to protect against stress-induced toxicity in Drosophila. Therefore, our results have revealed SUMOylation as a molecular signaling switch to regulate the distribution and functions of VCP during stress response, and suggest that deficiency in VCP SUMOylation caused by pathogenic mutations will render cells vulnerable to stress insults.

https://openalex.org/W2466276373,"PTEN is a tumor suppressor that functions to negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway as the lipid phosphatase for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues (amino acids 380-385) on the C-terminal tail serves to alter the conformational state of PTEN from an open active state to a closed inhibited state, resulting in a reduction of plasma membrane localization and inhibition of enzyme activity. The relative contribution of each phosphorylation site to PTEN autoinhibition and the structural basis for the conformational closure is still unclear. To further the structural understanding of PTEN regulation by C-terminal tail phosphorylation, we used protein semisynthesis to insert stoichiometric and site-specific phospho-Ser/Thr(s) in the C-terminal tail of PTEN. Additionally, we employed photo-cross-linking to map the intramolecular PTEN interactions of the phospho-tail. Systematic evaluation of the PTEN C-tail phospho-cluster showed autoinhibition, and conformational closure was influenced by the aggregate effect of multiple phospho-sites rather than dominated by a single phosphorylation site. Moreover, photo-cross-linking suggested a direct interaction between the PTEN C-tail and a segment in the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain. Mutagenesis experiments provided additional insights into how the PTEN phospho-tail interacts with both the C2 and catalytic domains."

Ensemble-based dynamic studies using a luminescence resonance energy transfer technique also show a similar mechanism with the glutamate-binding LBD of the NMDA receptor (9Rambhadran A. Gonzalez J.

In comparison to the other ionotropic glutamate receptors, the NMDA receptors are unique in that they are obligate heteromers typically consisting of a glutamate-binding subunit such as GluN2A and the glycine-binding subunit GluN1. As before, when its ligand binds to the GluN1 subunit LBD, it closes its clamshell cleft. However, crystal studies of the GluN1 LBD show no difference in the extent of cleft closure with different partial agonists, leading to the hypothesis of a two-state model, in which the closed, active state is stabilized to varying degrees, rather than the multistate model of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (10Jespersen A.

Consistent with this, computational experiments using umbrella sampling methods have revealed that the apo-GluN1 LBD conformational landscape shows two free energy minima, with one minimum corresponding to a closed clamshell and the other to an open clamshell (14Yao Y. Belcher J. Berger A.J. Mayer M.L.

Together, this suggests that the addition of agonist stabilizes the closed clamshell conformation with partial agonists stabilizing the conformation to a lesser degree. Experimental verification of the two-state model has been attempted using fluorescence techniques. Early ensemble luminescence resonance energy transfer experiments did not show a difference in the cleft closure state between both full and partial agonists (9Rambhadran A. Gonzalez J. Jayaraman V. et al.Conformational changes at the agonist binding domain of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16953-16957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis of a single closed cleft conformation; however, these studies were unable to resolve any difference in the stabilization of the closed cleft state, which would be central to the mechanism of the two-state hypothesis. More recently, single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has been used to experimentally observe the dynamic changes undergone by the NMDA receptor (2Sasmal D.K. Lu H.P. et al.Single-molecule patch-clamp FRET microscopy studies of NMDA receptor ion channel dynamics in living cells: revealing the multiple conformational states associated with a channel at its electrical off state.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 12998-13005Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and specifically by the GluN1 LBD (16Dolino D.M. Cooper D. Ramaswamy S. Jaurich H. Landes C.F. Jayaraman V. et al.Structural dynamics of the glycine-binding domain of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor.J. Biol.

J. 2015; 109: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These latter studies provided the first experimental evidence of a partial agonist-dependent change in the conformational equilibrium of the GluN1 LBD; however, the time resolution for these experiments was limited to 10 ms. With the kinetic movements of the GluN1 LBD occurring faster than this resolution (18Kussius C.L. Popescu G.K. et al.Kinetic basis of partial agonism at NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the lack of a clear conformational model, more robust experimental methods were needed to clarify this mechanism of partial agonism. To probe the conformational landscape of the GluN1 LBD at faster time scales than previously studied, we used smFRET and multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) to obtain a complete experimental investigation of the dynamics and conformational equilibrium of the GluN1 LBD. MFD experiments can be used as another method of obtaining smFRET data, but in contrast to obtaining the intensity-based FRET efficiency of individual molecules over a period of seconds, MFD experiments simultaneously measure a number of fluorescence parameters, including intensity, lifetime, and anisotropy of molecules, as they diffuse one at a time through a small confocal volume. The use of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) allows for the exploration of dynamic motions in a broad range of time scales, down to picoseconds (19Sisamakis E. Valeri A. Kalinin S. Rothwell P.J. Seidel C.A.M. et al.Accurate single-molecule FRET studies using multiparameter fluorescence detection.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 475: 456-514Google Scholar), making this method particularly well suited for observing the mechanism of partial agonism of the GluN1 LBD. The isolated GluN1 LBD was purified, and site-directed labeling with fluorescent dyes was performed to probe the distance across the LBD cleft (Fig. 1) (16Dolino D.M. Cooper D. Ramaswamy S. Jaurich H. Landes C.F. Jayaraman V. et al.Structural dynamics of the glycine-binding domain of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 797-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that the GluN1 LBD exhibits a common closed cleft, active arrangement among a variety of agonists, with partial agonists showing less stability of the closed conformation and more dynamic conversions to the open conformations. Moreover, we find among the FRET states one conformation, which resembles within 2.8 Å the published crystallographic structure for the glycine-bound configuration, and another state that differs only by 1.6 Å from the DCKA-bound structure (13Furukawa H. Gouaux E. et al.Mechanisms of activation, inhibition and specificity: crystal structures of the NMDA receptor NR1 ligand-binding core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The GluN1 LBD was mutated at Ser-507 and Thr-701 (full-length sequence) on opposite sides of the cleft as has previously been described (16Dolino D.M. Cooper D. Ramaswamy S. Jaurich H. Landes C.F.

J. 2015; 109: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and then labeled using the FRET pair Alexa 488 and Alexa 647, with an R0 of 52 Å. Based on crystallographic studies of the glycine-bound (PDB code 1PB7, orange) and DCKA-bound (PDB code 1PBQ, blue) conformations of the LBD, we performed in silico labeling and determined the expected mean FRET efficiency distance 〈RDA〉E = 48.7 and 54.2 Å, for both structures, respectively (Fig. 1A). With this construct one should be able to observe the clamshell closure due to the binding of different ligands. To verify that these mutations (GluN1 S507C/T701C) do not abolish the functionality and efficacy of ligands in the full receptor, we obtained whole cell electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 1B). Ligand efficacy was determined by normalizing to the maximum amplitude in presence of the full agonist glycine. As expected, d-serine, also a full agonist, has similar efficacy to glycine, followed by l-alanine and ACBC. The last two are considered partial agonists (Fig. 1C). For single molecule experiments, we used pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) of donor and acceptor fluorophores to excite the doubly labeled LBD. The emitted fluorescence photons were collected to measure various FRET efficiency indicators of single molecules of the LBD when in complex with different ligands (glycine, 1 mm; d-serine, 1 mm; l-alanine, 15 mm; ACBC, 10 mm; or DCKA 100 μm). FRET efficiency was measured simultaneously through both intensity measurements and donor lifetime measurements in the presence of the acceptor (Fig. 2) . The resulting single-molecule events or burst histograms are presented in a multidimensional representation, where each event was preselected according to a 1:1 donor to acceptor stoichiometry. The cleaned FRET signal is shown as contours on two-dimensional histograms and as filled histograms over the one-dimensional 〈τD(A)〉f and FD/FA projections. The green sigmoidal line over the two-dimensional histogram represents the static FRET line (Equation 3, Table 1) , which is the theoretical relationship between the two FRET indicators: the donor fluorescence average lifetime 〈τD(A)〉f and the ratio of donor-to-acceptor fluorescence (FD/FA). Populations that lie on the line indicate FRET states that are “static” (19Sisamakis E. Valeri A. Kalinin S. Rothwell P.J. Seidel C.A.M. et al.Accurate single-molecule FRET studies using multiparameter fluorescence detection.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 475: 456-514Google Scholar), i.e. populations with dynamic interconversion rates that are slower than the burst duration.TABLE 1FRET linesSampleStatic FRET lineGly(0.7732/0.4240)/((3.8660/((−0.0405 × 〈τD(A)〉f3) + (0.2914 × 〈τD(A)〉f2) + 0.4891 × 〈τD(A)〉f −0.0422))−1)d-Ser(0.8286/0.4290)/((4.1430/((−0.0348 × 〈τD(A)〉f3) + (0.2676 × 〈τD(A)〉f2) + 0.4977 × 〈τD(A)〉f −0.0443))−1)l-Ala(0.8426/0.4130)/((4.2130/((−0.0335 × 〈τD(A)〉f3) + (0.2622 × 〈τD(A)〉f2) + 0.4998 × 〈τD(A)〉f −0.0448)) − 1)ACBC(0.7990/0.3810)/((3.9950/((−0.0377 × 〈τD(A)〉f3) + (0.2799 × 〈τD(A)〉f2) + 0.4932 × 〈τD(A)〉f − 0.0432))−1)DCKA(0.8498/0.3960)/((4.2490/((−0.0329 × 〈τD(A)〉f3) + (0.2594 × 〈τD(A)〉f2) + 0.5008 × 〈τD(A)〉f −0.0451))−1) Open table in a new tab These MFD histograms show clear differences in the conformational landscapes probed by the GluN1 LBD in complex with various ligands. As expected, with the antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DCKA), mostly medium to low FRET states are explored, with a longer donor fluorescence lifetime and a larger donor-to-acceptor fluorescence ratio (FD/FA = 3.3) (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with the stabilization of an open cleft conformation. When in complex to the full agonist glycine, the FRET states shift toward higher FRET efficiencies, indicated by lower donor fluorescence lifetimes and smaller donor to acceptor fluorescence ratios (Fig. 2B). This is also consistent with the stabilization of the closed cleft conformation. A second full agonist, d-serine, shows a similar trend (Fig. 2C), although not as pronounced. To assess the LBD conformational space and dynamics across a variety of activation states we examined two partial agonists (l-alanine and 1-amino-1-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid). Between the two, the more effective partial agonist l-alanine (Fig. 2D) resembled more the two full agonists, and the less effective partial agonist 1-amino-1-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (ACBC, Fig. 2E) resembled more the antagonist histogram, similarly to the whole cell recordings (Fig. 1B). Of note, the histograms for the two partial agonists seemed to spread across a wider variety of conformational states. These states must be to some extent static because they lie along the green FRET line. It is then evident that none of the ligands trap a single state of the LBD, but rather ligand binding redistributes the population of the conformational states consistent with the mechanism of conformational selection. To quantitatively analyze the conformational space and dynamic effects induced by ligand binding, we used probability distribution analysis (PDA) (20Kalinin S. Felekyan S. Antonik M. Seidel C.A.M. et al.Probability distribution analysis of single-molecule fluorescence anisotropy and resonance energy transfer.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 10253-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Kalinin S. Valeri A. Antonik M. Felekyan S. Seidel C.A.M. et al.Detection of structural dynamics by FRET: a photon distribution and fluorescence lifetime analysis of systems with multiple states.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 7983-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We use various models to fit the one-dimensional fluorescence ratio histograms with multiple time window (Δt = 0.5, 2, and 5 ms). In addition, we use PDA to identify the mean FRET efficiency distance (〈RD(A)〉E) between donor and acceptor for each limiting state. For each conformational state, we use Gaussian distributions that represent the interdye donor-acceptor distance distributions. In PDA analysis, the width (hwDA) of each distribution is given by acceptor photophysics (22Kalinin S. Sisamakis E. Magennis S.W. Felekyan S. Seidel C.A.M. et al.On the origin of broadening of single-molecule FRET efficiency distributions beyond shot noise limits.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify the model that best represents the experimental data, we carry a systematic approach of identifying the minimum number of shot-noise limited states (no Gaussian distribution of states). We reached a reasonable convergence with three different FRET states based on visual inspection of the weighted residuals (w. res) and the figure of merit χ2. To improve the fit, we added the contribution of the donor-only population due to acceptor bleaching. Although we have burst selection with 1:1 donor-to-acceptor stoichiometry, the presence of Donor only population indicates that a significant fraction of the acceptor is photobleached within the duration of the time window. To identify and remove this artifact further, we use the ratio of the prompt signal corresponding to the TCSPC channels of donor excitation (Sprompt) and total uncorrected signal of donor and acceptor emission over all TCSPC channels (STotal) (donor and acceptor excitation in PIE experiments) (Fig. 3A). It is worth mentioning that the stoichiometry parameter is corrected for quantum yield and detection efficiencies; however, the raw detected signal (S) does not require additional corrections. Therefore, this selection serves as an additional identification of events that smear toward the donor only population due to photobleaching. We ruled out the possibility of a very low FRET state due to very long interdye distances because after the Sprompt/STotal (Fig. 3A) selection there were no left over burst with high enough FD/FA ratio and 1:1 stoichiometry. After identifying the minimum number of FRET-related conformations, we increased the level of complexity in the fitting model. For example, we know that intensity-based FRET parameters are determined by fluctuations on the integrated acquisition time. PDA is particularly susceptible for capturing the blinking behavior of dyes, which produces additional broadening of the distribution beyond the shot noise limit. This behavior has been well characterized (22Kalinin S. Sisamakis E. Magennis S.W. Felekyan S. Seidel C.A.M. et al.On the origin of broadening of single-molecule FRET efficiency distributions beyond shot noise limits.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is known that broadening is caused mostly due to acceptor blinking and it follows a monotonic relationship with respect to the interdye separation distance (22Kalinin S. Sisamakis E. Magennis S.W. Felekyan S. Seidel C.A.M. et al.On the origin of broadening of single-molecule FRET efficiency distributions beyond shot noise limits.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, each FRET-related conformational state will have its own distribution of distances with a particular width (hwDA) and mean interdye distance 〈RDA〉E. Note that Rmp and 〈RDA〉E represent different distances (see accessible volume under “Materials and Methods”). Benchmark studies (23Sindbert S. Kalinin S. Nguyen H. Kienzler A. Clima L. Bannwarth W. Appel B. Müller S. Seidel C.A.M. et al.Accurate distance determination of nucleic acids via Forster resonance energy transfer: implications of dye linker length and rigidity.J. Am. Chem.

Methods. 2012; 9: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) have shown that 6% of the interdye distance 〈RDA〉E is a typical effective width per state. Thus, we fixed the distribution width to 6% of each 〈RDA〉E. Broadening beyond this limit would be considered to emerge from dynamic processes. To exemplify this representation, we show in Fig. 3B the experimental and PDA modeled FD/FA histogram distributions at Δt = 0.5 ms for the LBD in presence of glycine. Here, we identify three limiting states depicted as Gaussian distributions, each with different color (high FRET orange, medium FRET Navy, and low FRET wine). The mean FD/FA value of each distribution is shown as a vertical line with the same color code. Each line correlates to the experimentally determined interdye distance per state or 〈RDA〉E. In addition to three limiting states, one dynamic transition, also shown as Gaussian (dark yellow), is added to statistically improve the fitting quality. For example, in this case χ2 decreases from 4.7 to 1.15, when dynamics is included at Δt = 5 ms. Weighted residuals (w. res.) are shown on top layer for visual representation of the goodness of the fit. In a simplified representation it is possible to only show the model distribution as compared with the experimental histogram and the vertical lines for representing the mean FD/FA value per state. Hereafter, this simplified representation will be used. To study if there were any dynamic processes involved in the submillisecond to millisecond time scale between states, the experimental FD/FA distributions were globally fit using three time windows (Δt = 0.5, 2, and 5 ms). If all states were static within the time window, the static model would roughly fit all time windows equally well and the probability distribution would not change. This was the case for the LBD bound to DCKA and ACBC, suggesting that the states were static within the selected time windows (Fig. 4 for DCKA and ACBC). The figure of merit χ2 and the modeled FD/FA distribution are shown in red when the states are treated as static and it is shown in green when the model includes a dynamic transition. If during the selected time window, a molecule switches multiple times between states, the fluorescence bursts of the interconverting molecules will show different degrees of mixing between states; thus changing the probability distribution. This is only true if the dynamic interconversion occurs at time scales that are smaller or comparable to the selected time window. The need for a dynamic state was noticeable for the glycine, d-serine, and l-alanine bound states (Fig. 4), whereas for DCKA and ACBC χ2 increases by the addition of the dynamic states. The larger differences comparing multiple time windows in the distribution for l-alanine are indicative of slower kinetics in the millisecond to submillisecond time scales. It is obvious in this case that there is a split of states with an increase in population of the higher FRET states. Faster kinetics equilibrates the distribution at shorter time windows as seen in the case of glycine because there is no split of states. However, there is evidence of population redistribution toward higher FRET efficiencies or lower FD/FA ratios. Therefore, the static model used of three FRET states is no longer valid. To include the dynamic component we tested the addition of a single two-state transition between any FRET states. Remember that the mean FD/FA value of each state is shown as a vertical line with the same color code and the relationship to distance can be readily determined (TABLE 2, TABLE 3).TABLE 2RDA〉E determined by PDA analysisSampleHFMFLFÅAll33.945.855.8 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3FD/FA ratio for each given mean FRET distanceSampleHFMFLFGly0.140.862.8d-Ser0.150.92.9l-Ala0.161.03.1ACBC0.161.03.2DCKA0.161. 03.2FD/FA = ΦFD(0)/ΦA × (RDA/R0)6 (R0 = 52 Å) Open table in a new tab We observed that the single two-state kinetic state (HF ⇌ MF) was needed to significantly improve our figure of merit (χ2) across time windows for the LBD bound to the full agonists and to the partial agonist l-alanine.

These distances were determined with the assumption that κ2 = 2/3. To validate this assumption, the κ2 distribution and the mean values for these conditions were determined using the wobble in a cone model (Fig. 5) .

https://openalex.org/W2396132292,"Nearly all members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family share a cytoplasmic domain structure that serves as an unusual AP-1 clathrin adaptor-dependent Golgi export signal in one Kir channel, Kir2.1 (KCNJ2), raising the question whether Kir channels share a common Golgi export mechanism. Here we explore this idea, focusing on two structurally and functionally divergent Kir family members, Kir2.3 (KCNJ4) and Kir4.1/5.1 (KCNJ10/16), which have ∼50% amino identity. We found that Golgi export of both channels is blocked upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of the AP-1 γ subunit, as predicted for the common AP-1-dependent trafficking process. A comprehensive mutagenic analysis, guided by homology mapping in atomic resolution models of Kir2.1, Kir2.3, and Kir4.1/5.1, identified a common structure that serves as a recognition site for AP-1 binding and governs Golgi export. Larger than realized from previous studies with Kir2.1, the signal is created by a patch of residues distributed at the confluence of cytoplasmic N and C termini. The signal involves a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the C-terminal region that form a hydrophobic cleft, an adjacent cluster of basic residues within the N terminus, and a potential network of salt bridges that join the N- and C-terminal poles together. Because patch formation and AP-1 binding are dependent on proper folding of the cytoplasmic domains, the signal provides a common quality control mechanism at the Golgi for Kir channels. These findings identify a new proteostatic mechanism that couples protein folding of channels to forward trafficking in the secretory pathway. Nearly all members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family share a cytoplasmic domain structure that serves as an unusual AP-1 clathrin adaptor-dependent Golgi export signal in one Kir channel, Kir2.1 (KCNJ2), raising the question whether Kir channels share a common Golgi export mechanism. Here we explore this idea, focusing on two structurally and functionally divergent Kir family members, Kir2.3 (KCNJ4) and Kir4.1/5.1 (KCNJ10/16), which have ∼50% amino identity. We found that Golgi export of both channels is blocked upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of the AP-1 γ subunit, as predicted for the common AP-1-dependent trafficking process.

The extent to which genome-wide chromatin reorganization also contributes to the resultant changes in gene expression remains unknown. We examined the roles of two chromatin structural proteins, Ctcf (CCCTC-binding factor) and Hmgb2 (high mobility group protein B2), in regulating pathologic transcription and chromatin remodeling. Our data demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between Hmgb2 and Ctcf in controlling aspects of chromatin structure and gene expression. Both proteins regulate each others' expression as well as transcription in cardiac myocytes; however, only Hmgb2 does so in a manner that involves global reprogramming of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate that the actions of Hmgb2 on local chromatin accessibility are conserved across genomic loci, whereas the effects on transcription are loci-dependent and emerge in concert with histone modification and other chromatin features. Finally, although both proteins share gene targets, Hmgb2 and Ctcf, neither binds these genes simultaneously nor do they physically colocalize in myocyte nuclei. Our study uncovers a previously unknown relationship between these two ubiquitous chromatin proteins and provides a mechanistic explanation for how Hmgb2 regulates gene expression and cellular phenotype. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence for structural remodeling of chromatin on a genome-wide scale in the setting of cardiac disease.

Furthermore, we provide direct evidence for structural remodeling of chromatin on a genome-wide scale in the setting of cardiac disease. The genome is organized hierarchically with the functional unit being the nucleosome, a heteromultimeric complex of two copies each of four core histones around which ∼147 base pairs of DNA wrap (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). The histone tails can be modified according to many combinations, resulting in recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes that in turn determine the spacing of nucleosomes along the genome (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6582) Google Scholar). Additional structural regulation of transcription is conferred by DNA methylation and nucleosome packaging (3Filion G.J. van Bemmel J.G. Braunschweig U. Talhout W. Kind J. Ward L.D.

Chromatin structural proteins in turn regulate these multiple tiers of genomic structure to influence cell type-specific transcription, although the mechanisms for this phenomenon are poorly understood. Transcriptome remodeling during pathologic stress to the heart has been well documented, as has the role of histone-modifying proteins in this process (6Rosa-Garrido M. Karbassi E. Monte E.

However, chromatin structure remodeling in disease requires coordination with other chromatin features, including DNA methylation (9Movassagh M. Choy M.K. Goddard M. Bennett M.R. Down T.A. Foo R.S.

How chromatin structure is reorganized in a genome-wide manner to carry out disease-associated gene expression remains poorly understood. In cardiac development, the patterning of histone modifications changes as the cell commits to a lineage, molding the transcriptome for the appropriate phenotype (11Wamstad J.A. Alexander J.M.

Similar observations have been made in disease; in a transverse aortic constriction model of heart failure in mice, alterations to cis-acting histone post-translational modifications coordinate expression changes of 325 genes (13Papait R.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 20164-20169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, chromatin regulation in the setting of cardiac disease involves features more complex than the effects of a local histone modification on gene expression, notably, higher order chromatin structure, which remains unexplored in the heart. Different cell types ought to have different chromatin structure underpinning their different transcriptomes, although most of the knowledge on endogenous chromatin structure (4Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

Similarly, decreased H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me2 in the heart were observed in a mouse model of diabetes with glomerulosclerosis, a condition that can lead to heart disease in humans and induces hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes in mice (22Gaikwad A.B.

CCCTC-binding factor (Ctcf) is an 11 zinc finger protein that organizes higher order chromatin structure by one or more of the following actions: insulating genes from their enhancers (25Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. The protein CTCF is required for the enhancer blocking activity of vertebrate insulators.Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar); orchestrating DNA looping to bring together genes and their regulatory elements (26Handoko L. Xu H. Li G. Ngan C.Y. Chew E. Schnapp M. Lee C.W. Ye C. Ping J.L. Mulawadi F. Wong E. Sheng J. Zhang Y. Poh T. Chan C.S. et al.CTCF-mediated functional chromatin interactome in pluripotent cells.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 630-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar); and/or localizing to the boundaries between heterochromatin (compact and silenced DNA) and euchromatin (loosely packed and accessible DNA) to prevent heterochromatin spreading (27Cuddapah S.

Global analysis of the insulator binding protein CTCF in chromatin barrier regions reveals demarcation of active and repressive domains.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Despite the well established role for Ctcf in genome organization, virtually nothing is known about its role in the normal or diseased cardiomyocyte. High mobility group protein B2 (Hmgb2) is a non-nucleosomal chromatin structural protein, which, by binding to and bending DNA, can alter gene expression (28Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. HMGB proteins and gene expression.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We previously found that Hmgb2 abundance is altered in heart disease (21Franklin S. Chen H. Mitchell-Jordan S. Ren S. Wang Y. Vondriska T.M. Quantitative analysis of the chromatin proteome in disease reveals remodeling principles and identifies high mobility group protein B2 as a regulator of hypertrophic growth.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 (M111.014258)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and in this study we sought to test the molecular mechanisms for its actions at the level of both the chromatin fiber and the entire genome. Herein, we uncover a previously unknown relationship between Hmgb2 and Ctcf, and we use this relationship to explore the role of chromatin architectural proteins in regulating cardiac gene expression in disease. To uncover the contribution of Ctcf and Hmgb2 to the cardiac phenotype, we analyzed microarray data (29Rau C.D. Wang J. Avetisyan R. Romay M.C. Martin L. Ren S. Wang Y. Lusis A.J. Mapping genetic contributions to cardiac pathology induced by β-adrenergic stimulation in mice.Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet. 2015; 8: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) from the hearts of 84 classical inbred and recombinant strains of mice in the basal state and mice that were treated for 3 weeks with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist that increases the inotropy of the heart and is used to model hypertrophy and failure in animal models (30Yeager J.C. Iams S.G. Isoproterenol-induced cardiac failure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1981; 168: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the basal condition, hmgb2 and ctcf mRNA levels are inversely correlated with each other, and this relationship is weakened, but still significant, after isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 1A). This correlation is striking given that 66 of the 84 strains down-regulated Ctcf, whereas the response of Hmgb2 is genotype-dependent (a finding validated in NRVMs, in which Ctcf was down-regulated at the protein level in response to isoproterenol, phenylephrine, or endothelin-1 (data not shown), and the response of Hmgb2 is agonist-dependent (21Franklin S. Chen H. Mitchell-Jordan S. Ren S. Wang Y. Vondriska T.M. Quantitative analysis of the chromatin proteome in disease reveals remodeling principles and identifies high mobility group protein B2 as a regulator of hypertrophic growth.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 (M111.014258)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). hmgb2 mRNA abundance correlated with that of neither hmgb1 nor hmgb3 in the basal setting or after isoproterenol (Fig. 1A). Strains that respond to isoproterenol by going into heart failure exhibit a significantly direct correlation between the ratio of Ctcf to Hmgb2 and heart size, whereas the mice that are resistant or develop hypertrophy show the opposite trend (Fig. 1B). In support of these observations having functional significance in the heart, microarray data from the same panel of mice taken from other tissues (73 strains analyzed for liver (31Ghazalpour A. Bennett B.J. Shih D. Che N. Orozco L. Pan C. Hagopian R. He A. Kayne P. Yang W.P. Kirchgessner T. Lusis A.J. Genetic regulation of mouse liver metabolite levels.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 730Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and 98 strains analyzed for macrophages (32Farber C.R. Bennett B.J. Orozco L. Zou W. Lira A. Kostem E. Kang H.M. Furlotte N.

Mouse genome-wide association and systems genetics identify Asxl2 as a regulator of bone mineral density and osteoclastogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002038Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) showed that the relationship between hmgb2 and ctcf levels is organ-dependent (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemistry to label for Hmgb2 and Ctcf in mouse cardiac tissue sections confirmed that both proteins are expressed in the nuclei of adult myocytes (Fig. 1D). We next sought to functionally validate the inverse regulation between Hmgb2 and Ctcf. We used adenoviruses to overexpress or siRNAs to knock down hmgb2 and ctcf in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) (Fig. 2). Increased Hmgb2 expression resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in Ctcf at the protein and mRNA level, whereas hmgb2 knockdown caused up-regulation of ctcf at the mRNA level with no change in protein by 72 h (Fig. 2, A and B). hmgb2 knockdown did not affect levels of histone H1, another chromatin structural protein (Fig. 2B). Likewise, ctcf knockdown up-regulated and ctcf overexpression down-regulated Hmgb2 (Fig. 2C). By microscopy, we observed an increase in the overall abundance of Hmgb2 in nuclei depleted of Ctcf (Fig. 2D). Finally, in cardiac-specific ctcf knock-out mice, we observe a doubling (204.9%) in hmgb2 abundance by RNA-seq from isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Together, these findings extend our observation of an endogenous inverse relationship between Ctcf and Hmgb2 levels in the mouse heart by demonstrating that this relationship is dynamic and responsive to experimental perturbation. We next examined available Ctcf chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from human CD4+ cells (gene expression omnibus accession GSM325895), adult mouse heart (UCSC accession wgEncodeEM001684), mouse embryonic stem cells (gene expression omnibus accession GSM69916), and rat liver (33Schmidt D. Schwalie P.C. Wilson M.D. Ballester B. Gonçalves A. Kutter C. Brown G.D. Marshall A. Flicek P. Odom D.T. Waves of retrotransposon expansion remodel genome organization and CTCF binding in multiple mammalian lineages.Cell. 2012; 148: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We performed our own ChIP-seq for Hmgb2 in NRVMs and used liftOver to compare Hmgb2 binding to Ctcf peaks from the other four samples. In all four comparisons, Hmgb2 reads were strongly enriched around Ctcf binding peaks as compared with a randomized set of reads of similar length and number (Fig. 3A). We also compared Ctcf ChIP-seq data in the heart to Hmgb2 binding peaks separated by whether they fell in genes, promoters, or intergenic regions, and we found the greatest enrichment in intergenic regions using basal Hmgb2 ChIP-seq and promoter regions using Hmgb1 ChIP-seq from hypertrophic (phenylephrine-treated) NRVMs (Fig. 3B). For comparison, we mapped Hmgb2 enrichment around peaks for Nkx2.5, a cardiac transcription factor, in HL1 cells ((34He A. Kong S.W. Ma Q. Pu W.T. Co-occupancy by multiple cardiac transcription factors identifies transcriptional enhancers active in heart.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5632-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) an atrial myocyte cell line) and did not see enrichment (Fig. 3A). Together, these suggest that Hmgb2 and Ctcf bind the same regions of the genome and that a portion of Hmgb2 peaks may be cell type-independent. We validated the Hmgb2 ChIP-seq by selecting 20 peaks that were within 2 kb upstream of the TSS and performing ChIP-PCR in NRVMs. In our analysis, 19 of the 20 peaks showed enriched pulldown over an IgG control. ChIP-PCR for Ctcf showed Ctcf binding five of the 19 promoter regions (Fig. 3C). These five promoters also showed Ctcf binding in the adult mouse heart (UCSC accession wgEncodeEM001684). We then examined whether Hmgb2 and Ctcf co-occupied these promoters in cardiac cells using ChIP-reChIP (Fig. 3C). We immunoprecipitated Ctcf with one antibody, eluted the protein and DNA complex from the beads, and then reimmunoprecipitated for Ctcf using a different antibody. There was some loss of DNA in this process, but in all cases the ChIP-reChIP successfully pulled down the five promoter sequences, serving as a positive control for the assay. We then immunoprecipitated Hmgb2 with one antibody, followed by immunoprecipitation with a second Hmgb2 antibody. In this case, the loss in sample was greater, due to the poor utility of the second Hmgb2 antibody for immunoprecipitation. Despite these limitations, we still achieved enrichment of one of the five Hmgb2 targets. Finally, we immunoprecipitated for Hmgb2 followed by immunoprecipitation for Ctcf (and vice versa, with the first immunoprecipitation for Ctcf followed by immunoprecipitation for Hmgb2). In these experiments, the better performing Hmgb2 antibody was used. However, unlike the control experiments using different Ctcf antibodies against the same protein, here we saw loss of enrichment when immunoprecipitating for both Ctcf and Hmgb2 on the same sample. Together, these experiments indicate that both Ctcf and Hmgb2 bind these five regions, but not at the same time, hence the ability of Ctcf and Hmgb2 to pull down non-overlapping pools of these DNA fragments. Super-resolution imaging of immunolabeled Hmgb2 and Ctcf in NRVM nuclei confirmed the lack of colocalization of Hmgb2 and Ctcf in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3D); only ∼9% of the Hmgb2 or Ctcf puncta were within 50 nm of each other (we define colocalization as within 50 nm based on the resolution of the microscope, Fig. 3E). HMGB2 and CTCF also did not colocalize in 293T cells (data not shown). By contrast, the ChIP-seq data predicts 20–24% overlap of these two proteins (∼41,000 total Hmgb2 peaks, ∼33,000 total cardiac Ctcf peaks, and ∼8000 overlapping Hmgb2 and Ctcf peaks indicates ∼20% of Hmgb2 peaks and ∼24% of Ctcf peaks should overlap). To characterize the phenotypic implications of disrupting the balance of Hmgb2 or Ctcf in myocytes, we analyzed the global effect of Hmgb2 and Ctcf on cardiac gene expression. Previous studies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts have shown that loss of Ctcf increases the nucleolar area; however, in that cell type, the nucleoli number decreased (35van de Nobelen S.

CTCF regulates the local epigenetic state of ribosomal DNA repeats.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2010; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ctcf depletion in ES cells causes a modest decrease in ribosomal RNA transcripts (35van de Nobelen S. Rosa-Garrido M. Leers J. Heath H. Soochit W. Joosen L. Jonkers I. Demmers J. van der Reijden M. Torrano V. Grosveld F. Delgado M.D. Renkawitz R. Galjart N. Sleutels F. CTCF regulates the local epigenetic state of ribosomal DNA repeats.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2010; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In mammals, the ribosome is made up of ∼85 proteins (30–50 for 40S subunit and 40–50 for 60S subunit) and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs: 18S, 5S, 5.8S, and 25S) (36Nazar R.N. Ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes.IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The sequences of DNA encoding these rRNAs colocalize within the nucleus, forming so-called “nucleolar organizing regions” surrounding the nucleolus (37Farley K.I. Surovtseva Y. Merkel J. Baserga S.J.

In the rat, the 45S rDNA gene (the precursor for 18S, 5.8S, and 28S) is clustered in repeats on chromosomes 3, 11, and 12, with ∼35 copies per chromosome (NCBI and RefSeq 2012). Like mRNA, rRNA expression is regulated by histone post-translational modifications and DNA methylation (39Bártová E. Horáková A.H. Uhlírová R. Raska I. Galiová G. Orlova D. Kozubek S.

We overexpressed Gfp alone or Hmgb2 or Ctcf tagged with GFP in 293T cells, incubated them in 5′-fluorouridine for 30 min and then stopped the reaction, fixed the cells, and used immunocytochemistry to detect the localization and intensity of 5′-fluorouridine labeling. We found no overt change to 5′-fluorouridine signal in either the ctcf or Gfp-only overexpressing cells. Similarly, ctcf knockdown in NRVMs had only a modest effect (11% decrease in 5′-fluorouridine intensity, p < 0.001, n = 264 control, n = 287 ctcf knockdown). By contrast, we found a stark absence of transcription in the nucleoli of hmgb2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A, open arrowheads). Cells in the same plate that did not actively express the hmgb2 plasmid, and which therefore were not green, also did not show transcriptional inhibition (Fig. 4A, solid arrowheads). We quantified the top 250 cells with the most Gfp expression. There was >50% reduction in the mean 5′-fluorouridine intensity of hmgb2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B) and an inverse relationship between 5′-fluorouridine intensity and Gfp intensity in the overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B). Both of these observations were also true when analyzing all (n = 329) hmgb2-overexpressing cells, rather than focusing only on the cells with the greatest overexpression (reduction in median level of 5′FU by 49% and a significant correlation between GFP and 5′FU in overexpressing cells, p value <0.001).

Here, we characterized novel splice variants of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Cav1.4 Ca2+ channels that regulate neurotransmitter release in photoreceptors in the retina. These variants lack a portion of exon 45 and/or the entire exon 47 (Cav1.4Δex p45, Cav1.4Δex 47, Cav1.4Δex p45,47) and are expressed in the retina of primates but not mice. Although the electrophysiological properties of Cav1.4Δex p45 are similar to those of full-length channels (Cav1.4FL), skipping of exon 47 dramatically alters Cav1.4 function. Deletion of exon 47 removes part of a C-terminal automodulatory domain (CTM) previously shown to suppress Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) and to cause a positive shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation. Exon 47 is crucial for these effects of the CTM because variants lacking this exon show intense CDI and activate at more hyperpolarized voltages than Cav1.4FL. The robust CDI of Cav1.4Δex 47 is suppressed by CaBP4, a regulator of Cav1.4 channels in photoreceptors. Although CaBP4 enhances activation of Cav1.4FL, Cav1.4Δex 47 shows similar voltage-dependent activation in the presence and absence of CaBP4.

https://openalex.org/W2396492116,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (Tf) and its cognate receptor (TfR1) is a central pathway supporting the uptake of trophic iron. It has generally been assumed that this is a constitutive process. However, we have reported that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, is activated by Tf to facilitate the internalization of the Tf-TfR1 ligand-receptor complex. As an extension of these findings, we have tested whether subsequent trafficking steps might be regulated by additional kinase-dependent cascades, and we observed a significant endocytic block by inhibiting c-Abl kinase by a variety of methods. Importantly, Tf internalization was reduced significantly in all of these cell models and could be restored by re-expression of WT c-Abl. Surprisingly, this attenuated Tf-TfR1 endocytosis was due to a substantial drop in both the surface and total cellular receptor levels. Additional studies with the LDL receptor showed a similar effect. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy of imatinib-treated cells revealed a marked colocalization of internalized TfR1 with late endosomes/lysosomes, whereas attenuating the lysosome function with several inhibitors reduced this receptor loss. Importantly, inhibition of c-Abl resulted in a striking redistribution of the chaperone Hsc70 from a diffuse cytosolic localization to an association with the TfR1 at the late endosome-lysosome. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsc70 ATPase activity in cultured cells by the drug VER155008 prevents this chaperone-receptor interaction, resulting in an accumulation of the TfR1 in the early endosome. Thus, inhibition of c-Abl minimizes receptor recycling pathways and results in chaperone-dependent trafficking of the TfR1 to the lysosome for degradation. These findings implicate a novel role for c-Abl and Hsc70 as an unexpected regulator of Hsc70-mediated transport of trophic receptor cargo between the early and late endosomal compartments."

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Expression of CD36, a receptor for oxidized LDL (oxLDL) that enhances macrophage/foam cell formation, is activated by the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). CD36 also functions as a fatty acid transporter to influence fatty acid metabolism and the pathophysiological status of several diseases. In this study, we determined that progesterone induced macrophage CD36 expression, which is related to progesterone receptor (PR) activity. Progesterone enhanced cellular oxLDL uptake in a CD36-dependent manner. Mechanistically, progesterone increased PPARγ expression and PPARγ promoter activity in a PR-dependent manner and the binding of PR with the progesterone response element in the PPARγ promoter. Specific deletion of macrophage PPARγ (MφPPARγ KO) expression in mice abolished progesterone-induced macrophage CD36 expression and cellular oxLDL accumulation. We also determined that, associated with gestation and increased serum progesterone levels, CD36 and PPARγ expression in mouse adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and peritoneal macrophages were substantially activated. Taken together, our study demonstrates that progesterone can play dual pathophysiological roles by activating PPARγ expression, in which progesterone increases macrophage CD36 expression and oxLDL accumulation, a negative effect on atherosclerosis, and enhances the PPARγ-CD36 pathway in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, a protective effect on pregnancy."

Population-based genome sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most severe form of malaria, has highlighted two related polymorphic genes called dblmsp and dblmsp2, which encode Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain-containing proteins located on the merozoite surface but whose function remains unknown. Using recombinant proteins and transgenic parasites, we show that DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 directly and avidly bind human IgM via their DBL domains. We used whole genome sequence data from over 400 African and Asian P. falciparum isolates to show that dblmsp and dblmsp2 exhibit extreme protein polymorphism in their DBL domain, with multiple variants of two major allelic classes present in every population tested. Despite this variability, the IgM binding function was retained across diverse sequence representatives. Although this interaction did not seem to have an effect on the ability of the parasite to invade red blood cells, binding of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 to IgM inhibited the overall immunoreactivity of these proteins to IgG from patients who had been exposed to the parasite.

Among the different species of Plasmodium causing malaria in humans, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the highest burden of disease. The clinical symptoms of malaria are associated with the blood stage of the infection, when the merozoite stage of the parasite recognizes, invades, and develops within human erythrocytes (3.Cowman A.F.

Despite these interesting features, the function of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 and their role in the pathology of malaria are unknown. Duffy binding-like erythrocyte-binding antigen merozoite surface protein. Here, we used recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cells and a knock-out parasite line to show that the DBL domains of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 from the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum bind avidly and directly to human IgM. Using population-based genome sequencing and bespoke assembly tools, we revealed widespread genetic diversity focused on the DBL domain, with two major allelic forms of both dblmsp and dblmsp2 observed in populations from Africa and Southeast Asia. Despite their diversity, binding of the DBL domains from different DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 sequence variants to human IgM was conserved, suggesting an important role in the parasite biology. To gain insight into the functional role of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 during malaria pathogenesis, we first expressed the entire coding region of both proteins from the P. falciparum 3D7 strain using a recently developed expression system based on mammalian cells, which has been shown to produce natively folded P. falciparum proteins (20.Crosnier C. Wanaguru M. McDade B. Osier F.H. Marsh K. Rayner J.C. Wright G.J. A library of functional recombinant cell surface and secreted Plasmodium falciparum merozoite proteins.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2013; 12: 3976-3986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both proteins were expressed (Fig. 1A), and their immunoreactivity to sera from malaria-exposed and unexposed control individuals was quantified. To our surprise, whereas other MSP3 family members (MSP3, MSP6, H101, and MSP11) and DBL-containing merozoite surface proteins (EBA140, EBA175, and EBA181) reacted, as expected, with only the exposed sera, DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 showed equally strong immunoreactivity to both the unexposed control and exposed sera (Fig. 1B). This suggested that recombinant DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 bound immunoglobulins present in normal serum from individuals without prior exposure to the malaria parasite. Indeed, when each protein was exposed to purified human immunoglobulin isotypes, strong binding was observed to IgM, but not to IgA, IgE, or IgG (Fig. 1C). This binding was specific to human IgM because they did not bind immunoglobulins from other mammalian species including goat, rabbit, guinea pig, and cow, or purified mouse IgM (Fig. 1D). To confirm these observations, we showed that DBLMSP-coated beads but not control beads incubated in normal human serum purified bands with masses there were consistent with the heavy and light chain of IgM (Fig. 1E), and their identities were subsequently confirmed by mass spectrometry. IgM adopts a flat, planar structure in solution but can change to a “staple” conformation upon antigen binding, thereby permitting interaction with other proteins such as C1q (21.MacKenzie M.R. Creevy N. Heh M. The interaction of human IgM and C1q.J. Immunol. 1971; 106: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether antigen bound to IgM influenced its interaction with DBLMSP and DBLMSP2, we made use of two transfectomas producing chimeric IgMs that recognize dinitrophenyl but differ by either the presence or absence of a murine J-chain. In these chimeric IgMs, the whole κ light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain are of murine origin, whereas the heavy chain Fc constant region is human (22.Collins C. Tsui F.W. Shulman M.J. Differential activation of human and guinea pig complement by pentameric and hexameric IgM.Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 bound IgM from both transfectomas, demonstrating that they interact with the human IgM heavy chain constant region, and this binding was independent of whether they were engaged with antigen or not. Binding of DBLMSP2 to IgMs lacking a J-chain, however, was consistently weaker (Fig. 1F). To identify the region on IgM that bound DBLMSP and DBLMSP2, we used mouse monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific domains of the human μ chain constant region (23.Rudich S.M. Mihaesco E. Winchester R. Mongini P.K. Analysis of the domain specificity of various murine anti-human IgM monoclonal antibodies differing in human B lymphocyte signaling activity.Mol.

Antibody 1G6, whose epitope is located within the Cμ4 domain, inhibited the interaction of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 with human IgM, whereas antibodies IX11 and HB57, with epitopes located in the Cμ1 and Cμ2 domains, respectively, or the Cμ3-specific antibodies 196.6b and 5D7 did not (Fig. 2A). To confirm these observations, we also made use of chimeric recombinant antibodies in which domains of the human μ chain constant region replace domains from the human α or γ chain (25.Braathen R. Sorensen V. Brandtzaeg P. Sandlie I. Johansen F.E. The carboxyl-terminal domains of IgA and IgM direct isotype-specific polymerization and interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor.J.

Structural requirements for incorporation of J chain into human IgM and IgA.Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In all cases, binding of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 proteins was observed only when the Cμ4 domain was present in the chimeric antibodies, and no binding was detected with domain-swapped antibodies containing only the Cμ2 or Cμ3 domains (Fig. 2B). To determine which regions of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 were involved in IgM binding, we individually expressed either the DBL domain or the SPAM fragment. The SPAM fragments did not bind IgM, whereas the isolated DBL domains bound IgM as efficiently as the full-length proteins in this assay, indicating that the DBL domain encompassed all IgM binding activity (Fig. 2C). To determine whether DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 could, like MSP3, form oligomers, we first used size exclusion chromatography on each full-length protein. In both cases, polydisperse peaks were observed, suggesting the formation of higher order oligomers composed exclusively of the proteins of interest (Fig. 3A). We then resolved purified proteins encompassing the DBL domain and SPAM fragment by size exclusion chromatography. Although the DBL domain of DBLMSP2 eluted as a single monodisperse peak consistent with it being a monomer, the SPAM fragment elution profile was polydisperse, with peaks consistent with tetrameric and other higher order complexes and only a minor fraction consistent with a monomeric form (Fig. 3B). A similar analysis of DBLMSP gave comparable results, suggesting that both DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 are able to form higher order oligomers by interactions through their C terminus. To quantify the interaction between IgM and both DBLMSPs and demonstrate that the proteins interacted directly, we used surface plasmon resonance. Binding of soluble, purified human IgM was tested against immobilized full-length DBLMSP or DBLMSP2, mimicking the orientation of the proteins that would be expected in vivo. IgM binding to both parasite proteins was clearly saturable, demonstrating the specificity of the interactions, with equilibrium binding constants (KD) of 0.3 and 1.1 nm for DBLMSP and DBLMSP2, respectively (Fig. 3C). Given the multimeric nature of both IgM and the two parasite proteins studied, these measurements reflect overall binding avidity and are not easily comparable with other monomeric protein interactions. We therefore immobilized human IgM on the chip and used the monomeric DBL domains as analytes. Using this approach, the affinity for human IgM was 200–550-fold weaker, reflecting the loss of avidity but nonetheless still strong, with an equilibrium binding affinity of 60 nm for DBLMSP versus 600 nm for DBLMSP2 (Fig. 3D). The physiological concentration of IgM in human serum is ∼1–2 mg/ml (1–2 μm), which is at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than the measured binding constants and implies that all serum-exposed DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 would be rapidly and irreversibly complexed with IgM. To demonstrate that native DBLMSP could bind human IgM, we generated Δdblmsp P. falciparum merozoites in which the dblmsp gene has been targeted (Fig. 4A) and confirmed this by Southern blotting (Fig. 4B). Using an antibody raised against the SPAM region of DBLMSP, we showed that the Δdblmsp parasites no longer expressed DBLMSP protein (Fig. 4C) and that it was absent from the surface of merozoites (Fig. 4D). We then used immunohistochemistry to test for the presence of human IgM at the surface of 3D7 wild-type or Δdblmsp parasites. In wild-type parasites, DBLMSP is expressed at the surface of merozoites in all schizonts, whereas DBLMSP2 is present in only a very small subset of schizonts (1% or less) (17.Amambua-Ngwa A. Tetteh K.K. Manske M. Gomez-Escobar N. Stewart L.B. Deerhake M.E. Cheeseman I.H. Newbold C.I. Holder A.A. Knuepfer E. Janha O. Jallow M. Campino S. Macinnis B. Kwiatkowski D.P. Conway D.J. Population genomic scan for candidate signatures of balancing selection to guide antigen characterization in malaria parasites.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002992Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Following culture in the presence of purified human IgM or with human serum, IgM could be detected readily at the surface of wild-type but not dblmsp-deficient merozoites (Fig. 5A). These observations were further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy of purified wild-type and knock-out merozoites incubated in the presence of purified human IgM, which showed regular punctate labeling at the surface of wild-type but not Δdblmsp merozoites (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that native DBLMSP binds IgM and is the sole IgM-binding protein at the surface of most merozoites. Δdblmsp knock-out mutants grown in the presence of medium containing a serum alternative that does not contain human IgM did not show any invasion phenotype when compared with the wild type. To determine whether the presence of human IgM on the merozoite surface had any effect on the ability of the wild-type parasite to invade red blood cells, we also performed invasion assays with parasites grown in either serum alternative alone or serum alternative supplemented with 1 mg/ml human IgM. No difference in invasion efficiency was observed, suggesting that the presence of human IgM on the merozoite surface does not affect erythrocyte invasion in vitro (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Human IgM bind native DBLMSP protein.

To further characterize the genetic diversity in these two genes, we looked at the sequence variability among field isolates from Africa and Southeast Asia. Characterizing and quantifying genetic architecture in field isolates using population-based genomic sequencing are challenging both because of their high degree of polymorphism and the appreciable levels of mixed infections. To circumvent these issues, we applied the Cortex de novo variation assembler (27.Iqbal Z. Caccamo M. Turner I. Flicek P. McVean G. De novo assembly and genotyping of variants using colored de Bruijn graphs.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28.Iqbal Z. Turner I. McVean G.

This method is agnostic to different types of genetic variation including indels and structural variants and is highly specific. Using this method, we generated biallelic variant calls across the P. falciparum genome using short-read Illumina sequence data from 434 field isolates from the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, and Cambodia (minimum 50× coverage; mean read length, 74 bp) as reported elsewhere (17.Amambua-Ngwa A.

Genome-wide analysis of selection on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in West African populations of differing infection endemicity.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Comparing genome sequences across P. falciparum isolates revealed striking regions of high sequence diversity, for example on chromosome 10 (Fig. 6A), and in particular around the MSP3 gene family. Using this approach, the highest peak was observed at msp3 whose two diverged haplotypes, within which recombination is reduced, have been very well studied in the literature and whose divergence precedes the P. reichenowi/P. falciparum split (31.Okenu D.M. Thomas A.W. Conway D.J. Allelic lineages of the merozoite surface protein 3 gene in Plasmodium reichenowi and Plasmodium falciparum.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, we also observed extremely high peaks at dblmsp and dblmsp2. After close examination of the variant calls within dblmsp and dblmsp2, we found a large number of overlapping variants. Because Cortex only calls biallelic variants, samples with multiple infections, which contain more than two alleles at a single site, will return no value. Because few sites were multiallelic in all samples, we took the union of all sites in the 434 samples and removed redundancy; this union contained the vast majority of polymorphic sites. The overlapping alleles in dblmsp and dblmsp2 were long (up to ∼1 kb) and shared sequence. As a result of this, together with the unknown multiplicity of infection and lack of phasing information with the short Illumina reads, we took a conservative approach and did not attempt to genotype the implied long multiallelic variants. Applying these approaches, we established that dblmsp and dblmsp2 each contained one major cluster of long non-recombining haplotypes (15 haplotypes in dblmsp and 41 in dblmsp2), with differing lengths (∼570 bp in dblmsp and 1350 bp in dblmsp2) and all overlapping the region encoding the DBL domain. In dblmsp, these 15 haplotypes grouped into two major allelic forms that we termed class 1 (3 haplotypes) and 2 (12 haplotypes) (Fig. 6, B and C). In dblmsp2, we found two major allelic forms, class 1 (6 haplotypes) and class 2 (35 haplotypes), which we subdivided into two subclasses (c2.1 and c2.2) on the basis of multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 6, B and D). To quantify the divergence between haplotypes, we designated d(c1,c2) as the mean number of SNP and indel differences between classes c1 and c2. For dblmsp, d(c1,c1) = 1.77 and d(c2,c2) = 22.5, whereas d(c1,c2) = 185. Similarly for dblmsp2, d(c1,c1) = 2.9, d(c2.1,c2.1) = 34.2, d(c2.2,c2.2) = 7.0, and d(c2.1, c2.2) = 61, whereas d(c1, c2.1) = 239 and d(c1,c2.2) = 194, demonstrating that for both genes, the two main allelic classes were deeply diverged. To get an estimate of population frequencies, we used the alignments to find sequence markers characteristic of the main classes and then queried the de Bruijn graph for all 434 samples to see which samples showed evidence of class 1 and/or class 2 haplotypes. Using this approach, we were able to find evidence for a haplotype from either dimorphic form even in samples where no call had been made. Our findings confirmed that both dimorphic forms co-existed at high frequencies in each gene and all four countries (Fig. 6E). Haplotype classes in all 434 samples were clearly identified in the region encoding th"

Although mutations in either the first or second PHD finger allow for Rpd3S complex formation, the assembled complexes from these mutants cannot recognize nucleosomes or function to maintain chromatin structure and prevent cryptic transcriptional initiation from within transcribed regions. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role of combinatorial readout in maintaining chromatin organization and in enforcing the transcriptional fidelity of genes."

Signaling analysis showed that leptin stimulation led to a rapid and strong STAT3 activation followed by a second-phase moderate STAT3 activation, which was selectively abolished by anti-inflammatory chemical PS1145 or TNFα antagonist WP9QY. Physiological study in normal mice revealed that diurnal rise of blood pressure was abrogated following central administration of PS1145 or a leptin receptor antagonist. Central TNFα pretreatment was found to potentiate the effect of leptin in elevating blood pressure in normal mice. In pathophysiology, dietary obesity mimicked TNFα pretreatment in promoting leptin-induced blood pressure rise, and this effect was blocked by central treatment with either PS1145 or WP9QY.

Jarjoura D. Tridandapani S. Butchar J.P. Toll-like receptor 2 ligands regulate monocyte Fcγ receptor expression and function.J. Biol.

SRBCs (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) were fluorescently labeled using PKH26 dye (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and then opsonized with anti-SRBC antibody (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. SRBCs were mixed with NLCs, and then cells were gently pelleted by slow centrifugation and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Non-ingested SRBCs were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Ingested RBCs were counted using fluorescence immersion oil microscopy. The phagocytic index was calculated as the total number of SRBCs ingested by 50 NLCs. Nurse-like cells were pretreated with 10 ng/ml IFNγ or PBS control for 72 h. Cells were counted and left overnight for adherence in quadruplicate in 96-well tissue culture plates (5 × 104/100 μl of medium). CLL cells were added at (5 × 105/100 μl) and incubated for 24 h. Non-adherent CLL B cells (100 μ ∼ 5 × 105) were harvested and stained with Annexin V FITC/propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) using the protocol of the manufacturer. Data are represented as the percentage of total live CLL cells (Annexin V FITC− propidium iodide−). CLL cells were enriched as described previously, incubated with 10 μg/ml rituximab on ice for 2 h, washed with PBS, and then labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (5.0 μg/ml, Life Technologies) for 10 min at room temperature. Simultaneously, NLCs were harvested, washed, and incubated with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (5.0 μg/ml, Life Technologies) for 10 min at room temperature. Following washes, co-incubations of NLCs with CLL cells for 60 min at a ratio of 1:5 (NLC:CLL) were done. Cells were then washed and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed onto microscope slides with ProLong® Gold mounting solution (Thermo Scientific) and then examined using confocal microscopy. For NLC gene expression studies, paired two-tailed Student's t tests were used to compare untreated relative copy numbers to IFNγ-treated relative copy numbers. For the phagocytosis results, paired two-tailed Student's t tests were used to compare the mean phagocytic index control versus IFNγ-treated cells. For the inhibitor experiments, mixed-effect modeling was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). Significance was counted as p ]ltequ] 0.05. CLL-patient NLCs were derived as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their characteristics were confirmed via flow cytometry (Figs. 1, A–D). Gating based on forward and side scatter was done in accordance with previous work (1.Ysebaert L. Fournié J.J.

The results showed that the cells were CD68+ and CD14dim (Fig. 1B), with some CD68+ cells also showing expression of CD200R (Fig. 1C). All cells were CD80− (Fig. 1D). NLCs have been described as counterparts to tumor-associated macrophages seen within solid tumors (1.Ysebaert L. Fournié J.J.

This led to the question of whether they could be reprogrammed away from their tumor-supportive phenotype. Because of their similarities with solid-tumor macrophages, the possibility existed that treatment with cytokines such as IFNγ (9.Duluc D. Corvaisier M. Blanchard S. Catala L. Descamps P. Gamelin E. Ponsoda S. Delneste Y. Hebbar M. Jeannin P. Interferon-γ reverses the immunosuppressive and protumoral properties and prevents the generation of human tumor-associated macrophages.Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) might be effective. To test this, we treated NLCs for 72 h with IFNγ and measured levels of the M1-related markers (17.Mosser D.M. The many faces of macrophage activation.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 73: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) NOS2 (nitric-oxide synthase 2), HLA-DR, and CD86. Results showed that IFNγ led to variable effects with NOS2, increasing for some donors and decreasing for others (data not shown). Transcripts for the T cell coactivator CD86 were significantly elevated (Fig. 2A), with a corresponding increase in surface expression (Fig. 2, B and C). Likewise, HLA-DR was significantly elevated at the transcriptional (Fig. 2D) as well as cell surface levels (Fig. 2, E and F) by IFNγ. We also examined FcγRI, which is the high-affinity IgG receptor and thus can play a role in antibody-mediated responses (18.Graziano R.F. Fanger M.W. Fc γ RI and Fc γ RII on monocytes and granulocytes are cytotoxic trigger molecules for tumor cells.J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3536-3541PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor has been shown to respond to IFNγ in healthy donor monocytes and macrophages (19.Guyre P.M. Morganelli P.M. Miller R. Recombinant immune interferon increases immunoglobulin G Fc receptors on cultured human mononuclear phagocytes.J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20.Perussia B. Dayton E.T. Lazarus R. Fanning V. Trinchieri G. Immune interferon induces the receptor for monomeric IgG1 on human monocytic and myeloid cells.J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1092-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) as well as in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells (21.Notter M. Ludwig W.D. Bremer S. Thiel E. Selective targeting of human lymphokine-activated killer cells by CD3 monoclonal antibody against the interferon-inducible high-affinity Fc γ RI receptor (CD64) on autologous acute myeloid leukemic blast cells.Blood. 1993; 82: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results showed that treatment of NLCs with IFNγ significantly increased FcγRI transcript (Fig. 2G) and protein (Fig. 2, H and I). However, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, and γ chain levels were unaffected (data not shown). We also tested the effect of IFNγ on SDF-1 levels because this is a major protumoral factor produced by NLCs (3.Burger J.A. Tsukada N. Burger M. Zvaifler N.J. Dell'Aquila M. Kipps T.J. Blood-derived nurse-like cells protect chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells from spontaneous apoptosis through stromal cell-derived factor-1.Blood. 2000; 96: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no effect of IFNγ on SDF-1 transcript was seen (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that IFNγ does not effect a complete shift toward an M1 phenotype in NLCs but that it does up-regulate molecules involved with effector functions. Because IFNγ increased expression of the high-affinity IgG receptor FcγRI, we tested the effects of IFNγ on phagocytosis. We treated NLCs with IFNγ for 72 h and then measured their ability to ingest fluorescently labeled, opsonized SRBCs. The results showed that IFNγ-treated NLCs ingested significantly more SRBCs than untreated NLCs (p = 0.034, Fig. 3A, plotted in B). Next, we tested whether IFNγ-treated NLCs would be capable of phagocytosing antibody-coated CLL cells. We treated NLCs with IFNγ for 72 h as above, membrane-labeled them with fluorescent dye, and then incubated them for 1 h with membrane-labeled CLL cells that were opsonized with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, which is commonly used for the treatment of CLL. We examined phagocytosis via confocal microscopy between untreated (Fig. 3C) and IFNγ-treated (Fig. 3D) NLCs and found that IFNγ significantly increased the number of ingested CLL cells (Fig. 3E). CD38/CD31 interactions in cooperation with CD100 promote survival of CLL cells, and it has been shown that blocking antibodies against CD31 can disrupt CLL cell survival (22.Deaglio S. Vaisitti T. Bergui L. Bonello L. Horenstein A.L. Tamagnone L. Boumsell L. Malavasi F. CD38 and CD100 lead a network of surface receptors relaying positive signals for B-CLL growth and survival.Blood. 2005; 105: 3042-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the effects of IFNγ treatment on the expression of CD31 in NLCs. The results showed that 72-h treatment with IFNγ led to a significant reduction in CD31 (Fig. 4A). The above led us to test whether IFNγ-induced NLC polarization would be sufficient to interfere with NLC-dependent CLL cell survival. We treated NLCs for 72 h and then co-cultured them with CLL cells for 24 h. CLL cell survival was measured by Annexin/propidium iodide staining. The results showed that IFNγ treatment significantly reduced the survival of CLL cells within the co-cultures (Fig. 4B) despite not accelerating the death of control CLL cells in single culture (data not shown). In this study, we found that treatment of NLCs with IFNγ could reprogram them toward a more effector-like phenotype and also in such a way that they no longer supported the survival of CLL cells. IFNγ also significantly enhanced the phagocytic ability of NLCs against opsonized SRBCs as well as rituximab-coated CLL cells. These findings suggest that IFNγ could serve to improve the outcome of antibody therapy for CLL. They also support the earlier observation that NLCs resemble M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (15.Giannoni P. Pietra G. Travaini G. Quarto R. Shyti G. Benelli R. Ottaggio L. Mingari M.C. Zupo S. Cutrona G. Pierri I. Balleari E. Pattarozzi A. Calvaruso M. Tripodo C. et al.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia nurse-like cells express hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and display features of immunosuppressive type 2 skewed macrophages.Haematologica. 2014; 99: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) because the latter have been found to respond to IFNγ (9.Duluc D. Corvaisier M. Blanchard S. Catala L. Descamps P. Gamelin E. Ponsoda S. Delneste Y. Hebbar M. Jeannin P. Interferon-γ reverses the immunosuppressive and protumoral properties and prevents the generation of human tumor-associated macrophages.Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In addition, these data suggest that SDF-1, although important for CLL cell survival, is by itself not sufficient. IFNγ did not significantly decrease NLC SDF-1 but did decrease CLL cell survival in NLC/CLL cultures. This is in agreement with Burger et al. (3.Burger J.A. Tsukada N. Burger M. Zvaifler N.J. Dell'Aquila M. Kipps T.J. Blood-derived nurse-like cells protect chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells from spontaneous apoptosis through stromal cell-derived factor-1.Blood. 2000; 96: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found that supplementing CLL cells with SDF-1 offered some but not full protection against apoptosis. Additional survival stimuli such as CD31/CD38 interactions, along with others yet to be tested, are likely to contribute to CLL cell survival. Quantifying the full effects of IFNγ on NLCs with regard to their interactions with CLL cells will require further study. Direct administration of IFNγ continues to be tested for conditions including macular edema, HIV, and various tumor types (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). A synthetic version of IFNγ (Actimmune) was approved for the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease as well as to delay the progression of malignant osteopetrosis (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm109130.htm). Our results suggest that such IFNγ administration may be beneficial against CLL as well. Within the context of antibody therapy, IFNγ would be induced in natural killer cells, which could act locally upon the NLCs. This could be further strengthened by the co-administration of agents such as IL-12 (23.Parihar R. Nadella P. Lewis A. Jensen R. De Hoff C. Dierksheide J.E. VanBuskirk A.M. Magro C.M. Young D.C. Shapiro C.L. Carson 3rd., W.E.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5027-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), CpG (24.Roda J.M. Parihar R. Carson 3rd., W.E. CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides act through TLR9 to enhance the NK cell cytokine response to antibody-coated tumor cells.J.

TLR8 stimulation enhances cetuximab-mediated natural killer cell lysis of head and neck cancer cells and dendritic cell cross-priming of EGFR-specific CD8+ T cells.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2013; 62: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Such co-treatment would be predicted to significantly enhance antibody-mediated clearance of CLL cells and may also inhibit the development of new NLCs. Given the importance of CD20 antibody-based therapy in prolonging survival of CLL patients, this could represent a major advance for this currently incurable disease. J. C. B., S. T., and J. P.

HSPB5 (also known as CRYAB or αB-crystallin) is a small molecular weight heat shock protein encoded by the HSPB5 (crystallin, alpha B) gene and functions as a molecular chaperone. Its promoter contains a heat shock element, a stress-responsive binding site of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), that functionally up-regulates the expression of HSPB5. Increased levels of HSPB5 can then go on to provide distinct cytoprotective effects engaged in restoring cellular homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 1.Morimoto R.I.

The ACDs dimerize and assemble to form a polydisperse ensemble of oligomers, largely through dynamic interactions mediated by the terminal regions (6.Hochberg G.K. Benesch J.L. Dynamical structure of αB-crystallin.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2014; 115: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

The HSPB5 ACD contains two hydrophobic grooves, one between the β4 and β8 strands and the other at the dimer interface, both of which serve as putative binding sites for chaperone action (10.Clark A.R.

Of the known mutations in HSPB5 linked with (cardio)myopathy, all but one result in aberrant protein aggregation of the mutant protein (reviewed in Ref. 25.Mitzelfelt K.A. Benjamin I.J. Tanguay R.M. Hightower L.E. The Big Book on Small Heat Shock Proteins. 1st ed. Springer International Publishing, Switzerland2015: 269-299Google Scholar).

The relative contribution of loss- versus gain-of-toxic function effects remain unclear for specific mutations. An enhanced understanding of HSPB5 as a chaperone is needed to inform therapy development. Here we have investigated a recessive mutation in HSPB5, 343delT, found in a patient who presented at age 4 months with profound muscle stiffness, persistent creatine kinase elevation, and histopathological features of a myofibrillar myopathy (29.Forrest K.M. Al-Sarraj S. Sewry C. Buk S. Tan S.V. Pitt M. Durward A. McDougall M. Irving M. Hanna M.G. Matthews E. Sarkozy A. Hudson J. Barresi R. Bushby K. et al.Infantile onset myofibrillar myopathy due to recessive CRYAB mutations.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2011; 21: 37-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This homozygous recessive, single base deletion results in a frameshift and formation of a premature stop codon following addition of 14 missense residues (S115fs129X). The truncated protein is predicted to contain residues 1–115, having lost the C-terminal extension, as well as a significant portion of the ACD. The skeletal muscle biopsy of the patient shows dense, irregular staining of HSPB5, detectable only by an antibody recognizing the N terminus of HSPB5 (NT-HSPB5). This band runs at the predicted molecular weight of 15 kDa on a Western blot, smaller than the 22-kDa WT HSPB5 protein (29.Forrest K.M. Al-Sarraj S. Sewry C. Buk S. Tan S.V. Pitt M. Durward A. McDougall M. Irving M. Hanna M.G. Matthews E. Sarkozy A. Hudson J. Barresi R. Bushby K. et al.Infantile onset myofibrillar myopathy due to recessive CRYAB mutations.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2011; 21: 37-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, the biopsy shows intense, irregular staining of desmin and myotilin. At presentation, the patient exhibited neither signs of an associated cardiomyopathy nor cataracts, although with age, these symptoms may develop. Of note, the non-consanguineous parents, each heterozygous for 343delT, have no known symptoms attributed to this mutation; however, potential development of late-onset symptoms cannot be excluded. To understand 343delT protein dynamics and their contribution to disease, we have incorporated the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (30.Takahashi K. Okita K. Nakagawa M. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblast cultures.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3081-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) derived from the patient as a unique system to permit the study of endogenous 343delT protein within cell types of interest. Additionally, we used systems of overexpression in a cell line that lacks endogenous HSPB5 expression (reviewed in Ref. 31.Christians E.S. Banerjee Mustafi S. Benjamin I.J. Chaperones and cardiac misfolding protein diseases.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2014; 15: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) because of the recessive nature of the mutation as well as in vitro analysis of 343delT. Here we describe our findings, which provide insights into the molecular defects of 343delT in disease pathogenesis. Fig. 1A shows the family pedigree of the patient harboring the homozygous, recessive 343delT mutation. The non-consanguineous parents are each heterozygous for the mutation and are asymptomatic, whereas the homozygous 343delT patient exhibits a severe, infantile-onset myopathy (29.Forrest K.M. Al-Sarraj S. Sewry C. Buk S. Tan S.V. Pitt M. Durward A. McDougall M. Irving M. Hanna M.G. Matthews E. Sarkozy A. Hudson J. Barresi R. Bushby K. et al.Infantile onset myofibrillar myopathy due to recessive CRYAB mutations.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2011; 21: 37-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of 343delT (strategy outlined in Fig. 1B), we generated iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts of the patient through four-factor reprogramming. Isogenic, heterozygous, gene-corrected control cells were then engineered from the patient iPSCs with a strategy adapted from Yusa et al. (32.Yusa K. Rashid S.T. Strick-Marchand H. Varela I. Liu P.Q.

Hasegawa M. et al.Targeted gene correction of α1-antitrypsin deficiency in induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 478: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) through zinc finger nuclease-stimulated homologous recombination (see “Experimental Procedures”). The genotypes of both the patient (343delT/343delT) and heterozygous wild-type knockin control (WT KI/343delT) iPSCs are outlined in Fig. 1B and were confirmed through direct Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1C). Both iPSC lines expressed relevant pluripotency markers, including NANOG, stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA-4), octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT-4), and TRA-1–81 at the protein level (Fig. 1, D and E) and NANOG, OCT-4 (POU5F1), SOX2, and TRA-1-60 at the RNA level (Fig. 1F). In vitro EZ sphere differentiations of both cell lines resulted in up-regulation of markers from all three germ layers (Fig. 1G). Karyotypes were normal (Fig. 1H). These data validate the use of generated iPSC lines for further investigations. Validated iPSC lines were differentiated into skeletal myotubes (iSKMs) and cardiomyocytes (iCMs) using established protocols (see “Experimental Procedures”). iCMs contracted rhythmically in the dish, stained positive for cardiomyocyte markers, including Troponin T (TnT) (Fig. 2A), and exhibited cardiomyocyte-like action potential profiles (Fig. 2C). iSKMs elongate as they mature in culture, many appear multinucleated, some cells can be observed to twitch spontaneously, and they stain positively for muscle markers, including TnT (Figs. 2B and 4A) and desmin (Fig. 4B). No obvious phenotypic differences were observed between WT KI/343delT and 343delT/343delT iCMs or iSKMs when characterizing cell differentiation in this way.FIGURE 4343delT forms visible aggregates when overexpressed and induces a cellular stress response. A and B, 343delT/343delT iSKMs were transfected with pCMV-MYC-WT or pCMV-MYC-343delT constructs. Cells were stained 48 h post-transfection with antibodies recognizing NT HSPB5 (red) and TnT (green) (A) and MYC tag (green) and desmin (red) (B). Scale bars = 25 μm. C–E, BHK21 cells were transfected with pCMV-MYC-WT or pCMV-MYC-343delT constructs for 24 h and co-stained with antibodies against NT HSPB5 (red) and MYC tag (green) (C) MYC tag (green) and desmin (red) (D), and MYC-tag (green) and HSP70 (red) (E). Scale bars = 50 μm. In all merged immunocytochemistry images, nuclei were counterstained and merged with DAPI (blue). Enlargements of the area within the white dotted box are shown at the right. Arrows indicate 343delT aggregates. F, WCL from BHK21 cells transfected as above or similarly with pCMV-MYC-empty vector (EV) were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing HSP70, MYC (9E10), and α-tubulin as a loading control. Samples were run in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major difference observed between the muscle-differentiated cell lines was a complete lack of detectable 343delT protein both through immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2, A and B) and Western blotting (Fig. 2, D and E) in the 343delT/343delT line when probed with an NT HSPB5 antibody. In the WT KI/343delT control, predicted to express both a 22-kDa-sized WT protein and a 15-kDa-sized 343delT protein, only the WT form of the protein is detectable (Fig. 2, D and E), indicating that lack of detectable 343delT is not due to immaturity of the cells. This result was surprising to us because the muscle biopsy from the patient showed dense, irregular staining of HSPB5 through immunohistochemistry and a 15-kDa-sized protein detectable by Western blotting with the NT HSPB5 antibody (29.Forrest K.M. Al-Sarraj S. Sewry C. Buk S. Tan S.V. Pitt M. Durward A. McDougall M. Irving M. Hanna M.G. Matthews E. Sarkozy A. Hudson J. Barresi R. Bushby K. et al.Infantile onset myofibrillar myopathy due to recessive CRYAB mutations.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2011; 21: 37-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lack of 343delT protein was confirmed in a second iPSC line derived from the patient as well as the isogenic, heterozygous, gene-corrected control line derived from that iPSC line (supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, homozygous knockin of the 343delT mutation into the endogenous HSPB5 locus of an iPSC line derived from an unrelated, healthy individual also exhibited a complete lack of detectable 343delT protein (data not shown). Because 343delT protein was not detectable, we next investigated whether this was due to defects in RNA levels. The 343delT transcript is not predicted to be a target for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because the premature stop codon is downstream of the final exon-exon junction complex (33.Amrani N. Sachs M.S. Jacobson A. Early nonsense: mRNA decay solves a translational problem.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that 343delT transcript levels would be comparable with the WT. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of iCMs and iSKMs revealed expression of HSPB5 mRNA in both WT KI/343delT and 343delT/343delT (Fig. 2, F and G). HSPB5 mRNA levels may differ depending on the efficiency of differentiation, which varies between iPSC lines and differentiation attempts, as noted by differences in expression of the muscle-specific gene Troponin T (TNNT2) (Fig. 2, F and G). Therefore, although the level of HSPB5 mRNA cannot be directly compared between samples, we confirm that 343delT mRNA is present. Additionally, in contrast to an unstable mRNA control, MYC, levels of HSPB5 mRNA did not decline in WT KI/343delT or 343delT/343delT iCMs with treatment of actinomycin D to inhibit transcription over 24 h (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating similar transcript stability in WT and 343delT. These results show that the defect in 343delT protein expression is not due to deficient transcript levels. To further investigate the reason for lack of 343delT protein detection, we next examined protein degradation as a possible mechanism. iCMs were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (34.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Proteasome inhibitors: valuable new tools for cell biologists.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the increase in the short-lived cell cycle inhibitor p21 with MG132 treatment (35.Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 via N-terminal ubiquitinylation.Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), 343delT protein (15 kDa) remained undetectable in both WT KI/343delT and 343delT/343delT with inhibition of proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of autophagosome maturation with bafilomycin A1 for 12 h (36.Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Bafilomycin A1 prevents maturation of autophagic vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes in rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E cells.Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) was also insufficient to evoke 343delT protein detection in iCMs, although LC3-II (lower band) increased as expected with treatment (supplemental Fig. S3A). Additionally, treatment of 343delT/343delT iSKMs with the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib for up to 48 h (37.Nawrocki S.T. Carew J.S. Dunner Jr., K. Boise L.H. Chiao P.J. Huang P. Abbruzzese J.L. McConkey D.J. Bortezomib inhibits PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase and induces apoptosis via ER stress in human pancreatic cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11510-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3B) or MG132 for 12 h (supplemental Fig. S3C) and inhibition of autophagosome maturation with bafilomycin A1 for 12 h (supplemental Fig. S3C) were also insufficient to evoke 343delT detection. These data suggest that the lack of detectable 343delT protein is not due to degradation by the proteasome or autophagy. Complementary experiments of overexpression of 343delT in a human breast cancer cell line (MCF7 cells) showed that both inhibition of the proteasome (MG132) and autophagy (bafilomycin A1) resulted in slight increases in 343delT protein (supplemental Fig. S3, D and E). This result suggests that 343delT protein is likely degraded to some extent by the proteasome and autophagy, but this is not the major cause for our inability to detect 343delT protein in our iPSC model. Another possibility we considered is that 343delT mRNA is differentially targeted compared with WT by a microRNA that inhibits translation. To examine this possibility, we transfected iCMs with siRNA to knock down dicer, the protein responsible for processing pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (38.Flores-Jasso C.F. Arenas-Huertero C. Reyes J.L. Contreras-Cubas C. Covarrubias A. Vaca L. First step in pre-miRNAs processing by human Dicer.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although knockdown of dicer was confirmed through decreased levels of dicer protein and elevated levels of c-MYC, a known target of dicer-dependent microRNAs (39.Jackstadt R. Hermeking H. MicroRNAs as regulators and mediators of c-MYC function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect 343delT protein in either WT KI/343delT or 343delT/343delT (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that 343delT is not differentially targeted by a dicer-dependent microRNA. To confirm that there is no inherent defect in the translation efficiency of 343delT compared with WT, we performed an in vitro transcription/translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate labeling-translated proteins with [35S]l-methionine and [35S]l-cysteine. We utilized a plasmid containing N-terminally MYC-tagged versions of WT (pCS2-MYC-WT) and 343delT (pCS2-MYC-343delT) and an SP6 promoter as the template for this reaction. Both WT and 343delT are visible after 30 min of incubation and increase after 90 min (Fig. 3C). No significant difference is observed between WT and 343delT in the rate of synthesis over time (21.8 ± 3.4 and 19.1 ± 6.9, respectively) of the recombinant protein. This result shows that 343delT is translated efficiently, at least in this reticulocyte lysate. In toto, these results demonstrate that lack of detectable 343delT protein in iCMs and iSKMs generated from 343delT/343delT and WT KI/343delT is not attributable to proteasomal degradation, autophagic degradation, microRNA targeting, or defective translation. The results presented above utilizing iCMs and iSKMs show an absence of detectable 343delT protein. The presence of mutant protein in the biopsy specimen of the protein suggests that accumulation of 343delT in the affected tissue may contribute to disease. For this reason, we attempted to simulate these conditions with our model to determine whether high levels of 343delT expression would result in aggregation in muscle cells. We transiently transfected N-termin"
https://openalex.org/W2407862355,"Hyperekplexia is a rare human neuromotor disorder caused by mutations that impair the efficacy of glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Loss-of-function mutations in the GLRA1 or GLRB genes, which encode the α1 and β glycine receptor (GlyR) subunits, are the major cause. Paradoxically, gain-of-function GLRA1 mutations also cause hyperekplexia, although the mechanism is unknown. Here we identify two new gain-of-function mutations (I43F and W170S) and characterize these along with known gain-of-function mutations (Q226E, V280M, and R414H) to identify how they cause hyperekplexia. Using artificial synapses, we show that all mutations prolong the decay of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and induce spontaneous GlyR activation. As these effects may deplete the chloride electrochemical gradient, hyperekplexia could potentially result from reduced glycinergic inhibitory efficacy. However, we consider this unlikely as the depleted chloride gradient should also lead to pain sensitization and to a hyperekplexia phenotype that correlates with mutation severity, neither of which is observed in patients with GLRA1 hyperekplexia mutations. We also rule out small increases in IPSC decay times (as caused by W170S and R414H) as a possible mechanism given that the clinically important drug, tropisetron, significantly increases glycinergic IPSC decay times without causing motor side effects. A recent study on cultured spinal neurons concluded that an elevated intracellular chloride concentration late during development ablates α1β glycinergic synapses but spares GABAergic synapses. As this mechanism satisfies all our considerations, we propose it is primarily responsible for the hyperekplexia phenotype.

As these effects may deplete the chloride electrochemical gradient, hyperekplexia could potentially result from reduced glycinergic inhibitory efficacy. However, we consider this unlikely as the depleted chloride gradient should also lead to pain sensitization and to a hyperekplexia phenotype that correlates with mutation severity, neither of which is observed in patients with GLRA1 hyperekplexia mutations. We also rule out small increases in IPSC decay times (as caused by W170S and R414H) as a possible mechanism given that the clinically important drug, tropisetron, significantly increases glycinergic IPSC decay times without causing motor side effects. A recent study on cultured spinal neurons concluded that an elevated intracellular chloride concentration late during development ablates α1β glycinergic synapses but spares GABAergic synapses. As this mechanism satisfies all our considerations, we propose it is primarily responsible for the hyperekplexia phenotype."

Stage II sporulation protein D (SpoIID) is a lytic transglycosylase (LT) essential for sporulation. The LT superfamily is a potential drug target because it is active in essential bacterial processes involving the peptidoglycan, which is unique to bacteria. However, the absence of structural information for the sporulation-specific LT enzymes has hindered mechanistic understanding of SpoIID. Here, we report the first crystal structures with and without ligands of the SpoIID family from two community relevant spore-forming pathogens, Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium difficile. The structures allow us to visualize the overall architecture, characterize the substrate recognition model, identify critical residues, and provide the structural basis for catalysis by this new family of enzymes.

Sporulation is an evolutionarily conserved process that allows some Gram-positive bacteria to differentiate into a dormant cell type called a spore that allows them to resist chemical agents such as antibiotics and disinfectants and physical agents such as radiation, boiling and drying (1.Morlot C.

Sporulation is characterized by an asymmetric cell division, followed by migration of the mother cells' membrane around the nascent spore in a phagocyte-like process (2.Errington J.

In this complex, SpoIIM serves as a scaffold upon which the SpoIID and SpoIIP enzymes assemble (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z.

Engulfment during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is governed by a multi-protein complex containing tandemly acting autolysins.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SpoIIP is single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular portion that has both amidase and endopeptidase activities. This enzyme cleaves the cross-links connecting the stem peptides of PGN and removes the stem peptides from the glycan chains (Fig. 1a). SpoIID is a lytic transglycosylase (LT), an enzyme that cleaves the glycan strands of PGN (Fig. 1b). It also has a single-pass transmembrane domain and a large extracellular portion that can bind PGN but can only cleave glycan strands after the stem peptides of PGN have been removed by SpoIIP. The requirement for a peptide-free glycan strand defines an ordered and sequential set of events during the engulfment process. SpoIID also functions to stimulate SpoIIP activity (4.Gutierrez J. Smith R. Pogliano K. SpoIID-mediated peptidoglycan degradation is required throughout engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3174-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). LTs represent a class of autolysin that cleaves the glycan chain of the PGN to facilitate biosynthesis, remodeling, degradation, and turnover of the bacterial cell wall (7.Scheurwater E. Reid C.W. Clarke A.J. Lytic transglycosylases: bacterial space-making autolysins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). LTs differ from the other two classes of glycan strand-cleaving enzymes. Although muramidases hydrolyze the β-1,4 N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)-N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) glycosidic bond and glucosaminidases hydrolyze the β-1,4 NAG-NAM glycosidic bond, LTs use the C-6 hydroxyl of NAM as a nucleophile in the cleavage reaction of the β-1,4 NAM-NAG glycosidic bond. Consequently, the product of LT action has a terminal 1,6-anhydro-NAM (Fig. 1b). The proposed intramolecular transglycosylation reaction requires the presence at the active site of a catalytic residue that has been identified as a glutamate in several enzymes (8.Thunnissen A.M. Dijkstra A.J. Kalk K.H. Rozeboom H.J. Engel H. Keck W. Dijkstra B.W. Doughnut-shaped structure of a bacterial muramidase revealed by x-ray crystallography.Nature. 1994; 367: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence homology observed among the LT superfamily, in most cases their catalytic domains include a region structurally similar to that of goose egg-white lysozyme (GEWL) (9.Thunnissen A.M. Isaacs N.W. Dijkstra B.W. The catalytic domain of a bacterial lytic transglycosylase defines a novel class of lysozymes.Proteins. 1995; 22: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The LT superfamily has been subdivided into four families on the basis of conserved motifs (10.Blackburn N.T. Clarke A.J. Identification of four families of peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases.J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, SpoIID does not show sequence homology with any of the characterized murein hydrolases and thus represents the founding member of a new LT family (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z. A highly coordinated cell wall degradation machine governs spore morphogenesis in Bacillus subtilis.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although several crystal structures are available for members of the 1–4 LT families, none have previously been determined for any members of the SpoIID family. The standard protocols from the Center for the Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases were used for cloning, overexpression, and purification of CdSpoIID (YP_001086593.1) and Ba-SpoIID (AAP29172.1) (11.Anderson W.F.

Briefly, BaSpoIID (from residues 33 to 339) and CdSpoIID (from residues 28 to 354) were cloned into the pMCSG7 expression vector (bioinformatics.anl.gov). The mutants of CdSpoIID were generated by PCR and by using the polymerase incomplete primer extension technique (13.Klock H.E. Lesley S.A.

At that point, the temperature was reduced to 25 °C, and protein overexpression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 16 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by sonication. Proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were concentrated and stored at −80 °C in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (GE Healthcare), and both its size and purity were checked by SDS-PAGE. Sitting drop crystallization plates were set up at room temperature, and crystals were obtained for BaSpoIID at a concentration of 13.4 mg/ml in 0.15 m dl-malic acid, pH 7.0, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, and for CdSpoIID at 7.0 mg/ml in 1.6 m tri-sodium citrate, pH 6.5, with elastase 1:100 (v/v) (Sigma, 50 units/ml) (11.Anderson W.F. Structural genomics and drug discovery for infectious diseases.Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2009; 9: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Harvested crystals were transferred to the mother liquor before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team at the Advance Photon Source, Argonne, IL (APS BEAMLINE 21-ID-G). All structural work was performed by the Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (15.Anderson W.F. Structural genomics and drug discovery for infectious diseases.Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2009; 9: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data were processed using HKL-2000 for indexing, integration, and scaling (16.Otwinowski Z.M. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). A selenomethionine derivative of BaSpoIID was used to phase the structure by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. The domains from this structure were used for molecular replacement to phase CdSpoIID. Structures were refined with Refmac (17.Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S. Steiner R.A.

The visualization of the sequence conservation of the most 40 different members of Pfam08486 (the conserved domain of the SpoIID family) on the structure of CdSpoIID (Fig. 6e) was performed using the ConSurf server (20.Ashkenazy H.

Yoo S. Sanchez R. SiteComp: a server for ligand binding site analysis in protein structures.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 1172-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Only the grid points with interaction energy below e−10 were included in the cluster. The result of this analysis was the molecular interaction field (MIF), which clearly showed the location for favorable interaction energy clusters in subsite −1, between the active site residues of CdSpoIID and the ligand. The MIF and the limited empty volume in subsite −1 of the CdSpoIID guided the modeling of the NAM moiety in Coot (18.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). In particular, to maintain the links with the NAG in subsites −2 and +1 by conserving the minimum energy conformation, the NAM in subsite −1 has (i) the C6 in axial position, (ii) the N-acetyl group, and (iii) the lactyl group modeled in the two lobes available in the MIF. Any alternative conformation of NAM in subsite −1 is not able to maintain the links with the NAG in subsites −2 and D. Additionally, the lactyl group in subsite −3 was modeled in a minimum energy conformation in accordance with the conformation of the pyranose ring of the NAG in subsite −3 of the NAG3-1 molecule in the crystal structure of CdSpoIID. The sequence alignment was generated with ESPript (22.Robert X. Gouet P. Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W320-W324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) and ClustalW (23.Larkin M.A. Blackshields G.

The maximum likelihood method was used to infer the evolutionary history of identified sequences in Mega 6.06 (24.Tamura K. Peterson D. Peterson N. Stecher G. Nei M. Kumar S.

The activity of SpoIID from Bacillus subtilis (BsSpoIID) has been previously tested on PGN purified from the cell wall (i.e. sacculi) of E. coli (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z. A highly coordinated cell wall degradation machine governs spore morphogenesis in Bacillus subtilis.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sacculi were prepared from E. coli BL21DE3 as described previously (25.Harz H. Burgdorf K. Höltje J.V. Isolation and separation of the glycan strands from murein of Escherichia coli by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of cells was grown in LB until an A600 of 0.5. The growth was stopped by rapid cooling in an ice bath, and the cells were spun down (10 min; 10,000 × g; 4 °C) and boiled in 100 ml of 4% SDS with vigorous stirring for 30 min. Sacculi were then sedimented by ultracentrifugation (10 min; 10,000 × g; room temperature) and washed five times with double distilled H2O to remove SDS. Isolated sacculi were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 10 mm NaCl, 0.32 m imidazole and treated with 100 μg/ml amylase (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation at 60 °C in the presence of 100 μl/ml of Pronase E (Sigma). The sacculi were boiled again with 4% SDS for 15 min and washed, as described above, until free of SDS. Sacculi were labeled with Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB, Sigma) by incubating them with 20 mm RBB in 0.25 m NaOH overnight at 37 °C, as described previously (26.Zhou R. Chen S. Recsei P. A dye release assay for determination of lysostaphin activity.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The preparation was neutralized with HCl, and the dye-labeled sacculi were pelleted by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 20 min, room temperature). The sacculi were then washed repeatedly with double distilled H2O until the supernatant was clear. For the enzymatic reaction in Fig. 4, d and e, 600 μl of RBB-labeled PGN were incubated in buffer B1 (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for 1 h with 100 μm CwlH, CdSpoIID, BaSpoIID or in combination. For Fig. 4e, the insoluble material of CwlH reaction was washed 10 times with 1 ml of B1 and 0.01% SDS and then 5 times with B1 alone to eliminate the SDS. 20 μl of CwlH-treated RBB-labeled PGN were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with CdSpoIID mutants at 10 μm in buffer B1. Reactions were stopped by adding ½ reaction volume of 95% ethanol. Soluble cleavage products were separated by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g) at room temperature. Structural multialignment was performed using PROMALs3D on a set of representative structures from 14 different LTs available in the Protein Data Bank (Table 2) (27.Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V.

This protein was successfully expressed, purified, and crystallized. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction with a selenomethionine-substituted sample of BaSpoIID provided initial experimental phases. The final model (Fig. 2, a–c) was refined at 2.10 Å resolution (Table 1). BaSpoIID has a fist-like shape, which includes an α-helix rich α-domain (“the hand”), and a β-strand rich β-domain (“the arm”). A deep groove runs across the palm of the α-domain. The α-domain includes seven α-helices, with α2 spanning the α-domain under the transverse groove. Two clusters of α-helices (α1-α3-α5 and α9-α10) and three small β-sheets (β1-β2, β4-β5-β14, and β6–β13) were assembled around α2 and participate in the formation of the main groove. A β-strand rich β-domain is organized in two β-sheets (β7-β12-β11 and β8-β9-β10) connected by two α-helices (α7 and α8) (Fig. 2, a–c).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for crystal structures of BaSpoIID and CdSpoIIDBaSpoIID (PDB code 4RWR)CdSpoIID (PDB code 5I1T)Data collectionSpace groupP21P3121Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)46.62, 144.48, 47.0898.08, 98.08, 108.33α, β, γ (°)90.00, 115.36, 9090.00, 90.00, 120.00Resolution (Å)30.00-2.10 (2.14-2.10)aValues in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.30.00-2.60 (2.64-2.60)Rsym or Rmerge0.105 (0.623)0.067 (0.608)I/σI12.4 (2.2)30.8 (4.1)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)Redundancy4.3 (4.3)8.8 (9.3)RefinementResolution (Å)27.53-2.10 (2.15-2.10)29.08-2.60 (2.67-2.60)No. of reflections31,083 (2,402)17,967 (1,362)Rwork/Rfree0.188/0.243 (0.246/0.302)0.155/0.196 (0.200/0.308)No. of atomsProtein4,2032,314Ligand/ion0/082/3Water290148B-FactorsProtein39.568.6Ligand/ion97.5/68.4Water36.665.6r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0090.011Bond angles (°)1.441.48a Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab SpoIIDs exhibit considerable sequence divergence, and we decided it would be useful to compare divergent SpoIID structures. The SpoIID from C. difficile (CdSpoIID) shares only 34.8% sequence identity with BaSpoIID and was selected for subsequent studies (Fig. 3). CdSpoIID was successfully expressed, purified, and crystallized. The structure was determined to 2.6 Å resolution by the molecular replacement method using the structure of BaSpoIID as a search model (Fig. 2, d–f) (Table 1). CdSpoIID has the same structural organization of BaSpoIID with a α-helix rich α-domain forming the hand and a β-strand rich β-domain, forming the arm (Fig. 2f). Well diffracting CdSpoIID crystals only grew in the presence of N,N′,N″-tri-acetyl-chitotriose (NAG3) molecules, which mimic the glycan chains of the PGN. In the structure, a NAG3 molecule (NAG3-1) occupies subsites −4, −3, and −2 of the substrate-binding site, whereas a second NAG3 molecule (NAG3-2) occupies subsites +1, +2, and +3 (Fig. 4a). CdSpoIID makes direct interactions with sugars spanning positions −4 to +1 (Fig. 4b). The glycosidic torsion angles of the NAG3 molecules adopt an intermediate configuration between the rotation of NAG-NAM (pentapeptide) observed for the PGN with three NAG-NAM (pentapeptide) disaccharides per turn (28.Meroueh S.O. Bencze K.Z. Hesek D. Lee M. Fisher J.F. Stemmler T.L. Mobashery S. Three-dimensional structure of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4404-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and the rotation of α-chitin (NAG polymer) in which the planes of the saccharide rings are oriented at 180° to each other (29.Minke R. Blackwell J. The structure of α-chitin.J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This indicates that the SpoIID interactions modify the sugar orientations in the glycan chains. The CdSpoIID crystal structure also revealed a new zinc-binding site made up of a turn-β-strand-turn motif that contributes two cysteines (Cys-40 and Cys-146) and two histidines (His-134 and His-145) to the coordination of the zinc (Fig. 4c). This binding site has no counterpart in the BaSpoIID. We next sought to leverage our structural insight to clarify SpoIID function. First, we confirmed that both CdSpoIID and BaSpoIID require peptide-free glycan chains as substrate for their hydrolase activities (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z.

Pogliano K. SpoIID-mediated peptidoglycan degradation is required throughout engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3174-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, no blue release was detected in the supernatant for reactions containing BaSpoIID and CdSpoIID when incubated with RBB-labeled PGN. Consequently, the RBB-labeled PGN was incubated with the CwlH enzyme in combination with CdSpoIID or BaSpoIID confirming the requirement for CdSpoIID and BaSpoIID for stem-free glycan chains as substrate (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, based on a structural analysis, we generated 14 CdSpoIID single mutants (in each case mutated to alanine) and tested their enzymatic activity (Fig. 4e). The Glu-101 to Ala substitution inactivated the enzyme. This result, complemented by the structural data and by the fact that the corresponding Glu-88 in the BsSpoIID has been previously proposed to be the catalytic residue (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z. A highly coordinated cell wall degradation machine governs spore morphogenesis in Bacillus subtilis.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4.Gutierrez J. Smith R. Pogliano K. SpoIID-mediated peptidoglycan degradation is required throughout engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 3174-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), confirms that Glu-101 of CdSpoIID is the essential catalytic residue for the reaction. Interestingly, the single mutations of His-145, Cys-146, or Cys-140, three of the residues involved in the zinc coordination, also inactivated the enzyme, highlighting the importance of this structural motif for CdSpoIID activity. Besides the mutations of Glu-101 and the residues involved in the zinc binding coordination, other mutations affect the in vitro activity of CdSpoIID. We identified Tyr-194 as another key residue. Its hydroxyl group is positioned at 3.4 Å from the carboxylic group of the catalytic glutamate Glu-101 in CdSpoIID. This position is occupied by tyrosines or phenylalanines in all the enzymes in the SpoIID family. Consequently, besides the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine, the aromatic ring that the two residues share seems to be particularly important in the active site. The Tyr-194 of CdSpoIID, which corresponds to Phe-176 in BaSpoIID, makes hydrophobic interactions with the acetyl group of NAG at subsite −2. The Tyr-213 substitution to alanine also impacts the activity of the enzyme. This residue makes hydrophobic interactions with the NAG3-1 in the subsite −4 (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the catalytic activity of mutants S196A and Q324A, which interact with the acetyl group of the NAG3-2 subsite +1 and NAG3-1 subsite −2, respectively. Gln-324 seems to have also a structural importance due to the interaction that occurs between its amide group and the carbonyl of Gln-114 from the α2-helix (Fig. 4b). The side chain amide group of Gln-324 is also at 3 Å from a side chain oxygen of Glu-101. His-318 is highly conserved in the family, and its side chain interacts with the carbonyl of the acetyl group of NAG3 at subsite −2. His-318 in CdSpoIID corresponds to His-297 in BsSpoIID, and its alanine substitution completely abrogates spore formation in B. subtilis (1.Morlot C. Uehara T. Marquis K.A. Bernhardt T.G. Rudner D.Z.

Additionally, a number of BsSpoIID mutations that reduce PGN degradation activity and/or sporulation efficiency have previously been reported (Fig. 3). These residues are very conserved in all the members of the SpoIID family and correspond in CdSpoIID to Arg-119, Thr-202, Lys-217, Asp-224, Met-322, Tyr-344, and Tyr-345 (1.Morlot C. Uehara T.

Extrusion of T4P and natural transformation of DNA in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus requires a unique secretin complex comprising six stacked rings, a membrane-embedded cone structure, and two gates that open and close a central channel. To investigate the role of distinct domains in ring and gate formation, we examined a set of deletion derivatives by cryomicroscopy techniques. Here we report that maintaining the N0 ring in the deletion derivatives led to stable PilQ complexes. Analyses of the variants unraveled that an N-terminal domain comprising a unique βββαβ fold is essential for the formation of gate 2. Furthermore, we identified four βαββα domains essential for the formation of the N2 to N5 rings. Mutant studies revealed that deletion of individual ring domains significantly reduces piliation. The N1, N2, N4, and N5 deletion mutants were significantly impaired in T4P-mediated twitching motility, whereas the motility of the N3 mutant was comparable with that of wild-type cells. This indicates that the deletion of the N3 ring leads to increased pilus dynamics, thereby compensating for the reduced number of pili of the N3 mutant. All mutants exhibit a wild-type natural transformation phenotype, leading to the conclusion that DNA uptake is independent of functional T4P.

Important structural information has been derived from electron cryomicroscopy of isolated GspD, the T2SS secretin from Vibrio cholerae. GspD forms a 12-fold symmetrical cylinder with a diameter of 155 Å and a length of 200 Å (16Korotkov K.V. Johnson T.L. Jobling M.G. Pruneda J. Pardon E. Héroux A. Turley S. Steyaert J. Holmes R.K.

The conserved β sheet-rich C-terminal domains of GspD form a channel through the outer membrane that is closed by an extracellular and a periplasmic gate (2Korotkov K.V. Gonen T. Hol W.G.

Interestingly, T4P-mediated twitching motility requires two retraction ATPases, designated PilT1 and PilT2, that are dispensable for natural transformation (24Salzer R. Joos F. Averhoff B.

PilQ was found to undergo substantial conformational changes between the closed and the open, pilus-extruding state (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state.eLife. 2015; 410.7554/eLife.07380Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SP-EM analyses of purified PilQ complexes revealed that the structure comprises six stacked rings (N0-N5) and a cone structure (20Burkhardt J. Vonck J. Averhoff B. Structure and function of PilQ, a secretin of the DNA transporter from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9977-9984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), consistent with the in situ data of the entire T4P machinery (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state.eLife. 2015; 410.7554/eLife.07380Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of PilQ complexes formed by different PilQ variants led to the identification of an unusual ααβαββα fold as the N0 ring-forming domain. Production of the truncated PilQ variant in a pilQ-negative background led to a mutant that was non-piliated and non-motile but still naturally transformable (19Burkhardt J. Vonck J. Langer J.D. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Unusual N-terminal ααβαββα fold of PilQ from Thermus thermophilus mediates ring formation and is essential for piliation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8484-8494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that pilus structures are not required for natural transformation. However, identification of other ring- and gate-forming domains was not possible because of instability of the PilQ variants. Moreover, the assignment of specific functions to distinct ring structures in secretins has not been reported so far. Here we found that maintaining the N0 ring domain in PilQ deletion derivatives leads to stable PilQ complexes, which we used to perform a thorough structure/function analysis that unraveled one of the gate-forming and four ring-forming domains. We further demonstrated that the individual rings play separate roles in T4P extrusion and T4P dynamics but are dispensable for natural transformation. These results demonstrate that individual ring structures within the secretin complex exhibit distinct functions during T4P extrusion. Secondary structure analyses revealed that there are four contiguous βαββα folds (N2 to N5) in the secretin PilQ from T. thermophilus, suggested to form ring-building motifs (20Burkhardt J. Vonck J. Averhoff B. Structure and function of PilQ, a secretin of the DNA transporter from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9977-9984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of these motifs in ring formation, we generated a set of internal PilQ deletion variants (ΔN2, ΔN3, ΔN4, and ΔN5) that were produced in a T. thermophilus pilQ deletion background (Fig. 1). Western blotting analyses of membrane fractions revealed that all variants assembled into SDS-stable PilQ complexes (Fig. 2), demonstrating that deletion of individual βαββα domains does not abolish complex formation.FIGURE 2Detection of truncated PilQ complexes. Total membranes (50 μg of protein) of the T. thermophilus HB27 wild type and membranes of pilQwt, ΔpilQ::bleo, N1Δβ1β2, N1β3αβ4, ΔN1, ΔN2, ΔN3, ΔN4, and ΔN5 mutants were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting analysis using polyclonal PilQ antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). The full-length PilQ monomers are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first βαββα fold (N2 domain) is preceded by an unusual βββαβ fold (N1 domain) (Fig. 1). To elucidate the role of this domain in ring formation, we generated a PilQ deletion derivative devoid of either the entire N1 domain (Δβ1β2β3αβ4) or N1 subdomains (N1Δβ1β2 or N1Δβ3αβ4) (Fig. 1). These deletion derivatives also assembled into macromolecular PilQ complexes (Fig. 2), providing clear evidence that the N1 domain is also dispensable for complex assembly. To unequivocally identify the ring-forming domains in PilQ, His-tagged deletion derivatives were produced in T. thermophilus and purified by affinity and anion exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE analyses led to the detection of high molecular weight PilQ complexes (Fig. 3). Different size PilQ complexes and varying amounts of monomers were detected for most of the purified deletion derivatives (Fig. 3). The highest amount of monomer accumulation was detected in preparations of PilQ deletion derivatives devoid of the N1 domain and the N1Δβ1β2 subdomain. This leads to the conclusion that, in particular, the N1β1β2 plays a major role in PilQ complex stability. SP-EM studies of PilQ showed six rings and a cone domain that were also seen in situ by cryo-ET (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W.

To analyze the effect of the domain deletions on the structure of PilQ, we analyzed the purified deletion derivatives by SP-EM (Fig. 4A). In all cases, with the exception of the ΔN1 mutant, the amount of protein complex was sufficient for SP-EM analysis (Fig. 4A). The overall shape of the complex was comparable with the in situ cryo-ET structure of the PilQ complex. Deletion of the first subdomain of N1 (N1Δβ1β2) did not result in an obvious change in the structure compared with the wild type (Fig. 4D). In contrast, deletion of the second part of N1 (N1Δβ3αβ4) changed the structure dramatically (Fig. 4E). The periplasmic end of the complex, corresponding to the N0, N1, and N2 rings, was significantly narrower. The N0 ring, which is the widest ring in the wild-type complex (Fig. 4, B and C), was no longer visible. In the wild-type structure, a second dense domain was observed close to the N0 ring that extends into the center of the complex, forming gate 2 (Fig. 4, B and C). This gate is still clearly present in PilQ complexes devoid of the partial deletions in the N1 domain. The N1 ring is followed by two further rings (N2 and N3) that are similar in size and are separated by a gap of ∼12 Å, designated as the N2/N3 gap (Fig. 4, B and C). The ΔN2 and ΔN3 variants were structurally similar, with one ring and the N2/N3 gap missing (Fig. 4, F and G). Deletion of the βαββα domain downstream of the N3 domain led to loss of the N4 ring, confirming its position in the complex (Fig. 4, C and H). The C-terminal part of all variants as well as the wild type formed a trapezoid (“cone structure”) that shows a strong central density (Fig. 4B). Below the cone is a “cup” structure with a shape characteristic of the secretin domain. Based on its position, the lower part of the cone is likely to be gate 1, as identified by cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging (Fig. 4, B and C) (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state.eLife. 2015; 410.7554/eLife.07380Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In all ring variants, the secretin domain and gate 1 were clearly visible (Fig. 4, B–I), suggesting that a specific motif in the secretin domain is responsible for forming this gate. The narrow ring beneath gate 1 in the cup is missing in the ΔN5 mutant complex (Fig. 4I), indicating that it is formed by the βαββα domain in N5 (Fig. 4I). Because of the poor stability of the ΔN1 mutant, it was not suitable for SP-EM analysis. To investigate the effect of the N1 mutation, the intact T4P machinery composed of PilQ and accessory proteins was analyzed in situ by cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging. The assembled machinery in the closed state (without pili) was identified in whole cells (Fig. 5F) and detected exclusively at the cell poles, in agreement with previous data (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state.eLife. 2015; 410.7554/eLife.07380Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the number of complexes was severely reduced compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5, A, E, F, and J), probably as a result of reduced protein stability. Closed-state complexes were selected, aligned, and averaged to determine the three-dimensional structure of the ΔN1 mutant in its native membrane-bound state. Comparison with the wild-type complex (Fig. 5, C and D) shows that the N1 domain is responsible for the formation of gate 2 (Fig. 5, H and I). The outer membrane-embedded secretin domain was poorly resolved in the average, most likely because of the inherent flexibility of the complex and the reduced number of particles available. Removal of gate 2 did not affect the ability of PilQ to assemble with accessory proteins (designated P1, P2, and C1) into the entire T4P machinery (Fig. 5, C, D, H, and I). In rare cases, cells lacking gate 2 in PilQ were also found to assemble pili (Fig. 5G). However, the shape of the PilQ complex was abnormal compared with the wild type (compare Fig. 5, B and C), and it was associated with extracellular material, possibly from cell leakage (Fig. 5B). Conventional Fourier shell correlation, applying the 0.5 FSC criterion, are presented in Fig. 6.FIGURE 6FSC curves for subtomogram averages. Resolution estimates were based on conventional FSC measurements and the 0.5 criterion in IMOD. Calculations for the closed state of the ΔN1 mutant (blue, 50 Å) is shown with the wild-type complex (green, 35 Å) for comparison. Data for the wild-type complex have been shown previously (18Gold V.A. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Kühlbrandt W.

Seventy-eight percent of wild-type cells were piliated with 6 ± 3 pili/cell, whereas only 1% of the ΔpilQ::bleo mutant cells were piliated with one pilus at the cell surface, mostly on disrupted cells (Fig. 7A), in agreement with previous data (19Burkhardt J. Vonck J. Langer J.D. Salzer R. Averhoff B. Unusual N-terminal ααβαββα fold of PilQ from Thermus thermophilus mediates ring formation and is essential for piliation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 8484-8494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All PilQ variants could extrude pili; however, the percentage of piliated cells decreased significantly to 20–34% (Fig. 7A). Moreover, the number of pili per cell decreased dramatically (Fig. 7A). In the wild-type cells, only 10% showed less than three pili, whereas 41% exhibited four to seven pili and 27% more than seven. In contrast, the piliated mutant cells extruded only one to three pili (Fig. 7A). To test the role of the N1-N5 domains and the N1 subdomains (N1Δβ1β2 and N1Δβ3αβ4) in T4P-mediated twitching motility, we assessed the ability of cells to twitch. Both wild-type cells and the ΔpilQ::bleo mutant complemented with wild-type pilQ were able to move on solid surfaces with twitching zones of ∼3.2 and ∼3.5 cm, respectively (positive controls) (Fig. 7B). The non-complemented ΔpilQ::bleo mutant (negative control) did not show twitching at all (Fig. 7B), in agreement with our previous findings (19Burkhardt J. Vonck J. Langer J.D. Salzer R. Averhoff B.

The ΔN3 mutant cells were as mobile as the wild type (Student's t test (95%)) (Fig. 7B). The clear reduction in piliation but wild-type levels of twitching suggests that the remaining pilus structures must exhibit increased dynamics, thereby compensating for their reduced numbers. An alternative explanation would be that only a fraction of pili present on wild-type cells contributes to twitching motility. The N1Δβ3αβ4, ΔN2, and ΔN4 mutants were impaired in twitching motility and showed only 34%, 34%, and 21% of wild-type motility, respectively (Fig. 7B). An even stronger effect was ex"

The units of genetic information contained in mRNA codons need to be precisely translated at the ribosome into corresponding amino acid sequences in proteins. Because protein function is dictated by structure and, thus, amino acid sequence, mistakes in translation of the genetic code can yield drastic alterations in the properties of products of mistranslation. Quality control mechanisms exist that help maintain translation fidelity, limiting mistranslation to one mistake in 103-104 codons under normal growth conditions (1Loftfield R.B. Vanderjagt D. The frequency of errors in protein biosynthesis.Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) 2The abbreviations used are: aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseaa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAl-DOPA3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanineEcPheRSE. coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetaseSccytoPheRSS. cerevisiae cytoplasmic PheRS. enzymes, which pair amino acids and tRNAs for participation as substrates in protein synthesis, are among the primary determinants of translational fidelity. In the event that a non-cognate amino acid or tRNA is utilized as an aaRS substrate, the resulting mispaired aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) species may lead to an error in decoding at the ribosome, resulting in mistranslation of the genetic code. To limit these errors, aaRS enzymes have evolved strict quality control mechanisms, which typically confer high substrate specificity and contribute to an estimated rate of mispaired aa-tRNA production limited to roughly 1 per 3000 aa-tRNAs produced (2Loftfield R.B.

The active sites of these editing domains serve to recognize misacylated tRNA species and hydrolyze mispaired aa-tRNA ester linkages. aaRSs also rely heavily on substrate discrimination in the synthetic active site.

Translational fidelity mediated by aaRS enzymes can be a context-dependent phenomenon. In particular, a shift in the abundance of an aaRS cognate or non-cognate substrate may result in unusually high misacylation of tRNAs. Illustrative of this effect is the observation that Chinese hamster ovary cells starved for tyrosine exhibit a high degree of mistranslation of Tyr codons as Phe (9Raina M. Moghal A. Kano A.

Rather than relying on editing activity, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits high kinetic discrimination between Tyr and Phe at the amino acid activation step. In an environment depleted for its cognate Tyr, an unusually high degree of near-cognate Phe utilization by TyrRS and mistranslation of Tyr codons as Phe are observed. Oxidative stress also plays an important role in non-cognate aa-tRNA synthesis either by generating non-protein amino acids, which must then be proofread (10Bullwinkle T. Reynolds N.M. Raina M.

For example, Phe may be oxidatively converted to one of several derivatives. Among these are the proteinogenic amino acid p-Tyr and the non-protein amino acids 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA), ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr), and meta-tyrosine (m-Tyr) (Fig. 1). Of these, only m-Tyr is a threat to translational fidelity in an Escherichia coli (E. coli) phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (EcPheRS) mutant strain defective in post-transfer editing activity (10Bullwinkle T.

Oxidation of cellular amino acid pools leads to cytotoxic mistranslation of the genetic code.Elife. 2014; (10.7554/eLife.02501)PubMed Google Scholar). The post-transfer editing activity of the wild-type enzyme can hydrolyze m-Tyr-tRNAPhe species that are synthesized as m-Tyr accumulates under conditions of oxidative stress. p-Tyr, which is present at levels necessary for typical protein synthesis under normal conditions, is the most obvious candidate as a non-cognate threat to PheRS product specificity; surprisingly, p-Tyr presents no such challenge to EcPheRS. Without wild-type EcPheRS post-transfer editing activity, E. coli grows as well as wild type, even when challenged with an excess of p-Tyr. Kinetic analysis revealed a high degree of EcPheRS discrimination in the amino acid activation step against p-Tyr but not m-Tyr. Taken together, these observations show that normal EcPheRS editing activity is critical, not under typical growth conditions, but to protect E. coli from cytotoxic mistranslation of Phe codons in conditions that favor intracellular accumulation of m-Tyr (10Bullwinkle T.

In contrast to the E. coli enzyme, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic PheRS (SccytoPheRS) exhibits poor discrimination in the amino acid activation step against p-Tyr (∼20-fold lower than EcPheRS), but p-Tyr-tRNAPhe production is limited by post-transfer editing (10Bullwinkle T.

As with EcPheRS, SccytoPheRS post-transfer editing of m-Tyr-tRNAPhe limits cytotoxicity of m-Tyr. Here, we show unexpected phenotypic effects of direct media supplementation of S. cerevisiae with cognate Phe, proteinogenic non-cognate Ala, and non-protein oxidized Phe derivatives in a SccytoPheRS post-transfer quality control mutant. We highlight striking differences in the promiscuity of the yeast and bacterial enzymes for non-protein amino acids and discuss multiple strategies employed by SccytoPheRS to maintain product specificity in the face of conditional threats to translational quality control in a biological context. We previously constructed a βD243A SccytoPheRS strain with defective post-transfer editing activity (frs1−1), and a wild-type strain constructed from this background, which we refer to as wild type throughout this manuscript (13Reynolds N.M.

Wild type and frs1−1 S. cerevisiae stain were grown in the presence of varying levels of supplemented amino acids as indicated at 30 °C in a 96-well microplate format (xMarkTM Microplate Absorbance Spectrophotometer, Bio-Rad), and optical density at 600 nm was measured at 30-min intervals after brief agitation. To characterize growth under oxidative stress conditions, wild-type and frs1−1 S. cerevisiae strain were grown in minimal media. 50-ml cultures were prepared in triplicate for each condition, and shaken at 240 rpm, 30 °C. Optical density at 600 nm was measured at various time points. Oxidative stress cultures contained 2.0 mm paraquat (methyl viologen dichloride, Sigma). 10-ml samples of exponentially growing culture were passed over Whatman® Protran® BA85 nitrocellulose filter membranes, washed with 10 ml of water, and stored at −80 °C for processing and analysis of intracellular amino acid abundance. Frozen cell pellets were processed for analysis as previously described (10Bullwinkle T. Reynolds N.M. Raina M. Moghal A.B. Matsa E. Rajkovic A. Kayadibi H. Fazlollahi F. Ryan C. Howitz N. Faull K.F.

Briefly, a mixture of 13C internal standards for Phe, p-Tyr, and l-DOPA were added to each cell pellet before extraction in −20 °C extraction buffer (40% methanol, 40% acetonitrile, 20% water). Solutions were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and vacuum-dried. Dried samples were re-dissolved in solvent A (water/formic acid, 100/0.1, v/v; 50 μl) and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was transferred to LC injector vials. Aliquots of the supernatant (typically 4 μl) were injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Phenomenex Kinetex C18, 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7-μm particle size, 100 Å pore size) equilibrated in solvent A and isocratically eluted (100 μl/m). The effluent from the column was directly connected to an electrospray ion source (Agilent Jet Stream) attached to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6460) scanning in the positive multiple reaction monitoring mode with standard resolution settings (FWHM 0.7) using previously optimized conditions for the following transitions: l-DOPA, 198 → 181, 198 → 152; l-[U-13C6]DOPA, 204 → 187, 204 → 152; p-Tyr, 182 → 136; p[U-13C9]Tyr, 191 → 144; Phe, 166 → 120; [U-13C9]Phe, 175 → 128. With each batch of samples a series of standards was simultaneously prepared with the same amount of internal standards and increasing amounts of l-DOPA, m-Tyr and o-Tyr (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 pmol), p-Tyr (0, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 nmol), and Phe (0, 1.5, 3.75, 7.5, and 15 nmol) in duplicate. Typical retention times for l-DOPA, p-Tyr, m-Tyr, o-Tyr, and Phe were 7.3, 10.8, 13.5, 18.1, and 20.6 min, respectively. Peak areas were measured using instrument manufacturer supplied software (Agilent MassHunter). The amount of each analyte in each sample was determined by interpolation from the curves constructed from the standard samples (peak area l-DOPA, p-Tyr, or Phe/peak area l-[U-13C6]DOPA, p-[U-13C9]Tyr, or p-[U-13C9]Phe against the amount of l-DOPA, p-Tyr, or Phe in each standard sample). The accuracy of kinetic analyses of non-cognate amino acid substrates for enzyme specificity determination depends on the degree of cognate amino acid contamination (14Cvetesic N. Palencia A. Halasz I. Cusack S. Gruic-Sovulj I. The physiological target for LeuRS translational quality control is norvaline.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1639-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we purified p-Tyr, dl-o-Tyr, and l-DOPA before their use for kinetic analyses. p-Tyr (Regis Chemical Co.) was purified by recrystallization from a minimal volume of boiling water as previously described (15Faull K.F. Gan I. Halpern B. Hammond J. Im S. Cotton R.G. Danks D.M. Freeman R. Metabolic studies on two patients with nonhepatic tyrosinemia using deuterated tyrosine loads.Pediatr.

Fractions 27, 28, and 29 each had a signal for o-Tyr (retention time (rt) 24.5 min; 3, 4, and 1 × 108 area counts in the m/z 182 extracted ion chromatograms (EIC), respectively) with no detectable signals for either p-Tyr (rt 16.7 min; m/z EIC 182), m-Tyr (rt 18.4 min; m/z EIC 182), or Phe (rt 24.2 min; m/z EIC 166). With limits of detection for p-Tyr, m-Tyr, and Phe estimated to be below 3.6, 4.5, and 1.4 × 104 area counts, respectively, fractions 27–29 appeared to contain <1 part in 104 of either p-Tyr, m-Tyr, or Phe. Fractions 27–29 were pooled, lyophilized to dryness, weighed (4 mg) and used for the experiments described below. l-DOPA (Sigma) was purified in an identical manner using the same semi-preparative column after it had been thoroughly washed to remove traces of residual analytes. Fractions containing the 280-nm peak of absorption eluting between 11 and 14 min were screened by LC/MS as described above. Fractions 23–28 contained a large peak for l-DOPA with no detectable amount of p-Tyr, m-Tyr, o-Tyr or Phe. These fractions were pooled, lyophilized to dryness (7.2 mg), and used for the experiments described below. His6-tagged wild type and post-transfer editing-defective SccytoPheRS were purified from previously constructed strains (16Roy H. Ling J. Alfonzo J. Ibba M.

Wild-type SccytoPheRS (5 nm for Phe and dl-o-Tyr, 500 nm for l-DOPA) catalyzed the activation of a given amino acid substrate (25–1000 μm Phe, 100–3000 μm dl-o-Tyr, or 200–1000 μm l-DOPA) in a reaction mix containing 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm [32P]PPi (∼1–2 cpm/pmol). The reaction was quenched in a solution containing 1% activated charcoal in 5.6% HClO4 and 75 mm PPi, which was then filtered through Whatman No. 3MM filter discs and washed with water. Negative control values (no enzyme present) were subtracted to account for retained PPi. The velocity of [32P]ATP formation as a function of substrate concentration was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression. As a practical consideration, l-DOPA Vmax was not observable. kcat and Km are thus not reported individually for l-DOPA. Δ(v/E)/Δ[l-DOPA] in a linear range was used as a measure of kcat/Km with l-DOPA. Transcription of tRNAPheΔA76 in vitro, tRNAPhe ΔA76 radiolabeling with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, and analysis of the relative efficiency of aminoacylation of tRNAPhe by PheRS were carried out as reported previously (10Bullwinkle T. Reynolds N.M. Raina M. Moghal A.B. Matsa E. Rajkovic A. Kayadibi H. Fazlollahi F. Ryan C. Howitz N. Faull K.F. Lazazzera B. Ibba M. Oxidation of cellular amino acid pools leads to cytotoxic mistranslation of the genetic code.Elife. 2014; (10.7554/eLife.02501)PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of aa-[32P]AMP and [32P]AMP accumulation over time was used as a measure for the relative efficiency in SccyoPheRS aminoacylation of tRNAPhe with a given amino acid. Analysis of pretransfer editing was carried out as previously described (7Ling J. Peterson K.M. Simonovic I. Söll D. Simonovic M.

Wild-type SccytoPheRS-catalyzed rates of [α-32P]AMP and aa-[α-32P]AMP synthesis were compared. Reactions contained 1 μm SccytoPheRS, 2 mm dl-o-Tyr, 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm ATP, 10 μm natively purified tRNAPhe (Sigma), and 0.5 μm [α-32P]ATP. Matched no-enzyme control values were subtracted to account for spontaneous hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP. 1-μl samples of the reaction mix were quenched at various time points with 1.5 μl of 0.5 mm NaOAc (pH 4.2). 1.5 μl of quenched reactions at various time points were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with water. Products were resolved in a mobile phase consisting of 100 mm ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid. Spots corresponding to o-Tyr-[α-32P]AMP and free [α-32P]AMP were visualized as described previously (10Bullwinkle T. Reynolds N.M. Raina M. Moghal A.B. Matsa E. Rajkovic A. Kayadibi H. Fazlollahi F.

Modulation of tRNAAla identity by inorganic pyrophosphatase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The rate of o-Tyr transfer from o-Tyr-AMP to tRNAPhe was determined with a quench flow RQF-3 KinTek instrument as before (19Yadavalli S.S. Ibba M. Selection of tRNA charging quality control mechanisms that increase mistranslation of the genetic code.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with modifications based on unavailability of o-[14C]Tyr. Because we expected o-Tyr-AMP·PheRS complex instability, o-Tyr activation was carried out in situ. Syringe A contained 4 mm ATP, 5 μm post-transfer editing ablated SccytoPhers, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and either 2 mm dl-o-Tyr, 1 mm p-Tyr, or 1 mm Phe. Syringe B contained 1.5 μm [32P]tRNAPhe, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C and quenched with 0.5 m NaOAc. An equal volume of quenched reaction mix and 1:10 diluted S1 were mixed, and the S1 nuclease reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. 1.5 μl of each time point was spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose and developed as detailed above. aa-tRNA formation over time was fitted to the single-exponential equation [aa-tRNA] = C + A (1 − ektrans×t). o-Tyr-AMP was synthesized under aminoacylation reaction conditions described above in the absence of tRNAPhe using [α-32P]ATP. o-Tyr-AMP was then purified after 15 min via standard acidic phenol-chloroform extraction techniques. The stability of ∼14 μm o-Tyr-AMP under reaction conditions in the absence of enzyme was observed by TLC separation, as above. After our observations that PheRS post-transfer editing activity is required to protect E. coli from m-Tyr, we examined the role that post-transfer editing activity plays in a eukaryotic species, S. cerevisiae. Having previously demonstrated that p-Tyr and m-Tyr are more toxic to a cytosolic SccytoPheRS post-transfer editing mutant strain (frs1−1) (10Bullwinkle T. Reynolds N.M. Raina M. Moghal A.B. Matsa E. Rajkovic A. Kayadibi H. Fazlollahi F. Ryan C. Howitz N. Faull K.F. Lazazzera B. Ibba M. Oxidation of cellular amino acid pools leads to cytotoxic mistranslation of the genetic code.Elife. 2014; (10.7554/eLife.02501)PubMed Google Scholar), we examined a possible protective effect of editing in the presence of oxidative stress. Methyl viologen (paraquat) is used as a surrogate for oxidative stress, as it exacerbates electron transport leakage from the mitochondrion and single-hydrogen reduction of molecular oxygen. We found that SccytoPheRS post-transfer editing activity limited the toxicity of paraquat (Fig. 2), suggesting a similar protective role of PheRS post-transfer editing in both bacteria and eukarya under oxidative stress. To test if the protective role that SccytoPheRS post-transfer editing plays in S. cerevisiae is due to a decrease in the availability of intracellular Phe, accumulation of non-cognate PheRS substrates, or some indirect effect, we extracted soluble intracellular metabolites from exponentially growing S. cerevisiae grown in minimal media and examined by LC-MS/MS the relative molar abundance of putative SccytoPheRS substrates (Fig. 3). There are 20 possible hydroxylation states of the phenyl ring of Phe; here, we show the detectable intracellular accumulation of five of them: Phe, p-Tyr, o-Tyr, m-Tyr, and l-DOPA. 2.0 mm paraquat induced the accumulation not only of some oxidized derivatives of Phe but also a doubling of Phe itself. This may represent a sensing mechanism whereby S. cerevisiae compensates for oxidation of its Phe pool by overproducing Phe. Proteinogenic p-Tyr accumulates 5–6-fold under oxidative stress and may do so as a result of a combination of Phe oxidation and programmed biosynthesis. Notably, there is no known hydroxylase in S. cerevisiae that can convert Phe to p-Tyr. o-Tyr accumulates 6–7-fold under oxidative stress, and m-Tyr increases by 2-fold. l-DOPA, which is undetectable in unstressed S. cerevisiae, accumulates to 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than o-Tyr or m-Tyr, which may represent oxidation of intracellular p-Tyr as well as Phe. We also observed that unstressed S. cerevisiae grown in rich media contain levels of l-DOPA similar to those in stressed cultures (not shown). This suggests a degree of l-DOPA contamination in rich media components and subsequent cellular uptake. Because commercial yeast extracts and peptones are undefined and may become oxidized over time, the degree of non-protein amino acid contamination is a challenge to interpretation of results with such undefi"
https://openalex.org/W2356360275,"Chitoporin from the chitinolytic marine Vibrio has been characterized as a trimeric OmpC-like channel responsible for effective chitin uptake. In this study we describe the identification and characterization of a novel OprD-like chitoporin (so-called EcChiP) from Escherichia coli. The gene was identified, cloned, and functionally expressed in the Omp-deficient E. coli BL21 (Omp8) Rosetta strain. On size exclusion chromatography, EcChiP had an apparent native molecular mass of 50 kDa, as predicted by amino acid sequencing and mass analysis, confirming that the protein is a monomer. Black lipid membrane reconstitution demonstrated that EcChiP could readily form stable, monomeric channels in artificial phospholipid membranes, with an average single channel conductance of 0.55 ± 0.01 nanosiemens and a slight preference for cations. Single EcChiP channels showed strong specificity, interacting with long chain chitooligosaccharides but not with maltooligosaccharides. Liposome swelling assays indicated the bulk permeation of neutral monosaccharides and showed the size exclusion limit of EcChiP to be ∼200–300 Da for small permeants that pass through by general diffusion while allowing long chain chitooligosaccharides to pass through by a facilitated diffusion process. Taking E. coli as a model, we offer the first evidence that non-chitinolytic bacteria can activate a quiescent ChiP gene to express a functional chitoporin, enabling them to take up chitooligosaccharides for metabolism as an immediate source of energy.

Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative, heterotrophic bacterium that lives in open environments, such as soil, manure, and water, but the persistence of E. coli populations depends upon the availability of carbon substrates in each natural environment. E. coli usually grows on glucose-enriched nutrients such as starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose (1Kim B.H. Gadd G.M. Bacterial Physiology and Metabolism. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York2008Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) but not on chitin polysaccharides as it intrinsically lacks competent chitin-utilization machinery (2Francetic O.

Deciphering key features in protein structures with the new ENDscript server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W320-W324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) according to the three-dimensional structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprD (pdb 2odj). The nucleotide sequence encoding chitoporin was identified in the E. coli strain K-12 substrain MG1655 chromosome in the NCBI database (gi 49175990), and the ChiP gene was commercially synthesized using the GenScript Gene Synthesis Service. The ChiP DNA fragment ligated in the pUC57 cloning vector was excised and then transferred into the pET23d(+) expression vector using the NcoI and XhoI cloning sites so that the ChiP gene could be expressed under the control of the T7 promoter. The oligonucleotides used for colony detection of the ChiP PCR product were 5′-ATACCATGGCCATGCGTACGTTTAGT-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-AACCTCGAGTCAGAAGATGGTGAA-3′ for the reverse primer (sequences underlined indicate the restriction sites). Nucleotide sequences of sense and antisense strands of the PCR fragment were determined by automated sequencing (First BASE Laboratories SdnBhd, Selangor DarulEhsan, Malaysia). Expression and purification of the recombinant EcChiP were carried out as previously described (8Suginta W. Chumjan W. Mahendran K.R. Schulte A. Winterhalter M. Chitoporin from Vibrio harveyi, a channel with exceptional sugar specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 11038-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression vector pET23d(+), harboring the full-length ChiP gene, was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Omp8 Rosetta strain, which lacks major endogenous Omps, including OmpF, OmpC, OmpA, and LamB. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin and 25 μg·ml−1 kanamycin. During the exponential growth phase (A600 ∼ 0.6–0.8), EcChiP expression was induced with 0.5 mm final concentration of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG). After 6 h of additional incubation at 37 °C, the cell pellet was harvested by centrifugation at 2,948 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For protein purification, the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) containing 10 μg·ml−1 RNase A and 10 μg·ml−1 DNase I. Cells were disrupted with a high speed ultrasonic processor (EmulsiFlex-C3, Avestin Europe, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min. After this, 20% (w/v) SDS solution was added to obtain a final concentration of 2%, and the suspension was further incubated at 50 °C for 60 min with 300 rpm shaking to ensure complete lysis. Cell wall components were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellet, containing recombinant EcChiP, was extracted twice with 2.5% (v/v) n-octylpolyoxyethylene (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausanne, Switzerland) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again. The supernatant was then dialyzed thoroughly against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (v/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide (Sigma). To obtain protein of high purity, the solubilized EcChiP was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography using a Hitrap Q HP prepacked column (5 × 1 ml) connected to an ÄKTA Prime plus FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% (v/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide. The purity of the eluted fractions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing EcChiP were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 high resolution column. The purity of the EcChiP fractions obtained after the size exclusion step was verified by SDS-PAGE before they were pooled, and the protein concentration of the freshly prepared EcChiP was estimated using the Novagen BCA protein assay kit (EMD Chemicals Inc., San Diego, CA). The purified EcChiP was electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and the EcChiP bands were excised and sent to BGI Tech Solutions (HongKong) Co. Ltd. for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Briefly, protein in the gel was digested with trypsin and eluted to obtain a peptide mixture, then MALDI-TOF mass spectrographic analysis was performed, and the obtained peptide masses were identified using Mascot software v2.3.02. Standard proteins and dyes of known molecular weight were resolved on a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR column. Dextran-2000 was used to obtain the void volume (V0), whereas DNP-lysine was used to calculate the volume of the stationary phase (Vi) and the elution volume of each protein sample, denoted as Ve. The elution of a protein sample was characterized by the distribution coefficient (Kd) derived as in Equation 1, A calibration curve was created by plotting Kd versus logarithmic values of the corresponding molecular weights of the standard proteins and was used to estimate the molecular weight of EcChiP. The standard proteins used in this experiment were ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (250 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Black lipid membrane (BLM) reconstitution was carried out in electrolyte containing 1 m KCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at room temperature (25 °C). Solvent-free bilayer (Montal-Mueller type) formation was performed using 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). First, the aperture was prepainted with a few microliters of 1% (v/v) hexadecane in hexane, then a planar bilayer was formed across the aperture by lowering and raising the liquid level (23Montal M. Mueller P. Formation of bimolecular membranes from lipid monolayers and a study of their electrical properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Ionic currents were detected using Ag+/AgCl electrodes with a patch-clamp amplifier connected to a two-electrode bilayer head-stage (PC-ONE plus PC-ONE-50; Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The BLM setup was operated within a Faraday cage on a vibration-dampening table with an A/D converter (LIH 1600, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) and was operated using the software PULSE program (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). One of the electrodes, immersed in 1 m KCl electrolyte on the cis side of the cuvette, was connected to ground, whereas the electrode on the trans side was connected to the amplifier head-stage. EcChiP was always added to the cis side of the cuvette. Conductance values were extracted from the current steps observed at different voltages after the addition of the protein. The ion selectivity of EcChiP was determined using different salt solutions, such as 1 m lithium chloride (LiCl), 1 m cesium chloride (CsCl), and 1 m potassium acetate (KAc). To investigate sugar translocation, single EcChiP channels were reconstituted in the artificial lipid membrane as described earlier. To prevent multiple insertions during data acquisition, the protein solution in the chamber was gently diluted after the first insertion by sequential additions of the working electrolyte. Then the fully open EcChiP channel was titrated with distinct concentrations of different chitooligosaccharides: chitobiose (GlcNAc2), chitotriose (GlcNAc3), chitotetraose (GlcNAc4), chitopentaose (GlcNAc5) and chitohexaose (GlcNAc6). Each sugar was added to the cis side of the chamber. Fluctuations of ion flow were observed as a result of sugar diffusion through the reconstituted channel and were usually recorded for 2 min at different transmembrane potentials. To test the substrate specificity of the channel toward chitooligosaccharides, maltodextrin sugars were used as controls. The EcChiP- and VhChiP-reconstituted proteoliposomes were prepared as described elsewhere (24Yoshimura F. Nikaido H.

Schulte A. Winterhalter M. Suginta W. Porin involvement in cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance of Burkholderia pseudomallei.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e95918Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine (20 mg/ml, freshly prepared in chloroform) (Sigma) was used to form multilamellar liposomes. For the preparation of proteoliposomes, 200 ng of EcChiP was reconstituted into 200 μl of the liposome suspension by sonication, and then 17% (w/v) dextran (40kDa) was entrapped in the proteoliposomes. d-Raffinose solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer to obtain concentrations of 40, 50, 60, and 70 mm for determination of the isotonic solute concentration. This value was then used for the adjustment of the isotonic concentration for other solutes. To carry out a liposome-swelling assay, 25 μl of the proteoliposome suspension was added to 600 μl of sugar solution, and changes in absorbance at 500 nm were monitored immediately. The apparent absorbance change over the first 60 s was used to estimate the swelling rate (s−1) following the equation ϕ = (1/Ai)dA/dt in which ϕ is the swelling rate, Ai is the initial absorbance, and dA/dt is the rate of absorbance change during the first 60 s. The swelling rate for each sugar was normalized by setting the rate of l-arabinose (150 Da), the smallest sugar, to 100%. The values presented are averages from three to five independent determinations. Protein-free liposomes and proteoliposomes without sugars were used as negative controls. The sugars tested were d-glucose (180 Da), d-mannose (180 Da), d-galactose (180 Da), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (221 Da), d-sucrose (342 Da), d-melezitose (522 Da), GlcNAc2 (424 Da), GlcNAc3 (628 Da), GlcNAc4 (830 Da), GlcNAc5 (1034 Da), GlcNAc6 (1237 Da), and maltodextrins. The availability of the nucleotide sequence in the genome of E. coli strain K-12 sub-strain MG1655, (complete genome NCBI reference sequence; NC_000913) allowed the putative amino acid sequence of E. coli ChiP (so-called EcChiP) to be identified. The full-length ChiP gene corresponding to EcChiP was synthesized commercially, for which the target gene was ligated into the NcoI and XhoI cloning sites of the pUC57 cloning vector (GenScript). The nucleotide sequence of the ChiP gene, comprising 1407 bps, was translated to a putative polypeptide of 468 amino acids, including the 26-amino acid signal sequence. The theoretical mass of the full-length EcChiP was 52,780 Da, with a predicted isoelectric point of 4.70. Amino acid sequence comparison of EcChiP with other bacterial ChiPs in the SwissProt/UniProtKB database is presented in Fig. 1. The putative sequence of EcChiP showed highest sequence identity to Salmonella typhimurium ChiP (Q7CQY4) (90%) (18Figueroa-Bossi N. Valentini M. Malleret L. Fiorini F. Bossi L.

Amino acid residues located within the pore interior, such as Trp-138, Asp-314, Arg-320, and Tyr-421, are predicted to be crucial for sugar transport (residues marked as sticks in Fig. 2B, top view). The predicted transmembrane topology for EcChiP is shown in Fig. 2C.

When the transformed cells were grown to exponential phase, expression of the recombinant EcChiP was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for a period of 6h at 37 °C. Fig. 3A shows SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates of the Omp-deficient E. coli expressing EcChiP. When compared with cells transformed with the empty vector (lane 1, no induction; and lane 2, IPTG induction), uninduced cells transformed with the pET23d(+)/ChiP vector did not produce the heterologous protein (lane 3), whereas a prominent band of the expected size (50 kDa) appeared on induction with IPTG (lane 4). These results confirmed successful production of EcChiP in the selected host cells. For purification of EcChiP, the induced cells were subjected to a two-step detergent extraction. In the first step using 2% (w/v) SDS, most of EcChiP remained in the insoluble fraction, and in the second step EcChiP was solubilized with 2.5% (v/v) n-octylpolyoxyethylene.

We investigated actin remodeling induced by histamine together with mDCs phenotype, cytokine production, and the stimulatory and polarizing ability of Th0.

Recently, we found that Elmo2 specifically interacts with ClipR-59. Because Akt and Rac1 have been implicated in insulin dependent Glut4 membrane translocation, we hypothesize here that Elmo2 may play a role in insulin-dependent Glut4 membrane translocation. Accordingly, we found that overexpression of Elmo2 enhanced, whereas its knockdown suppressed, insulin-dependent Glut4 membrane translocation in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 skeletal muscle cells. We also examined whether Elmo2 contributes to the insulin-mediated activation of Rac1 and Akt. We found that Elmo2 is required for insulin-induced Rac1 GTP loading, but not AKT activation, in L6 cells induced by insulin. Instead, Elmo2 is required to promote the insulin-induced membrane association of Akt. Together, our studies demonstrate that Elmo2 is a new regulator of insulin-dependent Glut4 membrane translocation through modulating Rac1 activity and Akt membrane compartmentalization."
https://openalex.org/W2391179902,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) plays a critical role in the destruction of terminally misfolded proteins at the secretory pathway. The system also regulates expression levels of several proteins such as Pca1p, a cadmium exporter in yeast. To gain better insight into the mechanisms underlying ERAD of Pca1p and other polytopic proteins by the proteasome in the cytosol, our study determined the roles for the molecular factors of ERAD in dislodging Pca1p from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inactivation of the 20S proteasome leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated Pca1p in the ER membrane, suggesting a role for the proteasome in extraction of Pca1p from the ER. Pca1p formed a complex with the proteasome at the membrane in a Doa10p E3 ligase-dependent manner. Cdc48p is required for recruiting the proteasome to Pca1p. Although the Ufd2p E4 ubiquitin chain extension enzyme is involved in efficient degradation of Pca1p, Ufd2p-deficient cells did not affect the formation of a complex between Pca1p and the proteasome. Two other polytopic membrane proteins undergoing ERAD, Ste6*p and Hmg2p, also displayed the same outcomes observed for Pca1p. However, poly-ubiquitinated Cpy1*p, a luminal ERAD substrate, was detected in the cytosol independent of proteolytic activities of the proteasome. These results indicate that extraction and degradation of polytopic membrane proteins at the ER is a coupled event. This mechanism would relieve the cost of exposed hydrophobic domains in the cytosol during ERAD."

An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mature IL-1α recognized IL-1α and pINS but failed to detect mature INS and IL-1β. Analysis of the pINS sequence revealed the existence of an INS/IL-1α motif in the C-peptide of pINS. Surprisingly, the INS/IL-1α motif was recognized by monoclonal antibody raised against IL-1α. Deleting the INS/IL-1α motif in pINSd and IL-1α changed their activities. To investigate the pINSd receptor, the reconstitution of IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) in Wish cells restored pINSd activity that was reversed by an IL-1R antagonist. These data suggested that pINSd needs IL-1R1 for inflammatory cytokine induction. Mouse embryo fibroblast cells of IL-1R1-deficient mice further confirmed that pINSd promotes immune responses through IL-1R1. Although it has been established that diabetes increases susceptibility to infections, the role of insulin (INS) in the immune response is unknown. Here, we investigated the immunological function of INS. Proinsulin dimer (pINSd) was a potent immune stimulus that induced inflammatory cytokines, but mature INS was unable to induce an immune response. An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mature IL-1α recognized IL-1α and pINS but failed to detect mature INS and IL-1β.

A dog pancreatic hormone has been shown to be essential for metabolizing carbohydrates and the successful treatment of diabetes (1Banting F.G. Campbell W.R. Fletcher A.A.

Among the 11 cytokines in the interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokine, except IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), 10 have no signal peptide. The signal peptide in IL-1Ra allows the cell to release IL-1Ra as an active molecule without processing (6Dinarello C.A. Immunological and inflammatory functions of the interleukin-1 family.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). IL-1α and IL-1β are essential members of the IL-1 cytokine family, having important roles as immune sentinels early in infections. However, IL-1Ra is a natural antagonist to block IL-1α and IL-1β activity by its competition for binding to IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and suppresses the immune response (7Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Primary structure and functional expression from complementary DNA of a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Nine members of the IL-1R family, except IL-1R8, have three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular domain. The IL-1R family has crucial roles in innate and acquired immune responses against infections because IL-1R family shares a conserved functional domain with Toll-like receptor. The intracellular domain of the IL-1R family contains a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domain that interacts with adaptor molecules for downstream signal pathways, whereas IL-1R2 is a decoy receptor due to the lack of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain in its short intracellular domain (8Garlanda C.

It has been established that IL-1α and IL-1β use identical receptor components, IL-1R1 and IL-1R3, to transmit signaling (9Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G.

A decreased proliferative response to different stimuli has been observed in the lymphocytes of diabetic patients in comparison with that of non-diabetic normal control individuals (11Casey J.I.

For instance, the different types of primary immune cells from diabetic patients have been studied in the presence or absence of stimuli. Without stimulation, the levels of TNFα in type 1 diabetics, IL-6 in type 2 diabetics, and IL-8 in both types of diabetics were increased compared with nondiabetic controls (15Myśliwska J. Zorena K.

IL-1α/β and IL-6 secretion from PBMCs and monocytes in the presence of LPS stimulation was reduced in both types of diabetics (18Mooradian A.D. Reed R.L. Meredith K.E. Scuderi P. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor and IL-1α and IL-1β in diabetic patients.Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but there were no differences in TNFα concentrations after stimulation with LPS when comparing monocytes of type 2 diabetics with nondiabetic controls (19Ohno Y.

Various studies have suggested that binding of advanced glycation end products to nondiabetic cells in the absence of stimulation leads to increased cytokine production (20Imani F. Horii Y.

The present study provides insight into hitherto unknown immunological functions of proinsulin dimer (pINSd): its ability to induce immune responses through IL-1R1. We expressed recombinant INS to investigate its role in the immune response. Two distinct molecular sizes of proinsulin monomer (pINSm) and pINSd were observed by silver staining (not shown). We used each fraction to stimulate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Huvecs). Prominent induction of IL-6 was observed where pINSd fractions appeared (not shown). Therefore, the pINSm and pINSd fractions were pooled and confirmed the purity by silver staining as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The pINSm and pINSd including a mature commercial INS (comINS) were used to stimulate various cell types. The pINSd was highly effective in inducing IL-6, whereas the pINSm and comINS remained ineffective (Fig. 1, C–G). Huvecs and PBMCs were shown to have a very high response to pINSd compared with other cell types. The pINSd and IL-1α stimulation also induced IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α in the primary cells but not in A549 and Huvecs (not shown). Because IL-6 production was most reliable across different immune and non-immune cell types, we chose to monitor IL-6 regulation by pINSd. The pINSd-mediated inflammatory cytokine production in various cell types precisely overlapped with IL-1α activity but not with IL-1β activity (not shown). For instance, although activity levels varied across different cell types, pINSd and IL-1α were active in all cell types. Next, we were interested in investigating how the activity of pINSd in different cells corresponded with IL-1α activity but not with IL-1β. Intriguingly, IL-6 production by pINSd in A549 cells increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), whereas IL-1α levels decreased with prolonged incubation time (Fig. 2B). We used an IL-1α ELISA to detect IL-1α levels in the A549 cell culture supernatant. The IL-1α ELISA kit was developed with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against mature IL-1α as a capture antibody and an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the same antigen as a detection antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then performed Western blotting with the supernatant of pINSd-treated A549 cells by using the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody. The polyclonal antibody detected the bands of the dimer and hexamer forms in the pINSd-treated A549 cells but not in those cells treated with comINS (Fig. 2C). We compared the results of our IL-1α ELISA with the results from a commercial IL-1α ELISA kit. Surprisingly, our IL-1α ELISA detected pINSd, whereas the commercial kit failed to detect pINSd (Fig. 3A). An additional experiment in which trypsin was used to degrade pINSd prior to immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) suggested that the added recombinant pINSd is responsible for IL-6 induction in the A549 cell assay because trypsin dramatically abolished its activity (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Identification of INS/IL-1α motif. A, anti-IL-1α mAb ELISA detected pINSd but failed to recognize comINS, which is mature INS lacking the C-peptide. A commercial IL-1α ELISA kit did not recognize pINSd. B, pINSd was incubated for 60 min in the presence or absence of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). pINSd (100 ng/lane loaded) was properly detected as a band of ∼30 kDa, but pINSd was not observed where trypsin was added. C, the same batch of pINSd in the presence or absence of trypsin was examined for IL-6 induction in A549 cells. The production of IL-6 was found to be due to pINSd because trypsin abolished IL-6 production. D, sequence analysis of pINS and IL-1α revealed the INS/IL-1α motif.

Cont, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results illustrate that IL-1α likely shares an epitope with pINS that is recognized by the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against IL-1α but not with mature comINS (Fig. 3A). A careful sequence analysis of pINS and IL-1α revealed an INS/IL-1α motif of 7 amino acid residues, VELGGGP, with 71.4% identity in the C-peptide of pINS (Fig. 3D). Alternatively, a dot blotting experiment demonstrated that the mAb anti-IL-1α recognized pINSd but failed to recognize mature comINS (Fig. 3E) because the INS/IL-1α motif in C-peptide does not exist in the mature comINS. The rabbit polyclonal antibody has preferential reactivity with hexamer rather than dimer because detection sensitivity of the faint hexamer band was similar to the thick dimer band (Fig. 4A). Mature INS is composed of two polypeptide chains, β chain and α chain, but lacks the C-peptide. To verify whether the INS/IL-1α motif is an anti-IL-1α mAb epitope in the C-peptide, VELGGGP in pINS was deleted using mutagenesis (28Kim S.H. Azam T. Yoon D.Y. Reznikov L.L. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Site-specific mutations in the mature form of human IL-18 with enhanced biological activity and decreased neutralization by IL-18 binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant pINSd wild type (WT) and pINSd/C1 were expressed and purified (Fig. 4A). We examined whether mAb anti-IL-1α recognizes the INS/IL-1α motif by using the pINSd/C1 mutant. As expected, mAb anti-IL-1α recognized the INS/IL-1α motif in the C-peptide of pINSd, and the motif was found to be a critical epitope for mAb anti-IL-1α (Fig. 4C). The INS/IL-1α motif at the C terminus of IL-1α (not shown) was also deleted in the same manner as the motif in pINSd/C1 was deleted. Recombinant IL-1α/WT and /C1 were expressed and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as shown in Fig. 4B. IL-1α/WT and /C1 were checked with the mAb raised against IL-1α. Consistently, the sensitivity of detection of IL-1α/C1 by the mAb anti-IL-1α was weak compared with IL-1α/WT (Fig. 4D). The mAb anti-IL-1α failed to recognize IL-1β as shown in the bottom row of Fig. 4D because IL-1β does not possess the motif (not shown). Recombinant IL-1α/WT and /C1 were used to stimulate different cell types to examine their activities. IL-1α/C1 completely lost its activity in A549 cells, Huvecs, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes (Fig. 5A, B, and D) but was partially impaired in whole blood cells (WBCs) (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, pINSd/C1 was more effective at enhancing activity compared with pINSd/WT across cell types (Fig. 6, A–D).FIGURE 6Bioassay of the motif-deleted pINSd mutant. A–D, assay of pINSd/WT and /C1. A549 cells (A), Huvecs (B), WBCs (C), and PMN leukocytes (D) were treated with pINSd/WT and /C1.

IL-1Ra is a natural receptor antagonist that binds to IL-1R1 and competes with IL-1α and IL-1β (7Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Primary structure and functional expression from complementary DNA of a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). pINSd-induced IL-6 was completely inhibited by IL-1Ra in A549 cells and Huvecs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, A and B). Next, we reconstituted IL-1R1 in Wish cells to prove the role of IL-1R1 directly in pINSd activity. Our results revealed that Wish cells do not respond to IL-1 because of lacking IL-1R1 expression. 4S. Lee, E. Kim, H. Jhun, J. Hong, A. Kwak, S. Jo, S. Bae, J. Lee, B. Kim, J. Lee, S. Youn, S. Kim, M. Kim, H. Kim, Y. Lee, D.-K. Choi, Y.-S. Kim, and S. Kim, unpublished data. We first stably expressed IL-1R1 and then examined whether Wish/IL-1R1 clones 3 and 18 (C-3 and C-18) restored IL-1a and IL-1b activity by inducing IL-6 product. IL-1α and IL-1β enhanced IL-6 upon reconstitution of IL-1R1, but the mock control remained inactive (not shown). IL-6 was significantly increased in Wish IL-1R1/C-3 and /C-18 after pINSd stimulation, similar to the enhancement of IL-1α and IL-1β activity, but the mock control did not respond to pINSd (not shown). In addition, IL-1R1 expression was not detected in the mock control; however, IL-1R1 expression in Wish/C-3 was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 7C), immunoblotting (Fig. 7D), and FACS analysis (not shown). The dose-dependent pINSd-mediated IL-6 production (Fig. 7E) was reversed by IL-1Ra (Fig. 7F) in Wish/IL-1R1/C-3. We were interested in investigating pINSd-mediated inflammatory cytokine production using MEFs of IL-1R1-deficient mice. We first examined mouse IL-1R1 mRNA expression in the MEFs of WT and IL-1R1-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 8A, IL-1R1 expression was observed in MEFs of WT mice but not in IL-1R1-deficient mice. Similar to the previous results of human cell assays, the pINSd/C1 was approximately two times more active than pINSd/WT in MEFs of WT (Fig. 8, B and C). As shown in Fig. 8, B and C, pINSd/WT- and /C1-mediated mouse IL-6 production was significantly impaired in MEFs of IL-1R1-deficient mice. These data further confirmed that pINSd stimulates IL-1R1 to induce inflammatory cytokines. Finally, the activity of IL-1α/WT, IL-1α/C1, and IL-1β was tested with MEFs of IL-1R1-deficient mice. Similar to the result in Fig. 5, IL-1α/C1 impaired IL-6 production in WT MEFs (Fig. 9B) compared with IL-1α/WT (Fig. 9A). The pattern of IL-1α/WT, IL-1α/C1, and IL-1β activity was similar to that of pINSd (Fig. 8) in the MEFs of IL-1R-deficient mice (Fig. 9).FIGURE 9IL-1α/WT and /C1 activity with MEFs of IL-1R1-deficient mice.

The results of immunological pINSd activities were reproducible with various cell types, and it was found that only pINSd possesses the immunological capability to induce inflammatory cytokines with comINS and pINSm unable to induce them. These data provide direct evidence for the first time that pINS induces an immune response through the induction of inflammatory cytokines. A recent study has provided a rapid test of therapies designed to preserve pancreatic β-cells in type 1 diabetics, but it is hampered due to limited availability of sensitive β-cell health biomarkers (32Watkins R.A. Evans-Molina C. Terrell J.K. Day K.H. Guindon L. Restrepo I.A. Mirmira R.G. Blum J.S. DiMeglio L.A.

In this study, the levels of the proinsulin:C-petide ratio and HSP90 were increased in type I diabetes patients, and HSP90 levels were also increased 4-fold in islets isolated from non-obese prediabetic mice compared with matched CD1 controls. This study suggested that β-cell stress can be measured using proinsulin:C-petide ratios and HSP90 to reduce β-cell stress in new onset type I diabetics. Further studies with diabetic patients are necessary to evaluate the immunological functions of pINSd in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Human mature comINS contains 51 amino acids with A and B chains linked by disulfide bonds, whereas pro-INS contains 86 amino acids before cleavage of the C-peptide between the B and A chains. Prepro-INS contains a hydrophobic 24-residue signal peptide that directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, forming pINS (33Kitabchi A.E. Proinsulin and C-peptide: a review.Metabolism. 1977; 26: 547-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of INS was first characterized (34Sanger F. Tuppy H. The amino-acid sequence in the phenylalanyl chain of insulin. I. The identification of lower peptides from partial hydrolysates.Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 463-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and then its structure was determined by x-ray crystallography (35Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.C. Mercola D.A. Vijayan M. Atomic positions in rhombohedral 2-zinc insulin crystals.Nature. 1971; 231: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The mAb anti-IL-1α recognizing pINSd as well as the overlap in activity between pINSd and IL-1α led us to investigate the sequence homology between pINSd and IL-1α. A careful analysis of the pINS sequence revealed an INS/IL-1α homology motif in the C-peptide. Deletion of the motif changed the biological activities of pINSd and IL-1α, suggesting a critical role of the motif in immunological functions (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). However, further study is necessary to validate the enhancement of pINSd/C1 but not IL-1α/C1, which lost its activity. The existence of the INS/IL-1α motif in pINSd and IL-1α and its absence in IL-1β could account for the unique activity of IL-1α in cellular metabolism associated with cell growth and cancer that diverges from IL-1β activity, which is limited to inflammatory functions (36Bersudsky M.

Using the precise sequence information of INS/IL-1α motif, development of a neutralizing antibody against the ligands and receptors will shed light on the specific role of pINSd and IL-1α in diabetes. IL-1Ra completely abolished IL-1β-induced cytokines in all cells types, whereas in contrast the inhibitory effect of IL-1Ra on pINSd- and IL-1α-mediated cytokines was dependent on cell type. We also used IL-1R1-Fc (not shown) to modulate the activity of pINSd in an in vitro assay, but these Fc receptors were not sufficient to regulate pINSd activity due to the heterodimeric composition of cytokine receptor on cell membranes (9Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. Molecular cloning and characterization of a second subunit of the interleukin 1 receptor complex.J. Biol.

Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of IL-1R2, IL-1R3, and INS receptor in the immunological activity of pINSd, although we have characterized IL-1R1 as a crucial component in pINSd-induced immunological activity. Metabolic regulation of cell proliferation and immune responses against pathogens is requisite for survival of the host. Our discovery of the immunological activity of pINSd suggests for the first time a direct connection between metabolic regulation and the immune response. We obtained human INS cDNA from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and transferred the open reading frame of pINS without the hydrophobic signal peptide of 24 amino acid residues and possessing a His tag at the N terminus into pProEx/HTa (Life Technologies). Human precursor IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1Ra cDNAs were cloned as described (40Hong J. Bae S. Jhun H. Lee S. Choi J. Kang T. Kwak A. Hong K. Kim E. Jo S. Kim S.

Mouse IL-1α and IL-1β cDNAs were isolated from LPS-induced Raw 264.7 cells (not shown) and then transferred to an expression vector. The cDNA of IL-1R1 was cloned from A549 cells and then transferred into mammalian expression vector pCAGGs/Neo4 for Wish cell stable clones. The sequences of the constructed vectors were confirmed by CosmoGen (Seoul, Korea). The cDNAs of the plasmid vector from WT pINS and mature IL-1α were used as templates to generate mutant pINS/C1 as well as IL-1α/C1. We designed specific sense and reverse primers that overlapped with the deletion site and removed the C1 sequence (INS/IL-1α) motif (Fig. 3D) as described (40Hong J. Bae S. Jhun H. Lee S. Choi J. Kang T. Kwak A. Hong K. Kim E. Jo S. Kim S. Identification of constitutively active interleukin 33 (IL-33) splice variant.J. Biol.

The sequences of mutant vectors were confirmed (CosmoGen). pINS/WT and /C1 as well as mature IL-1α/WT and /C1 were expressed in E. coli. We purified the recombinant proteins from the inclusion bodies by lysing with a phosphate buffer for 3 h. The supernatant of the recombinant protein was passed through a mini-Talon column and eluted with imidazole (0.3 m). The eluted fractions were directly applied to HPLC. The peaks of each fraction (A280 nm) were visualized with silver staining (not shown). Human IL-1Ra, mouse IL-1α, and IL-1β were expressed as described (41Kim B. Lee Y. Kim E. Kwak A. Ryoo S. Bae S.H. Azam T. Kim S. Dinarello C.A. The interleukin-1α precursor is biologically active and is likely a key alarmin in the IL-1 family of cytokines.Front. Immunol. 2013; 4: 391Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly sized bands were pooled and lyophilized for further testing of purity and quantity evaluation. The comINS was obtained from Green Cross (Kyeonggi-do, Korea). A549, Huvec, Wish, CHO, and THP-1 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained according to the instructions provided. Primary human WBCs (1:4 dilution with RPMI 1640 medium), PBMCs, and PMN leukocytes (5 × 105/well in a 96-well plate) were isolated and treated with various stimuli with concentrations as defined in each figure. For MEF cell isolation, 13.5–14.5-day embryos were minced with forceps for single cell suspension. The isolated MEF cells were cultured in DMEM. Human PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation of blood over Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS (GE Healthcare). PBMCs were washed twice with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and resuspended in a culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium). The cell culture supernatant was harvested at different times for cytokine assay. Human cytokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNFα) and mouse IL-6 were measured with ELISA kits from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences was analyzed by unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Values of p <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data shown are representative of at least five independent experiments. Prior to transfection of pCAGGs/Neo-human IL-1R1 into parent Wish cells, we examined the expression of IL-1R1 with RT-PCR, Western blotting, and FACS analysis (not shown). Wish cells were transfected with empty pCAGGs or pCAGGs/Neo-human IL-1R1 plasmid DNA (2 μg) using Lipofectamine® 2000 from Life Technologies. A positive clone of Wish IL-1R1 was first screened with RT-PCR and then further confirmed with Western blotting and FACS analysis (not shown). Wish IL-1R1/C-3 and mock control cells were cultured and then harvested for Western blotting. Cell lysate was obtained by directly adding lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) to the plate after removing the cell culture medium with PBS washing. For the A549 cell supernatant of the pINSd-treated cells, standalone pINSd (100 ng/ml) or pINSd preincubated with trypsin (20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at the indicated times without FBS. The cell lysate (100 μg) or the supernatant (60 μl) was mixed with loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and loaded for 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). For dot blotting, recombinant proteins were dropped on a nitrocellulose membrane, and the amount was defined on each blot. The primary antibodies (1 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-1α and mAb anti-IL-1α) were incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled respected anti-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and then Supex (Neuronex, Seoul Korea) and an LAS-4000 imaging device (Fujifilm, Japan) were used to develop the blot. Mice were maintained in microisolator cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled barrier facility and provided with autoclaved water and food. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Konkuk University. We developed monoclonal antibodies against IL-1α protein. The anti-IL-1α antibody-producing B cells were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice four times with 50 μl of recombinant protein (10 μg) and an equal volume of adjuvant (Gerbu, Gaiberg, Germany). The titration of immunized mouse sera was confirmed by using direct ELISA with the antigen. The splenocytes of immunized mice were fused with mouse myeloma cells. The immunoglobulin isotypes of the selected mAb clones were determined using an Immuno-TypeTM mouse mAb isotyping kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mAbs were purified using protein G-agarose (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and their purity was confirmed using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (not shown). The mAbs were aliquot and stored at −80 °C until use. We developed an IL-1α sandwich ELISA by using the anti-IL-1α mAb (1 μg/ml) as a capture antibody and affinity-purified rabbit anti-IL-1α polyclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml) as a detection antibody. After washing, the wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h and then developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). H. J., S. L., and E. K. designed the study, analyzed the data, and performed the experiments. Jo.

Under pathophysiological conditions, the purinergic A2b receptor can regulate cell motility, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Expression of A2b, normally low, is increased in tissues experiencing adverse physiological conditions, including hypoxia and inflammation. ATP is released from such cells. We investigated whether extracellular cues can regulate centrosome-nucleus positioning and cell migration. We discovered that hypoxia as well as extracellular ATP cause a reversible increase in the distance between the centrosome and nucleus and reduced cell motility. We uncovered the underlying pathway: both treatments act through the A2b receptor and specifically activate the Epac1/RapGef3 pathway. We show that cells lacking A2b do not respond in this manner to hypoxia or ATP but transfection of A2b restores this response, that Epac1 is critically involved, and that Rap1B is important for the relative positioning of the centrosome and nucleus. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first report demonstrating that pathophysiological conditions can impact the distance between the centrosome and nucleus.

In mammalian cells, the centriole organizes pericentriolar material, forming the centrosome that nucleates polar arrays of microtubules. In non-cycling cells, the centriole functions as a basal body and generates the primary cilium. In most mammalian cells, the centrosome is in the center of the cell, in close proximity to the nucleus at all interphase stages, only to separate at the onset of mitosis to establish the poles of the mitotic spindle. The close proximity of the centrosome and nucleus in interphase stages appears to be conserved from unicellular organisms, including fungi, where the spindle pole body is the centrosome equivalent embedded in the nuclear membrane (1.Snyder M. The spindle pole body of yeast.Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), chrysomonads and other flagellates, where a prominent microfibril structure connects the basal body to the nucleus (2.Brugerolle G.

Ablation of their function or down-regulation of their expression result in an increased distance between the two organelles.

Developmental aspects of lissencephaly and the lissencephaly syndromes.Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1987; 23: 225-241PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that, in cultured neuronal cells, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of lissencephaly-associated genes can induce an increase in the distance between the centrosome and nucleus, causing defective nuclear translocation and retarded cell migration (4.Tanaka T.

Despite the progresses made in our understanding of the positioning of the centrosome and nucleus and its importance in cell migration, there is still the question of whether positioning can be regulated by extracellular cues. It is possible that, under certain circumstances, e.g. when adverse, extreme conditions are met, temporary separation and, consequently, retarded cell migration may be of overall benefit to the organism. We set out to discover whether such signaling pathways exist and focused on the purinergic receptor A2b for the following reasons. The level of expression of the purinergic A2b receptor is normally low but increases in response to adverse conditions, including necrosis, ischemia, hypoxia, and inflammation (22.Eltzschig H.K.

ATP is released from damaged or dying cells, in ischemia (24.Dale N. Frenguelli B.G. Release of adenosine and ATP during ischemia and epilepsy.Curr. Neuropharmacol. 2009; 7: 160-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and in response to gentle mechanical disturbance or hypoxia (25.Burnstock G. Purinergic signalling: from discovery to current developments.Exp. Physiol. 2014; 99: 16-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A2b is activated by extracellular ATP and adenosine (26.Fredholm B.B. Irenius E. Kull B. Schulte G. Comparison of the potency of adenosine as an agonist at human adenosine receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Elevated A2b is believed to assist tissues in coping with the extreme condition. Indeed, although A2b receptor knockout mice are viable and fertile (27.Yang D. Zhang Y. Nguyen H.G. Koupenova M. Chauhan A.K. Makitalo M. Jones M.R. St Hilaire C. Seldin D.C. Toselli P. Lamperti E.

Here we discovered a specific pathway that is activated through the purinergic receptor A2b by either hypoxia or extracellular ATP, triggering a cascade of events culminating in Epac1 and Rap1B activation and movement of the nucleus away from the centrosome. The end result is reduced cell migration. ATP is released into the extracellular milieu under pathological conditions from damaged cells, potentially acting as an extracellular signaling molecule (25.Burnstock G.

The inhibition was reversible: removal of ATP from the culture medium allowed RPE cell migration to resume. Other nucleotides had no effect on RPE cell migration (data not shown). To confirm this result, we tested the effect of ATP on cell migration of individual cells using the Transwell® system (38.Marshall J. Transwell((R)) invasion assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 769: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In these assays, ∼500 untreated cells migrated consistently through the membrane during the test period (1.5 days), whereas fewer than five ATP-treated cells migrated through the membrane over this period, confirming the scratch cell assay results. We next examined the position of the centrosome and nucleus in ATP-treated RPE cells compared with untreated cells. We first had to establish the distribution of distances between the two organelles in RPE cells under normal culture conditions. As expected, the centrosome and nucleus were in close proximity in the majority of RPE cells (Fig. 1c, control). Examples of such measurements are shown in Fig. 1c. The range observed (Fig. 1d) was between 0.32 and 13.12 μm, with a median of 1.30 μm and an average of 1.91 μm. Our analysis revealed that the distance between the centrosome and nucleus was smaller than 2.15 μm in >95% of cells analyzed. In subsequent experiments, we therefore took an observed distance of greater than 2.15 μm as indicative of enhanced separation between the two organelles. This cutoff was confirmed as an appropriate criterion by measuring centrosome-nucleus distances in RPE cells treated with nocodazole, which causes the nucleus to move away from the centrosome (3.Malone C.J. Misner L. Le Bot N. Tsai M.C. Campbell J.M. Ahringer J. White J.G.

The results (Fig. 1e shows examples) indicate that, in 47% of nocodazole-treated cells, the distance between the two organelles was >2.8 μm. Next, we analyzed the centrosome-nucleus distance in RPE cells treated for 24 h with 2 mm ATP, which caused an increased distance between the centrosome and nucleus (Fig. 1, c, ATP, and f). The average distance observed for the two organelles was 6.94 μm. ATP-induced centrosome-nucleus separation showed a dose-response effect (Fig. 1g) and was observed with 250 μm. ATP-mediated centrosome-nucleus separation is not restricted to a particular cell cycle stage and reversible. A time course experiment showed that treatment with 1 mm ATP results in significant centrosome-nucleus separation after 18 h (Fig. 1h). To visualize the effect of ATP, we recorded live-cell time-lapse images every 15 min for 16 h using HeLa cells expressing mCherry-H2B, an GFP-centrin. supplemental Movie 1 shows the results. It can be observed that, although the centrosome continues to reside in the center of the cell, the nucleus moves away as a result of ATP treatment. In contrast to RPE cells, ATP does not affect the distance between the centrosome and nucleus in HS68 cells (Fig. 1i). Finally, we also investigated a possible effect of ATP on the cell cycle. There was no significant difference between untreated and ATP-treated RPE cells. In untreated cells, 70.2% were in G1, 9.4% in G2, and 20.4% in S phase, whereas, for ATP-treated cells, 70.7% were in G1, 9.5% in G2, and 18.8% in S phase. Together, these results are the first demonstration that ATP can reversibly affect the distance between the centrosome and nucleus and cause reduced cell migration. Other triphosphate nucleotides did not cause separation (data not shown). In contrast, ADP, AMP, and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog PNP-AMP cause centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 2, a and b). Indeed, adenosine also causes centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 2c). Adenosine-mediated separation can be detected as early as 3 h after treatment (Fig. 2d). A dose-response experiment is shown in Fig. 2e. These data suggest that one of the adenosine receptors mediates ATP/adenosine-induced centrosome-nucleus separation. Four adenosine receptors, which belong to the P1 class of purinergic receptors, had been described, viz. A1, A2a, A2b, and A3. Caffeine is a non-selective antagonist (41.Dunwiddie T.V. Masino S.A. The role and regulation of adenosine in the central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 31-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), and we tested its effect first. Caffeine by itself did not affect the position of the centrosome and nucleus, but caffeine efficiently abrogated ATP and adenosine-induced separation (Fig. 2f). To identify the adenosine receptor responsible for the ATP effect, we used specific chemical inhibitors for the adenosine receptors (PSB36 for A1 (42.Weyler S. Fülle F. Diekmann M. Schumacher B.

Structure-activity relationships and molecular modeling of 3, 5-diacyl-2,4-dialkylpyridine derivatives as selective A3 adenosine receptor antagonists.J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 3186-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). The results are shown in Fig. 3a. Inhibitors alone had no effect on the position of the centrosome and nucleus. In combination with ATP, only the A2b inhibitors MRS1754 and PSB1115 (46.Müller C.E. Sandoval-Ramírez J. Schobert U. Geis U. Frobenius W. Klotz K.N. 8-(Sulfostyryl)xanthines: water-soluble A2A-selective adenosine receptor antagonists.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) completely abrogated ATP-mediated centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 3a). To prove that the A2b receptor is critically involved in the observed ATP effect, we carried out the following experiments. We first analyzed adenosine receptor mRNA expression in RPE cells and HS68 cells by RT-PCR. The results (Fig. 3b) show that the adenosine receptors A1 and A3 are not expressed in RPE and HS68 cells and that A2a mRNA expression was detected in both. In contrast, A2b mRNA was detected in RPE cells, not in HS68 cells. This suggested that A2b is required for the observed ATP-induced centrosome-nucleus separation. To support this, HS68 cells were transfected with pEGFP-A2b and pEGFP and treated with ATP. Western blotting analysis showed production of both GFP and GFP-A2b proteins (Fig. 3c). Without ATP, pEGFP-A2b did not affect the position of the centrosome and nucleus (Fig. 3d). However, pEGFP-A2b-transfected and ATP-treated HS68 cells showed centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 3, d and e), demonstrating a critical role for the adenosine A2b receptor in the ATP effect. A2b associates with the Gs subunit of heterotrimeric G protein. Upon A2b activation Gs activates adenylate cyclase, producing cAMP. To explore whether adenylate cyclase is involved in A2b-mediated centrosome-nucleus separation, we treated RPE cells with adenylate cyclase activators (forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP) and an inhibitor (dideoxyadenosine). As shown in Fig. 3f, forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP promote an increase in the distance between the centrosome and nucleus, but dideoxyadenosine had no effect. However, dideoxyadenosine efficiently reduced ATP-induced separation (Fig. 3f), showing that adenylate cyclase is the downstream effector. cAMP has been shown to activate two pathways: the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, and the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) pathway. We tested whether PKA mediates ATP-induced centrosome-nucleus separation using the PKA inhibitors H89 and I14–22 (a plasma membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor). No changes in the overall phosphorylation profiles of PKA substrates with or without ATP treatment were observed by Western blotting (Fig. 4a). PKA inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of PKA phosphosubstrates as expected (Fig. 4a). Neither of the PKA inhibitors exhibited any effect on the positioning of the centrosome and nucleus (Fig. 4b). Importantly, they were unable to block ATP-induced centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 4b). To further rule out PKA involvement, we analyzed mitotic kinase Aurora A, a PKA phosphosubstrate (47.Macurek L. Lindqvist A. Lim D. Lampson M.A. Klompmaker R. Freire R. Clouin C. Taylor S.S. Yaffe M.B. Medema R.H. Polo-like kinase-1 is activated by aurora A to promote checkpoint recovery.Nature. 2008; 455: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Aurora activates Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk-1) (48.Archambault V. Carmena M. Polo-like kinase-activating kinases: Aurora A, Aurora B and what else?.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which plays a role in controlling centrosome-nucleus separation at the onset of mitosis (19.Archambault V. Zhao X. White-Cooper H. Carpenter A.T. Glover D.M. Mutations in Drosophila Greatwall/Scant reveal its roles in mitosis and meiosis and interdependence with Polo kinase.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e200Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To analyze the involvement of Aurora in the ATP effect, RPE cells were treated with two Aurora kinase inhibitors: VX-680 with a high potency toward Aurora A and AZD-1152, a selective inhibitor of Aurora kinase B. These inhibitors did not cause centrosome-nucleus separation and did not interfere with ATP-induced centrosome-nucleus separation (Fig. 4c). We conclude that PKA is not involved in the ATP effect. We next investigated a role for Epac, a cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (49.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Epac is a Rap1 guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor directly activated by cyclic AMP.Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). In mammals, two Epac isoforms, Epac1 and Epac2, are encoded by two distinct genes, RAPGEF3 and RAPGEF4 (50.Bos J.L. Epac: a new cAMP target and new avenues in cAMP research.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We determined Epac mRNA expression in RPE and HS68 cells using RT-PCR. Epac1 mRNA is expressed in both cell types (Fig. 4d), whereas Epac2 mRNA was not detectable (Fig. 4d). We next used Epac1 and Epac2 inhibitors. ESI09 is an inhibitor of both Epac isoforms, with an IC50 of 3.2 μm and 1.4 μm for Epac1 and Epac2, respectively (51.Almahariq M. Tsalkova T. Mei F.C. Chen H. Zhou J. Sastry S.K. Schwede F. Cheng X.

Oxalate plays a central role in maintaining environmental pH, which counteracts inevitable population-collapsing alkaline toxicity in amino acid-based culture medium. In the phytopathogen Burkholderia glumae, two enzymes are responsible for oxalate production. First, the enzyme oxalate biosynthetic component A (ObcA) catalyzes the formation of a tetrahedral C6-CoA adduct from the substrates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Then the ObcB enzyme liberates three products from the C6-CoA adduct: oxalate, acetoacetate, and CoA. Interestingly, these two stepwise reactions are catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme, Obc1, from Burkholderia thailandensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Obc1 has an ObcA-like N-terminal domain and shows ObcB activity in its C-terminal domain despite no sequence homology with ObcB. We report the crystal structure of Obc1 in its apo and glycerol-bound form at 2.5 Å and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The Obc1 N-terminal domain is essentially identical both in structure and function to that of ObcA. Its C-terminal domain has an α/β hydrolase fold that has a catalytic triad for oxalate production and a novel oxyanion hole distinct from the canonical HGGG motif in other α/β hydrolases. Functional analyses through mutagenesis studies suggested that His-934 is an additional catalytic acid/base for its lyase activity and liberates two additional products, acetoacetate and CoA. These results provide structural and functional insights into bacterial oxalogenesis and an example of divergent evolution of the α/β hydrolase fold, which has both hydrolase and lyase activity.
