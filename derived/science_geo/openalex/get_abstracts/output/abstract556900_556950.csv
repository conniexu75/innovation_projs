https://openalex.org/W2330245166,"Computation can be performed in living cells by DNA-encoded circuits that process sensory information and control biological functions. Their construction is time-intensive, requiring manual part assembly and balancing of regulator expression. We describe a design environment, Cello, in which a user writes Verilog code that is automatically transformed into a DNA sequence. Algorithms build a circuit diagram, assign and connect gates, and simulate performance. Reliable circuit design requires the insulation of gates from genetic context, so that they function identically when used in different circuits. We used Cello to design 60 circuits forEscherichia coli(880,000 base pairs of DNA), for which each DNA sequence was built as predicted by the software with no additional tuning. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts), and across all circuits 92% of the output states functioned as predicted. Design automation simplifies the incorporation of genetic circuits into biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization."
https://openalex.org/W2332015053,"The high platinum loadings required to compensate for the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) impede the widespread uptake of low-temperature fuel cells in automotive vehicles. We have studied the ORR on eight platinum (Pt)–lanthanide and Pt-alkaline earth electrodes, Pt5M, where M is lanthanum, cerium, samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, thulium, or calcium. The materials are among the most active polycrystalline Pt-based catalysts reported, presenting activity enhancement by a factor of 3 to 6 over Pt. The active phase consists of a Pt overlayer formed by acid leaching. The ORR activity versus the bulk lattice parameter follows a high peaked “volcano” relation. We demonstrate how the lanthanide contraction can be used to control strain effects and tune the activity, stability, and reactivity of these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2334592091,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing typically uses batch processing at multiple locations. Disadvantages of this approach include long production times and the potential for supply chain disruptions. As a preliminary demonstration of an alternative approach, we report here the continuous-flow synthesis and formulation of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a compact, reconfigurable manufacturing platform. Continuous end-to-end synthesis in the refrigerator-sized [1.0 meter (width) × 0.7 meter (length) × 1.8 meter (height)] system produces sufficient quantities per day to supply hundreds to thousands of oral or topical liquid doses of diphenhydramine hydrochloride, lidocaine hydrochloride, diazepam, and fluoxetine hydrochloride that meet U.S. Pharmacopeia standards. Underlying this flexible plug-and-play approach are substantial enabling advances in continuous-flow synthesis, complex multistep sequence telescoping, reaction engineering equipment, and real-time formulation."
https://openalex.org/W2323608404,"Accurate sequence and assembly of genomes is a critical first step for studies of genetic variation. We generated a high-quality assembly of the gorilla genome using single-molecule, real-time sequence technology and a string graph de novo assembly algorithm. The new assembly improves contiguity by two to three orders of magnitude with respect to previously released assemblies, recovering 87% of missing reference exons and incomplete gene models. Although regions of large, high-identity segmental duplications remain largely unresolved, this comprehensive assembly provides new biological insight into genetic diversity, structural variation, gene loss, and representation of repeat structures within the gorilla genome. The approach provides a path forward for the routine assembly of mammalian genomes at a level approaching that of the current quality of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2332600968,"Global climate change is a major threat to biodiversity. Large-scale analyses have generally focused on the impacts of climate change on the geographic ranges of species and on phenology, the timing of ecological phenomena. We used long-term monitoring of the abundance of breeding birds across Europe and the United States to produce, for both regions, composite population indices for two groups of species: those for which climate suitability has been either improving or declining since 1980. The ratio of these composite indices, the climate impact indicator (CII), reflects the divergent fates of species favored or disadvantaged by climate change. The trend in CII is positive and similar in the two regions. On both continents, interspecific and spatial variation in population abundance trends are well predicted by climate suitability trends."
https://openalex.org/W2320476296,"Recent studies have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of many important biological processes. Here we report on the identification and characterization of a lncRNA, lnc13, that harbors a celiac disease-associated haplotype block and represses expression of certain inflammatory genes under homeostatic conditions. Lnc13 regulates gene expression by binding to hnRNPD, a member of a family of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Upon stimulation, lnc13 levels are reduced, thereby allowing increased expression of the repressed genes. Lnc13 levels are significantly decreased in small intestinal biopsy samples from patients with celiac disease, which suggests that down-regulation of lnc13 may contribute to the inflammation seen in this disease. Furthermore, the lnc13 disease-associated variant binds hnRNPD less efficiently than its wild-type counterpart, thus helping to explain how these single-nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2323846125,"With humans altering climate processes, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem functions (1), governments and societies confront the challenge of shaping a sustainable future for people and nature. Policies and practices to address these challenges must draw on social sciences, along with natural sciences and engineering (2). Although various social science approaches can enable and assess progress toward sustainability, debate about such concrete engagement is outpacing actual use. To catalyze uptake, we identify seven key social concepts that are largely absent from many efforts to pursue sustainability goals. We present existing and emerging well-tested indicators and propose priority areas for conceptual and methodological development."
https://openalex.org/W2328427632,"When animals encounter conflict they initiate and escalate aggression to establish and maintain a social hierarchy. The neural mechanisms by which animals resolve fighting behaviors to determine such social hierarchies remain unknown. We identified two subregions of the dorsal habenula (dHb) in zebrafish that antagonistically regulate the outcome of conflict. The losing experience reduced neural transmission in the lateral subregion of dHb (dHbL)–dorsal/intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (d/iIPN) circuit. Silencing of the dHbL or medial subregion of dHb (dHbM) caused a stronger predisposition to lose or win a fight, respectively. These results demonstrate that the dHbL and dHbM comprise a dual control system for conflict resolution of social aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2325803044,"The SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction, X− + RY → XR + Y−, is a paradigm reaction in organic chemistry (1). The modern understanding of the SN2 reaction mechanism is based on work of Hughes and Ingold (2), who proposed that the nucleophile (X−) approaches the carbon atom that bears the leaving group (Y−). As a result, the bond between the carbon atom and the leaving group becomes weakened. As this bond breaks and a new bond forms between the nucleophile and the carbon atom, the configuration of the carbon atom is inverted. Analyses of gas-phase reaction rates led to the suggestion of a potential energy surface (PES) with two wells connected by a central barrier transition state (3). Electronic structure calculations have confirmed this picture for some SN2 reactions (4), but recent studies have shown that the actual reaction dynamics may be considerably more complex (see the figure) (5–8)."
https://openalex.org/W2335654017,"About 34 million years ago, Earth’s climate cooled and an ice sheet formed on Antarctica as atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fell below ~750 parts per million (ppm). Sedimentary cycles from a drillcore in the western Ross Sea provide direct evidence of orbitally controlled glacial cycles between 34 million and 31 million years ago. Initially, under atmospheric CO2 levels of ≥600 ppm, a smaller Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), restricted to the terrestrial continent, was highly responsive to local insolation forcing. A more stable, continental-scale ice sheet calving at the coastline did not form until ~32.8 million years ago, coincident with the earliest time that atmospheric CO2 levels fell below ~600 ppm. Our results provide insight into the potential of the AIS for threshold behavior and have implications for its sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentrations above present-day levels."
https://openalex.org/W2317204097,"Self-assembly of nanoparticles can enable composites with pre-designed properties but remains challenged by reproducing structural diversity of atomic and molecular crystals. We combine anisotropic elastic and weakly screened electrostatic interactions to guide both orientational and triclinic positional self-ordering of inorganic nanocrystals in a nematic fluid host. The lattice periodicity of these low-symmetry colloidal crystals is more than an order of magnitude larger than the nanoparticle size. Orientations of nanocrystals, as well as crystallographic axes of ensuing triclinic colloidal crystals, are coupled to the uniform alignment direction of the nematic host, which can be readily controlled on large scales. We probe colloidal pair and many-body interactions and demonstrate how triclinic crystals with orientational ordering of the semiconductor nanorods emerge from competing long-range elastic and electrostatic forces."
https://openalex.org/W2317868549,"Highly purified outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of the periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia were produced using tangential flow ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation and Optiprep density gradient separation. Cryo-TEM and light scattering showed OMVs to be single lipid-bilayers with modal diameters of 75 to 158 nm. Enumeration of OMVs by nanoparticle flow-cytometry at the same stage of late exponential culture indicated that P. gingivalis was the most prolific OMV producer. P. gingivalis OMVs induced strong TLR2 and TLR4-specific responses and moderate responses in TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, NOD1 and NOD2 expressing-HEK-Blue cells. Responses to T. forsythia OMVs were less than those of P. gingivalis and T. denticola OMVs induced only weak responses. Compositional analyses of OMVs from the three pathogens demonstrated differences in protein, fatty acids, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan fragments and nucleic acids. Periodontal pathogen OMVs induced differential pattern recognition receptor responses that have implications for their role in chronic periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2328509703,"Host responses against metazoan parasites or an array of environmental substances elicit type 2 immunity. Despite its protective function, type 2 immunity also drives allergic diseases. The mechanisms that regulate the magnitude of the type 2 response remain largely unknown. Here, we show that genetic ablation of a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by Tyro3 in mice or the functional neutralization of its ortholog in human dendritic cells resulted in enhanced type 2 immunity. Furthermore, the TYRO3 agonist PROS1 was induced in T cells by the quintessential type 2 cytokine, interleukin-4. T cell–specific Pros1 knockouts phenocopied the loss of Tyro3. Thus, a PROS1-mediated feedback from adaptive immunity engages a rheostat, TYRO3, on innate immune cells to limit the intensity of type 2 responses."
https://openalex.org/W2331290626,"Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to identify biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease (PD); R2* values reflect iron content related to high levels of oxidative stress, whereas volume and/or shape changes reflect neuronal death. We sought to assess iron overload in the nigrostriatal system and characterize its relationship with focal and overall atrophy of the striatum in the pivotal stages of PD. Methods Twenty controls and 70 PD patients at different disease stages (untreated de novo patients, treated early-stage patients and advanced-stage patients with L-dopa-related motor complications) were included in the study. We determined the R2* values in the substantia nigra, putamen and caudate nucleus, together with striatal volume and shape analysis. We also measured R2* in an acute MPTP mouse model and in a longitudinal follow-up two years later in the early-stage PD patients. Results The R2* values in the substantia nigra, putamen and caudate nucleus were significantly higher in de novo PD patients than in controls. Early-stage patients displayed significantly higher R2* values in the substantia nigra (with changes in striatal shape), relative to de novo patients. Measurements after a two-year follow-up in early-stage patients and characterization of the acute MPTP mouse model confirmed that R2* changed rapidly with disease progression. Advanced-stage patients displayed significant atrophy of striatum, relative to earlier disease stages. Conclusion Each pivotal stage in PD appears to be characterized by putative nigrostriatal MRI biomarkers: iron overload at the de novo stage, striatal shape changes at early-stage disease and generalized striatal atrophy at advanced disease."
https://openalex.org/W2322942874,"Background Identifying cancer subtypes is an important component of the personalised medicine framework. An increasing number of computational methods have been developed to identify cancer subtypes. However, existing methods rarely use information from gene regulatory networks to facilitate the subtype identification. It is widely accepted that gene regulatory networks play crucial roles in understanding the mechanisms of diseases. Different cancer subtypes are likely caused by different regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, there are great opportunities for developing methods that can utilise network information in identifying cancer subtypes. Results In this paper, we propose a method, weighted similarity network fusion (WSNF), to utilise the information in the complex miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network in identifying cancer subtypes. We firstly build the regulatory network where the nodes represent the features, i.e. the microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and the edges indicate the interactions between the features. The interactions are retrieved from various interatomic databases. We then use the network information and the expression data of the miRNAs, TFs and mRNAs to calculate the weight of the features, representing the level of importance of the features. The feature weight is then integrated into a network fusion approach to cluster the samples (patients) and thus to identify cancer subtypes. We applied our method to the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) datasets. The experimental results show that WSNF performs better than the other commonly used computational methods, and the information from miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network contributes to the performance improvement. The WSNF method successfully identified five breast cancer subtypes and three GBM subtypes which show significantly different survival patterns. We observed that the expression patterns of the features in some miRNA-TF-mRNA sub-networks vary across different identified subtypes. In addition, pathway enrichment analyses show that the top pathways involving the most differentially expressed genes in each of the identified subtypes are different. The results would provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms characterising different cancer subtypes and assist the design of treatment therapies. All datasets and the R scripts to reproduce the results are available online at the website: http://nugget.unisa.edu.au/Thuc/cancersubtypes/."
https://openalex.org/W2320685447,"The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT), an interferon-γ release assay, is used to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but its inaccuracy in distinguishing active tuberculosis from latent infection is a major concern. There is thus a need for an easy and accurate tool for achieving that goal in daily clinical settings. This study aimed to identify candidate cytokines for specifically differentiating active tuberculosis from latent infection. Our study population consisted of 31 active TB (tuberculosis) patients, 29 LTBI (latent tuberculosis infection) patients and 10 healthy control subjects. We assayed for 27 cytokines in QFT supernatants of both specific antigen-stimulated blood samples (TBAg) and negative-control samples (Nil). We analyzed their specificities and sensitivities by creating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and measuring the area under those curves (AUCs). In TBAg–Nil supernatants, IL-10, IFN-γ, MCP-1 and IL-1RA showed high AUCs of 0.8120, 0.7842, 0.7419 and 0.7375, respectively. Compared with each cytokine alone, combined assay for these top four cytokines showed positive rates in diagnosing active TB, and GDA analysis revealed that MCP-1 and IL-5 are potent in distinguishing active TB from LTBI, with Wilk’s lambda = 0.718 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, utilizing the unique characteristic of IL-2 that its TBAg–Nil supernatant levels are higher in LTBI compared to active TB, the difference between IFN-γ and IL-2 showed a large AUC of 0.8910. In summary, besides IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-1RA and MCP-1 in QFT supernatants may be useful for distinguishing active TB from LTBI. Those cytokines may also help us understand the difference in pathogenesis between active TB and LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2316268830,"Vitamin D is an important regulator of immune function and largely acts to dampen chronic inflammatory events in a variety of tissues. There is also accumulating evidence that vitamin D acts to enhance initial inflammation, beneficial during both infection and wound healing, and then promotes resolution and prevention of chronic, damaging inflammation. The current study examines the effect of topical vitamin D in a mouse of model of corneal epithelial wound healing, where acute inflammation is necessary for efficient wound closure. At 12 and 18 hours post-wounding, vitamin D treatment significantly delayed wound closure by ~17% and increased infiltration of neutrophils into the central cornea. Basal epithelial cell division, corneal nerve density, and levels of VEGF, TGFβ, IL-1β, and TNFα were unchanged. However, vitamin D increased the production of the anti-microbial peptide CRAMP 12 hours after wounding. These data suggest a possible role for vitamin D in modulating corneal wound healing and have important implications for therapeutic use of vitamin D at the ocular surface."
https://openalex.org/W2322498190,"In this paper we use a panel of manufacturing firms in Spain to examine the extent to which they use internal and external sources of information (customers, suppliers, competitors, consultants and universities) to generate product and process innovation. Our results show that, although internal sources are influential, external sources of information are key to achieve innovation performance. These results are in line with the open innovation literature because they show that firms that are opening up their innovation process and that use different information sources have a greater capacity to generate innovations. We also find that the importance of external sources of information varies depending on the type of innovation (product or process) considered. To generate process innovation, firms mainly rely on suppliers while, to generate product innovation, the main contribution is from customers. The potential simultaneity between product and process innovation is also taken into consideration. We find that the generation of both types of innovation is not independent."
https://openalex.org/W2317615226,"Stars born with masses below around 10 solar masses end their lives as white dwarf stars. Their atmospheres are dominated by the lightest elements because gravitational diffusion brings the lightest element to the surface. We report the discovery of a white dwarf with an atmosphere completely dominated by oxygen, SDSS J124043.01+671034.68. After oxygen, the next most abundant elements in its atmosphere are neon and magnesium, but these are lower by a factor of ≥25 by number. The fact that no hydrogen or helium are observed is surprising. Oxygen, neon, and magnesium are the products of carbon burning, which occurs in stars at the high-mass end of pre–white dwarf formation. This star, a possible oxygen-neon white dwarf, will provide a rare observational test of the evolutionary paths toward white dwarfs."
https://openalex.org/W2327229247,"This study aimed to explore the effects of fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Pretreatment with fucoidan protected liver function indicated by ALT, AST and histopathological changes by suppressing inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). In addition, intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis mediated by Bax, Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Caspase 3, 8, and 9 were inhibited by fucoidan and the action was associated with the TRADD/TRAF2 and JAK2/STAT1 signal pathways. Our results demonstrated that fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus alleviated ConA-induced acute liver injury via the inhibition of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis mediated by the TRADD/TRAF2 and JAK2/STAT1 pathways which were activated by TNF-α and IFN-γ. These findings could provide a potential powerful therapy for T cell-related hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2332788370,"Estrogen promotes the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which likely underlies its ability to accelerate re-endothelialization and reduce adverse remodeling after vascular injury. In previous studies, we have shown that the protective effects of E2 (the active endogenous form of estrogen) in vascular injury require the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). ERα transduces the effects of estrogen via a classical DNA binding, “genomic” signaling pathway and via a more recently-described “rapid” signaling pathway that is mediated by a subset of ERα localized to the cell membrane. However, which of these pathways mediates the effects of estrogen on endothelial cells is poorly understood. Here we identify a triple point mutant version of ERα (KRR ERα) that is specifically defective in rapid signaling, but is competent to regulate transcription through the “genomic” pathway. We find that in ECs expressing wild type ERα, E2 regulates many genes involved in cell migration and proliferation, promotes EC migration and proliferation, and also blocks the adhesion of monocytes to ECs. ECs expressing KRR mutant ERα, however, lack all of these responses. These observations establish KRR ERα as a novel tool that could greatly facilitate future studies into the vascular and non-vascular functions of ERα rapid signaling. Further, they support that rapid signaling through ERα is essential for many of the transcriptional and physiological responses of ECs to E2, and that ERα rapid signaling in ECs, in vivo, may be critical for the vasculoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2313971768,"The aim of the study reported in this article was to investigate staff nurses’ perceptions and experiences about structural empowerment and perceptions regarding the extent to which structural empowerment supports safe quality patient care. To address the complex needs of patients, staff nurse involvement in clinical and organizational decision-making processes within interdisciplinary care settings is crucial. A qualitative study was conducted using individual semi-structured interviews of 11 staff nurses assigned to medical or surgical units in a 600-bed university hospital in Belgium. During the study period, the hospital was going through an organizational transformation process to move from a classic hierarchical and departmental organizational structure to one that was flat and interdisciplinary. Staff nurses reported experiencing structural empowerment and they were willing to be involved in decision-making processes primarily about patient care within the context of their practice unit. However, participants were not always fully aware of the challenges and the effect of empowerment on their daily practice, the quality of care and patient safety. Ongoing hospital change initiatives supported staff nurses’ involvement in decision-making processes for certain matters but for some decisions, a classic hierarchical and departmental process still remained. Nurses perceived relatively high work demands and at times viewed empowerment as presenting additional. Staff nurses recognized the opportunities structural empowerment provided within their daily practice. Nurse managers and unit climate were seen as crucial for success while lack of time and perceived work demands were viewed as barriers to empowerment."
https://openalex.org/W2276118635,"Pancreatic islets are functional units involved in glucose homeostasis. The multicellular system comprises three main cell types; $\beta$ and $\alpha$ cells reciprocally decrease and increase blood glucose by producing insulin and glucagon pulses, while the role of $\delta$ cells is less clear. Although their spatial organization and the paracrine/autocrine interactions between them have been extensively studied, the functional implications of the design principles are still lacking. In this study, we formulated a mathematical model that integrates the pulsatility of hormone secretion and the interactions and organization of islet cells and examined the effects of different cellular compositions and organizations in mouse and human islets. A common feature of both species was that islet cells produced synchronous hormone pulses under low- and high- glucose conditions, while they produced asynchronous hormone pulses under normal glucose conditions. However, the synchronous coordination of insulin and glucagon pulses at low glucose was more pronounced in human islets that had more $\alpha$ cells. When $\beta$ cells were selectively removed to mimic diabetic conditions, the anti-synchronicity of insulin and glucagon pulses was deteriorated at high glucose, but it could be partially recovered when the re-aggregation of remaining cells was considered. Finally, the third cell type, $\delta$ cells, which introduced additional complexity in the multicellular system, prevented the excessive synchronization of hormone pulses. Our computational study suggests that controllable synchronization is a design principle of pancreatic islets."

https://openalex.org/W2321272800,"Eutrophication affects seagrasses negatively by increasing light attenuation through stimulation of biomass of fast-growing, bloom-forming algae and because high concentrations of ammonium in the water can be toxic to higher plants. We hypothesized nevertheless, that moderate amounts of nitrophilic macroalgae that coexists with seagrasses under eutrophic conditions, can alleviate the harmful effects of eutrophication on seagrasses by reducing ammonium concentrations in the seawater to non-toxic levels because such algae have a very large capacity to take up inorganic nutrients. We studied therefore how combinations of different ammonium concentrations (0, 25 and 50 μM) and different standing stocks of macroalgae (i.e. 0, 1 and 6 layers of Ulva sp.) affected survival, growth and net production of the seagrass Zostera noltei. In the absence of Ulva sp., increasing ammonium concentrations had a negative influence on the performance of Z. noltei. The presence of Ulva sp. without ammonium supply had a similar, but slightly smaller, negative effect on seagrass fitness due to light attenuation. When ammonium enrichment was combined with presence of Ulva sp., Ulva sp. ameliorated some of negative effects caused by high ammonium availability although Ulva sp. lowered the availability of light. Benthic microalgae, which increased in biomass during the experiment, seemed to play a similar role as Ulva sp.–they contributed to remove ammonium from the water, and thus, aided to keep the ammonium concentrations experienced by Z. noltei at relatively non-toxic levels. Our findings show that moderate amounts of drift macroalgae, eventually combined with increasing stocks of benthic microalgae, may aid seagrasses to alleviate toxic effects of ammonium under eutrophic conditions, which highlights the importance of high functional diversity for ecosystem resistance to anthropogenic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2316561385,"Purpose We aimed to a) introduce a new Test to Exhaustion Specific to Tennis (TEST) and compare performance (test duration) and physiological responses to those obtained during the 20-m multistage shuttle test (MSST), and b) determine to which extent those variables correlate with performance level (tennis competitive ranking) for both test procedures. Methods Twenty-seven junior players (8 males, 19 females) members of the national teams of the French Tennis Federation completed MSST and TEST, including elements of the game (ball hitting, intermittent activity, lateral displacement), in a randomized order. Cardiorespiratory responses were compared at submaximal (respiratory compensation point) and maximal loads between the two tests. Results At the respiratory compensation point oxygen uptake (50.1 ± 4.7 vs. 47.5 ± 4.3 mL.min-1.kg-1, p = 0.02), but not minute ventilation and heart rate, was higher for TEST compared to MSST. However, load increment and physiological responses at exhaustion did not differ between the two tests. Players’ ranking correlated negatively with oxygen uptake measured at submaximal and maximal loads for both TEST (r = -0.41; p = 0.01 and -0.55; p = 0.004) and MSST (r = -0.38; P = 0.05 and -0.51; p = 0.1). Conclusion Using TEST provides a tennis-specific assessment of aerobic fitness and may be used to prescribe aerobic exercise in a context more appropriate to the game than MSST. Results also indicate that VO2 values both at submaximal and maximal load reached during TEST and MSST are moderate predictors of players competitive ranking."

We found a monopartite NLS at the N terminus of large terminase, flanking the ATPase domain, that is conserved only in α-herpesviruses.

In addition, we predicted a classical NLS in the third terminase subunit that is partially conserved among herpesviruses. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that both location and potency of NLSs in terminase subunits evolved more rapidly than the rest of the amino acid sequence despite the selective pressure to keep terminase gene products active and localized in the nucleus.

However, the mechanisms that control such mechanotransduction are poorly understood. We have previously established that tyrosine phosphorylation of the transmembrane protein nephrin promotes recruitment of the Nck1/2 cytoskeletal adaptor proteins and downstream actin remodeling. We now reveal that Nck integrates nephrin with the Hippo kinase cascade through association with the adaptor protein WTIP. Using mutational analysis, we show that Nck sequesters WTIP and its binding partner Lats1 to phosphorylated nephrin, resulting in decreased phospho-activation of Lats1. We further demonstrate that, coincident with nephrin dephosphorylation in a transient model of podocyte injury in mice, Lats1 is rapidly activated, and this precedes significant down-regulation of the transcription regulator Yap. Moreover, we show reduced levels of Yap protein in mice with chronic disruption of nephrin phospho-signaling. Together, these findings support the existence of a dynamic molecular link between nephrin signaling and the canonical Hippo pathway in podocytes, which may facilitate the conversion of mechanical cues to biochemical signals promoting podocyte viability.

Integration of the slit diaphragm with the underlying actin cytoskeleton is proposed to endow the podocyte with a flexible cytoarchitecture that can dynamically adapt to the contractile demands of mechanical strain (2Kriz W.

Nephrol. 2012; 32: 327-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a hallmark of kidney disease is remodeling of the foot process actin cytoskeleton, leading to simplification of podocyte structure (effacement), disruption of filtration (proteinuria), and podocyte loss (1Greka A. Mundel P. Cell biology and pathology of podocytes.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A major component of the podocyte slit diaphragm is the transmembrane protein nephrin. The extracellular region of nephrin interacts with adjacent nephrin molecules, forming a structural filter, whereas the intracellular tail coordinates signaling cascades that regulate actin dynamics as well as podocyte survival (4New L.A.

Despite the central importance of Nck in podocyte biology, the downstream signaling pathways controlling its function remain to be fully elucidated. In a search for novel effectors of Nck signaling within podocytes, we have identified Wilms tumor-interacting protein (WTIP). WTIP is a Lim domain- and poly-proline-containing scaffold protein of the Ajuba family that is expressed in podocytes, where it has been shown to regulate F-actin assembly (11Srichai M.B.

WTIP is also an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of the Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade terminating with Lats1/2 kinases that phosphorylate the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz, leading to their nuclear exclusion and subsequent degradation (13Das Thakur M.

Soc. Nephrol. 2016; 27: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Nck bridges the interaction of WTIP and Lats1 with phosphorylated nephrin, resulting in reduced Hippo signaling. We further show that Lats1 is transiently activated in a reversible mouse model of podocyte injury coincident with nephrin dephosphorylation and that Lats1 activation precedes phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Yap. Last, we demonstrate reduced expression of Yap in mice with chronic loss of nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Together, we have uncovered a novel role for Nck in connecting phosphorylated nephrin with the Hippo pathway through WTIP, which may have implications in mechanotransduction and podocyte survival.

GFP-tagged CD16/7-nephrinY3F-3xSH3 was constructed by cloning the three Nck2 SH3 domains in-frame with the C terminus of CD16/7-nephrinY3F. Human Nck1 3xSH3 and 3xSH3* were previously cloned into pGEX-4T-1 as GST fusion constructs. Mouse WTIP (BC054125) and WTIPΔPRR, which lacks 351 base pairs (128–479, inclusive), resulting in deletion of 117 amino acids of the PRR of WTIP, were cloned into pEGFP-C1 and pCDNA3.1-HA.

Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used for immunoblot detection. HEK293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °;C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection was performed using PEI for 48 h. Cells expressing CD16/7-nephrin were starved in serum-free medium overnight and stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD16 antibody for 10 min at 37 °;C. For inhibition of SFKs, cells were treated with 10 μm PP2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h prior to CD16 stimulation, and CD16 stimulation was performed in the continued presence of PP2. Cells were lysed in phospholipase C lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors by vortexing and sonicating on ice. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °;C with rotation, followed by washing three times with phospholipase C buffer. Immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads in 2× SDS loading buffer by boiling at 100 °;C for 2 min. For Western blotting, proteins from total lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat milk powder or BSA, and incubated overnight at 4 °;C with primary antibody. Detection was performed using ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce), and membranes were exposed to film (Pierce). Values used for densitometry were obtained using ImageLab v2.0 analysis software (Bio-Rad). Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced in Escherichia coli DH5α using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B (GE Healthcare). 5 μg of each GST fusion protein was incubated for 3 h at 4 °;C with lysates from HEK293T cells and processed as described for immunoprecipitation. NephrinY3F knockin mice were generated by homologous recombination targeting mouse Tyr-1191, Tyr-1208, and Tyr-1232 for mutation to Phe as described previously (9New L.A. Martin C.E. Scott R.P.

Male and female animals on the C57BL/6N background were used between 5–8 weeks of age, which is prior to the onset of significant renal injury. Male C57BL/6N mice (475, Charles River Laboratories Canada) aged 8–10 weeks were injected with 0.04 mg/g of γ2 subclass sheep anti-rat nephrotoxic serum (a gift from Dr. David Salant, Boston University) via tail vein injection. Prior to injection, mice were warmed in an empty cage under a heat lamp for 15 min to induce tail vein dilation. Spot urine samples were collected prior to and at various times after injection. At 0, 6, or 24 h post-injection, mice were euthanized with CO2, and both kidneys were removed and immediately processed for glomerular isolation. Animal studies were approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee and carried out in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care protocols. Kidneys were dissected, and cortices were separated from the medulla, minced, and digested by incubation with 1 mg/ml type 4 collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) in PBS at 37 °;C with 140 rpm agitation for 30 min. Digested cortices were passed through 100-mm sterile nylon cell strainers with chilled PBS to obtain glomeruli. Red blood cells were lysed in sterile Ack lysis buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, and 0.1 mm EDTA), and the remaining enriched glomeruli were lysed in phospholipase C lysis buffer supplemented with fresh protease inhibitors as described above. Lysed glomeruli were further subjected to sonication for 10 s on ice before proceeding to separating soluble protein from the cell pellet through centrifugation. For mRNA isolation, kidney cortices were dissected from mice injected for 0 or 24 h with NTS and immediately flash-frozen and stored at −80 °;C. mRNA was isolated using the Ambion RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of RNA with the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR reactions were carried out using PerfeCta SYBR Green FastMix, Rox (Quanta Bioscience) using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Standard curves were generated for all primer pairs used, and melt curves were examined to verify the presence of a single amplicon. “No template” controls were included in all runs. Expression differences between time 0 and 24 h samples were calculated using the ΔCt method and corrected for primer efficiency using StepOnePlus v2.3 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Differences were normalized to the reference gene β2-microglobulin. The following primer pairs were used: β2-microglobulin, GCTATCCAGAAAACCCCTCA (forward) and CCGTTCTTCAGCATTTGGAT (reverse); nephrin, CTAGTTTCCCCCAAGGTGCT (forward) and GTCCACCCTGGATGAAGATG (reverse); Yap1, TTTCGGCAGGCAATACGGAA (forward) and AGGGATCGGAACTATTGGTTGT (reverse); CCND1, GCGTACCCTGACACCAATCT (forward) and CACAGACCTCCAGCATCCAG (reverse); and amphiregulin, ACAGCGAGGATGACAAGGAC (forward) and GCCAATAGCTGCGAGGATGA (reverse). WTIP was identified as a putative Nck interaction partner based on the presence of an extensive proline-rich region (PRR) (Fig. 1A), including the minimal consensus motif required for Nck SH3 domain binding, PXXP (where P is proline and X is any amino acid) (23Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Identification of a ten-amino acid proline-rich SH3 binding site.Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Therefore, to validate that Nck and WTIP interact, FLAG-tagged Nck1 or Nck2 was transiently coexpressed with GFP-tagged WTIP or GFP alone in HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation of GFP (Fig. 1, B and C). The immunoblot for GFP and FLAG reveals a specific interaction between both Nck1 and Nck2 with WTIP-GFP but not GFP alone. We hypothesized that the proline-binding SH3 domains of Nck would facilitate the interaction with WTIP. To test this, Nck1 and Nck2 variants with point mutations (Fig. 2A) inactivating the proline-binding functions of all three SH3 domains of Nck (3xSH3*) or a point mutation that inactivates the phosphotyrosine binding function of the SH2 domain (SH2*) were coexpressed with WTIP-GFP in HEK293T cells, and lysates were harvested for binding assays. Co-immunoprecipitation of WTIP-GFP and Nck1-FLAG is detected for Nck1 WT and SH2*, but the interaction is obstructed by the 3xSH3* mutation (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the interaction between WTIP-GFP and Nck2-FLAG is also impaired by the 3xSH3* mutation (Fig. 2C). Therefore, at least one of the Nck SH3 domains is required to bind WTIP, whereas the Nck SH2 domain is not required. Because there are three potential Nck SH3 domains capable of binding WTIP, we next sought to isolate which of these domains is most critical for the Nck-WTIP interaction by performing binding assays between WTIP-GFP and all possible Nck1 variants with one, two, or three SH3 domains inactivated (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of GFP (WTIP) and immunoblot for FLAG (Nck1 variants) reveals that the first and third SH3 domains of Nck are primarily responsible for binding to WTIP (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, to verify the role of the PRR of WTIP in binding Nck, a deletion variant of WTIP was generated that lacks the internal PRR, denoted as WTIPΔPRR. A pulldown assay of wild-type WTIP and WTIPΔPRR using GST fused to either the three wild-type Nck1 SH3 domains (3xSH3) or three mutated Nck1 SH3 domains (3xSH3*) reveals that the PRR of WTIP is required for the interaction between Nck and WTIP (Fig. 2E). A prominent function of Nck in podocytes is connecting nephrin at the slit diaphragm to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Thus, we next investigated whether Nck could recruit WTIP to nephrin. To test this, chimeric CD16/7-nephrin was used to facilitate inducible phosphorylation of the nephrin intracellular domain upon CD16 clustering (5Jones N. Blasutig I.M. Eremina V. Ruston J.M. Bladt F. Li H. Huang H. Larose L. Li S.S. Takano T. Quaggin S.E. Pawson T. Nck adaptor proteins link nephrin to the actin cytoskeleton of kidney podocytes.Nature. 2006; 440: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cells transiently coexpressing CD16/7-nephrin-GFP, Nck2-FLAG, and WTIP-HA were stimulated with CD16 in the presence or absence of the SFK inhibitor PP2, and lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation of GFP (CD16/7-nephrin). As reported previously (24New L.A. Keyvani Chahi A. Jones N. Direct regulation of nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation by Nck adaptor proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1500-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), CD16/7-nephrin phosphorylation induced by CD16 stimulation is suppressed in the presence of PP2 and enhanced by overexpression of Nck2 (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, Nck recruitment to nephrin is suppressed in the presence of PP2 (Fig. 3A). Notably, we demonstrate that WTIP-HA coimmunoprecipitation with CD16/7-nephrin-GFP occurs primarily when CD16/7-nephrin has been clustered and Nck2-FLAG is overexpressed above endogenous levels (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Nck can mediate the recruitment of WTIP to nephrin upon nephrin phosphorylation by SFKs. To further validate that Nck mediates recruitment of WTIP to phosphorylated nephrin, Nck mutants that disrupt upstream and downstream interactions were coexpressed with CD16/7-nephrin and WTIP-HA. Nck2 3xSH3* is able to bind the intracellular tail of nephrin but is unable to bind WTIP. By contrast, Nck2 SH2* is able to bind WTIP but is unable to be recruited to the intracellular tail of nephrin. In addition, we employed a variant of CD16/7-nephrin in which the three Nck-binding tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine (Y3F) to disrupt Nck recruitment to nephrin. Transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD16 antibody and harvested for immunoprecipitation of GFP (CD16/7-nephrin). Coimmunoprecipitation of CD16/7-nephrin-GFP and WTIP-HA only occurs when the nephrin tyrosine residues are present and phosphorylated and when Nck2 contains all functional SH3 and SH2 domains (Fig. 3B). Last, to verify the phospho- and Nck dependence of WTIP recruitment to nephrin, we generated a construct in which the Nck2 SH3 domains were directly fused to the intracellular tail of CD16/7-nephrinY3F (CD16/7-nephrinY3F-3xSH3). Coexpression of this construct with WTIP-HA rescues binding of WTIP to CD16/7-nephrinY3F (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that Nck links phosphorylated nephrin with WTIP. WTIP negatively regulates the Hippo pathway through binding and inhibiting Lats kinases, which in turn promotes stabilization of Yap (13Das Thakur M. Feng Y. Jagannathan R. Seppa M.J. Skeath J.B. Longmore G.D. Ajuba LIM proteins are negative regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 657-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To first assess the interplay between WTIP, Lats and nephrin, we coexpressed CD16/7-nephrinY3F or CD16/7-nephrinY3F-3xSH3 fusion construct with WTIP-HA and Lats1-FLAG in HEK293T cells and harvested lysates for immunoprecipitation of GFP (CD16/7-nephrin). Immunoblotting for HA and FLAG demonstrates that Lats1 is recruited to nephrin coincident with WTIP (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, assessment of lysates from cells coexpressing CD16/7-nephrinY3F-GFP or CD16/7-nephrinY3F-3xSH3-GFP with WTIP-HA and Lats1-FLAG by immunoblot for phospho-Lats (Ser-909-active kinase) suggests that complex formation between nephrin, WTIP, and Lats1 coincides with a significant decrease in Lats1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C), implying reduced Hippo pathway activation. We next explored whether changes in components of the Hippo pathway might correlate with altered nephrin signaling induced by podocyte injury. Here, we employed the γ2 nephrotoxic serum (NTS) nephritis model, in which injection of C57BL/6 mice with sheep anti-rat glomerular antiserum induces nephrotic-range proteinuria within 24 h after injection, which resolves by 72–96 h post-injection (Fig. 5A) (25Hoppe J.M. Vielhauer V. Induction and analysis of nephrotoxic serum nephritis in mice.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1169: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Glomeruli were isolated from mice at 0, 6, or 24 h following NTS injection and processed for immunoblotting and subsequent densitometric quantitation (Fig. 5, B and C). At 6 h post-NTS injection, which precedes marked proteinuria, there is significantly reduced nephrin phosphorylation on Tyr-1176/1193 compared with uninjected controls. This reduction in nephrin phosphorylation is coincident with a significant increase of Lats1 phosphorylation on Ser-909 and a concomitant rise in Yap phosphorylation on Ser-127. By 24 h post-NTS injection, when proteinuria is maximal, nephrin phosphorylation remains significantly lower than in control animals. Intriguingly however, although phospho-Lats1 Ser-909 has returned back to baseline at this time point, phospho-Yap Ser-127 remains significantly elevated, and there is a marked reduction in total Yap levels, consistent with the notion that phosphorylation of Yap on Ser-127 triggers its degradation (14Varelas X. The Hippo pathway effectors TAZ and YAP in development, homeostasis and disease.Development. 2014; 141: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To determine whether this loss of Yap protein affected its transcriptional activity, we isolated mRNA from the kidney cortex of NTS-injected mice and controls and used quantitative PCR to examine transcript levels of several Yap target genes. At 24 h post-injection, we noted a marked decrease in expression of amphiregulin (AREG) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) (Fig. 5D). As expected, no significant changes were observed in nephrin or Yap mRNA levels. Overall, the NTS model of transient podocyte inju"

The rat model of cardiac remodeling was established by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol(ISO) at the dose of 0.25 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 7 days. We found that the expression of β1- and β2-ARs decreased in the remodeling heart. The mechanisms may include the inhibition of DNA transcription and the increase of mRNA degradation. cAMP-response element binding protein(CREB) is a well-known transcription factor of β-AR. However, the expression and activation of CREB was not changed in the remodeling heart. Further, human Antigen-R (HuR), a RNA binding protein, which binds to the 3'-untranslated region of the β-AR mRNA and promotes RNA degradation, was increased in the remodeling model. And in vitro, HuR deficiency reversed the reduction of β-AR mRNA induced by ISO. Therefore, the present findings indicate that HuR, but not CREB, is responsible for the reduction of β-AR expression in ISO induced cardiac remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2322634489,"Introduction Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in primary care has been recommended; however, the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) are not known. This study aimed to determine the opinions of HCP about the feasibility of implementing screening within a primary care setting. Methods A cross-sectional mixed methods census survey of 418 HCPs from 59 inner-city practices (Nottingham, UK) was conducted between October-December 2014. Postal and web-surveys ascertained data on existing methods, knowledge, skills, attitudes, barriers and facilitators to AF screening using Likert scale and open-ended questions. Responses, categorized according to HCP group, were summarized using proportions, adjusting for clustering by practice, with 95% C.Is and free-text responses using thematic analysis. Results At least one General Practitioner (GP) responded from 48 (81%) practices. There were 212/418 (51%) respondents; 118/229 GPs, 67/129 nurses [50 practice nurses; 17 Nurse Practitioners (NPs)], 27/60 healthcare assistants (HCAs). 39/48 (81%) practices had an ECG machine and diagnosed AF in-house. Non-GP HCPs reported having less knowledge about ECG interpretation, diagnosing and treating AF than GPs. A greater proportion of non-GP HCPs reported they would benefit from ECG training specifically for AF diagnosis than GPs [proportion (95% CI) GPs: 11.9% (6.8–20.0); HCAs: 37.0% (21.7–55.5); nurses: 44.0% (30.0–59.0); NPs 41.2% (21.9–63.7)]. Barriers included time, workload and capacity to undertake screening activities, although training to diagnose and manage AF was a required facilitator. Conclusion Inner-city general practices were found to have adequate access to resources for AF screening. There is enthusiasm by non-GP HCPs to up-skill in the diagnosis and management of AF and they may have a role in future AF screening. However, organisational barriers, such as lack of time, staff and capacity, should be overcome for AF screening to be feasibly implemented within primary care."
https://openalex.org/W2329020226,"Common alkylating antitumor drugs, such as temozolomide, trigger their cytotoxicity by methylating the O6-position of guanosine in DNA. However, the therapeutic effect of these drugs is dampened by elevated levels of the DNA repair enzyme, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which directly reverses this alkylation. As a result, assessing MGMT levels in patient samples provides an important predictor of therapeutic response; however, current methods available to measure this protein are indirect, complex and slow. Here we describe the design and synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors that report directly on MGMT activity in a single step within minutes. The chemosensors incorporate a fluorophore and quencher pair, which become separated by the MGMT dealkylation reaction, yielding light-up responses of up to 55-fold, directly reflecting repair activity. Experiments show that the best-performing probe retains near-native activity at mid-nanomolar concentrations. A nuclease-protected probe, NR-1, was prepared and tested in tumor cell lysates, demonstrating an ability to evaluate relative levels of MGMT repair activity in twenty minutes. In addition, a probe was employed to evaluate inhibitors of MGMT, suggesting utility for discovering new inhibitors in a high-throughput manner. Probe designs such as that of NR-1 may prove valuable to clinicians in selection of patients for alkylating drug therapies and in assessing resistance that arises during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2331312502,"The antidepressant activity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel blocker, ketamine, has led to the investigation of negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) selective for the NR2B receptor subtype. The clinical development of NR2B NAMs would benefit from a translational pharmacodynamic biomarker that demonstrates brain penetration and functional inhibition of NR2B receptors in preclinical species and humans. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is a translational measure that can be used to demonstrate pharmacodynamic effects across species. NMDA receptor channel blockers, such as ketamine and phencyclidine, increase the EEG gamma power band, which has been used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the development of NMDA receptor antagonists. However, detailed qEEG studies with ketamine or NR2B NAMs are lacking in nonhuman primates. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects on the qEEG power spectra of the NR2B NAMs traxoprodil (CP-101,606) and BMT-108908 in nonhuman primates, and to compare them to the NMDA receptor channel blockers, ketamine and lanicemine. Cynomolgus monkeys were surgically implanted with EEG radio-telemetry transmitters, and qEEG was measured after vehicle or drug administration. The relative power for a number of frequency bands was determined. Ketamine and lanicemine increased relative gamma power, whereas the NR2B NAMs traxoprodil and BMT-108908 had no effect. Robust decreases in beta power were elicited by ketamine, traxoprodil and BMT-108908; and these agents also produced decreases in alpha power and increases in delta power at the doses tested. These results suggest that measurement of power spectra in the beta and delta bands may represent a translational pharmacodynamic biomarker to demonstrate functional effects of NR2B NAMs. The results of these studies may help guide the selection of qEEG measures that can be incorporated into early clinical evaluation of NR2B NAMs in healthy humans."
https://openalex.org/W2313961127,"Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is an acute, highly contagious, and febrile viral disease that affects both domestic and wild small ruminants. The disease has become a major obstacle to the development of sustainable Agriculture. Hemagglutinin (H), the envelope glycoprotein of Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV), plays a crucial role in regulating viral adsorption and entry, thus determining pathogenicity, and release of newly produced viral particles. In order to accurately understand the epidemic of the disease and the interactions between the virus and host, we launch the work. Here, we examined H gene from all four lineages of the PPRV to investigate evolutionary and epidemiologic dynamics of PPRV by the Bayesian method. In addition, we predicted positive selection sites due to selective pressures. Finally, we studied the interaction between H protein and SLAM receptor based on homology model of the complex. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that H gene can also be used to investigate evolutionary and epidemiologic dynamics of PPRV. Positive selection analysis identified four positive selection sites in H gene, in which only one common site (aa246) was detected by two methods, suggesting strong operation structural and/or functional constraint of changes on the H protein. This target site may be of interest for future mutagenesis studies. The results of homology modeling showed PPRVHv-shSLAM binding interface and MVH-maSLAM binding interface were consistent, wherein the groove in the B4 blade and B5 of the head domain of PPRVHv bound to the AGFCC' β-sheets of the membrane-distal ectodomain of shSLAM. The binding regions could provide insight on the nature of the protein for epitope vaccine design, novel drug discovery, and rational drug design against PPRV."
https://openalex.org/W2322655713,"Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) 6, a member of the IRF family, is essential for epidermal and orofacial embryonic development. Irf6 is strongly expressed in keratinocytes, in which it regulates epidermal proliferation, differentiation, and migration. A recent role for Irf6 in Toll-like receptor 2-dependent chemokine gene expression was also reported in an epithelial cell line. However, a function for Irf6 in innate immune cells was not previously reported. In the present study, we investigated the expression and function of Irf6 in bone marrow-derived neutrophils and macrophages. We show here, using a conditional knockout of Irf6 in lysosymeM expressing cells, that Irf6 is required for resistance to LPS-induced endotoxic shock. In addition, Irf6-deficient bone marrow-derived neutrophils exhibited increased chemotactic index and velocity compared with wild-type cells in vitro. TLR4-specific KC and IL6 secretions were upregulated in Irf6-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro. These cells also exhibited an increased level of phosphorylated IkBa. Collectively, our findings suggest a role for Irf6 in the resistance to endotoxic shock due to NFk-B-mediated alteration of cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2319949235,"While the role of both elevated levels of circulating bacterial cell wall components and adipose tissue in hepatic fat accumulation has been recognized, it has not been considered that the bacterial components-recognizing adipose tissue receptors contribute to the hepatic fat content. In this study we found that the expression of adipose tissue bacterial flagellin (FLG)-recognizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 associated with liver fat content (r = 0.699, p = 0.003) and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.529, p = 0.016) in humans (n = 23). No such associations were found for lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-recognizing TLR4. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms of these associations, human HepG2 hepatoma cells were exposed in vitro to the conditioned culture media derived from FLG or LPS-challenged human adipocytes. The adipocyte-mediated effects were also compared to the effects of direct HepG2 exposure to FLG and LPS. We found that the media derived from FLG-treated adipocytes stimulated fat accumulation in HepG2 cells, whereas either media derived from LPS-treated adipocytes or direct FLG or LPS exposure did not. This is likely due to that FLG-treatment of adipocytes increased lipolysis and secretion of glycerol, which is known to serve a substrate for triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes. Similarly, only FLG-media significantly decreased insulin signaling-related Akt phosphorylation, IRS1 expression and mitochondrial respiratory chain ATP5A. In conclusion, our results suggest that the FLG-induced TLR5 activation in adipocytes increases glycerol secretion from adipocytes and decreases insulin signaling and mitochondrial functions, and increases fat accumulation in hepatocytes. These mechanisms could, at least partly, explain the adipose tissue TLR5 expression associated with liver fat content in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2320489293,"Energy consumption and tribological properties could be improved by proper design of surface texture in friction. However, some literature focused on investigating their performance under high temperature. In the study, different groove surface textures were fabricated on steels by a laser machine, and their tribological behaviors were experimentally studied with the employment of the friction and wear tester under distinct high temperature and other working conditions. The friction coefficient was recorded, and wear performance were characterized by double light interference microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Then, the performances of energy consumptions were carefully estimated. Results showed that friction coefficient, wear, and energy consumption could almost all be reduced by most textures under high temperature conditions, but to a different extent which depends on the experimental conditions and texture parameters. The main improvement mechanisms were analyzed, such as the hardness change, wear debris storage, thermal stress release and friction induced temperature reduction by the textures. Finally, a scattergram of the relatively reduced ratio of the energy consumption was drawn for different surface textures under four distinctive experimental conditions to illustrate the comprehensive energy consumption improving ability of textures, which was of benefit for the application of texture design."
https://openalex.org/W2318530889,"Rationale Obesity is characterized by increased systemic and pulmonary blood volumes (pulmonary vascular congestion). Concomitant abnormal alveolar membrane diffusion suggests subclinical interstitial edema. In this setting, functional abnormalities should encompass the entire distal lung including the airways. Objectives We hypothesize that in obesity: 1) pulmonary vascular congestion will affect the distal lung unit with concordant alveolar membrane and distal airway abnormalities; and 2) the degree of pulmonary congestion and membrane dysfunction will relate to the cardiac response. Methods 54 non-smoking obese subjects underwent spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), diffusion capacity (DLCO) with partition into membrane diffusion (DM) and capillary blood volume (VC), and cardiac MRI (n = 24). Alveolar-capillary membrane efficiency was assessed by calculation of DM/VC. Measurements and Main Results Mean age was 45±12 years; mean BMI was 44.8±7 kg/m2. Vital capacity was 88±13% predicted with reduction in functional residual capacity (58±12% predicted). Despite normal DLCO (98±18% predicted), VC was elevated (135±31% predicted) while DM averaged 94±22% predicted. DM/VC varied from 0.4 to 1.4 with high values reflecting recruitment of alveolar membrane and low values indicating alveolar membrane dysfunction. The most abnormal IOS (R5 and X5) occurred in subjects with lowest DM/VC (r2 = 0.31, p<0.001; r2 = 0.34, p<0.001). Cardiac output and index (cardiac output / body surface area) were directly related to DM/VC (r2 = 0.41, p<0.001; r2 = 0.19, p = 0.03). Subjects with lower DM/VC demonstrated a cardiac output that remained in the normal range despite presence of obesity. Conclusions Global dysfunction of the distal lung (alveolar membrane and distal airway) is associated with pulmonary vascular congestion and failure to achieve the high output state of obesity. Pulmonary vascular congestion and consequent fluid transudation and/or alterations in the structure of the alveolar capillary membrane may be considered often unrecognized causes of airway dysfunction in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2328861447,"The aim of the study was to evaluate ovarian toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, since only scarce data are available on gonadal function after this treatment. Six-week-old female mice received orally, once daily, vehicle or sunitinib (50 mg/kg/d) during 5 weeks. Fertility parameters were analyzed from ovulation to litter assessment. Sunitinib exposure significantly reduced (i) corpora lutea number per ovary (1.1 ± 0.38 in sunitinib group versus 4 ± 0.79 in control group, p<0.01) and (ii) serum Anti Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in sunitinib treated mice (12.01 ± 1.16) compared to control mice (14.33 ± 0.87 ng/ml, p< 0.05). However, primordial and growing follicles numbers per ovary were not different in both groups. After treatment withdrawal, female mice in both groups were able to obtain litters. These data could be helpful to counsel clinicians and patients, when fertility preservation methods are discussed, before TKI treatment in girls and young women."
https://openalex.org/W2321418609,"Water accumulation in the interstitium (edema) and the peritoneum (ascites) of nephrotic patients is classically thought to stem from the prevailing low plasma albumin concentration and the decreased transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient. However, several clinical and experimental observations suggest that it might also stem from changes in capillary permeability. We addressed this hypothesis by studying the peritoneum permeability of rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. The peritoneum of puromycin aminonucleoside rats displayed an increase in the water filtration coefficient of paracellular and transcellular pathways, and a decrease in the reflection coefficient to proteins. It also displayed oxidative stress and subsequent activation of NF-κB. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of NF-κB prevented the changes in the water permeability and reflection coefficient to proteins and reduced the volume of ascites by over 50%. Changes in water permeability were associated with the overexpression of the water channel aquaporin 1, which was prevented by reactive oxygen species scavenging and inhibition of NF-κB. In conclusion, nephrotic syndrome is associated with an increased filtration coefficient of the peritoneum and a decreased reflection coefficient to proteins. These changes, which account for over half of ascite volume, are triggered by oxidative stress and subsequent activation of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2329479329,"This pragmatic study examines love as a mode of communication. Our focus is on the receiver side: what makes an individual feel loved and how felt love is defined through daily interactions. Our aim is to explore everyday life scenarios in which people might experience love, and to consider people's converging and diverging judgments about which scenarios indicate felt love. We apply a cognitive psychometric approach to quantify a receiver's ability to detect, understand, and know that they are loved. Through crowd-sourcing, we surveyed lay participants about whether various scenarios were indicators of felt love. We thus quantify these responses to make inference about consensus judgments of felt love, measure individual levels of agreement with consensus, and assess individual response styles. More specifically, we (1) derive consensus judgments on felt love; (2) describe its characteristics in qualitative and quantitative terms, (3) explore individual differences in both (a) participant agreement with consensus, and (b) participant judgment when uncertain about shared knowledge, and (4) test whether individual differences can be meaningfully linked to explanatory variables. Results indicate that people converge towards a shared cognitive model of felt love. Conversely, respondents showed heterogeneity in knowledge of consensus, and in dealing with uncertainty. We found that, when facing uncertainty, female respondents and people in relationships more frequently judge scenarios as indicators of felt love. Moreover, respondents from smaller households tend to know more about consensus judgments of felt love, while respondents from larger households are more willing to guess when unsure of consensus."
https://openalex.org/W2329938409,"Tree growth, especially diameter growth of tree stems, is an important issue for understanding the productivity and dynamics of forest stands. Metabolic scaling theory predicted that the 2/3 power of stem diameter at a certain time is a linear function of the 2/3 power of the initial diameter and that the diameter growth rate scales to the 1/3 power of the initial diameter. We tested these predictions of the metabolic scaling theory for 11 Japanese secondary forests at various growth stages. The predictions were not supported by the data, especially in younger stands. Alternatively, we proposed a new theoretical model for stem diameter growth on the basis of six assumptions. All these assumptions were supported by the data. The model produced a nearly linear to curvilinear relationship between the 2/3 power of stem diameters at two different times. It also fitted well to the curvilinear relationship between diameter growth rate and the initial diameter. Our model fitted better than the metabolic scaling theory, suggesting the importance of asymmetric competition among trees, which has not been incorporated in the metabolic scaling theory."
https://openalex.org/W2323606403,"Naegleria sp. is a free living amoeba belonging to the Heterolobosea class. Over 40 species of Naegleria were identified and recovered worldwide in different habitats such as swimming pools, freshwater lakes, soil or dust. Among them, N. fowleri, is a human pathogen responsible for primary amoeboic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Around 300 cases were reported in 40 years worldwide but PAM is a fatal disease of the central nervous system with only 5% survival of infected patients. Since both pathogenic and non pathogenic species were encountered in the environment, detection and dispersal mode are crucial points in the fight against this pathogenic agent. Previous studies on identification and genotyping of N. fowleri strains were focused on RAPD analysis and on ITS sequencing and identified 5 variants: euro-american, south pacific, widespread, cattenom and chooz. Microsatellites are powerful markers in population genetics with broad spectrum of applications (such as paternity test, fingerprinting, genetic mapping or genetic structure analysis). They are characterized by a high degree of length polymorphism. The aim of this study was to genotype N. fowleri strains using microsatellites markers in order to track this population and to better understand its evolution. Six microsatellite loci and 47 strains from different geographical origins were used for this analysis. The microsatellite markers revealed a level of discrimination higher than any other marker used until now, enabling the identification of seven genetic groups, included in the five main genetic groups based on the previous RAPD and ITS analyses. This analysis also allowed us to go further in identifying private alleles highlighting intra-group variability. A better identification of the N. fowleri isolates could be done with this type of analysis and could allow a better tracking of the clinical and environmental N. fowleri strains."
https://openalex.org/W2313779720,"Recently, a modular organisation has been proposed to simplify control of the large number of muscles involved in human walking. Although previous research indicates that a single set of modular activation patterns can account for muscle activity at different speeds, these studies only provide indirect evidence for the idea that speed regulation in human walking is under modular control. Here, a more direct approach was taken to assess the synergistic structure that underlies speed regulation, by isolating speed effects through the construction of gain functions that represent the linear relation between speed and amplitude for each point in the time-normalized gait cycle. The activity of 13 muscles in 13 participants was measured at 4 speeds (0.69, 1.00, 1.31, and 1.61 ms(-1)) during treadmill walking. Gain functions were constructed for each of the muscles, and gain functions and the activity patterns at 1.00 ms(-1) were both subjected to dimensionality reduction, to obtain modular gain functions and modular basis functions, respectively. The results showed that 4 components captured most of the variance in the gain functions (74.0% ± 1.3%), suggesting that the neuromuscular regulation of speed is under modular control. Correlations between modular gain functions and modular basis functions (range 0.58-0.89) and the associated synergistic muscle weightings (range 0.6-0.95) were generally high, suggesting substantial overlap in the synergistic control of the basic phasing of muscle activity and its modulation through speed. Finally, the combined set of modular functions and associated weightings were well capable of predicting muscle activity patterns obtained at a speed (1.31 ms(-1)) that was not involved in the initial dimensionality reduction, confirming the robustness of the presently used approach. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence of synergistic structure in speed regulation, and may inspire further work on flexibility in the modular control of gait."
https://openalex.org/W2323955517,"This study fills demand for data on access and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the Brazilian legal Amazon, a region of localities with identical economic, political, and social problems. We use the 2010 Brazilian Demographic Census to compile data on urban and rural households (i) with computers and Internet access, (ii) with mobile phones, and (iii) with fixed phones. To compare the concentration of access to ICT in the municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon with other regions of Brazil, we use a concentration index to quantify the concentration of households in the following classes: with computers and Internet access, with mobile phones, with fixed phones, and no access. These data are analyzed along with municipal indicators on income, education, electricity, and population size. The results show that for urban households, the average concentration in the municipalities of the Amazon for computers and Internet access and for fixed phones is lower than in other regions of the country; meanwhile, that for no access and mobile phones is higher than in any other region. For rural households, the average concentration in the municipalities of the Amazon for computers and Internet access, mobile phones, and fixed phones is lower than in any other region of the country; meanwhile, that for no access is higher than in any other region. In addition, the study shows that education and income are determinants of inequality in accessing ICT in Brazilian municipalities and that the existence of electricity in rural households is directly associated with the ownership of ICT resources."

We present the first whole-genome study of a Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterium, Mycobacterium sp. UM_CSW (referred to hereafter as UM_CSW), isolated from a patient diagnosed with bronchiectasis. Our data suggest that this clinical isolate is likely a novel mycobacterial species, supported by clear evidence from molecular phylogenetic, comparative genomic, ANI and AAI analyses. UM_CSW is closely related to the Mycobacterium avium complex. While it has characteristic features of an environmental bacterium, it also shows a high pathogenic potential with the presence of a wide variety of putative genes related to bacterial virulence and shares very similar pathogenomic profiles with the known pathogenic mycobacterial species. Thus, we conclude that this possible novel Mycobacterium species should be tightly monitored for its possible causative role in human infections."
https://openalex.org/W33210814,"Empirical descriptions and studies suggest that generally depositors observe a sample of previous decisions before deciding if to keep their funds deposited or to withdraw them. These observed decisions may exhibit different degrees of correlation across depositors. In our model depositors decide sequentially and are assumed to follow the law of small numbers in the sense that they believe that a bank run is underway if the number of observed withdrawals in their sample is large. Theoretically, with highly correlated samples and infinite depositors runs occur with certainty, while with random samples it needs not be the case, as for many parameter settings the likelihood of bank runs is zero. We investigate the intermediate cases and find that i) decreasing the correlation and ii) increasing the sample size reduces the likelihood of bank runs, ceteris paribus. Interestingly, the multiplicity of equilibria, a feature of the canonical Diamond-Dybvig model that we use also, disappears almost completely in our setup. Our results have relevant policy implications."
https://openalex.org/W2320259728,"The maximum parsimony (MP) method for inferring phylogenies is widely used, but little is known about its limitations in non-asymptotic situations. This study employs large-scale computations with simulated phylogenetic data to estimate the probability that MP succeeds in finding the true phylogeny for up to twelve taxa and 256 characters. The set of candidate phylogenies are taken to be unrooted binary trees; for each simulated data set, the tree lengths of all (2n - 5)!! candidates are computed to evaluate quantities related to the performance of MP, such as the probability of finding the true phylogeny, the probability that the tree with the shortest length is unique, the probability that the true phylogeny has the shortest tree length, and the expected inverse of the number of trees sharing the shortest length. The tree length distributions are also used to evaluate and extend the skewness test of Hillis for distinguishing between random and phylogenetic data. The results indicate, for example, that the critical point after which MP achieves a success probability of at least 0.9 is roughly around 128 characters. The skewness test is found to perform well on simulated data and the study extends its scope to up to twelve taxa."
