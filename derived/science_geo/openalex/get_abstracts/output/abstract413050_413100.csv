https://openalex.org/W1996076856,"Affinity tagging, mass spectroscopy and a tailor-made scoring system are used to identify 497 high-confidence interactions between human proteins and human immunodeficiency virus proteins. Nevan Krogan and colleagues report a global analysis of human proteins that interact with the 18 proteins expressed by HIV-1. Using affinity tagging and mass spectrometry combined with a new quantitative scoring system and a high level of validation by co-immunoprecipitation, they identify 497 HIV–human protein–protein interactions, providing new insights into host proteins that could play a part in HIV replication. Functional validation of a few of these hits revealed a number of new factors that inhibit HIV replication, including EIF3d, which is cleaved by HIV protease, and DESP and HEAT1, which interact with integrase and inhibit integration. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a small genome and therefore relies heavily on the host cellular machinery to replicate. Identifying which host proteins and complexes come into physical contact with the viral proteins is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how HIV rewires the host’s cellular machinery during the course of infection. Here we report the use of affinity tagging and purification mass spectrometry1,2,3 to determine systematically the physical interactions of all 18 HIV-1 proteins and polyproteins with host proteins in two different human cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat). Using a quantitative scoring system that we call MiST, we identified with high confidence 497 HIV–human protein–protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins, with ∼40% of the interactions being identified in both cell types. We found that the host proteins hijacked by HIV, especially those found interacting in both cell types, are highly conserved across primates. We uncovered a number of host complexes targeted by viral proteins, including the finding that HIV protease cleaves eIF3d, a subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. This host protein is one of eleven identified in this analysis that act to inhibit HIV replication. This data set facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how the host machinery is manipulated during the course of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2104649441,"X-ray diffraction is used to show that the structural distortion of magnetite below 125 kelvin is to a first approximation caused by charge ordering of its constituent iron ions, but that the localized electrons are distributed over three iron sites to form ‘trimeron’ quasiparticles. In a letter to Nature in 1939, Evert Johannes Willem Verwey described the first example of a low-temperature charge-ordering transition in a solid — the Verwey transition — in the mineral magnetite, Fe3O4 (see go.nature.com/3h2pp1 ). This phenomenon has since been observed in other transition metal oxides, yet despite decades of study, the precise structure of the charge-ordered state in magnetite has remained elusive. The complex structural distortions that characterize the Verwey state have now been determined, revealing an anomalous shortening of some inter-atomic distances. These are suggestive of an unusual charge configuration in which the localized electrons are each distributed over three neighbouring Fe sites. The mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) undergoes a complex structural distortion and becomes electrically insulating at temperatures less than 125 kelvin. Verwey proposed in 1939 that this transition is driven by a charge ordering of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions1, but the ground state of the low-temperature phase has remained contentious2,3 because twinning of crystal domains hampers diffraction studies of the structure4. Recent powder diffraction refinements5,6,7 and resonant X-ray studies8,9,10,11,12 have led to proposals of a variety of charge-ordered and bond-dimerized ground-state models13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we report the full low-temperature superstructure of magnetite, determined by high-energy X-ray diffraction from an almost single-domain, 40-micrometre grain, and identify the emergent order. The acentric structure is described by a superposition of 168 atomic displacement waves (frozen phonon modes), all with amplitudes of less than 0.24 ångströms. Distortions of the FeO6 octahedra show that Verwey’s hypothesis is correct to a first approximation and that the charge and Fe2+ orbital order are consistent with a recent prediction17. However, anomalous shortening of some Fe–Fe distances suggests that the localized electrons are distributed over linear three-Fe-site units, which we call ‘trimerons’. The charge order and three-site distortions induce substantial off-centre atomic displacements and couple the resulting large electrical polarization to the magnetization. Trimerons may be important quasiparticles in magnetite above the Verwey transition and in other transition metal oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2016365513,"Angelman syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletion or mutation of the maternal allele of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). In neurons, the paternal allele of UBE3A is intact but epigenetically silenced, raising the possibility that Angelman syndrome could be treated by activating this silenced allele to restore functional UBE3A protein. Using an unbiased, high-content screen in primary cortical neurons from mice, we identify twelve topoisomerase I inhibitors and four topoisomerase II inhibitors that unsilence the paternal Ube3a allele. These drugs included topotecan, irinotecan, etoposide and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). At nanomolar concentrations, topotecan upregulated catalytically active UBE3A in neurons from maternal Ube3a-null mice. Topotecan concomitantly downregulated expression of the Ube3a antisense transcript that overlaps the paternal copy of Ube3a. These results indicate that topotecan unsilences Ube3a in cis by reducing transcription of an imprinted antisense RNA. When administered in vivo, topotecan unsilenced the paternal Ube3a allele in several regions of the nervous system, including neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, striatum, cerebellum and spinal cord. Paternal expression of Ube3a remained elevated in a subset of spinal cord neurons for at least 12 weeks after cessation of topotecan treatment, indicating that transient topoisomerase inhibition can have enduring effects on gene expression. Although potential off-target effects remain to be investigated, our findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for reactivating the functional but dormant allele of Ube3a in patients with Angelman syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2075049040,"The transcription cofactor CBF-β is shown to regulate the ability of HIV-1 to evade host restriction mediated by the deaminase APOBEC3; it acts by interacting with the HIV protein Vif, so disrupting the Vif–CBF-β interaction could provide a new therapeutic target against HIV-1 infection. The transcription cofactor CBF-β (core binding factor β) regulates the DNA binding activity of RUNX family proteins. Two independent studies now show that CBF-β also regulates the ability of HIV-1 to evade host restriction mediated by the cDNA deaminase APOBEC3G, a host factor that blocks viral replication. They show that it associates with the HIV protein Vif, and is essential for the assembly of the Vif-Cul5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and destruction of APOBEC3. Both groups suggest that disrupting the Vif–CBF-β interaction could provide a new therapeutic target against HIV-1 infection. Restriction factors, such as the retroviral complementary DNA deaminase APOBEC3G, are cellular proteins that dominantly block virus replication1,2,3. The AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), produces the accessory factor Vif, which counteracts the host’s antiviral defence by hijacking a ubiquitin ligase complex, containing CUL5, ELOC, ELOB and a RING-box protein, and targeting APOBEC3G for degradation4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we reveal, using an affinity tag/purification mass spectrometry approach, that Vif additionally recruits the transcription cofactor CBF-β to this ubiquitin ligase complex. CBF-β, which normally functions in concert with RUNX DNA binding proteins, allows the reconstitution of a recombinant six-protein assembly that elicits specific polyubiquitination activity with APOBEC3G, but not the related deaminase APOBEC3A. Using RNA knockdown and genetic complementation studies, we also demonstrate that CBF-β is required for Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G and therefore for preserving HIV-1 infectivity. Finally, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vif also binds to and requires CBF-β to degrade rhesus macaque APOBEC3G, indicating functional conservation. Methods of disrupting the CBF-β–Vif interaction might enable HIV-1 restriction and provide a supplement to current antiviral therapies that primarily target viral proteins."

Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice featuring defective atRAL clearance were used to examine the one or more underlying molecular mechanisms, because exposure to intense light causes severe photoreceptor degeneration in these animals. Here we report that bright light exposure of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice increased atRAL levels in the retina that induced rapid NADPH oxidase-mediated overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, such ROS generation was inhibited by blocking phospholipase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release, indicating that activation occurs upstream of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation. Because multiple upstream G protein-coupled receptors can activate phospholipase C, we then tested the effects of antagonists of serotonin 2A (5-HT2AR) and M3-muscarinic (M3R) receptors and found they both protected Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mouse retinas from light-induced degeneration. Thus, a cascade of signaling events appears to mediate the toxicity of atRAL in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration of Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice.

Oxidative stress is a major mechanism contributing to photoreceptor cell death in animal models of retinal degeneration, including light-induced retinopathy (26Donovan M. Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G.

Tightly regulated low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are needed to mediate physiological functions, including cell survival, growth, differentiation, and metabolism. But excessive production of ROS can damage macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids (28Finkel T. Oxidant signals and oxidative stress.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Thus, aberrant ROS generation constitutes a major mechanism of pathological cell death. NADPH oxidase is the main enzymatic source of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (29Lambeth J.D. NOX enzymes and the biology of reactive oxygen.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), and its product ROS, which is involved in retinal degeneration (30Haruta M. Bush R.A. Kjellstrom S. Vijayasarathy C. Zeng Y.

Rac1, an essential component of the NADPH oxidase complex, is implicated in light-induced retinal degeneration, because Rac1 deficiency partially protects photoreceptor cells against photo-oxidative insult (30Haruta M.

These findings imply that, by causing oxidative stress, NADPH oxidase is mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of some types of retinal degeneration. Although atRAL stimulates the production of superoxide via NADPH oxidase (33Lochner J.E. Badwey J.A. Horn W. Karnovsky M.L.

PLC activation reportedly occurs prior to NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in atRAL-treated neutrophils suggesting that products of PLC enzymatic activity, diacylglycerols and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), could be the intermediates involved in this pathway (33Lochner J.E.

IP3 promotes release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol through binding to an intracellular IP3-receptor, IP3R (36Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S.

Sjölin C. Dahlgren C.

Because PLC is typically activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) coupled to Gq protein (38Rhee S.G. Regulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar), specific GPCRs could affect overall PLC activation, thus mediating atRAL- induced toxic effects. Results from cell culture experiments indicate that atRAL-induced generation of ROS can be mediated through NADPH oxidase. We further investigated the in vivo signaling mechanisms that mediate the action of atRAL in causing ROS production and light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. The results indicate that PLC activation and the resulting second messenger IP3 contribute to atRAL-induced NADPH oxidase activation. The toxic action of atRAL was also diminished by blocking serotonin 2A (5-HT2AR) or M3-muscarinic (M3R) receptors, implicating GPCR participation in the overall process. These observations raise the possibility that certain types of retinal degeneration could be prevented by therapies selectively targeting transient sequestration (buffering) of elevated atRAL, antagonizing a subset of GPCRs, or inhibiting PLC, IP3R, or NADPH oxidase, alone or in combination. Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, generated and genotyped as previously described (20Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-retinal clearance.J. Biol.

Eight- to 12-week-old BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were housed in the Animal Resource Center at the School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, where they were routinely maintained in a 12-h light (less than 10 lux)/12-h dark cycle environment. For bright light exposure experiments, mice were dark-adapted for 24 h prior to illumination at 10,000 lux (150-watt spiral lamp, Commercial Electric) for either 30 min (Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice) or 2 h (BALB/c mice). Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mouse pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide prior to light exposure, whereas BALB/c mice did not require pupil dilation before such exposure. Analyses of retinal structural and functional changes were performed 7 days after bright light exposure. All animal-handling procedures and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University. atRAL was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada). All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), apocynin (APO), diphenyliodonium (DPI), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), ketanserin, and 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were obtained from Sigma.

Ritanserin and 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4-DAMP) were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). ARPE19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The ROS probes, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA, Sigma) or dihydroethidium (DHE, Invitrogen) were added in DMSO at a concentration of 400 nm (final solvent concentration, 1% v/v) after indicated pretreatments and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before cells were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline. ROS signals were subsequently observed at the same exposure setting under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000 B). Fluorescence quantification was performed with Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Thresholds corresponding to fluorescent signals were set from the images, and average fluorescence intensities were recorded for statistical analyses. The ROS probe, DHE, at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight in 25 μl of DMSO, was administered to Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice via intraperitoneal injection 30 min prior to light exposure. Eye cups obtained after removing the cornea, lens, and vitreous body from enucleated eye globes 3 h post light illumination were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cryosections were prepared from fixed eye cups and cut at 12-μm thickness for microscopic assessment of ROS fluorescence in the retina using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Ret-NH2 and pregabalin were administered by gavage to 24-h dark-adapted mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight 2 h before illumination. All other experimental compounds were given to 24 h dark-adapted mice by intraperitoneal injection through a 28-gauge needle at 24 h and 1 h prior to bright light exposure. Tested compounds and their doses were as follows: APO, 50 mg/kg body weight; DPI, 1 mg/kg body weight; U-73122, 6.25 mg/kg body weight; 2-APB, 2.5 mg/kg body weight; ketanserin, 1.25 mg/kg body weight; ritanserin, 3.75 mg/kg body weight; 8-OH-DPAT, 10 mg/kg body weight; and 4-DAMP, 6.25 mg/kg body weight. The gavage volume was 100 μl per treatment. The injected volume of the injected drug did not exceeded 50 μl per animal. Ret-NH2 was prepared in soybean oil. Pregabalin and 8-OH-DPAT were dissolved in water. All other drugs were dissolved in DMSO. Ultra-high resolution SD-Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT, Bioptigen, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used for in vivo imaging of mouse retinas. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture consisting of ketamine (6 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.44 mg/ml) diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 100 mm NaCl given at a dose of 20 μl/g body weight. Pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide prior to imaging. Four frames of OCT images acquired in the B-mode were averaged for presentation. Retinal histology and immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described (41Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F.

Briefly, eye cups freed of cornea, lens, and vitreous body were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde and processed for Epon embedding. Sections of 1-μm thickness were cut and stained with toluidine blue for histological examination under a light microscope. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 12-μm thick cryosections prepared from 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed eye cups. Collected cryosections were stained with DAPI and subjected to examination for rhodopsin, and with peanut agglutinin for cone sheaths. All ERG procedures were performed by published methods (41Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K.

For single-flash recording, the duration of white light flash stimuli (from 20 μs to 1 ms) was adjusted to provide a range of illumination intensities (from −3.7 to 1.6 log cd·s/m2). Three to five recordings were made at sufficient intervals between flash stimuli (from 3 s to 1 min) to allow recovery from any photobleaching effects. Extraction, derivatization, and separation of retinoids were performed, and 11-cis-retinal content was analyzed by HPLC by procedures previously described (41Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V.

Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical analyses were performed using the student's t test for p value calculations. To determine the effect of atRAL on retinal ROS production, we incubated ARPE19 cells, an immortalized human RPE-like cell line susceptible to atRAL-induced cell death, with atRAL followed by examination with a ROS probe. As shown in Fig. 1A, atRAL exposure significantly elevated intracellular ROS production prior to massive cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Because the probe used, DCF-DA, is highly selective for H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals, intracellular ROS levels were also examined by another commonly used ROS probe, DHE, which is especially sensitive to superoxide. Consistently, the intracellular ROS signal-identified DHE probe was markedly increased in ARPE19 cells treated with 30 μm atRAL (Fig. 1B), a concentration that reproducibly caused excessive ARPE19 cell death as reported previously (10Maeda A.

Since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around Sun-like stars1,2, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to the detection of true Earth analogues. The size of an exoplanet can be determined when it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing a decrease in starlight proportional to its radius. The smallest exoplanet hitherto discovered3 has a radius 1.42 times that of the Earth’s radius (R⊕), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. Here we report the discovery of two planets, one Earth-sized (1.03R⊕) and the other smaller than the Earth (0.87R⊕), orbiting the star Kepler-20, which is already known to host three other, larger, transiting planets4. The gravitational pull of the new planets on the parent star is too small to measure with current instrumentation. We apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood of the planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signals result from an eclipsing binary star. Theoretical considerations imply that these planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. The outer planet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere."

In disease, hIAPP undergoes a multistep misfolding process in which the monomer changes into various oligomeric forms and ultimately forms fibrils. A detailed molecular and mechanistic understanding of this process could facilitate therapeutic intervention. However, the three-dimensional structure of hIAPP fibrils or other misfolded forms remains elusive. FT-IR spectroscopy and circular dichroism show that the fibrils contain β-sheet structure (14.Higham C.E. Jaikaran E.T. Fraser P.E. Gross M. Clark A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). According to transmission electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy, hIAPP fibrils can have striated ribbon and twisted fibril morphologies (18.Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N.

A related, albeit slightly different, model has been suggested based upon the x-ray crystal structures of hIAPP fragments (20.Wiltzius J.J. Sievers S.A. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Popov D. Riekel C. Eisenberg D. Atomic structure of the cross-β-spine of islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin).Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Additionally, a number of theoretical models have been proposed for hIAPP fibrils, with one such model suggesting that hIAPP adopts a planar S-shaped fold with three β-strands (residues 8–16, 20–27, and 30–37) stacked in register (21.Kajava A.V.

To obtain more detailed structural insight into the architecture of hIAPP fibrils, we adapted an EPR-based approach previously developed to determine the structure of membrane-bound α-synuclein (22.Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Structure of membrane-bound α-synuclein from site-directed spin labeling and computational refinement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The EPR data are consistent with a structure in which individual hIAPP monomers within the fibril contain two β-strands with an interstrand separation that is greater than predicted in previous models. Computational refinement based on EPR results indicated that the two strands have an out-of plane stagger of about 15 Å. Stacking of multiple monomers results in a left-handed helical twist consistent with that observed for the fibril by electron microscopy. The model provides a basis for understanding the formation, extension, and stability of the hIAPP fibril. Hexafluoroisopropanol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Synthetic wild-type hIAPP was obtained from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). The spin label, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSL), was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Single- and double-cysteine mutants of hIAPP were purchased from Biomer Technology (Pleasanton, CA), with the native cysteines at positions 2 and 7 substituted by alanine (17.Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Identifying structural features of fibrillar islet amyloid polypeptide using site-directed spin labeling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Peptides arrived 95% purified and lyophilized and were stored at −80 °C until use. Purified peptides were reacted with >5 molar excess MTSL for ∼1 h at room temperature. Unreacted MTSL was removed using a Toyopearl cation exchange column. The spin-labeled peptide was desalted using a C18 reverse phase SpinColumn (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and eluted with 100% hexafluoroisopropanol. Peptide concentrations were calculated by UV absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl using an extinction coefficient of 1400 m−1 cm−1. Labeled peptides were stored at −80 °C until use. Stock solutions of spin-labeled hIAPP and wild-type hIAPP were lyophilized and then reconstituted with deionized water containing 0.5% acetic acid. hIAPP fibrils were formed in a spin-diluted state (17.Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Identifying structural features of fibrillar islet amyloid polypeptide using site-directed spin labeling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48420-48425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) by mixing stock solutions of spin-labeled hIAPP with unlabeled hIAPP (1:4 ratio) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. For fibril formation, aliquots of stock hIAPP were added to 10 mm phosphate buffer with 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) in a volume of 100 μl to give a concentration of 100 μm. Wild-type fibrils were grown for 1 week and then sonicated on ice at 1-min intervals using a tip sonicator for 10 min. The sonicated seeds were added to each spin-labeled sample at 10 weight by weight to encourage growth of amyloid fibrils. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 3–7 days to allow fibril formation. To examine fibril growth, 10 μl of fibril samples were adsorbed onto carbon- and Formvar-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution for 5 min. The stained grids were photographed using a JEOL JEM-1400 electron microscope at 80–100 kV. For unilateral metal shadowing experiments, specimens were freeze-dried on a carbon film and a 0.7-nm layer of tantalum/tungsten was deposited from an elevation angle of 30° in a BAL-TEC BAF 060 freeze-fracture machine (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The metal layer was stabilized by a uniform 5-nm carbon layer. Micrographs were recorded on a Philips CM120 microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Fibril samples were pipetted into a glass capillary (0.6-mm inner diameter, 0.84-mm outer diameter, VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ) that was sealed at one end. The sample was centrifuged, and supernatant was removed to eliminate smaller aggregates and free spin labels. EPR spectra of fibrils were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) EMX spectrometer with an HS resonator at 12-milliwatt incident microwave power and a scan range of 150 gauss. Mobility was calculated using the inverse of the central line width: the distance between the peak of the central line and the trough of the third line. Intramolecular distances were measured using four-pulse DEER experiments. Fibril samples were prepared by diluting 3% spin-labeled hIAPP (two spin labels per peptide) with unlabeled hIAPP and seeding with 10.0 wt% sonicated wild-type fibrils. Samples (300 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 3–7 days to allow fibril formation and then ultracentrifuged to remove supernatant containing smaller aggregates. The fibril pellet was collected into a quartz capillary (1.5-mm inner diameter, 1.8-mm outer diameter) and flash-frozen before DEER data were acquired at 78 K. Four-pulse DEER experiments were performed using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 X-band pulse EPR spectrometer fitted with a 3-mm split ring (MS-3) resonator, a continuous flow helium cryostat (CF935), and a temperature controller (ITC503S, all Oxford Instruments). Data were fit using Gaussian distributions (23.Chiang Y.W. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. The determination of pair distance distributions by pulsed ESR using Tikhonov regularization.J. Magn.

Computational refinement of the structure of the hIAPP fibril was performed using distances from DEER experiments (covering residues 12–36 of hIAPP) and data from EM and continuous wave EPR. The model included 101 copies of residues 12–36 of the 37-amino acid hIAPP peptide. The initial model was constructed as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Each peptide was broken into two fragments (residues 12–26 and 27–36). The two fragments were each constructed as β-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis at a distance of 30 Å apart and with a 5 Å space between adjacent strands (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Seventeen spin labels were added to every fourth peptides at residues 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, and 36, beginning from the first peptide (supplemental Fig. S1C). This starting model was based on CD and FT-IR data showing that hIAPP fibrils consist of β-sheets (19.Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R. Tycko R.

Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar). SAMD calculations were performed in AMBER10 (27.Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M.

After a brief minimization (3000 steps) of the starting structure, 10 cycles of SAMD were performed for 160 ps/cycle. Each SAMD cycle included a heating phase from 0 to 1200 K in 4 ps; maintenance of the temperature at 1200 K for a further 6 ps (during the first 10 ps, the force constants for the constraints were increased from 0.1 to 10.0); and then cooling to 0 K over 150 ps, with stepwise adjustments of the TAUTP parameter. SAMD was performed with a time step of 0.001 ps, a distance-dependent dielectric of 4, and a cut-off of 10.0 Å. The two fragments of each peptide were free to move in the SAMD calculations, under the constraints described below. Full details of the parameters and input files used for these calculations will be provided on request. The constraints used in the calculations are shown in supplemental Table S1. DEER distances were implemented with ranges of ±2, ±4, or ±8 (supplemental Table S2) to reflect the width of the experimental distribution qualitatively. The “missing” peptide bond between residues 26 and 27 in each peptide was constrained to distances <5 Å. The distance from the first to the last peptide was limited to 468–481 Å to prevent the fibril from bending. Several sets of calculations were performed with inclusion of constraints of the helical pitch of the fibril, based on the data from EM, with the goal of producing structures with pitches ranging from 200 to 4000 Å. The pitch constraint was implemented based on the assumption of an ∼5 Å interpeptide distance (as defined in the starting structure) and constraint of torsional angles between the β-strands of peptides i and i+10 in the fibril (supplemental Table S1). Thus, for example, a pitch of 500 Å is equivalent to a full helical turn over 100 peptides; therefore, the required torsional angle is −36° (for a left-handed helix) between the β-strands of peptides i and i+10. The equation used to generate the torsional constraints for a given pitch and details of the implementation of the constraints are given in a footnote to supplemental Table S1. SAMD calculations were also performed with no constraint of the pitch. Structures were collected at the end of each SAMD cycle, giving a total of 10 structures. Each of these was energy-minimized (500 steps) to connect the missing peptide bonds and replace the spin labels with the original amino acids. Structural analysis was performed using AMBER10 (27.Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J.

PROCHECK: a program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) for checking the integrity of the structure. The chirality and pitch of the fibril helix, the distance between the two β-sheets, and the stagger of each peptide were analyzed using the in-house program FIBRIL. Distances between label pairs in the modeling structures were calculated and compared with the experimental DEER distances. Because hIAPP fibrils can be polymorphic, we first developed a protocol involving multiple rounds of seeding that resulted in a relatively homogeneous fibril preparation. This approach yielded wild-type hIAPP fibrils with a predominantly (∼95%) twisted morphology (Fig. 1A) and a left-handed coil according to unilateral shadowing EM (Fig. 1B). These fibrils were used as seeds to induce formation of spin-labeled fibrils, which were grown from a mixture of labeled peptide and an excess of wild-type peptide (75% for singly labeled and 97% for doubly labeled peptides). According to negative stain electron microscopy, the resultant spin-labeled fibrils had the same morphology as those of the wild-type fibrils (Fig. 1, C and D). Next, 28 sets of hIAPP fibrils containing singly labeled peptides were analyzed by continuous wave EPR spectroscopy to obtain site-specific mobility and secondary structure information. The EPR spectra obtained under these conditions (supplemental Fig. S2) are highly sensitive to the label motion, which can be quantified using the inverse central line width (ΔHo−1), a commonly used semiquantitative mobility parameter. We found that residues 2 and 4 have high ΔHo−1 values, indicating that this N-terminal region is disordered in hIAPP fibrils. Residues 11–36 have generally low mobility values. Despite the general immobilization, enough contrast remains to reveal two regions (14–19 and 31–36) in which ΔHo−1 alternates with a periodicity of 2. Such a periodicity is commonly observed for β-sheet structures in which one face is more buried than the other. Because residue 13 was not included in the present study, it was not possible to monitor the periodicity starting from residue 12. However, based upon distance measurements presented below, residues 12 and 13 are included in one of the two β-strand regions (Fig. 2, blue). Residues 12–19 and 31–36 are also located within regions previously assigned to be in β-strand conformations according to solid-state NMR (Fig. 2). Residues 7–10 appear to be in a transition region in which the mobility is between that of the extreme N terminus and the most immobilized regions. No clear periodicity could be observed for the intrastrand region, which has previously been suggested to contain little or no β-sheet structure in hIAPP fibrils (19.Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R.

The solid-state NMR study investigated hIAPP fibrils with different morphology, but the assignment of secondary structure is in remarkably good agreement with our data, suggesting that regions of secondary structure may be similar in fibrils of different morphology. The EPR mobility data are consistent with the two-stranded, horseshoe-like model (Fig. 3) that has frequently been suggested for hIAPP and peptides in other amyloid fibrils (29.Antzutkin O.N.

To test this model, intramolecular interlabel distances were determined in fibrils containing 18 different doubly labeled hIAPP peptides mixed with a 97% excess of wild-type hIAPP. None of these spectra displayed strong spin-spin interactions, which are typically seen for spin labels ≤15 Å apart (supplemental Fig. S3). To increase the range of the EPR distance measurements, four-pulse DEER experiments were performed (supplemental Fig. S4). First, we measured distances between residues expected to be in a β-sheet region (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S4A). Because a β-strand typically extends by ∼3.5 Å/amino acid, two spin labels (referred to here as R1) introduced at the i and i+6 positions should be ∼21 Å apart. The DEER measurements (Fig. 3B) are in excellent agreement with this prediction because the distances for the 12R1/18R1 and 13R1/19R1 pairs are 22 and 21 Å, respectively (Fig. 3A). The labels for the 13R1/18R1 and 14R1/19R1 pairs are spaced 5 amino acids apart, but the labels are facing in opposite directions and are predicted to be ∼20 Å apart. Again, the experimental distances support the presence of a β-strand for residues 12–19. Next, we measured 14 additional distances to investigate the spatial relationship between the two β-strands and other regions of the molecule (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S4B). Most of these distances (Fig. 3B) are inconsistent with the model presented in Fig. 3A. This is particularly apparent for the inter-β-strand distances (13R1/32R1; 13R1/35R1; 13R1/36R1; 14R1/32R1; 17R1/35R1), which range from 26 to 33 Å and are ∼20 Å longer than expected. Similarly, a number of distances between strand 1 and the non-β-strand region (20.Wiltzius J.J. Sievers S.A. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Popov D. Riekel C. Eisenberg D.

The DEER data clearly reveal long distances between the strands, and the distributions for interstrand distances are wider than those for residues that are within the same strand (supplemental Fig. S4). This could indicate some structural heterogeneity within the fibrils, with somewhat variable orientations between the strands. However, it should also be noted that the accuracy with which the distance distributions can be determined is higher for the smaller distances because these require only short data acquisition times in four-pulse DEER experiments. To generate structural models, we performed SAMD calculations using the EPR data as constraints. The calculations included a stack of 101 peptides with every fourth peptide being spin-labeled (supplemental Fig. S1), and a family of 10 structural models was generated. Remarkably, all of these models spontaneously exhibited left-handed helical structures that resemble the overall twisted morphology seen in the EM images. The mean pitch of the helix was 237.0 ± 13.5 Å (supplemental Table S3), which corresponds to a complete helical turn over about 50 peptides. This pitch is at the lower end of the range of pitches seen by EM. This could be due to the calculations including only a single stack of peptides, whereas the EM images (Fig. 1) show protofilaments wrapped around each other to form fibrils with variable pitches of 250 to about 1000 Å. Therefore, further SAMD calculations were performed (supplemental Tables S4–S7) to determine whether the DEER distances could also be consistent with these longer pitches. Calculations in which the pitch was nominally constrained to 250 Å (supplemental Table S4), 500 Å (supplemental Table S5), and 1000 Å (supplemental Table S6), respectively, gave structures with average pitches of 242.7 ± 4.4, 448.3 ± 10.6, and 833.0 ± 42.3 Å, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5). With stronger constraints, we were able to generate helical structures (all left-handed) with much larger pitches (supplemental Table S7). One of the best established geometrical parameters for hIAPP fibrils is the distance between the β-sheets, which has been determined to be about 10 Å by electron diffraction (16.Sumner Makin O. Serpell L.C. Structural characterization of islet amyloid polypeptide fibrils.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Calculation of this “sheet-to-sheet” distance for the derived models gave values of 8.8 ± 0.3, 10.8 ± 0.2, and 12.6 ± 0.4 Å for mean helical pitches of 242.7, 448.3, and 833.0 Å, respectively (supplemental Tables S4–S6), but much higher sheet-to-sheet distances for larger pitches (supplemental Table S7). DEER data were also inconsistent with helical pitches >1000 Å. For example, the mean 13R1/35R1 distance in models with pitches ≤1000 Å was consistent with the DEER distance, but this consistency was lost in models with higher helical pitches (supplemental Fig. S6). The 13R1/35R1 distance spans the two β-sheets and should be sensitive to the sheet-to-sheet distance. Therefore, we suggest that these results support an upper limit for the helical pitch of close to 1000 Å, about the same as that seen in the EM images. A structural model with a pitch of about 500 Å is shown in Fig. 4. The peptide conformation has a horseshoe shape (Fig. 4A), but with the important distinction that one β-strand is displaced with respect to the plane of the second β-strand (Fig. 4B). This displacement can be seen by observing the location of a single peptide in the fibril (Fig. 4, C and D), in which the two β-strands within each peptide have a stagger of about ∼15 Å, causing one β-strand in peptide i to be adjacent to the opposite β-strand in peptide i+3. The resulting helical twist produced by this arrangement of peptides is shown in Fig. 4E. In this study, we investigated the structure of hIAPP fibrils using electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and computational refinement. The EPR data are consistent with a peptide conformation with two β-strands forming two opposing β-sheets that wrap around one another, but the long interstrand distances are inconsistent with previous models. Our computational refinement revealed that the two strands in each peptide are staggered by about 15 Å, and this staggered relationship leads to a left-handed twisted morphology within the protofilament. This stagger is not present in the model of striated ribbon fibrils (19.Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R. Tycko R. Peptide conformation and supramolecular organization in amylin fibrils: constraints from solid-state NMR.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13505-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and may represent the underlying structural difference between those two morphologies. An interesting consequence of the twisted arrangement with staggered β-strands is the significant exposure of a hydrophobic surface at the fibril ends. These “sticky ends” are likely to promote the capture of further monomeric hIAPP and thus may facilitate fibril elongation. A detailed analysis of the geometry of the derived models indicated an upper limit for the helical pitch of about 1000 Å. Comparison of structures with different pitches revealed only small differences in peptide conformation and slight changes in the angle between adjacent β-strands, but these differences resulted in significant differences in the helical pitch. The general consistency between the structures derived at an atomic level and the macroscopic EM images is remarkable, particularly because only a single stack of peptides was used in the computational refinement. Our findings provide a direct connection between the macroscopic EM images and a structural model at the molecular level. The finding that minor structural changes at the monomer level can lead to significant variations in the long-range twist could explain why fibrils of hIAPP and other amyloid proteins can vary significantly in twist along the fibril axis (16.Sumner Makin O. Serpell L.C. Structural characterization of islet amyloid polypeptide fibrils.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18.Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N.

Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Subtle structural changes might occur during fibril growth, and such changes could be sufficient to result in a significant alteration in fibril pitch. We note that our structural models only consider a single stack of peptides and that additional restrictions may occur from the wrapping of multiple structures around each other within fibrils or perhaps also within protofilaments (19.Luca S. Yau W.M. Leapman R. Tycko R. Peptide conformation and supramolecular organization in amylin fibrils: constraints from solid-state NMR.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13505-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The twisted arrangement of the protofilaments and the out-of-plane stagger of each monomer also suggest a reason for the particular stability of hIAPP fibrils. This arrangement results in the absence of a discrete plane of hydrogen bonds orthogonal to the fibril axis, and thus, there is no plane that would be susceptible to fracture. Although a small stagger has been inferred from mutagenesis data (30.Lührs T. Ritter C. Adrian M. Riek-Loher D. Bohrmann B. Döbeli H. Schubert D. Riek R. Three-dimensional structure of Alzheimer amyloid-β(1–42) fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17342-17347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) and solid-state NMR results (32.Petkova A.T. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Experimental constraints on quaternary structure in Alzheimer β-amyloid fibrils.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 498-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) for amyloid-beta fibrils, the present results differ significantly from all previously proposed fibril structures. The difference arises from the ability to determine long-range distances, which are essential for defining the overall structure and defining the stagger between the two β-strands. These distances complement those from solid-state NMR, which is effective for determining distances <10 Å. The refined family of structures represents the first example in which structural investigation at the atomistic level is able to reproduce the overall morphology observed by EM. In our previous studies, we have combined continuous wave and pulsed EPR with computational refinement to investigate structures of membrane proteins (22.Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S.

https://openalex.org/W2112316968,"Ascent to high altitude is associated with a fall in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen (hypobaric hypoxia). For oxidative tissues such as skeletal muscle, resultant cellular hypoxia necessitates acclimatization to optimize energy metabolism and restrict oxidative stress, with changes in gene and protein expression that alter mitochondrial function. It is known that lowlanders returning from high altitude have decreased muscle mitochondrial densities, yet the underlying transcriptional mechanisms and time course are poorly understood. To explore these, we measured gene and protein expression plus ultrastructure in muscle biopsies of lowlanders at sea level and following exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Subacute exposure (19 d after initiating ascent to Everest base camp, 5300 m) was not associated with mitochondrial loss. After 66 d at altitude and ascent beyond 6400 m, mitochondrial densities fell by 21%, with loss of 73% of subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Correspondingly, levels of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α fell by 35%, suggesting down-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Sustained hypoxia also decreased expression of electron transport chain complexes I and IV and UCP3 levels. We suggest that during subacute hypoxia, mitochondria might be protected from oxidative stress. However, following sustained exposure, mitochondrial biogenesis is deactivated and uncoupling down-regulated, perhaps to improve the efficiency of ATP production."
https://openalex.org/W1998118058,"Since angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)] is a non-renin dependent alternate precursor for the generation of cardiac Ang peptides in rat tissue, we investigated the metabolism of Ang-(1-12) by plasma membranes (PM) isolated from human atrial appendage tissue from nine patients undergoing cardiac surgery for primary control of atrial fibrillation (MAZE surgical procedure). PM was incubated with highly purified 125I-Ang-(1-12) at 37°C for 1 h with or without renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors [lisinopril for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), SCH39370 for neprilysin (NEP), MLN-4760 for ACE2 and chymostatin for chymase; 50 µM each]. 125I-Ang peptide fractions were identified by HPLC coupled to an inline γ-detector. In the absence of all RAS inhibitor, 125I-Ang-(1-12) was converted into Ang I (2±2%), Ang II (69±21%), Ang-(1-7) (5±2%), and Ang-(1-4) (2±1%). In the absence of all RAS inhibitor, only 22±10% of 125I-Ang-(1-12) was unmetabolized, whereas, in the presence of the all RAS inhibitors, 98±7% of 125I-Ang-(1-12) remained intact. The relative contribution of selective inhibition of ACE and chymase enzyme showed that 125I-Ang-(1-12) was primarily converted into Ang II (65±18%) by chymase while its hydrolysis into Ang II by ACE was significantly lower or undetectable. The activity of individual enzyme was calculated based on the amount of Ang II formation. These results showed very high chymase-mediated Ang II formation (28±3.1 fmol×min−1×mg−1, n = 9) from 125I-Ang-(1-12) and very low or undetectable Ang II formation by ACE (1.1±0.2 fmol×min−1×mg−1). Paralleling these findings, these tissues showed significant content of chymase protein that by immunocytochemistry were primarily localized in atrial cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time in human cardiac tissue a dominant role of cardiac chymase in the formation of Ang II from Ang-(1-12)."
https://openalex.org/W2015047834,"In physiological conditions, both β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and cellular prion (PrP(c)) undergo similar disintegrin-mediated α-secretase cleavage yielding N-terminal secreted products referred to as soluble amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα) and N1, respectively. We recently demonstrated that N1 displays neuroprotective properties by reducing p53-dependent cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the potential of N1 as a neuroprotector against amyloid β (Aβ)-mediated toxicity. We first show that both recombinant sAPPα and N1, but not its inactive parent fragment N2, reduce staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activation and TUNEL-positive cell death by lowering p53 promoter transactivation and activity in human cells. We demonstrate that N1 also lowers toxicity, cell death, and p53 pathway exacerbation triggered by Swedish mutated βAPP overexpression in human cells. We designed a CHO cell line overexpressing the London mutated βAPP (APP(LDN)) that yields Aβ oligomers. N1 protected primary cultured neurons against toxicity and cell death triggered by oligomer-enriched APP(LDN)-derived conditioned medium. Finally, we establish that N1 also protects neurons against oligomers extracted from Alzheimer disease-affected brain tissues. Overall, our data indicate that a cellular prion catabolite could interfere with Aβ-associated toxicity and that its production could be seen as a cellular protective mechanism aimed at compensating for an sAPPα deficit taking place at the early asymptomatic phase of Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2038504801,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is essential for many signaling pathways and cellular processes. As Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) functions in many of the same processes, we investigated a role for APC in the regulation of GSK-3-dependent signaling. We find that APC directly enhances GSK-3 activity. Furthermore, knockdown of APC mimics inhibition of GSK-3 by reducing phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and by activating mTOR, revealing novel roles for APC in the regulation of these enzymes. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 through an unknown mechanism, and this results in both stabilization of β-catenin and activation of mTOR. We therefore hypothesized that Wnts may regulate GSK-3 by disrupting the interaction between APC and the Axin-GSK-3 complex. We find that Wnts rapidly induce APC dissociation from Axin, correlating with β-catenin stabilization. Furthermore, Axin interaction with the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 causes APC dissociation from Axin. We propose that APC regulates multiple signaling pathways by enhancing GSK-3 activity, and that Wnts induce APC dissociation from Axin to reduce GSK-3 activity and activate downstream signaling. APC regulation of GSK-3 also provides a novel mechanism for Wnt regulation of multiple downstream effectors, including β-catenin and mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W2089464893,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a peptide hormone cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells. In type II diabetes, IAPP aggregates in a process that is associated with β-cell dysfunction and loss of β-cell mass. The relationship between IAPP's conformational landscape and its capacity to mediate cell death remains poorly understood. We have addressed these unknowns by comparing the cytotoxic effects of sequence variants with differing α-helical and amyloid propensities. IAPP was previously shown to oligomerize cooperatively on binding to lipid bilayers. Here, comparable transitions are evident in cell culture and are associated with a change in subcellular localization to the mitochondria under toxic conditions. Notably, we find that this toxic gain of function maps to IAPP's capacity to adopt aggregated membrane-bound α-helical, and not β-sheet, states. Our findings suggest that upon α-helical mediated oligomerization, IAPP acquires cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) properties, facilitating access to the mitochondrial compartment, resulting in its dysfunction."

However, sex-specific differences and the role of estradiol in ocular inflammatory-reparative responses are not well understood. We found that female mice exhibited delayed corneal epithelial wound closure and attenuated polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte responses, a phenotype recapitulated by estradiol treatment both in vivo (topically in male mice) and in vitro (corneal epithelial cell wound healing). The cornea expresses 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) and receptors for lipoxinA4 (LXA4), which have been implicated in an intrinsic lipid circuit that regulates corneal inflammation and wound healing. Delayed epithelial wound healing correlated with lower expression of 15-LOX in the regenerated epithelium of female mice. Estradiol in vitro and in vivo down-regulated epithelial 15-LOX expression and LXA4 formation, while estradiol abrogation of epithelial wound healing was completely reversed by treatment with LXA4. More important, ERβ and ERα selectively regulated epithelial wound healing, PMN cell recruitment, and activity of the intrinsic 15-LOX/LXA4 circuit. Our results demonstrate for the first time a sex-specific difference in the corneal reparative response, which is mediated by ERβ and ERα selective regulation of the epithelial and PMN 15-LOX/LXA4 circuit. These findings may provide novel insights into the etiology of sex-specific ocular inflammatory diseases.—Wang, S. B., Hu, K. M., Seamon, K.J., Mani, V., Chen, Y., Gronert, K.

Cofilin-actin aggregates are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but how cofilin-actin aggregation induces pathological effects in the CNS remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that cofilin rods disrupted dendritic microtubule integrity in rat hippocampal cultures. Long term time-lapse imaging revealed that cofilin rods block intracellular trafficking of both mitochondria and early endosomes. Importantly, cofilin rod formation induced a significant loss of SV2 and PSD-95 puncta as well as dendritic spines. Cofilin rods also impaired local glutamate receptor responses. We discovered an inverse relationship between the number of synaptic events and the accumulation of cofilin rods in dendrites. We also detected cofilin rods in aging rat brains in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2048289427,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3β to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3β activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3β, or at Thr-668, the GSK3β phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3β activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3β kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease."

Consequently, this transdimer may present a unique repertoire of autoantigen-derived peptides triggering a pathogenic response that ultimately leads to beta cell destruction. However, the binding characteristics of the HLA-DQ transdimers are poorly understood. In this study we have generated HLA-DQ2trans HLA-DQ8trans molecules and determined which peptides are naturally bound to these transdimers. Moreover, we designed transdimer-specific peptide binding assays and employed these to determine the requirements for peptide binding to transdimers in detail. The results demonstrate that both transdimers have vastly different peptide binding properties. Finally, we have used the novel binding motifs to identify potential beta cell autoantigen-derived epitopes specifically presented by HLA-DQ8trans. A set of bicistronic lentiviral vectors containing the α-chain (DQA1*05:01 or DQA1*03:01) or the β-chain (DQB1*03:02, DQB1*02:01) coding sequences and, respectively, a GFP- or a puromycin-resistant gene were generated. Third generation lentiviruses were produced following standard procedures (18.Carlotti F. Bazuine M. Kekarainen T. Seppen J. Pognonec P. Maassen J.A. Hoeben R.C. Lentiviral vectors efficiently transduce quiescent mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, lentiviral vectors (pRRL-CMV-GOI-GFP/puro) were co-transfected with “helper” plasmids, encoding HIV-1 gag-pol (HIV-1 rev and HIV-1 VSV-G envelope) into 293T cells. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested after 48 and 72 h, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and stored until use at −80 °C. Virus titers were estimated by ELISA for HIV p24 level (ZeptoMetrix Corp.). For cotransductions of HEK293 cells, virus-containing supernatants were added to fresh media supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and cells were incubated overnight. Transduced cells were cell-sorted for high DQ expression by FACS using GFP and an anti-DQ antibody (SPV-L3). By this, HEK293 cells expressed only one type of HLA-DQ molecule; DQA1*05:01/DQB1*02:01 (HLA-DQ2cis), DQA1*03:01/DQB1*03:02 (HLA-DQ8cis), DQA1*03:01/DQB1*02:01 (HLA-DQ2trans), or DQA1*05:01/DQB1*03:02 (HLA-DQ8trans). HLA-DQ2trans and HLA-DQ8trans molecules were isolated from the transduced HEK293 cells. Peptide elutions were performed as follows. Approximately 1010 cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and l-glutamine. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors (complete inhibitor mix, Roche Applied Science)) and subsequently centrifuged for 60 min at 10.000 × g to remove nuclei and insoluble material. Lysates were precleared with Sepharose beads and mixed with Sepharose beads coupled with a pan-DQ antibody (SPV-L3). After 60 min of incubation the beads were washed with 5 bed volumes lysis buffer subsequently followed by 4 bed volumes of low salt buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 8 bed volumes of high salt buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 4 bed volumes of no salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 4 bed volumes of low Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The HLA-peptide complexes were eluted with 5 bed volumes of 10% acetic acid. To remove high molecular mass HLA molecules, a filtration step with a Centriprep filtration unit with a cutoff value of 10 kDa was used. The peptide fraction was freeze-dried and redissolved in 200 μl of 10% acetic acid. Fractionation was performed with an HPLC system (see below). The material was eluted using a gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid. The complex MHC-peptide pool was prefractionated on a C18 reverse phase HPLC system (200 μm × 15 cm; Reprosil-C18-AQ 3 μm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany). Fractions were reduced to near dryness, and 95/3/0.1 v/v/v water/acetonitrile/formic acid was added. Fractions were subsequently analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides were characterized by nanoflow liquid chromatography using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) coupled on line to a 7-tesla LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany). The chromatographic system consisted of the following components. ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ3 μm was used as a resin for the analytical nano column, and AQUA-C18 5 μm was used as a resin for the trapping column. Columns were prepared in house. The end of the nanocolumn was drawn to a tip (ID ∼5 μm), from which the eluent was sprayed into the mass spectrometer. Peptides were trapped at 5 μl/min on a 1-cm column (100-μm internal diameter, packed in house) and eluted to a 15-cm column (50-μm internal diameter, packed in house) at 150 nl/min in a 60-min gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the FT-ICR-MS with a resolution of 25,000 at a target value of 5,000,000. The two most intense ions were then isolated for accurate mass measurements by a selected ion monitoring scan in FT-ICR with a resolution of 50,000 at a target accumulation value of 50,000. The selected ions were fragmented in the linear ion trap using collision-induced dissociation at a target value of 10,000. In a post analysis process, raw data were converted to peak lists using Bioworks Browser software, Version 3.1. For protein identification, MS/MS data were submitted to the human IPI data base using Mascot Version 2.4 (Matrix Science) with the following settings: 5 ppm and 0.8-Da deviation for precursor and fragment masses, respectively; no enzyme was specified. All reported hits were assessed manually, and peptides with MASCOT scores <45 were discarded. Homology modeling of the complexes between the two HLA-DQtrans molecules and eluted antigenic peptides was performed as previously described (19.Eerligh P. van Lummel M. Zaldumbide A. Moustakas A.K.

The HLA-DQ trans molecules were obtained by aligning the Cα of HLA-DQ2cis and HLA-DQ8cis in the β-pleated sheet regions of the α1β1 domains of these molecules and making the transdimers by selecting the α-chain and β-chain of the corresponding cis dimers. Energy minimization of each respective complex, unless otherwise noted, was carried out via the program Discover of Accelrys (San Diego, CA) on Silicon Graphics Fuel and Indigo instruments using 1000 cycles of the steepest gradient approach followed by 1000 cycles of the conjugate gradient approach. As outlined previously, homology modeling can be used to predict the physicochemical features of the pockets of the HLA-DQ2/8 trans molecules to a certain extent, and this information was used to identify the most likely nine-amino acid binding core in the eluted peptides. When alignment was equivocal, alternative alignments were tried and verified by energy minimization. All structures were examined for atomic clashes via the Discover program. Graphical representations were performed via the WebLabViewer (Version 3.5) and DSViewer Pro programs of Accelrys. The numbering of the residues in the amino acid sequences of the DQA and DQB molecules was done according to the scheme suggested by Fremont et al. (22.Fremont D.H. Monnaie D. Nelson C.A.

All modeled structures as Protein Data Bank coordinates are available in the supplemental material. Peptides were synthesized according to standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using a SyroII peptide synthesizer (MultiSynTech, Witten, Germany). The integrity of the peptides was checked using reverse phase HPLC and MS. Peptides to be tested as potential epitopes were synthesized as 13-mers containing two alanines both at the N and C termini. A heat map attempts to visualize all the amino acid occurrences for all positions in one picture (24.Colaert N. Helsens K. Martens L. Vandekerckhove J. Gevaert K.

The heat map represents a two-dimensional data matrix where every row is an amino acid and every column is a position and gives an overview of the preferred and non-preferred residues per position in the HLA-DQ binding core. One cell in the heat map matrix will be colored according to the calculated p value for that position and amino acid. The p value used for each analysis is 0.05. Only significantly up- and down-regulated residues according to the given p value 0.05 are colored in, respectively, a shade of green and red. The non-regulated elements are colored black. HLA-peptide binding assays were performed as described previously (25.Stepniak D. Wiesner M. de Ru A.H. Moustakas A.K. Drijfhout J.W. Papadopoulos G.K. van Veelen P.A. Koning F.

In short, FluoroNunc 96-well plates were coated with the pan-DQ-antibody SPV-L3. Plates were washed, blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and whole cell lysates (using Nonidet P-40 as detergent) of DQ-expressing HEK293 cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Titration ranges of the tested peptides (from 0 to 300 μm) were prepared with or without a fixed concentration (0.6 μm) of biotinylated indicator peptide depending on the type of assay (competition or direct). Subsequently, the peptide sample was applied to the wells containing binding buffer. After incubation, plates were washed, and europium-streptavidin in assay buffer was added to each well followed by incubation while shaking. After washing, wells were incubated with enhancement buffer. Plates were read using a time-resolved fluorometer (1234, Wallac). EC50 values were calculated based upon the observed binding of the tested peptides against the fixed concentration indicator peptide; the concentration of tested peptide required for half-maximal inhibition of binding of the reporter peptide indicate the EC50 value. A tailored data base of all the known protein sequences of beta cell proteins was built by extraction of relevant entries from several databases at the European Bioinformatics Institute with the SRS system. These databases include: UniProtKB, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, UniRef100, UniRef90, UniRef50, uniParc, refSeq Proteome, IPI, Refseq Proteome (release), Refseq Proteome (updates), MHCBN, Swall(SPTR), PIR, RemTrEMBL. The following search terms (keywords) were included: organism: Homo sapiens AND beta cell, OR pancreatic islet, OR islet of Langerhans. This data base contained, but was not restricted to, all well known diabetogenic proteins, including islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP), glutamic acid decarboxylase, isoform 65 (GAD65), glutamic acid decarboxylase, isoform 67 (GAD67), IA-2, preproinsulin, phogrin, zinc transporter-8 (ZnT-8), and islet cell autoantigen 69-kDa (ICA69). To generate cells that selectively express one kind of HLA-DQ molecule (HLA-DQ2cis, HLA-DQ8cis, HLA-DQ2trans, or HLA-DQ8trans), lentiviral constructs were generated encoding either the α- or β-chain from HLA-DQ2cis or HLA-DQ8cis. These constructs were used to infect HEK293 cells that do not naturally express HLA class II molecules. The resulting HEK293 cells stably expressed the desired HLA-DQ dimers. FACS sorting was used to isolate clones with high HLA-DQ expression. GFP expression correlated with expression of the HLA-DQA1 chains, and an antigen-processing cell (APC)-conjugated pan-HLA-DQ antibody (SPV-L3) was used to detect HLA-DQ expression (Fig. 1). HLA-DQ2- and HLA-DQ8 transdimers were isolated from the appropriate HEK293 cells by affinity purification. Subsequently, the bound peptides were eluted with acid and separated from the high molecular weight material by filtration. The resulting peptide pools were fractionated by reversed phase HPLC, and the peptides present were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. This resulted in the identification of 313 peptides for HLA-DQ2trans and 531 peptides for HLA-DQ8trans. Typically, and in agreement with previous studies, several length variants of most peptides were found. The 313 peptides eluted from HLA-DQ2trans represented 79 unique sequences, and the 531 HLA-DQ8trans peptides represented 180 unique sequences. To identify the putative nine-amino acid binding cores in the eluted peptides, we made use of the previously reported peptide binding motifs of HLA-DQ2cis and HLA-DQ8cis (21.Moustakas A.K. van de Wal Y. Routsias J. Kooy Y.M. van Veelen P. Drijfhout J.W. Koning F. Papadopoulos G.K.

HLA-DQ2cis prefers large hydrophobic and aromatic residues at positions p1/p9 and negatively charged residues at p4/p6/p7. HLA-DQ8cis has a preference for acidic residues at positions p1/p9 and secondary aliphatic/aromatic residues at p1 and mainly aliphatic residues at the central positions (p4/p6). The HLA-DQ transdimers are predicted to share some of the binding features of HLA-DQ2cis at the N terminus of the peptide and some of HLA-DQ8cis at the C terminus. To confirm this notion, we used molecular simulations to verify that predictions made on the basis of the properties of HLA-DQ2cis and HLA-DQ8cis are likely to be valid for the HLA-DQ transdimers as well. Altogether, this yielded enough information on the preference of the putative binding pockets in the HLA-DQ transdimers to predict the 9-amino acid binding core for 132 HLA-DQ2trans-eluted peptides and 277 HLA-DQ8trans-eluted peptides. Table 1 shows examples of the alignment and core predictions of length variants of nucleobinding-2-eluted peptides from HLA-DQ2trans and thioredoxin eluted peptides from HLA-DQ8trans. For a number of eluted HLA-DQ2trans and HLA-DQ8trans peptides (<0.1% of the eluted unique peptides) core sequences could not be identified (data not shown). All unique eluted peptides and their predicted nine-amino acid core and anchor residues are shown in supplemental Table 1.TABLE 1Alignment and core predictions of length variants of nucleobinding-2-eluted peptides from DQ2trans- and thioredoxin-eluted peptides from DQ8trans* The residues in italics constitute an alternative binding register, although weaker because of p60. Open table in a new tab * The residues in italics constitute an alternative binding register, although weaker because of p60. To verify the correctness of the predicted binding cores, we randomly selected a panel of eight HLA-DQ2trans- and eight HLA-DQ8trans-eluted peptides and tested these for binding to HLA-DQ2trans and HLA-DQ8trans in a cell-free binding assay. Peptides were synthesized as 13-mers containing the predicted 9-amino acid core flanked by two alanine residues at both the N and C termini of the peptide and a biotin label linked to the N terminus of the peptide. We observed that 15 of the 16 peptides tested bound to the respective HLA-DQ transdimer from which they had been isolated (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, only 1 of 8 HLA-DQ8trans peptides bound to HLA-DQ2trans, and 3 of 8 HLA-DQ2trans peptides bound to HLA-DQ8trans (data not shown). These data indicate that in the majority of the peptides the prediction of the binding core was successful. Moreover, the results suggest that HLA-DQ8trans, compared with HLA-DQ2trans, is less selective in binding peptides. The results of these direct peptide binding studies were used to select an indicator peptide for each HLA-DQ transdimer to establish a competitive peptide binding assay, which allows a more quantitative comparison of the affinity of HLA-peptide binding. As indicator peptides, we selected the peptides AAEAALEAEEWAA for HLA-DQ2trans and AAPHTTQPAVEAA for HLA-DQ8trans. Based on the results from the direct peptide binding assay, both are expected to be high affinity binding peptides (HLA-DQ2trans, 33.1 ± 3.5 μm; HLA-DQ8trans, 39.6 ± 4.8 μm), which minimizes the change of detecting false positive binders in a competitive peptide binding assay. Initially, these indicator peptides were examined for specific binding by testing them for self-competition in a competitive peptide binding assay with both HLA-DQ transdimers (Fig. 2, C and D). The results demonstrate that both indicator peptides bound to their respective HLA-DQ transdimer but not to the other transdimer, indicating that they are suitable for use in the competitive binding assay. Next, we tested the two panels of selected peptides in the competitive binding assay to exclude potential false positive binders in the direct binding assay. The results show that only one HLA-DQ2trans peptide did not bind properly, as indicated by the lack of a correct S-shaped binding curve (EC50 > 100 μm) (Fig. 3). The calculated EC50 values obtained were in general lower for HLA-DQ2trans (Fig. 3C) than EC50 values for HLA-DQ8trans (Fig. 3D), but these values cannot be directly compared, precluding assigning differences in overall peptide binding affinity. In contrast to the direct binding assay, we observed proper binding to DQ8trans of the peptide harboring the core nonamer EAGSAVEAE (data not shown). This inconsistency might be caused by the presence of a biotin in the peptide used in the direct binding assay, whereas this is absent in the peptide used in the competitive assay. Although the results support the notion that the nine-amino acid binding cores were generally correctly predicted, it is of note that peptide AAESGTSAADEAA displayed the lowest affinity for DQ8trans, whereas the residues at the anchor positions p1/p4/p6/p7/p9 fulfill the HLA-DQ8trans binding motif. Obviously, other factors also co-determine the binding of the peptide to the HLA-DQ transdimers. Based on the identified binding cores of the eluted peptides, the frequency of the amino acids at the anchor and non-anchor positions was calculated for both transdimers (data not shown) and compared with the human proteome. Amino acids with a frequency 1.5 times higher than the same amino acid in the human proteome were considered as preferred residue. To visualize all the amino acid occurrences for all positions in one picture, heatmaps were generated (supplemental Fig. 1). For HLA-DQ2trans, the majority of amino acids at both anchor and non-anchor positions (p1–p9) showed similar frequencies compared with the human proteome. At positions p1, p4, p6, p7, and p9, the acidic amino acids Asp and Glu were dominantly present. In accordance with this strong preference, the basic amino acids Lys, Arg, and His were virtually absent at these positions (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1). Strikingly, acidic residues were also frequently found at the non-anchor positions in the peptides that were eluted from HLA-DQ2trans. The vast majority of identified peptides contained multiple acidic residues. One extreme example of this is the 15-mer peptide EDEEKDEEDEEDEDK (derived from calreticulin) harboring 13 acidic residues. Next to the strong preference for negative charges, minor preferred amino acids within the binding motif of HLA-DQ2trans are mostly (small) aliphatic residues like Gly, Ala, Val, and Leu. In contrast, HLA-DQ8trans showed a strong preference for acidic residues (Asp, Gly) at p9 only, whereas at the other anchor positions HLA-DQ8trans preferred aliphatic residues, like Gly, Ala, Val, and Leu. Similar to HLA-DQ2trans, HLA-DQ8trans did not accommodate basic residues, except at position p7.TABLE 2Amino acid preferences at anchor positions within peptide binding motifs of the DQ2/8 cis- and transdimersMolecule/pocketp1p4p6p7p9DQA1*05:01/DQB1*02:01aMotif obtained from Refs. 25, 26, and 34.Aliphatic, Phe, TyrAcidicSmall aliphaticAcidicTrp, Phe, Tyr(DQ2cis)Gln, Asn, Glu, ProAliphatic, Phe,"

However, with a few exceptions, the contribution of each acetylated lysine to cellular functions is not well understood because of the limited specificity of most histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Here we show that the Mst2 complex in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a highly specific H3 lysine 14 (H3K14) acetyltransferase that functions together with Gcn5 to regulate global levels of H3K14 acetylation (H3K14ac). By analyzing the effect of H3K14ac loss through both enzymatic inactivation and histone mutations, we found that H3K14ac is critical for DNA damage checkpoint activation by directly regulating the compaction of chromatin and by recruiting chromatin remodeling protein complex RSC."
https://openalex.org/W2169226256,"Parasites of the nematode genus Anisakis are associated with aquatic organisms. They can be found in a variety of marine hosts including whales, crustaceans, fish and cephalopods and are known to be the cause of the zoonotic disease anisakiasis, a painful inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract caused by the accidental consumptions of infectious larvae raw or semi-raw fishery products. Since the demand on fish as dietary protein source and the export rates of seafood products in general is rapidly increasing worldwide, the knowledge about the distribution of potential foodborne human pathogens in seafood is of major significance for human health. Studies have provided evidence that a few Anisakis species can cause clinical symptoms in humans. The aim of our study was to interpolate the species range for every described Anisakis species on the basis of the existing occurrence data. We used sequence data of 373 Anisakis larvae from 30 different hosts worldwide and previously published molecular data (n = 584) from 53 field-specific publications to model the species range of Anisakis spp., using a interpolation method that combines aspects of the alpha hull interpolation algorithm as well as the conditional interpolation approach. The results of our approach strongly indicate the existence of species-specific distribution patterns of Anisakis spp. within different climate zones and oceans that are in principle congruent with those of their respective final hosts. Our results support preceding studies that propose anisakid nematodes as useful biological indicators for their final host distribution and abundance as they closely follow the trophic relationships among their successive hosts. The modeling might although be helpful for predicting the likelihood of infection in order to reduce the risk of anisakiasis cases in a given area."
https://openalex.org/W2069466607,"Although p63 and MYC are important in the control of epidermal homeostasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms governing keratinocyte proliferation or differentiation downstream of these two genes are not completely understood. By analyzing the transcriptional changes and phenotypic consequences of the loss of either p63 or MYC in human developmentally mature keratinocytes, we have characterized the networks acting downstream of these two genes to control epidermal homeostasis. We show that p63 is required to maintain growth and to commit to differentiation by two distinct mechanisms. Knockdown of p63 led to down-regulation of MYC via the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways and in turn reduced keratinocyte proliferation. We demonstrate that a p63-controlled keratinocyte cell fate network is essential to induce the onset of keratinocyte differentiation. This network contains several secreted proteins involved in cell migration/adhesion, including fibronectin 1 (FN1), interleukin-1β (IL1B), cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61), and jagged-1 (JAG1), that act downstream of p63 as key effectors to trigger differentiation. Our results characterized for the first time a connection between p63 and MYC and a cell adhesion-related network that controls differentiation. Furthermore, we show that the balance between the MYC-controlled cell cycle progression network and the p63-controlled cell adhesion-related network could dictate skin cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2140879291,"TRPV1 and TRPV3 are two heat-sensitive ion channels activated at distinct temperature ranges perceived by human as hot and warm, respectively. Compounds eliciting human sensations of heat or warmth can also potently activate these channels. In rodents, TRPV3 is expressed predominantly in skin keratinocytes, whereas in humans TRPV1 and TRPV3 are co-expressed in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglion and are known to form heteromeric channels with distinct single channel conductances as well as sensitivities to TRPV1 activator capsaicin and inhibitor capsazepine. However, how heteromeric TRPV1/TRPV3 channels respond to heat and other stimuli remains unknown. In this study, we examined the behavior of heteromeric TRPV1/TRPV3 channels activated by heat, capsaicin, and voltage. Our results demonstrate that the heteromeric channels exhibit distinct temperature sensitivity, activation threshold, and heat-induced sensitization. Changes in gating properties apparently originate from interactions between TRPV1 and TRPV3 subunits. Our results suggest that heteromeric TRPV1/TRPV3 channels are unique heat sensors that may contribute to the fine-tuning of sensitivity to sensory inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2108673463,"The proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F are primarily produced by Th17 lymphocytes. Both are involved in host defense mechanisms against bacterial and fungal pathogens and contribute to the development of various autoimmune diseases. T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display increased expression of transcription factor cAMP-responsive element modulator α (CREMα), which has been documented to account for aberrant T cell function and contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE. Here, we provide evidence that IL-17F expression is reduced in SLE T cells. We demonstrate that CREMα binds to a yet unidentified CRE site within the proximal promoter. This results in reduced IL-17F expression in SLE T lymphocytes and is independent of activating epigenetic patterns (increased histone H3 Lys-18 acetylation, reduced histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation, and CpG-DNA demethylation). Forced CREMα expression in human T lymphocytes results in reduced IL-17F expression. Our findings demonstrate extended involvement of CREMα in cytokine dysregulation in SLE by contributing to a disrupted balance between IL-17A and IL-17F. An increased IL-17A/IL-17F ratio may aggravate the proinflammatory phenotype of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2128785809,"Unfolding of the gene expression program that converts precursor cells to their terminally differentiated counterparts is critically dependent on the nucleosome-remodeling activity of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex. The complex can be powered by either of two alternative ATPases, BRM or BRG1. BRG1 is critical for development and the activation of tissue specific genes and is found in two major stable configurations. The complex of BRG1-associated factors termed BAF is the originally characterized form of mammalian SWI/SNF. A more recently recognized configuration shares many of the same subunits but is termed PBAF in recognition of a unique subunit, the polybromo protein (PBRM1). Two other unique subunits, BRD7 and ARID2, are also diagnostic of PBAF. PBAF plays an essential role in development, apparent from the embryonic lethality of Pbmr1-null mice, but very little is known about the role of PBAF, or its signature subunits, in tissue-specific gene expression in individual differentiation programs. Osteoblast differentiation is an attractive model for tissue-specific gene expression because the process is highly regulated and remains tightly synchronized over a period of several weeks. This model was used here, with a stable shRNA-mediated depletion approach, to examine the role of the signature PBAF subunit, ARID2, during differentiation. This analysis identifies a critical role for ARID2-containing complexes in promoting osteoblast differentiation and supports a view that the PBAF subset of SWI/SNF contributes importantly to maintaining cellular identity and activating tissue-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2005442019,"Initiation, a major rate-limiting step of host protein translation, is a critical target in many viral infections. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in hepatocellular carcinoma. Translation initiation, up-regulated in many cancers, plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. mTOR is a major regulator of host protein translation. Even though activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR by HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) is known, not much is understood about the regulation of host translation initiation by this virus. Here for the first time we show that HCV up-regulates host cap-dependent translation machinery in Huh7.5 cells through simultaneous activation of mTORC1 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by NS5A. NS5A, interestingly, overexpressed and subsequently hyperphosphorylated 4EBP1. NS5A phosphorylated eIF4E through the p38 MAPK-MNK pathway. Both HCV infection and NS5A expression augmented eIF4F complex assembly, an indicator of cap-dependent translation efficiency. Global translation, however, was not altered by HCV NS5A. 4EBP1 phosphorylation, but not that of S6K1, was uniquely resistant to rapamycin in NS5A-Huh7.5 cells, indicative of an alternate phosphorylation mechanism of 4EBP1. Resistance of Ser-473, but not Thr-308, phosphorylation of AKT to PI3K inhibitors suggested an activation of mTORC2 by NS5A. NS5A associated with eIF4F complex and polysomes, suggesting its active involvement in host translation. This is the first report that implicates an HCV protein in the up-regulation of host translation initiation apparatus through concomitant regulation of multiple pathways. Because both mTORC1 activation and eIF4E phosphorylation are involved in tumorigenesis, we propose that their simultaneous activation by NS5A might contribute significantly to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2011533034,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB4 is a phosphatidylcholine translocator specifically expressed at the bile canalicular membrane in hepatocytes, highly homologous to the multidrug transporter ABCB1. Variations in the ABCB4 gene sequence cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3. We have shown previously that the I541F mutation, when reproduced either in ABCB1 or in ABCB4, led to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi. Here, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing ABCB1-GFP were used as a model to investigate this mutant. We show that ABCB1-I541F is not properly folded and is more susceptible to in situ protease degradation. It colocalizes and coprecipitates with the ER chaperone calnexin and coprecipitates with the cytosolic chaperone Hsc/Hsp70. Silencing of calnexin or overexpression of Hsp70 have no effect on maturation of the mutant. We also tested potential rescue by chemical and pharmacological chaperones. Thapsigargin and sodium 4-phenyl butyrate were inefficient. Glycerol improved maturation and exit of the mutant from the ER. Cyclosporin A, a competitive substrate for ABCB1, restored maturation, plasma membrane expression, and activity of ABCB1-I541F. Cyclosporin A also improved maturation of ABCB4-I541F in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In HepG(2) cells transfected with ABCB4-I541F cDNA, cyclosporin A allowed a significant amount of the mutant protein to reach the membrane of bile canaliculi. These results show that the best strategy to rescue conformation-defective ABCB4 mutants is provided by pharmacological chaperones that specifically target the protein. They identify cyclosporin A as a potential novel therapeutic tool for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 patients."

https://openalex.org/W2125407220,"Soluble proteins are enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde transport from the Golgi that is mediated by the KDEL receptors. In addition to the classic carboxyl-terminal KDEL motif, a variety of sequence variants are also capable of receptor binding that result in ER localization. Although different ER localization signals that exhibit varying affinities for the KDEL receptors exist, whether there are functional implications was unknown. The present study determines whether AGR2 requires a specific ER localization signal to be functionally active. AGR2 is expressed in most human adenocarcinomas and serves a role in promoting growth and the transformed phenotype. Using two different cell lines in which AGR2 induces expression of either the EGFR ligand amphiregulin or the transcription factor CDX2, only the highly conserved wild-type carboxyl-terminal KTEL motif results in the appropriate outcome. Deletion of the KTEL motif results in AGR2 secretion and loss of AGR2 function. AGR2 function is also lost when ER residence is achieved with a carboxyl-terminal KDEL or KSEL instead of a KTEL motif. Thus variations in ER localization sequences may serve a specific functional role, and in the case of AGR2, this role is served specifically by KTEL."

We observed four identical heterodimers (27 kDa + 9 kDa), which resulted from the autoprocessing of the precursor protein (36 kDa) and which constitute the doughnut-shaped quaternary structure. The catalytic residue of NylC was identified as the N-terminal Thr-267 of the 9-kDa subunit. Furthermore, each heterodimer is folded into a single domain, generating a stacked αββα core structure.

Nylons are synthetic polymers that contain recurring amide groups (R-CO-NH-R′) as integral parts of their main polymer chains. The high strength, elasticity, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, and shape-holding characteristics of nylons over wide temperature ranges make these polymers suitable for the production of fibers and plastics. Currently, the worldwide production of nylons is estimated to be three to four million tons per year. Nylons tend to be partially crystalline, and the degree of crystallinity affects the properties of nylons, such as the melting points, strength, and rigidity. Two forms of crystals (α and γ) have been reported (1Dasgupta S. Hammond W.B. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Crystal structures and properties of nylon polymers from theory.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12291-12301Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the α-form, each polymer chain is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with adjacent chains aligned in an antiparallel orientation, whereas the chains are parallel in the γ-form. The α-form of nylon-6 is generally more stable (1Dasgupta S. Hammond W.B. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Crystal structures and properties of nylon polymers from theory.J. Am. Chem.

Nylon-6 is produced by the ring cleavage polymerization of ϵ-caprolactam and consists of more than 100 units of 6-aminohexanoate (Ahx). 4The abbreviations used are: Ahx6-aminohexanoateN-tnN-terminal nucleophileNylA6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolaseNylB6-aminohexanoate-linear dimer hydrolaseNylC6-aminohexanoate oligomer hydrolase, or nylon hydrolaser.m.s.root mean squareDmpAl-aminopeptidase d-Ala-esterase/amidaseBapAβ-peptidyl aminopeptidaseOATornithine acetyltransferaseSIMSsecondary ion mass spectrometryS111G111SG122D122GY130H130YA137L137AM225V225MG122Y130D122G/H130YG122Y130A36D122G/H130Y/D36AG122Y130Q263D122G/H130Y/E263QG122Y130M225D122G/H130Y/V225MS111G122Y130G111S/D122G/H130YG122Y130A137D122G/H130Y/L137AG122Y130A36Q263D122G/H130Y/D36A/E263QS111G122Y130A137G111S/D122G/H130Y/L137A. However, during the polymerization reaction, some molecules fail to polymerize and remain oligomers, whereas others undergo head-to-tail condensation to form cyclic oligomers. We have isolated bacterial strains that can degrade Ahx oligomers, which are by-products of nylon-6 production, and use these oligomers as their sole carbon and nitrogen source (2Negoro S.

NylCA and NylCK have 5 and 15 amino acid substitutions, respectively, relative to the NylCp2 sequence (supplemental Fig. S1), and both have 10–20 °C higher thermostability than NylCp2 (5Yasuhira K.

Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 7099-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the crystallization conditions of NylCA that are suitable for x-ray crystallographic analyses (34Yasuhira K. Shibata N. Tanaka Y. Kumagai N. Tanaka Y. Nagai K. Kato D. Takeo M. Negoro S. Higuchi Y. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction analysis of nylon-oligomer hydrolase (NylC) from Agromyces sp. KY5R.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 892-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed x-ray crystallographic analyses of NylCA, examined its structural/evolutional relationship to proteins registered in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and estimated the residues responsible for the catalytic function and autoprocessing. We also analyzed the effect of amino acid mutations on the thermostability of NylC. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of using the thermostable NylC mutant to degrade polymeric nylon-6 at high temperatures, which is expected to increase the reactivity of the polymer. The plasmids pSKFC4 (NylCp2), pSKRC4 (NylCA), and pSKKC4 (NylCK) contained 1.1-kb genes flanked by BamHI and PstI restriction sites, which were cloned into the expression vector pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.)

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C before use. To introduce the D36A, G111S, D122G, H130Y, L137A, V225M, and E263Q mutations into the NylCp2 sequence, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PrimeSTAR mutagenesis kit (Takara Bio Inc.) with the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The plasmids that contained the 1.1-kb fragments with mutated NylCp2 were isolated from transformed E. coli JM109 cells. DNA sequencing confirmed that the desired mutations were introduced into the wild-type nylCp2 sequence. Cultivation and purification from E. coli clones were performed as reported previously (34Yasuhira K. Shibata N. Tanaka Y. Kumagai N. Tanaka Y. Nagai K. Kato D. Takeo M. Negoro S. Higuchi Y.

In the NylC activity assays, the enzyme solution (0.1 ml) was mixed with an Ahx cyclic oligomer solution (0.9 ml, 4 mg ml−1 Ahx cyclic oligomer in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol (buffer A)) and incubated at 30 °C (standard assay condition). An increase in the concentration of the amino group was determined using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (5Yasuhira K. Tanaka Y. Shibata H. Kawashima Y. Ohara A. Kato D. Takeo M. Negoro S. 6-Aminohexanoate oligomer hydrolases from the alkalophilic bacteria Agromyces sp. strain KY5R and Kocuria sp. strain KY2.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 7099-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies were performed under standard assay conditions, with the exception of the different Ahx cyclic oligomer concentrations used. Nylon-6 that was mechanically disintegrated to a powder was a generous gift from Toyobo Co. (Tsuruga, Japan). To analyze the particle sizes, the nylon sample was magnified 80-fold with a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, model TM-1000). The diameter (maximum length) of 157 particles observed in five electron microphotographs was measured. The diameters ranged from 68 to 720 μm (average ± S.D., 270 ± 140 μm). To increase the reactivity of the nylon sample, the nylon-6 powder (10 mg) was autoclaved in plastic tubes (Eppendorf Co.) containing buffer A (180 μl) at 120 °C for 20 min prior to the initiation of the enzyme reaction. Hydrolytic reactions were initiated by the addition of the thermostable NylCp2-G122Y130A36Q263 mutant enzyme (1 mg ml−1, 20 μl) to each tube and incubated at 60 °C for 2 h. The gas cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) equipment (developed in the project “Development of System and Technology for Advanced Measurement and Analysis,” Japan Science and Technology Agency, 2006–2010) was used to analyze the reaction products (36Mochiji K. Hashinokuchi M. Moritani K. Toyoda N. Matrix-free detection of intact ions from proteins in argon cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry.Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2009; 23: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Enzyme reactions were performed in triplicate. The reaction products (containing both the insoluble and the soluble fractions) from the first tube were spotted onto a silicon plate (1-cm2 square plate). Mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) ranges of 5,000–35,000 and 0–1,500 were analyzed. The solid fractions (∼10 mg) that were recovered from the reaction products (the second tube) were washed with distilled water, lyophilized, and dissolved in trifluoroethanol (0.2 ml). Subsequently, a fraction (0.02 ml) was spotted onto a silicon plate (1-cm2 square plate). The m/z range of 1,500–15,000 was analyzed. The soluble fraction (1 μl) from the third tube was spotted onto a thin layer plate and developed by a solvent mixture containing 1-propanol:water:ethyl acetate:ammonia (24:12:4:1.3). The degradation products were detected by spraying the plate with a 0.2% ninhydrin solution (in n-butyl alcohol saturated with water) (5Yasuhira K. Tanaka Y. Shibata H. Kawashima Y. Ohara A. Kato D.

Droplets were prepared by mixing 2 μl of purified NylCA solution (10 mg ml−1 protein in buffer A) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (1.0 m sodium citrate as a precipitant in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl) and were equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution at 10 °C for 1 week.

Open table in a new tab For native crystals, the crystals were soaked for 24 h in a cryoprotectant solution (1.0 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 25% glycerol). Heavy atom derivatives of NylCA were prepared by soaking the crystals for 72 h in cryoprotectant solution containing 5 mm K2PtCl4. Cryo-cooling was performed by blowing cold nitrogen steam onto the crystals at 100 K. The diffraction data sets were collected at the SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) beamline BL38B1 equipped with a Rigaku Jupiter CCD detector system. The following parameters were chosen for data collection: wavelength, 1.0000 Å; crystal to detector distance, 180 mm; oscillation range per image, 0.5° (for native and platinum derivative). Indexing, integration, and the scaling of reflections were performed using the HKL2000 program package (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected from native NylCA crystals and from the K2PtCl4-derivative to resolutions of 2.00 Å and 2.20 Å, respectively (Table 1). The NylC structure was determined by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method using the K2PtCl4 derivative data. The platinum substructure for the derivative crystal was solved at a resolution of 2.2 Å by the program BnP (38Weeks C.M. Blessing R.H. Miller R. Mungee R. Potter S.A. Rappleye J. Smith G.D. Xu H.

The electron density map was automatically traced with ARP/wARP. Models for the untraced regions, with the exception of the amino acids at positions 1–18 and 261–266, were constructed by manual model building using XFIT (40McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was performed using the coordinates of the initial model to fit the unit cell of the NylCA crystal followed by positional and B-factor refinement with the program CNS (41Brünger A.T.

Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied throughout refinement with the exception of the residues 25–40 and 131–137 in which significant structural differences among chains were detected. After several cycles of manual model rebuilding by XFIT, R-factor and Rfree were determined to be 18.1 and 19.5%. No residue was found in the outlying regions. The results of the crystal structure analysis are summarized in Table 1. The figures of the three-dimensional structural models were generated with the program MolFeat (version 3.6, FiatLux Co., Tokyo, Japan). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra at far-UV wavelengths (200–250 nm) were measured using a spectropolarimeter (JASCO, model J-720WI). A cuvette with a path length of 1 mm was used for far-UV CD measurements. The results are expressed as the mean residue molar ellipticity, [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 (θobs − θback) l−1 c−1, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, θback is the observed ellipticity in degrees in the absence of enzyme (as background), c is the molar concentration of the residue, and l is the length of the light path (in centimeters). The temperature was controlled at 25 °C with a JASCO PTC-348WI Peltier system. For thermal transition experiments, the temperature was shifted from 25 to 95 °C with a JASCO PTC-348WI Peltier system at 1 °C min−1, and CD measurements were performed at 220 nm. The protein concentration used in the far-UV CD measurements was 0.1 mg ml−1. The asymmetric unit contains 15 molecules (molecules A–O), each composed of an α- and a β-subunit. One molecule (O) is part of a tetramer in which the four heterodim"

Chromosome structural instability in the absence of BRCA2 is thought to result from defective homology-directed DNA repair. Here, we show that BRCA2 links the fidelity of telomere maintenance with genetic integrity. Absence of BRCA2 resulted in signs of dysfunctional telomeres, such as telomere shortening, erosions, and end fusions in proliferating mouse fibroblasts. BRCA2 localized to the telomeres in S phase in an ATR-dependent manner, and its absence resulted in the accumulation of common fragile sites, particularly at the G-rich lagging strand, and increased the telomere sister chromatid exchange in unchallenged cells. The incidence of common fragile sites and telomere sister chromatid exchange increased markedly after treatment with replication inhibitors. Congruently, telomere-induced foci were frequently observed in the absence of Brca2, denoting activation of the DNA damage response and abnormal chromosome end joining. These telomere end fusions constituted a significant portion of chromosome aberrations in Brca2-deficient cells. Our results suggest that BRCA2 is required for telomere homeostasis and may be particularly important for the replication of G-rich telomeric lagging strands."

TSC2 deficiency induces constitutive activation of mTOR, leading to a state of insulin resistance due to a negative feedback regulation, resulting in reduced Akt phosphorylation. We have recently described an alternative mechanism showing that in TSC2 deficiency, enhanced PTEN expression contributes to reduced Akt phosphorylation. To explore the mechanism of PTEN regulation, we used rapamycin and constitutively active mTOR to show that TORC1 increases the expression of PTEN mRNA and protein. We found that in TSC2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts expression of a kinase-dead mutant of mTOR, which inhibits both TORC1 and TORC2, decreases the expression of PTEN via transcriptional mechanism. Furthermore, kinase-dead mTOR increased and decreased phosphorylation of Akt at catalytic loop site Thr-308 and hydrophobic motif site Ser-473, respectively. Moreover, inhibition of deregulated TORC1 in TSC2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts or in 293 cells by down-regulation of raptor decreased the levels of the transcription factor Hif1α and blocked PTEN expression, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473. Finally, knockdown of rictor or mSin1 attenuated the expression of Hif1α, which decreased transcription of PTEN. These results unravel a previously unrecognized cell-autonomous function of TORC1 and TORC2 in the up-regulation of PTEN, which prevents phosphorylation of Akt and may shield against the development of malignancy in TSC patients."

This organism and its type-I RCs were initially detected by the occurrence of pscA gene sequences, which encode the core subunit of the RC complex, in metagenomic sequence data derived from hot spring microbial mats. Here, we report the isolation and initial biochemical characterization of the type-I RC from Ca. C. thermophilum. After removal of chlorosomes, crude membranes were solubilized with 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and the RC complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The RC complex comprised only two polypeptides: the reaction center core protein PscA and a 22-kDa carotenoid-binding protein denoted CbpC. The absorption spectrum showed a large, broad absorbance band centered at ∼483 nm from carotenoids as well as smaller Qy absorption bands at 672 and 812 nm from chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a, respectively. The light-induced difference spectra of whole cells, membranes, and the isolated RC showed maximal bleaching at 840 nm, which is attributed to the special pair and which we denote as P840. Making it unique among homodimeric type-I RCs, the isolated RC was photoactive in the presence of oxygen. Analyses by optical spectroscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry revealed that the RC complex contained 10.3 bacteriochlorophyll aP, 6.4 chlorophyll aPD, and 1.6 Zn-bacteriochlorophyll aP′ molecules per P840 (12.8:8.0:2.0).

After absorbing a photon, a BChl dimer bound to the RC near the periplasmic surface of the membrane achieves a long lived, charge-separated state by transferring an electron through a series of bound cofactors to a terminal acceptor, which is bound to the RC near the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Based on their terminal electron acceptors, RC complexes are classified into two types (1.Golbeck J.H. Shared thematic elements in photochemical reaction centers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Type-I RCs utilize Fe-S clusters as terminal electron acceptors, whereas type-II RCs use quinones as terminal electron acceptors. Green sulfur bacteria (GSB; Chlorobi and Chlorobiales) and heliobacteria (Firmicutes and Heliobacteriaceae) possess type-I RCs; purple bacteria (Proteobacteria) and filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs (Chloroflexi) possess type-II RCs; and cyanobacteria (Cyanobacteria), similar to plants and algae, possess both type-I and type-II reaction centers, photosystems I and II, respectively. reaction center Candidatus carotenoid-binding protein chlorophyll bacteriochlorophyll either bacteriochlorophyll or chlorophyll n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside Fenna-Matthews-Olson green sulfur bacterium n-octyl β-d-glucoside phytol as esterifying alcohol Δ2,6-phytodienol as esterifying alcohol reversed-phase peridinin-Chl a protein. All characterized GSB and heliobacteria are strict anaerobes, a trait once thought to be a consequence of the vulnerability of their RC-bound Fe-S clusters to oxygen (2.Overmann J. Boone D.R.

However, Chlorobaculum tepidum is extremely tolerant to oxygen so long as cells are not illuminated. This observation suggests that reactive oxygen species are the true problem, and consistent with this hypothesis, mutants lacking enzymes for protection against reactive oxygen species are more sensitive to oxygen (4.Li H. Jubelirer S. Garcia Costas A.M. Frigaard N.U. Bryant D.A. Multiple antioxidant proteins protect Chlorobaculum tepidum against oxygen and reactive oxygen species.Arch. Microbiol. 2009; 191: 853-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The type-I RCs of GSB and heliobacteria uniquely have homodimeric core complexes, whereas all other RCs, including photosystems I and II, have heterodimeric core complexes (5.Hauska G. Schoedl T. Remigy H. Tsiotis G. The reaction center of green sulfur bacteria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 260-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Despite their simpler composition, few detailed structural studies have been reported for homodimeric RCs, and some aspects of their biochemical and biophysical properties remain controversial (6.Oh-oka H. Type 1 reaction center of photosynthetic heliobacteria.Photochem. Photobiol. 2007; 83: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

C. thermophilum can be cultivated in the laboratory as an aerobe, and thus, its RCs can also be synthesized under oxic conditions as well.

Chlorosomes are large light-harvesting organelles, which attach to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and which contain >200,000 self-aggregating BChl molecules. The suprastructures of the BChl d and c molecules in chlorosomes of C. tepidum were recently described (23.Ganapathy S. Oostergetel G.T. Wawrzyniak P.K. Reus M. Gomez Maqueo Chew A. Buda F.

C. thermophilum has a photosynthetic apparatus very similar to that of GSB (i.e. chlorosomes, FMO, and type-I RCs) (8.Bryant D.A. Costas A.M. Maresca J.A. Chew A.G. Klatt C.G. Bateson M.M.

Microbiol. 2012; 14: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the aerobic lifestyle of Ca. C. thermophilum suggests that its photosynthetic apparatus has unique modifications that allow it to remain functional in the presence of oxygen. We recently reported that the chlorosomes of Ca. C. thermophilum contain several novel proteins that are not known to occur in the chlorosomes of GSB or Chloroflexi (15.Garcia Costas A.M. Tsukatani Y. Romberger S.P. Oostergetel G.T. Boekema E.J.

C. thermophilum seem to be related to the ability of this organism to grow phototrophically under oxic conditions. In this report, we describe the isolation, spectroscopic properties, and pigment composition of the Ca. C. thermophilum RCs. These oxygen-tolerant RCs are complexes formed from a PscA homodimer and a novel carotenoid-binding protein (CBP; denotes the complex formed by the CbpC apoprotein and carotenoids). Unexpectedly, these RC-CBP complexes contain two molecules of Zn-BChl a′ (the C-132 epimer of Zn-BChl a), which may act as the primary electron donor (P840) or an electron acceptor. The properties of these RCs are discussed and compared with those of other chlorophototrophs. Ca. C. thermophilum cells were cultured photoheterotrophically at 53 °C under oxic conditions in an orbital shaking incubator (85 rpm) as described previously (8.Bryant D.A. Costas A.M. Maresca J.A.

Cells (9 g, wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation; resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 2 m NaSCN, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 3 mg of lysozyme ml−1; and incubated for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication for 5 min and then passed three times through a French pressure cell at 138 megapascals at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and large cell debris were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g) for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 220,000 × g for 1.5 h. The resulting pellet containing total membranes and chlorosomes was suspended in the same buffer and loaded onto sucrose density gradients (20–50%), which were centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C (220,000 × g). The membrane layer that formed below the chlorosome layer was collected, diluted with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm DTT), and the suspension was centrifuged again at 220,000 × g for 1.5 h. The resulting membrane pellets were suspended in ∼8 ml of buffer C (∼70 μg of pigments (BChl a and BChl c) ml−1) and solubilized with 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM). After ultracentrifugation (220,000 × g for 1.5 h), the supernatant was decanted and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.02% (w/v) DDM. The orange-colored RC preparation was eluted with buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl. The fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Ca C. thermophilum cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6; disrupted by sonication for 5 min; and passed three times through a French pressure cell at 138 megapascals at 4 °C. After unbroken cells and large cell debris were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant was centrifuged at 220,000 × g for 1.5 h. The resulting pellet containing total membranes and chlorosomes was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6 containing 0.6 m sodium carbonate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation (220,000 × g for 1.5 h), and the resulting blue supernatant enriched in FMO was stored at −80 °C until required for other studies. The resulting pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6 containing 18 or 34 mm n-octyl β-d-glucoside (OG) and incubated for 2 h. After centrifugation (220,000 × g for 1 h), the resulting supernatant was decanted, taking care to avoid the soft pellet containing the chlorosomes (although this supernatant usually exhibited a minor absorption peak at ∼740 nm due to residual contaminating chlorosomes). This supernatant was loaded onto sucrose density gradients (10–50% (w/v) sucrose prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6 containing 20 mm OG). After centrifugation at 220,000 × g for 18 h, an orange-colored layer containing the CBP was collected, diluted with the same buffer, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Ultracel 10,000, Millipore). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was performed by the method of Schägger and von Jagow (25.Schägger H. von Jagow G.

Resolution of 16 to 20 chlorophyll-protein complexes using a low ionic strength native green gel system.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with minor modifications: SDS was replaced with 0.02% (w/v) DDM and 0.05% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. The separating gel and the stacking gel contained 8 (w/v) and 2.5% (w/v) acrylamide, respectively (the ratio of acrylamide to N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide was 29:1 (w/w)). After electrophoresis, proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting analyses were performed using protein bands directly excised from the gel. Polypeptides in the gel slices were digested with trypsin as follows. Gel slices that had been stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue were destained with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. After vortexing for 10 min, gel slices were pelleted, and the liquid was removed. If the gel pieces were still blue, this process was repeated. Destained gel slices were dried by vacuum centrifugation. The gel pieces were then incubated with 10 mm DTT in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged, and the liquid was removed. Iodoacetamide solution (10 mg ml−1 in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. The gel samples were washed with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The gel samples were incubated with trypsin solution (12.5 ng of trypsin μl−1 in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate; Promega) at 37 °C for 16 h after which the liquid was collected into a clean vial. After adding 5% (v/v) formic acid solution (in 50% acetonitrile), the gel pieces were vortexed for 20 min and sonicated for 15 min, and the liquid was collected into the same vial. This step was repeated to increase the peptide yield. The solution containing the peptides from the digested protein was dried by vacuum centrifugation to reduce the volume and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, which was performed by the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Huck Institutes for the Life Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA). Peptides produced by tryptic digestion were identified using the search engine Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA), and amino acid sequence data were deduced from the genome of Ca.

Absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary-14 spectrophotometer modified for computerized data acquisition (Olis, Inc., Bogart, GA) and a Genesys 10 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Light-induced difference spectra were recorded using a JTS-10 spectrophotometer (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) and a series of interference filters (full-width half-maximum ≤10 nm) to monitor absorption changes at specific wavelengths. Actinic light was provided by light-emitting diodes that emitted maximally at 630 or 740 nm. Samples were subjected to continuous illumination until maximum bleaching was achieved (as judged by absorbance changes at 840 nm), and the magnitude of the absorbance change was plotted against wavelength. The pigment ratio of BChl a per special pair was estimated using the known extinction coefficients for the type-I RC of GSB: ϵ810 nm = 100 mm−1 cm−1 for antenna BChl a in the RC (27.Olson J.M.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker ECS-106 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat and temperature controller. Spectra were the average of eight scans recorded with the following conditions: frequency, 9.487 GHz; gain, 20,000; modulation amplitude, 5 gauss at 100 kHz. Power and temperature are specified in the legend for Fig. 4. A Spectra-Physics Millenia CW laser operating at 2.2 watts provided actinic light, and dark-adapted samples were illuminated directly in the cavity. Light-induced spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of a dark-adapted sample from that of the illuminated sample. The pigment compositions of the RC preparations were analyzed by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC on C18 columns (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) as described by Frigaard et al. (29.Frigaard N.U. Takaichi S.

The gradient was composed of Solvent A (30% methyl t-butyl ether, 66% methanol, 4% water (v/v/v)) and Solvent B (50% methyl t-butyl ether, 30% methanol, 20% acetonitrile (v/v/v)). At the time of injection, the mobile phase was 30% Solvent B at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Solvent B was linearly increased to 100% over 40 min followed by a constant flow of 100% Solvent B for 8 min after which Solvent B was returned to 30% in 1 min.

To explore the contribution of the Pg/Fn interaction to Fn cofactor activity, Pg variants were generated and their affinities for Fn were determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg (des(1–77)), and Mini-Pg (lacking kringles 1–4) bound Fn with Kd values of 3.1, 0.21, and 24.5 μm, respectively, whereas Micro-Pg (lacking all kringles) did not bind. The kinetics of activation of the Pg variants by tPA were then examined in the absence or presence of Fn. Whereas Fn had no effect on Micro-Pg activation, the catalytic efficiencies of Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg, and Mini-Pg activation in the presence of Fn were 300- to 600-fold higher than in its absence. The retention of Fn cofactor activity with Mini-Pg, which has low affinity for Fn, suggests that Mini-Pg binds the tPA-Fn complex more tightly than tPA alone. To explore this possibility, SPR was used to examine the interaction of Mini-Pg with Fn in the absence or presence of tPA. There was 50% more Mini-Pg binding to Fn in the presence of tPA than in its absence, suggesting that formation of the tPA-Fn complex exposes a cryptic site that binds Mini-Pg. Thus, our data (a) indicate that high affinity binding of Pg to Fn is not essential for Fn cofactor activity, and (b) suggest that kringle 5 localizes and stabilizes Pg within the tPA-Fn complex and contributes to its efficient activation.

Lipincott Co., Philadelphia, PA1994Google Scholar). A distinguishing feature of tPA is its affinity for Fn. By serving as a template onto which both tPA and Pg bind, Fn promotes enzyme-substrate interaction through formation of a ternary complex. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of Pg activation by tPA is 3 orders of magnitude greater in the presence of Fn than it is in its absence and 2 orders of magnitude greater in the presence of fibrinogen (Fg), the soluble precursor of Fn (3Fredenburgh J.C.

These features render tPA Fn-specific; enhanced Pn generation on the Fn surface promotes clot dissolution, whereas inefficient Pg activation in the presence of Fg limits systemic Fg degradation. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), in contrast to tPA, does not bind to Fn (2Bachmann F. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. J. B. Lipincott Co., Philadelphia, PA1994Google Scholar). Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of Pg activation by uPA in the presence of Fn is similar to that in its absence, or in the presence of Fg. Because Pn generation is not localized to the Fn surface, uPA lacks Fn specificity. The functional differences between tPA and uPA identify Fn affinity as a critical determinant of Fn specificity.

In contrast to the role played by the activator/Fn interaction, the contribution of the Pg/Fn interaction to the potentiating effect of Fn is unclear. The predominant form of Pg, termed Glu-Pg, is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of an NH2-terminal peptide, five kringle domains, and a protease domain (6Bachmann F. Hemostasis and Thrombosis.

Lijnen H.R. Basic and clinical aspects of fibrinolysis and thrombolysis.Blood. 1991; 78: 3114-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Glu-Pg assumes a closed conformation because of intramolecular links between the NH2-terminal peptide and kringle 5 domains, Lys-Pg has a more open conformation. The conformational change that occurs upon conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg not only renders Lys-Pg more readily activated by Pg activators, but also endows Lys-Pg with higher affinity for Fn than its intact precursor. Of the five kringle domains in Pg, kringles 1, 4, and 5 are reported to be the major mediators of the Pg/Fn interaction (9Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S.

Using four Pg derivatives, we compared their (a) affinities for immobilized Fn or Fg using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and (b) kinetics of activation by tPA or uPA in the absence of a cofactor with those in the presence of Fn or Fg. We also used SPR to compare the affinities of the various Pg derivatives for tPA because the binary Pg/tPA interaction may influence the kinetics of activation when the affinity of Pg for Fn decreases. We hypothesized that if the Pg/Fn interaction is an important determinant of the capacity of Fn to promote Pg activation by tPA, Fn cofactor activity would be attenuated or eliminated with Mini- and Micro-Pg, respectively, which exhibit little or no affinity for Fn. In contrast, because uPA does not bind to Fn, we postulated that Fn would have little or no effect on the kinetics of activation of all four forms of Pg by uPA.

Briefly, Glu-Pg (10 μm) was converted to Lys-Pg by incubation for 2 h at 25 °C with 0.16 μm Pn in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS), and 0.01% Tween 80 (HBST) containing 50 mm ϵ-ACA. Additional Pn (0.16 μm) was added and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. To remove Pn, a 10-fold molar excess of biotin-FPRck was added and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C while monitoring aliquots for Pn activity by S2251 hydrolysis. When no Pn activity was detected, the mixture was dialyzed against 4 × 1 liter of HBST prior to addition of streptavidin-agarose suspended in HBST. After centrifugation, the solution was filtered to remove any traces of streptavidin-agarose, and after confirming the absence of residual biotin-FPRck by showing no reduction in Pn-mediated S2251 hydrolysis, the solution was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Concentration was determined by photospectrometry. Mini-Pg was generated as described previously (16Wu H.L. Chang B.I. Wu D.H. Chang L.C. Gong C.C. Lou K.L. Shi G.Y.

Briefly, after incubating 33 μm Glu-Pg with 0.67 μm elastase in TBS for 60 min at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (NaPi), for 2 h at 4 °C, and then loaded onto a Lys-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with NaPi. After washing with the same buffer, the flow-through, which only contained Mini-Pg, was collected and protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against TBS, and concentrated by centrifugation. Concentration was determined by photospectrometry using an extinction coefficient of 16.0 (ϵ1%1 cm (280 nm)) and molecular mass of 38,000 Da, as reported previously (16Wu H.L. Chang B.I. Wu D.H.

Mini-Pg was then stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Micro-Pg was prepared as described previously (17Shi G.Y. Wu H.L. Isolation and characterization of microplasminogen.

The integrity of Lys-, Mini-, and Micro-Pg was assessed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). Each form displayed the expected molecular weight and was activable by uPA. Binding interactions were studied by SPR using a Biacore 1000 (Piscataway, NJ). Fg and albumin were biotinylated by coupling to a biotin-EZ-Link spacer consisting of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). Biotinylated Fg or albumin in HBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween 20 (HBSC-Tween 20) was then adsorbed to a streptavidin-coated (SA) sensor chip (Biacore) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until 5000 response units (RU) of Fg or 4000 RU of albumin were immobilized. For studies with Fn, immobilized Fg was converted to Fn by injecting 0.5 μm thrombin in HBSC-Tween 20 at a rate of 10 μl/min for 30 min as described previously (18Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R.

This procedure was repeated at least twice and was continued until there was no further reduction in RU, indicating complete conversion of Fg to Fn. Flow cells were then washed with 0.02 m HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% Tween 20 and equilibrated with HBSC-Tween 20. Binding studies were performed with a range of Glu- (0–20 μm), Lys- (0–0.75 μm), Mini- (0–20 μm), or Micro-Pg (0–20 μm) concentrations diluted in HBSC-Tween 20 containing a 2-fold molar excess of VFKck. Samples were injected at a rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min and the cells were then washed with HBSC-Tween 20 to monitor dissociation. Between runs, the cells were regenerated with 0.02 m HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm ϵ-ACA. The binding data were analyzed using the steady-state affinity model (Biacore). In the sensorgrams where RU values approached a plateau, RU bound was determined by subtracting the control RU values obtained in the albumin channel from those obtained with Fg or Fn. Corrected RU values were then plotted against the starting concentrations of Pg, and data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola to determine Kd values using SigmaPlot (version 8, SPSS). Similar studies were performed in the presence of active site-blocked tPA (FPR-tPA), which was generated by incubating 1 mg/ml of tPA with a 20-fold molar excess of FPRck for 2 h, followed by dialysis against HBS. Analytes, which contained 25 nm FPR-tPA and the various Pg derivatives in a range of concentrations were co-injected into flow cells containing immobilized biotinylated Fn. Pg binding to Fn in the presence of tPA was corrected for tPA binding to Fn alone. The total RU change at saturation was then plotted against the starting concentration of Pg and the Kd was determined by nonlinear regression as described above. Binding interactions were studied using SPR. tPA was inactivated by incubation with biotin-FPRck. Biotin-FPR-tPA, dissolved in HBSC-Tween 20, was then adsorbed to a SA sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min to an RU of 1800. Binding studies were carried out with Glu-, Lys-, Mini-, or Micro-Pg, in concentrations up to 20 μm, diluted in HBSC-Tween 20 containing a 2-fold molar excess of VFKck relative to Pg. Samples were injected at a rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min and flow cells were then washed with HBSC-Tween 20 to monitor dissociation. Between injections, the flow cells were regenerated with 0.02 m HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm ϵ-ACA. To normalize RU values, the RU change at saturation with each Pg variant was then divided by its molecular mass and the normalized values were then plotted against the starting concentration of Pg. Microtiter plates were pretreated for at least 1 h with HBS containing 1% Tween 80 and washed thoroughly with water. For studies with Fg, Glu-Pg (0–18 μm), Lys-Pg (0–5 μm), Mini-Pg (0–18 μm), or Micro-Pg (0–6.5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm CaCl2 and 400 μm S2251 in the absence or presence of 1 μm Fg in HBST. Reactions were initiated by addition of tPA or uPA, and absorbance was monitored at 405 and 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A tPA concentration of 0.25 nm was used with all Pg derivatives; in contrast, 1 nm uPA was used with Glu-, Lys-, and Micro-Pg, whereas 0.5 nm uPA was used with Mini-Pg. For studies with Fn, Glu-Pg (0–0.7 μm), Lys-Pg (0–0.05 μm), Mini-Pg (0–0.7 μm), or Micro-Pg (0–6.5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm CaCl2 and 400 μm S2251 in the absence or presence of 1 μm Fg in HBST. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 nm thrombin and either tPA or uPA, in the same concentrations used for the studies with Fg, and absorbance was then monitored at 405 and 450 nm. Absorbance at 405 nm was corrected for turbidity by subtracting absorbance determined at 450 nm. The rate of Pn generation (r) was determined as described previously (20Senis Y.A. Kim P.Y. Fuller G.L. García A. Prabhakar S. Wilkinson M.C. Brittan H. Zitzmann N. Wait R. Warrell D.A. Watson S.P. Kamiguti A.S. Theakston R.D. Nesheim M.E. Laing G.D. Isolation and characterization of cotiaractivase, a novel low molecular weight prothrombin activator from the venom of Bothrops cotiara.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using the relationship Acorr = (SA × r/2) × t2, corrected absorbance values (Acorr) were plotted against t2 to determine the slope (SA × r/2), where SA is the specific activity of Pn against S2251, r is the rate of Pn generation, and t is time. The rate was then calculated using the SA, which was experimentally determined to be 1.439 Acorr/min/μm. Rates were then plotted against the starting concentrations of the Pg derivatives and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot to determine the individual kcat and Km values. For reactions displaying linear rate versus substrate relationships, the slope of the line was taken as the catalytic efficiency. Because there is substantial change in turbidity when Fn polymerizes, more rigorous correction was necessary to accurately quantify the rate of Pn generation, as described by Schneider and Nesheim (21Schneider M. Nesheim M. A study of the protection of plasmin from antiplasmin inhibition within an intact fibrin clot during the course of clot lysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The correction factor was determined experimentally by forming Fn clots in the absence of added tPA or uPA. Absorbance at 405 nm, which reflects turbidity, was 1.7-fold higher than absorbance readings at 450 nm. Therefore, turbidity readings at 450 nm were multiplied by this correction factor prior to subtraction from the 405 nm readings (Acorr = A405 − (1.7 × A450)) to obtain those readings that solely reflect S2251 hydrolysis. Corrected absorbance values were again plotted against time squared and activation rates were determined as described above. The specific activity of Pn against S2251 in a 1 μm Fn clot was 0.924 Acorr/min/μm. Affinities of the Pg variants for immobilized Fg or Fn were assessed by SPR. The binding of Lys-Pg to Fn is illustrated in Fig. 2; RU values increased with increasing Lys-Pg concentration. The changes in corrected RU values were plotted against the corresponding concentration of Lys-Pg (Fig. 2, inset) and the Kd value was determined by nonlinear regression analysis. A similar approach was taken to determine the Kd values for Glu-, Lys-, and Mini-Pg binding to Fg or Fn. With Micro-Pg, the signal change did not approach saturation, even with concentrations up to 20 μm, indicating a lower limit to the Kd value. Binding data are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Kd values for the interaction of the Pg variants with Fg or Fn as determined using SPRFgFnμmGlu-Pg12.5 ± 2.93.1 ± 0.3Lys-Pg0.25 ± 0.030.21 ± 0.03Mini-Pg10.5 ± 224.5 ± 5.8Micro-Pg>20>20 Open table in a new tab The affinity of Glu-Pg for Fn was 4-fold higher than that for Fg; Kd values were 3.1 and 12.5 μm, respectively.

Therefore, the higher affinity of Glu-Pg for Fn relative to Fg is consistent with previous work, which validates the use of SPR for determination of the affinity for Fg and Fn, as observed previously with thrombin (18Fredenburgh J.C.

Compared with Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg bound Fg and Fn with 50- and 15-fold higher affinities, respectively; Kd values were 0.25 and 0.21 μm, respectively. As expected, with the loss of lysine-binding kringle domains, Mini-Pg bound Fg and Fn with low affinity; Kd values were 10.5 and 24.5 μm, respectively. This represents an 8-fold decrease in Fn affinity compared with Glu-Pg and a 117-fold decrease compared with Lys-Pg. Micro-Pg, which does not possess any kringle domains, exhibited minimal binding to both Fg or Fn, consistent with previous reports that kringles 1, 4, and 5 mediate the interaction of Pg with Fg or Fn (9Sottrup-Jensen L.

The Pg/tPA interaction was studied using SPR to explore the influence of this binary interaction on Pg activation. Because changes in RU are directly proportional to the molecular mass of the ligand, the observed RU values were first corrected for the molecular mass of the Pg variant used, and then plotted against the initial Pg concentration (Fig. 3). Pg variants bound to biotin-FPR-tPA, albeit with low affinity. Glu-Pg had the lowest affinity; an interaction that was immeasurable experimentally. In contrast, variants with an open conformation bound with higher affinities. All interactions were lysine-dependent because they were eliminated when ϵ-ACA was co-injected (data not shown). Lys-Pg, Mini-Pg, and Micro-Pg bound tPA with estimated Kd values of 3.4, 85, and 1.6 μm, respectively. Considering the ϵ-ACA sensitivity, our data raise the possibility that the protease domain of Pg interacts with the kringle 2 domain of tPA because the Kd of Micro-Pg for tPA reported here is almost identical to the Kd value for the kringle-dependent interaction of tPA with Fn (4Horrevoets A.J.

To complement the binding studies, the rates of tPA-mediated Pg activation were measured in the absence or presence of Fn or Fg. Rates of Pn formation were plotted again"

Recent structural and mechanistic studies of UGM have provided evidence for the existence of an FAD-Galf/p adduct as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle. These findings are consistent with Lewis acid/base chemistry involving nucleophilic attack by N5 of FADred at C1 of UDP-Galf/p. In this study, we employed a variety of FAD analogues to characterize the role of FADred in the UGM catalytic cycle using positional isotope exchange (PIX) and linear free energy relationship studies. PIX studies indicated that UGM reconstituted with 5-deaza-FADred is unable to catalyze PIX of the bridging C1–OPβ oxygen of UDP-Galp, suggesting a direct role for the FADred N5 atom in this process. In addition, analysis of kinetic linear free energy relationships of kcat versus the nucleophilicity of N5 of FADred gave a slope of ρ = −2.4 ± 0.4. Together, these findings are most consistent with a chemical mechanism for UGM involving an SN2-type displacement of UDP from UDP-Galf/p by N5 of FADred.

This reaction is essential for many pathogenic species of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi because UDP-Galf serves as the activated Galf donor during cell wall biosynthesis in these organisms (1Richards M.R.

Of particular clinical importance is the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cell wall of which possesses a galactan chain of ∼35 Galf residues that is essential for viability (3Pan F.

Biol. 2010; 17: 1356-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), UGM has become an attractive drug target because mammalian glycans do not contain Galf residues. UGM has also attracted much attention because it requires a reduced FAD coenzyme (FADred; 3) to catalyze a reversible ring contraction/expansion reaction that is redox-neutral (7Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Galactopyranose mutase from Escherichia coli: an unusual role of reduced FAD in its Catalysis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9065-9070Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This has raised questions about the catalytic function of the coenzyme during turnover. UDP-galactopyranose mutase UDP-galactopyranose UDP-galactofuranose reduced FAD positional isotope exchange single-electron transfer linear free energy relationship. Several previous studies have provided important insights into the chemical mechanism of the UGM-catalyzed reaction.

Species 7 is likely derived from the FAD-substrate adducts 6 and 8, where N5 of the flavin is covalently linked to the anomeric carbon of the substrate (9Soltero-Higgin M. Carlson E.E. Gruber T.D.

Three mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain the formation of 6 and 8 (Fig. 1). Generation of these intermediates may occur via nucleophilic attack by N5 of FADred at the anomeric carbon of 1 (or 2) concerted with cleavage of the C1–OPβ bond (Fig. 1, path A), which is reminiscent of typical SN2-type substitutions. Alternatively, formation of 6 and 8 may take place in a stepwise fashion similar to SN1-type substitutions (Fig. 1, path B), where elimination of UDP to produce an oxocarbenium intermediate (such as 4) precedes the nucleophilic attack by N5. It is also possible that the electron-deficient nature of 4 could facilitate single-electron transfer (SET) from FADred to form a radical pair (such as 5 and 10), followed by covalent bond formation to afford 6 and 8 (Fig. 1, path C). Indirect evidence for an oxocarbenium intermediate has come in the form of a significant rate reduction observed with UDP-[2-F]Galf (12Zhang Q. Liu H. Mechanistic investigation of UDP-galactopyranose mutase from Escherichia coli using 2- and 3-fluorinated UDP-galactofuranose as probes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6756-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the inability of UGM to displace UDP from the linear substrate analog UDP-galactitol (13Itoh K. Huang Z. Liu H.W. Synthesis and analysis of substrate analogues for UDP-galactopyranose mutase: implication for an oxocarbenium ion intermediate in the catalytic mechanism.Org. Lett. 2007; 9: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed PIX and linear free energy relationships (LFERs) to further investigate the role of N5 of FADred during UGM catalysis. To determine whether N5 is indeed necessary for cleavage of the anomeric bond of UDP-Galp, PIX was monitored for the double-labeled UDP-Galp substrate in the presence of UGM reconstituted with reduced 5-deaza-FAD. The results were then corroborated by considering the perturbations to the rate of isomerization imposed upon changing the nucleophilicity of N5. Together, the results of these experiments are most consistent with an SN2-type displacement of UDP from the substrate by N5 of FADred (Fig. 1, path A). The glf gene encoding UGM was introduced into a pET-24b+ vector to generate the recombinant pQZ-1 plasmid (7Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Galactopyranose mutase from Escherichia coli: an unusual role of reduced FAD in its Catalysis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9065-9070Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 StarTM (DE3) for overexpression of UGM as a C-terminal His6 fusion protein. Cells were cultured in LB medium with 50 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and the culture was allowed to incubate for an additional 18 h at 18 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by sonication, and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). UGM was purified as the holoenzyme with a bright yellow color and a distinct UV-visible absorption profile characteristic of tightly bound FAD. The purified enzyme was then flash-frozen in storage buffer (100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) containing 15% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. Double-labeled UDP-Galp was prepared according to published methods (8Barlow J.N. Girvin M.E. Blanchard J.S. Positional isotope exchange catalyzed by UDP-galactopyranose mutase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6968-6969Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where the double labels were introduced by incubating 100 mg of d-[1-13C]galactose (99%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) in 200 μl of H218O (95%, normalized; Fluka) at 55 °C for 2 days. This led to ∼80% incorporation of 18O at C1 as determined by mass spectrometry. A solution of 80 mm double-labeled galactose was then treated with pyruvate kinase and galactose kinase in the presence of 125 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 6 mm ATP in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) to generate [1-13C,1-18O]galactose 1-phosphate. The enzymes were removed by filtration (YM-10 membrane) following complete consumption of the labeled galactose as monitored by TLC. The filtrate was adjusted to pH 8.5 and treated with galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and inorganic pyrophosphatase in the presence of 0.6 mm UDP-glucose and 100 mm UTP to form UDP-[1-13C,1-18O]Galp. The reaction was monitored by HPLC (see below for conditions). Enzymes were then removed by filtration (YM-10 membrane), and the product was purified using a DEAE-cellulose column eluted with a 0–0.1 m gradient of NH4HCO3 in water. The isolated UDP-Galp was determined to be 95% pure based on HPLC analysis. The extent of isotopic double-label incorporation into the UDP-Galp product was determined by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectrometries and confirmed by high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (negative-ion mode), demonstrating peaks at m/z 566.0518 and 568.0530, corresponding to the 16O (calculated m/z 566.0511) and 18O (calculated m/z 568.0553) isotopologues, respectively. The 7/8-substituted FAD analogues used in this study were prepared according to published methods (14Thibodeaux C.J. Chang W.C. Liu H.W. Linear free energy relationships demonstrate a catalytic role for the flavin mononucleotide coenzyme of the type II isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 9994-9996Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The identity of each compound was verified by 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopies as well as by high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. FAD was removed from the purified enzyme by the addition of a 2.6-fold volume excess of 3 m KBr in 20% glycerol to a 10 mg/ml enzyme stock in storage buffer (15Huang Z. Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Reconstitution of UDP-galactopyranose mutase with 1-deaza-FAD and 5-deaza-FAD: analysis and mechanistic implications.Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The resulting mixture was incubated on ice for 2 min before precipitating the enzyme by the addition of a 1.8-fold volume excess of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 2.5). The enzyme precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The clear yellow supernatant containing released FAD was decanted, and the protein pellet was redissolved in 4 ml of storage buffer. The high salt treatment was repeated a second time, and the resulting apo-UGM was dialyzed against storage buffer. Reconstitution of UGM with FAD analogues was carried out by incubating a 2.5 mg/ml solution of apo-UGM with an excess of flavin cofactor for 15 min at room temperature. The reconstituted enzyme/cofactor solution was then diluted with storage buffer to a concentration compatible with the enzyme assays. In the LFER studies, the molar ratio of cofactor to apo-UGM was ∼100:1. Enzyme concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. PIX experiments were carried out at 27 °C in NMR tubes containing 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5), 10% D2O (for locking the 13C NMR signal), 7 mm Na2S2O4, and ∼14 mm double-labeled UDP-Galp in a total volume of ∼630 μl. Apo-UGM was preincubated with the respective cofactor for 15 min before dilution into the reaction solution. In the 5-deaza-FAD/UGM and apo-UGM samples, the final enzyme concentration was 15 μm, and the 5-deaza-FAD concentration was ∼820 μm. In the FAD/UGM positive control, the final enzyme and FAD concentrations were 10 and 220 μm, respectively. All 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 600-MHz Varian NMR spectrometer except for the reaction with apo-UGM, which was recorded using a 500-MHz Varian NMR spectrometer, at the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of Texas at Austin. Initial rates for the conversion of UDP-Galf to UDP-Galp by reconstituted UGM were determined according to a previously described discontinuous assay (12Zhang Q. Liu H. Mechanistic investigation of UDP-galactopyranose mutase from Escherichia coli using 2- and 3-fluorinated UDP-galactofuranose as probes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6756-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reactions were run in 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5) containing 7 mm Na2S2O4 and 10–500 μm UDP-Galf in a total volume of 30 μl. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a water bath. Enzyme concentrations varied from 0.015 to 0.2 μm depending on the analogue tested. Reactions were initiated upon the addition of UDP-Galf, quenched with a 3-fold excess of methanol, and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The resulting supernatant was dried in a speed vacuum concentrator prior to HPLC analysis. The fraction of reaction was determined based on the relative integrations of the UDP-Galf and UDP-Galp peaks and used to calculate the initial rate of reaction. HPLC analysis was performed at room temperature using a Varian Microsorb-MV 100-5 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) with UV detection at 262 nm. Solvent A contained 50 mm potassium Pi and 2.5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (pH 6.9) in H2O, and solvent B contained 50 mm potassium Pi and 2.5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (pH 6.9) in 50% H2O/acetonitrile. Isocratic elution was performed at 96% solvent A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. As described previously (8Barlow J.N. Girvin M.E. Blanchard J.S. Positional isotope exchange catalyzed by UDP-galactopyranose mutase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6968-6969Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the C1 13C NMR signal of UDP-Galp is split into a doublet by the adjacent β-phosphate and demonstrates an upfield shift of ∼0.03 ppm when the anomeric oxygen is replaced with 18O. The resulting two doublets were deconvoluted and integrated using Varian VnmrJ software and a multicomponent fit with Lorentzian line shapes. A 13C NMR example spectrum is provided in supplemental Fig. S2 along with the deconvolution. 13C NMR and mass spectrometry results indicated that the double-labeled UDP-Galp (11) was prepared with >99% incorporation of 13C at C1 and 77 ± 4% incorporation of 18O at the bridging C1–OPβ position. All remaining atoms in the substrate were at natural isotopic abundance. PIX experiments were conducted under reducing conditions (7 mm sodium dithionite) in NMR tubes. The change in the fraction (f) of 18O versus 16O bound to 13C1 was monitored versus time (t) by 13C NMR spectroscopy. (13C NMR stack plots are shown in supplemental Fig. S2.) Complete scrambling of the Pβ oxygens (Fig. 2) predicts the fraction of 18O at the bridging C1–OPβ position to ultimately reach an equilibrium value of feq = 0.26 (the product of the initial 18O enrichment in our double-labeled UDP-Galp substrate and the statistical factor of one-third). In the presence of 10 μm UGM reconstituted with FADred, PIX scrambling (11 ⇆ 12) was >90% complete within 20 min of incubation. In contrast, PIX was considerably slower in the presence of either 15 μm apo-UGM or UGM reconstituted with 5-deaza-FADred (Fig. 3), occurring over a time scale of >7 h. This permitted f to be measured every 60 min and subsequently fit using Equation 1 to extract the first-order rate constant for PIX (16Midelfort C.F. Rose I.A.

Chem. 1976; 251: 5881-5887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),f=feq+Δfexp⁡−kpixt(Eq. 1) where feq is the final value of f after complete equilibration of the exchangeable oxygens, and Δf is the difference between the initial value of f and feq. The first-order rate constant (kPIX) describes the approach to the PIX equilibrium under the experimental conditions and is equivalent to the positional exchange rate (17Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Positional isotope exchange as probe of enzyme action.Method Enzymol. 1995; 249: 398-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) normalized for the total initial substrate concentration, which was held constant and saturating in the experiments. The parameters kPIX and Δf were both allowed to float during nonlinear fitting, whereas feq was fixed at 0.26.FIGURE 3Comparison of PIX rates for apo-UGM (○) versus UGM reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD (●). Each time course is a plot of the fraction (f) of UDP-Galp possessing 18O at the bridging C1–OPβ position as determined by 13C NMR versus time. As a reference, the PIX rate was ∼100 times faster when UGM was reconstituted with FADred. Time courses were determined in separate experiments leading to the difference in the ordinate intercepts (see supplemental data for details). Reactions were run at 27 °C in potassium Pi (pH 7.5), 10% D2O, and 7 mm Na2S2O4 with 15 μm enzyme. Progress curves were obtained by fitting Equation 1 to the observed time courses using nonlinear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observed values of kPIX for apo-UGM and UGM reconstituted with 5-deaza-FADred were 0.0015 ± 0.0001 and 0.0017 ± 0.0001 min−1, respectively, ∼100-fold smaller than the kPIX for UGM reconstituted with FADred. These values of kPIX are significantly different from zero (p < 0.0001); however, they are not significantly different from one another (p > 0.3). No PIX scrambling was observed over a 24-h period when UGM was omitted from the reaction solution. Additional details regarding data fitting and statistical analysis are provided in the supplemental data. Following reconstitution of apo-UGM with each FAD analog (Fig. 4A), the turnover number (kcat) for conversion of UDP-Galf to UDP-Galp (Fig. 1, 2 → 1) was determined from plots of the initial rate (vi) (12Zhang Q. Liu H. Mechanistic investigation of UDP-galactopyranose mutase from Escherichia coli using 2- and 3-fluorinated UDP-galactofuranose as probes.J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2003; 31: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) versus substrate concentration (si) according to the structural relation (Equation 2),vi=kcatsie0/Km+si(Eq. 2) where e0 is the total enzyme concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant. Controls were also performed with ratios of 1000:1 for the 8-methoxy-FAD and 7-chloro-FAD analogues versus apo-UGM. No significant differences were observed in the fitted kinetic parameters, implying that the variations in kcat were not a result of subsaturating flavin concentrations. The resulting plot of log10(kcat) versus the sum of the substituent constants at positions 7 and 8 of the FAD analogues, denoted σm and σp, respectively, is shown in Fig. 4B. The values of σm and σp are based on the ionization of phenylacetic acid in water (18Taft Jr., R.W. Ehrenson S. Lewis I.C. Glick R.E. Evaluation of resonance effects on reactivity by application of the linear inductive energy relationship. VI. Concerning the effects of polarization and conjugation on the mesomeric Order.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 5352-5361Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar); however, substituent constants based on the ionization of benzoic acid in water gave similar results. On the basis of an analysis of variance, we found no evidence for either unequal expression of para versus meta effects in the LFER, i.e. ρm ≠ ρp(19Edmondson D.E. Ghisla S. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Agency for Scientific Publications, Berlin1999: 71-76Google Scholar), or non-additivity, i.e. higher order terms of σ. The value of the susceptibility factor (ρ) estimated from the linear correlation was −2.4 ± 0.4 and is significantly different from zero (p < 0.01). Additional details regarding data fitting and statistical analysis are provided in the supplemental data. Evidence for the cleavage of the anomeric UDP-Galp bond during turnover by UGM was first provided by Blanchard and co-workers (8Barlow J.N. Girvin M.E. Blanchard J.S. Positional isotope exchange catalyzed by UDP-galactopyranose mutase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6968-6969Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using PIX. In this study, incubation of UGM with UDP-[1-13C]Galp enriched with 18O at the bridging oxygen between C1 and the β-phosphate (11) was monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy. When 18O is replaced with 16O at the bridging position in the double-labeled substrate during turnover (see 12), a well resolved downfield shift of the 13C1 resonance occurs, with the change in the ratio of the 13C–18O and 13C–16O signals indicative of bond cleavage and reformation during catalysis (Fig. 2). It has also been shown that UGM reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD does not catalyze interconversion of UDP-Galf and UDP-Galp (15Huang Z. Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Reconstitution of UDP-galactopyranose mutase with 1-deaza-FAD and 5-deaza-FAD: analysis and mechanistic implications.Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This observation was initially interpreted as support for a mechanism involving SET (Fig. 1, path C) because 5-deaza-FAD is restricted to 2-electron processes (20Walsh C. Naturally occurring 5-deazaflavin coenzymes: biological redox roles.Acc. Chem. Res. 1986; 19: 216-221Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this indirect evidence does not exclude the possibility of a nucleophilic role for N5 of FADred and, in particular, an SN2-type process if it is required for expulsion of the UDP moiety. As an initial test of the hypothesis that N5 is directly involved in the cleavage of the anomeric bond of UDP-Galp to form the flavin-substrate adduct (6 and 8), we considered the ability of UGM to utilize 5-deaza-FAD to catalyze PIX of the Pβ oxygens in UDP-Galp. Reconstitution of apo-UGM with 5-deaza-FAD showed no effect on an observable low background rate of PIX despite the comparable binding affinities of 5-deaza-FAD and FADred (15Huang Z. Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Reconstitution of UDP-galactopyranose mutase with 1-deaza-FAD and 5-deaza-FAD: analysis and mechanistic implications.Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation that 5-deaza-FAD is unable to substitute for FADred in catalyzing PIX of the Pβ oxygens implies that N5 of FADred is necessary for cleavage of the anomeric C1–OPβ bond. The background PIX is most likely due to residual (<1%) holo-UGM in the apo-UGM preparation, which is consistent with the tight binding of FADred to UGM (KD < 10 nm) (15Huang Z. Zhang Q. Liu H.W. Reconstitution of UDP-galactopyranose mutase with 1-deaza-FAD and 5-deaza-FAD: analysis and mechanistic implications.Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the observed formation of UDP-Galf in all reactions (see supplemental data). It should also be noted that PIX would be independent of SET if the reaction were to proceed via the oxocarbenium ion intermediate 4 (Fig. 1, paths B and C). Thus, the inability of reduced 5-deaza-FAD to promote anomeric bond cleavage/reformation of 1 and 2 cannot be ascribed to an inability to facilitate SET and is more likely due to the absence of N5 serving as the nucleophile in C1–OPβ bond cleavage during the concerted attack at C1 of the substrate (Fig. 1, path A). To characterize the role of N5 of FADred during the UGM-catalyzed isomerization more closely, we next examined the kinetic LFERs associated with changes in the nucleophilicity of N5. If adduct 6 (or 8) is formed via an SN2-type substitution (Fig. 1, path A), and if this step is at least partially rate-limiting to steady-state turnover, then changes in the nucleophilicity of N5 should be reflected in the rate of steady-state turnover. In contrast, the rate of steady-state turnover is expected to be much less sensitive to the nucleophilicity of N5 if adduct formation proceeds by an SN1 or a SET pathway (Fig. 1, paths B and C), where formation of the oxocarbenium species (4) would be substantially rate-limiting. Thus, as the electron density at N5 of FADred is decreased by substitution of the isoalloxazine moiety, a decrease in the steady-state reaction rate is expected for mechanism A, whereas little or no effect is expected for mechanisms B and C. To test this hypothesis, several FAD analogues (Fig. 4A) containing electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups at positions 7 and/or 8 of the isoalloxazine moiety (meta and para, respectively, to the N5 position) were chemoenzymatically synthesized according to published procedures (14Thibodeaux C.J. Chang W.C. Liu H.W. Linear free energy relationships demonstrate a catalytic role for the flavin mononucleotide coenzyme of the type II isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 9994-9996Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The nucleophilicity of N5 is represented as the sum of the σm and σp substituent constants for the substituent at the meta and para positions, respectively, of the FAD analogues. These substituent constants are based on the ionization of phenylacetic acid in water (18Taft Jr., R.W. Ehrenson S. Lewis I.C. Glick R.E. Evaluation of resonance effects on reactivity by application of the linear inductive energy relationship. VI. Concerning the effects of polarization and conjugation on the mesomeric Order.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 5352-5361Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Except for the para-methoxy substituent, these values are nearly identical to the Hammett substituent constants obtained for ionization of benzoic acid in water (21Hansch C. Leo A. Taft R.W. A survey of Hammett substituent constants and resonance and field parameters.Chem. Rev. 1991; 91: 165-195Crossref Scopus (6965) Google Scholar). In the case of p-methoxy, σp is significantly more negative with benzoic acid likely due to hydrogen bond stabilization of a trans-quinoidal resonance structure in H2O (22Taft Jr., R.W. Sigma values from reactivities.J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 1805-1815Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although a better correlation was obtained with the values of σm and σp based on ionization of phenylacetic acid, the same conclusions were drawn with those based on benzoic acid (see supplemental data). Previous studies of many flavoenzymes (14Thibodeaux C.J. Chang W.C. Liu H.W.

Soc. 2003; 125: 15789-15795Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reconstituted with 7- and 8-substituted flavin analogues have established a precedence for significant LFERs correlating Hammett substituent constants with a variety of parameters related to flavin structure and reactivity. A linear correlation of log10(kcat) for the UGM-catalyzed reaction versus the sum of σm and σp for the FAD analogues was observed with a slope of −2.4 as shown in the Hammett plot of Fig. 4B. This implies that the rate of steady-state turnover by UGM is indeed sensitive to the electron density at N5 of FADred. The large negative ρ value suggests a substantial decrease in electron density on the flavin in the transition state of the step(s) that limits steady-state turnover. For the conversion of 2 to 1, formation of adduct 8 via an SN2-type reaction (2 → 8) and/or formation of the iminium species (8 → 7) would involve substantial loss of electron density from the flavin N5 center. If formation of 8 (Fig. 1) were to occur via an SN1 process, the expectation would be a ρ value approximating zero. Similarly, rate-determining product dissociation in either mechanism would also be expected to yield a ρ value near zero. Alone, the results of our LFER studies cannot distinguish between rate-limiting SN2-type adduct formation (2 → 8) and iminium formation (8 → 7). However, our PIX studies strongly suggest that if an SN1-type mechanism were operative, then cleavage of the anomeric bond to form an oxocarbenium intermediate (4) would be energetically demanding and contribute significantly to limiting kcat. Because this step is significantly impaired when N5 of FADred is absent in the active site of UGM, the most consistent interpretation of our PIX and LFER studies is that adduct formation (2 → 8) occurs by an SN2-type reaction that is mediated by N5 of FADred. In summary, 5-deaza-FAD is not able to support PIX of the β-phosphate oxygens of UDP-Galp, and kcat for the isomerization of UDP-Galf to UDP-Galp exhibits a negative LFER with respect to decreasing electron density at N5 of FADred. These observations represent a direct experimental evaluation of nucleophilic participation by FADred during UGM catalysis. Together, they support a mechanism in which the covalent FADred-Galp/f intermediates (6/8) are formed through a concerted SN2-type displacement involving N5 of FADred as the nucleophile. Thus, as has been characterized recently in several other flavoenzymes (14Thibodeaux C.J. Chang W.C. Liu H.W.

Chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury, leads to prolonged excruciating suffering and a reduced quality of life. However, effective treatment of chronic pain remains a major challenge, with only half of patients receiving adequate pain relief (1.Dworkin R.H. O'Connor A.B. Backonja M. Farrar J.T. Finnerup N.B.

Pain can occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to mildly painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) or stimuli not normally perceived as painful (allodynia). Our understanding of the mechanisms that sustain chronic neuropathic pain conditions is incomplete. It is likely that neuropathic pain becomes chronic as a result of the plasticity of both peripheral nerves and spinal dorsal horn neurons. Clinical studies of patients with neuropathic pain have indicated that the altered central processing associated with pain is maintained dynamically by ongoing peripheral input (2.Campero M. Serra J.

Another important auxiliary subunit, the Cavβ subunit, is involved in promoting the surface expression of the α1 subunit and the gating properties of HVACCs (10.De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P.

There are four Cavβ subunits, each with splice variants, encoded by four distinct genes. The Cavβ1 subunit appears to be the only Cavβ subunit expressed in the skeletal muscle (13.Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Molecular basis for Ca2+ channel diversity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), whereas the Cavβ2 subunit is present primarily in the heart (14.Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

The Cavβ3 subunit is strongly expressed in smooth muscle and brain, and the Cavβ4 is the predominant subunit in cerebellum (14.Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

Despite the importance of Cavβ subunits in regulating HVACC activity, little is known about the contribution of Cavβ subunits to nerve injury-induced changes in HVACC activity in primary sensory neurons and neuropathic pain. high voltage-activated calcium channels dorsal root ganglion excitatory postsynaptic current spinal nerve ligation. Therefore, we used a rat model of neuropathic pain to determine how nerve injury affects the expression level of Cavβ subunits in the DRG and dorsal spinal cord. We also determined the contribution of the Cavβ3 subunit to increased HVACC activity in DRG neurons and nociceptive input to the spinal cord induced by nerve injury. Our findings indicate that among the four Cavβ subunits in the DRG and spinal cord, Cavβ3 and Cavβ4 showed the greatest expression. Nerve injury up-regulated the Cavβ3, but not Cavβ4, subunit in the DRG. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of Cavβ3 greatly reduced increased HVACC activity in the DRG, glutamatergic input to the spinal cord, and pain hypersensitivity caused by nerve injury without impairing normal nociception. Our study highlights the important role of the Cavβ3 subunit in increased HVACC activity in primary sensory neurons in neuropathic pain. Therefore, targeting the Cavβ3 subunit at the spinal level represents a new strategy for treating neuropathic pain with improved therapeutic profiles. Neuropathic pain was induced by SNL in rats, as described previously (20.Kim S.H. Chung J.M.

In brief, male Sprague-Dawley rats initially weighing ∼250 g (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized with use of 2% isoflurane. The left L5 and L6 spinal nerves were isolated under a surgical microscope and ligated with 4.0 silk suture. Sham surgery was performed in the contralateral side of the same rats or separate rats by using the same procedure except that the spinal nerves were not ligated. In some rats, intrathecal cannulation was performed 7 days after SNL. After rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, catheters (PE-10 polyethylene tubing, 8 cm) were inserted through an incision in the cisternal membrane and advanced caudally so that the tip of each catheter was positioned at the lumbar spinal level (22.Chen S.R.

All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals. To assess mechanical nociception, paw withdrawal thresholds were measured by applying a noxious pressure stimulus using an Ugo Basil Analgesimeter (Varese, Italy). The nociceptive threshold was recorded when rats displayed pain by paw withdrawal or vocalization. The cutoff of 400 g was used to avoid potential tissue injury (22.Chen S.R. Cai Y.Q. Pan H.L. Plasticity and emerging role of BKCa channels in nociceptive control in neuropathic pain.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The tactile withdrawal threshold was measured by application of von Frey filaments to both hind paws of SNL rats. Rats were placed individually in plastic cages on a mesh floor and then allowed to acclimate for at least 30 min. A series of calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw. Brisk withdrawal or paw flinching was considered a positive response. The tactile stimulus that could produce a 50% likelihood of withdrawal was determined by using the “up-down” calculating method (21.Chen S.R. Eisenach J.C. McCaslin P.P. Pan H.L.

The lumbar segment of the vertebral column was removed quickly. The L5 and L6 DRGs were obtained and transferred into cold DMEM (Invitrogen). After DRGs were minced, they were placed into 5 ml of DMEM containing trypsin (type I, 0.2 mg/ml; Sigma) and collagenase (type I, 1 mg/ml; Sigma). After incubation at 34 °C for 40 min, 10% FBS was used to stop trypsin digestion. Neurons were plated onto a 35-mm culture dish containing poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml) precoated coverslips. The cells were incubated in fresh medium for at least another hour before they were used for electrophysiological recording of HVACC activity. HVACC currents were measured using barium as the charge carrier (IBa) (25.Wu Z.Z. Pan H.L.

After establishing the whole-cell configuration, the cell membrane capacitance and series resistance were electronically compensated. Signals were processed with use of an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Lambrecht, Germany), filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and acquired by using the Pulse program (HEKA Instruments). The extracellular solution consisted of 140 mm tetraethylammonium, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm BaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, osmolarity of 320 mosm). The pipette internal solution consisted of 120 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgATP, and 0.3 mm NaGTP (pH 7.2, osmolarity of 300 mosm). The voltage-dependent activation of HVACCs was tested at a holding potential of −90 mV and elicited by a series of command potentials from −70 to 50 mV for 150 ms in 10-mV steps (5-s intervals). The voltage-dependent inactivation of HVACCs was assessed by depolarizing cells to a series of prepulse potentials from −90 to 10 mV for 500 ms, followed by a command potential to 0 for 150 ms (25.Wu Z.Z.

After rats were anesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane, the lumbar segment of the spinal cord at the L5/L6 level was removed through laminectomy. The spinal cord tissue was immediately placed in ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid presaturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained 234 mm sucrose, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mm glucose, and 25 mm NaHCO3. The tissue was then placed in a shallow groove formed in a gelatin block and glued onto the stage of a vibratome. Transverse spinal cord slices (400 μm) were cut in the ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid and preincubated in Krebs' solution oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 34 °C for at least 1 h before they were transferred to the recording chamber. The Krebs' solution contained 117 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 11 mm glucose, and 25 mm NaHCO3 gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Each spinal cord slice was placed in a glass-bottomed chamber and continuously perfused with Krebs' solution at 5.0 ml/min at 34 °C maintained by an in-line solution heater and a temperature controller. The neurons in lamina II (substantia gelatinosa) at the L5 and L6 levels were identified under a fixed-stage microscope (BX50WI; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with differential interference contrast/infrared illumination. Lamina II neurons were selected for recording because they primarily receive nociceptive input from peripheral nerve fibers (27.Pan H.L. Khan G.M. Alloway K.D. Chen S.R.

The impedance of the electrode was 5–10 megohms when filled with internal solution containing 135 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm ATP-Mg, 0.5 mm sodium GTP, and 10 mm lidocaine N-ethyl bromide (QX314) adjusted to pH 7.2–7.4 with 1 m KOH (290–300 mosm). EPSCs of lamina II neurons were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV and evoked by electrical stimulation (0.8 mA, 0.2 ms, 0.2 Hz) of the dorsal root (31.Zhou H.Y. Zhang H.M. Chen S.R. Pan H.L. Increased C-fiber nociceptive input potentiates inhibitory glycinergic transmission in the spinal dorsal horn.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 324: 1000-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the stimulation intensity used, both A- and C-fiber afferents that were in close contact with the electrode tip were stimulated (30.Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L.

Signals were processed by an amplifier (MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), filtered at 1–2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored into a computer with pCLAMP 9.2 (Molecular Devices). We used agarose gel electrophoresis to determine which Cavβ subunits are expressed in the DRG and dorsal spinal cord. Because Cavβ subunits have a high “G-C” content, a “slow-down” PCR method was used for PCR amplification as reported previously (33.Frey U.H. Bachmann H.S. Peters J. Siffert W. PCR amplification of GC-rich regions. “Slowdown PCR.”.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PCR products were generated with LA TaqTM DNA polymerase (Takara), amplified with use of Cavβ subunit-specific primers, and analyzed with use of agarose gels. The sequence primers of the four Cavβ subunits that were used are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1List of primers used in PCR-agarose gel analysisGene (accession no.)PrimersCaVβ1 (NM_017346.1)Fwd: 5′-CACACCCGCCTAGCAGGACG-3′Rev: 5′-CGGCCCCGGTTCCTGTTGTC-3′CaVβ2 (NM_053851.1)Fwd: 5′-AGTGGTGTTGGTGGGCCCCT-3′Rev: 5′-ACTCCTGCGGGGGACACTGG-3′CaVβ3 (NM_012828.2)Fwd: 5′-AACCACCCAGCACAGCTAGCC-3′Rev: 5′-CACTGGGCGGACCCAGCATC-3′CaVβ4 (NM_012828.2)Fwd: 5′-CACCAGATCCAGCCTAGCGGAA-3′Rev: 5′-TTGTGTGGGTGGCACGCCAAT-3′GAPDH (NM_012828.2)Fwd: 5′-TGCCACTCAGAAGACTGTGG-3′Rev: 5′-TTCAGCTCTGGGATGACCTT-3′ Open table in a new tab We also used real-time PCR to determine the relative mRNA level of the Cavβ subunits.

Total protein was extracted by centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). The blot was probed with anti-Cavβ2 (NeuroMab, Davis, CA; 1:1000 dilution), anti-Cavβ3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000 dilution), anti-Cavβ4 (NeuroMab; 1:1000 dilution), and anti-GAPDH (Millipore; 1:1000 dilution). ImageJ was used to quantify the band intensities. The amounts of Cavβ subunit proteins were normalized by GAPDH, and the mean values of the DRG or spinal cord tissues in the contralateral side of nerve injury were considered as 1. To determine the cellular distribution of the Cavβ3 subunit in the DRG, we performed double immunofluorescence labeling of this Cavβ3 subunit with a marker for small neurons (peripherin) (34.Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. A sensory neuron-specific, proton-gated ion channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sections were rinsed in Tris-HCl buffer and incubated with 1% H2O2 in TBS for 30 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase. Sections were blocked with 5% blocking reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl for 1 h at 25 °C. Then the sections were incubated with the primary antibody mixture as follows: rabbit anti-Cavβ3 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel; dilution 1:100) and mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma; dilution 1:200) or mouse anti-peripherin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; dilution 1:100) at 25 °C for 2 h and at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, sections were rinsed and incubated with the secondary antibody mixture as follows: peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; dilution 1:100) and Alexa Fluor-594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; dilution 1:400) for 2 h at room temperature. Then the sections were rinsed and incubated with fluorescein tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; dilution 1:100) for 10 min. Finally, the sections were rinsed, mounted on slides, dried, and coverslipped. The negative control was established by omitting the primary antibody. The sections were examined on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and the areas of interest were photo-documented. To quantify changes in the distribution of Cavβ3 in peripherin- and NF200-immunoreactive DRG neurons by nerve injury, four confocal images were randomly selected from each DRG (two DRGs/rat) in three control and three nerve-injured rats, and the total number of peripherin- and NF200-immunoreactive cell bodies with and without Cavβ3 labeling was counted from each section. All of the siRNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego). Two Cavβ3-specific siRNAs (IDT catalog numbers 57372397 and 57372400) and a control siRNA (IDT catalog number 58008661; target sense, CGUUAAUCGCGUAUAAUACGCGUAT) were diluted by using RNA-free duplex buffer (1 μg/μl), incubated at 94 °C for 2"

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TPR Mps1 was acquired after the split between deutorostomes and protostomes, as it is distinguishable in chordates and echinoderms. Overexpression of TPR Mps1 resulted in decreased efficiency of both chromosome alignment and mitotic arrest, likely through displacement of endogenous Mps1 from the kinetochore and decreased Mps1 catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2046674182,"The tumor suppressor gene hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), which encodes a transcriptional repressor, is epigenetically silenced in many human tumors. Here, we show that ectopic expression of HIC1 in the highly malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line severely impairs cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In parallel, infection of breast cancer cell lines with a retrovirus expressing HIC1 also induces decreased mRNA and protein expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP experiments demonstrate that endogenous HIC1 proteins are bound, together with the MTA1 corepressor, to the EphA2 promoter in WI38 cells. Taken together, our results identify EphA2 as a new direct target gene of HIC1. Finally, we observe that inactivation of endogenous HIC1 through RNA interference in normal breast epithelial cells results in the up-regulation of EphA2 and is correlated with increased cellular migration. To conclude, our results involve the tumor suppressor HIC1 in the transcriptional regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor EphA2, whose ligand ephrin-A1 is also a HIC1 target gene. Thus, loss of the regulation of this Eph pathway through HIC1 epigenetic silencing could be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of epithelial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1966477099,"Huntington disease (HD) is one of several fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with misfolded proteins. Here, we report a novel method for the sensitive detection of misfolded huntingtin (HTT) isolated from the brains of transgenic (Tg) mouse models of HD and humans with HD using an amyloid seeding assay (ASA), which is based on the propensity of misfolded proteins to act as a seed and shorten the nucleation-associated lag phase in the kinetics of amyloid formation in vitro. Using synthetic polyglutamine peptides as the substrate for amyloid formation, we found that partially purified misfolded HTT obtained from end-stage brain tissue of two Tg HD mouse models and brain tissue of post-mortem human HD patients was capable of specifically accelerating polyglutamine amyloid formation compared with unseeded reactions and controls. Alzheimer and prion disease brain tissues did not do so, demonstrating the specificity of the ASA. It is unclear whether early intermediates or later conformational species in the protein misfolding process act as seeds in the ASA for HD. However, we were able to detect misfolded protein in the brains of YAC128 mice early in disease pathogenesis (11 weeks of age), whereas large inclusion bodies have not been observed in the brains of these mice by histology until 78 weeks of age, much later in the pathogenic process. The sensitive detection of misfolded HTT protein early in the disease pathogenesis in the YAC128 Tg mouse model strengthens the argument for a causative role of protein misfolding in HD."
https://openalex.org/W1969875323,"Polysialic acid on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) modulates cell-cell adhesion and signaling, is required for proper brain development, and plays roles in neuronal regeneration and the growth and invasiveness of tumor cells. Evidence indicates that NCAM polysialylation is highly protein-specific, requiring an initial polysialyltransferase-NCAM protein-protein interaction. Previous work suggested that a polybasic region located prior to the conserved polysialyltransferase catalytic motifs may be involved in NCAM recognition, but not overall enzyme activity (Foley, D. A., Swartzentruber, K. G., and Colley, K. J. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 15505-15516). Here, we employ a competition assay to evaluate the role of this region in substrate recognition. We find that truncated, catalytically inactive ST8SiaIV/PST proteins that include the polybasic region, but not those that lack this region, compete with endogenous ST8SiaIV/PST and reduce NCAM polysialylation in SW2 small cell lung carcinoma cells. Replacing two polybasic region residues, Arg(82) and Arg(93), eliminates the ability of a full-length, catalytically inactive enzyme (PST H331K) to compete with SW2 cell ST8SiaIV/PST and block NCAM polysialylation. Replacing these residues singly or together in ST8SiaIV/PST substantially reduces or eliminates NCAM polysialylation, respectively. In contrast, replacing Arg(82), but not Arg(93), substantially reduces the ability of ST8SiaIV/PST to polysialylate neuropilin-2 and SynCAM 1, suggesting that Arg(82) plays a general role in substrate recognition, whereas Arg(93) specifically functions in NCAM recognition. Taken together, our results indicate that the ST8SiaIV/PST polybasic region plays a critical role in substrate recognition and suggest that different combinations of basic residues may mediate the recognition of distinct substrates."

SfmD, a hypothetical protein in the biosynthetic pathway of SFM-A, was hypothesized to be responsible for the generation of the 3-hydroxy group of 3-OH-5-Me-OMe-Tyr based on previously heterologous expression results. We now report the in vitro characterization of SfmD as a novel heme-containing peroxidase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of 3-methyltyrosine to 3-hydroxy-5-methyltyrosine using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. In addition, we elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of 3-OH-5-Me-OMe-Tyr by kinetic studies of SfmD in combination with biochemical assays of SfmM2, a methyltransferase within the same pathway. Furthermore, SacD, a counterpart of SfmD involved in safracin B biosynthesis, was also characterized as a heme-containing peroxidase, suggesting that SfmD-like heme-containing peroxidases may be commonly involved in the biosynthesis of SFM-A and its analogs. Finally, we found that the conserved motif HXXXC is crucial for heme binding using comparative UV-Vis and Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra studies of SfmD wild-type and mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2087955046,"Centrosomal protein 55 (Cep55), which is localized to the centrosome in interphase cells and recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis, is a regulator required for the completion of cell abscission. Up-regulation of Cep55 and inactivation of p53 occur in the majority of human cancers, raising the possibility of a link between these two genes. In this study we evaluated the role of p53 in Cep55 regulation. We demonstrated that Cep55 expression levels are well correlated with cancer cell growth rate and that p53 is able to negatively regulate Cep55 protein and promoter activity. Down-regulation of expression of Cep55 was accompanied by repression of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) levels due to p53 induction. Overexpression of Plk1 and knockdown of p53 expression both enhanced the post-translational protein stability of Cep55. BI 2356, a selective Plk1 inhibitor, however, prevented Cep55 accumulation in p53 knockdown cells while persistently keeping Plk1 levels elevated. Our results, therefore, indicate the existence of a p53-Plk1-Cep55 axis in which p53 negatively regulates expression of Cep55, through Plk1 which, in turn, is a positive regulator of Cep55 protein stability."

https://openalex.org/W2033097779,"This study investigates the dynamics of zymogen activation when both extrinsic tenase and prothrombinase are assembled on an appropriate membrane. Although the activation of prothrombin by surface-localized prothrombinase is clearly mediated by flow-induced dilutional effects, we find that when factor X is activated in isolation by surface-localized extrinsic tenase, it exhibits characteristics of diffusion-mediated activation in which diffusion of substrate to the catalytically active region is rate-limiting. When prothrombin and factor X are activated coincident with each other, competition for available membrane binding sites masks the diffusion-limiting effects of factor X activation. To verify the role of membrane binding in the activation of factor X by extrinsic tenase under flow conditions, we demonstrate that bovine lactadherin competes for both factor X and Xa binding sites, limiting factor X activation and forcing the release of bound factor Xa from the membrane at a venous shear rate (100 s(-1)). Finally, we present steady-state models of prothrombin and factor X activation under flow showing that zymogen and enzyme membrane binding events further regulate the coagulation process in an open system representative of the vasculature geometry."

We demonstrate that hδOR-Cys-27 acts in a dominant negative manner and impairs cell surface delivery of the co-expressed hδOR-Phe-27 and impairs conversion of precursors to the mature form. This was demonstrated by metabolic labeling, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy in HEK293 and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using differentially epitope-tagged variants. The hδOR-Phe-27 precursors that were redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation were, however, rescued by a pharmacological chaperone, the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Co-immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled variants revealed that both endoplasmic reticulum-localized precursors and mature receptors exist as homo/heteromers. The existence of homo/heteromers was confirmed in living cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements, showing that the variants have a similar propensity to form homo/heteromers.

https://openalex.org/W2081941532,"The bursa of Fabricius, the acknowledged central humoral immune organ, plays a vital role in B lymphocyte differentiation. However, there are few reports of the molecular basis of the mechanism on immune induction and potential antitumor activity of bursal-derived peptides. In this paper, a novel bursal-derived pentapeptide-II (BPP-II, MTLTG) was isolated and exerted immunomodulatory functions on antibody responses in vitro. Gene microarray analyses demonstrated that BPP-II regulated expression of 2478 genes in a mouse-derived hybridoma cell line. Immune-related gene ontology functional procedures were employed for further functional analysis. Furthermore, the majority of BPP-II-regulated pathways were associated with immune responses and tumor processes. Moreover, BPP-II exhibited immunomodulatory effects on antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, including enhancement of avian influenza virus (H9N2 subtype)-specific antibody and cytokine production and modification of T cell immunophenotypes and lymphocyte proliferation. Finally, BPP-II triggered p53 expression and stabilization and selectively inhibited tumor cell proliferation. These data identified the multifunctional factor, BPP-II, as a novel biomaterial representing an important linking between the humoral central immune system and immune induction, including antitumor. Information generated in this study elucidates further the mechanisms involved in humoral immune system and represents the potential basis of effective immunotherapeutic strategies for treating human tumors and immune improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2061048939,"Crescentic glomerulonephritis (Crgn) is a complex disease where the initial insult is often the glomerular deposition of antibodies against intrinsic or deposited antigens in the glomerulus. The role of Fc receptors in the induction and progression of Crgn is increasingly recognized, and our previous studies have shown that copy number variation in Fcgr3 partially explains the genetic susceptibility of the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat to nephrotoxic nephritis, a rat model of Crgn. The Fcgr3-related sequence (Fcgr3-rs) is a novel rat-specific Fc receptor with a cytoplasmic domain 6 amino acids longer than its paralogue, Fcgr3. The Fcgr3-rs gene is deleted from the WKY rat genome, and this deletion is associated with enhanced macrophage activity in this strain. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the deletion of Fcgr3-rs in the WKY strain leads to increased macrophage activation. By lentivirus-mediated gene delivery, we generated stably transduced U937 cells expressing either Fcgr3-rs or Fcgr3. In these cells, which lack endogenous Fcgr3 receptors, we show that Fcgr3-rs interacts with the common Fc-γ chain but that Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis and signaling are defective. Furthermore, in primary macrophages, expression of Fcgr3-rs inhibits Fc receptor-mediated functions, because WKY bone marrow-derived macrophages transduced with Fcgr3-rs had significantly reduced phagocytic activity.

In crescentic glomerulonephritis, leukocytes, especially monocytes/macrophages, infiltrating the glomerulus play a critical role in the development of the disease by recognizing immunoglobulins and complement factors via cell surface receptors (1.Mason J.C. Pusey C.D. The Kidney in Systemic Autoimmune Diseases. 1st Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2008Google Scholar). One of the checkpoints regulating the immune response in glomerular inflammation is through leukocyte cell surface receptors for the Fc (fragment crystallizable) portion of IgG. The family of Fc receptors can regulate the fine balance between pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory states of cell activation, and there is increasing evidence suggesting that genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is partly dependent on Fc receptor-mediated activating and inhibitory signaling pathways determining the net signal (pro- or anti-inflammatory) in the progression of the disease (2.Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Fc-receptors as regulators of immunity.Adv. Immunol. 2007; 96: 179-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3.Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V.

There are two distinct classes of Fc receptors: the activatory and the inhibitory receptors. Most activatory receptors serve as the ligand-binding component of a receptor that also includes a signal transducing molecule containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) 2The abbreviations used are: ITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifFcRFc receptorBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageNTNnephrotoxic nephritisCrgnCrescentic glomerulonephritisWKYWistar-KyotoqRTquantitative RTPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

In monocytes and macrophages, this role is fulfilled by the common γ chain. Signaling via its ITAM motif triggers the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways including the activation of Src and Syk kinases, calcium mobilization, and NF-κB activation, leading ultimately to cellular responses such as phagocytosis and cytokine production. The importance of activatory Fcγ receptors in glomerulonephritis has been shown using mice engineered to lack the ITAM-bearing Fc receptor γ chain. We and others have shown that these mice are protected from glomerulonephritis induced by antibodies to glomerular basement membrane (6.Park S.Y. Ueda S. Ohno H. Hamano Y. Tanaka M. Shiratori T.

Positional cloning of Crgn1 led to the identification and functional characterization of the Fcgr3-related sequence (Fcgr3-rs), a novel rat-specific activatory Fc receptor arising from copy number variation in the Fcgr3 gene (9.Aitman T.J.

The genomic rearrangement in the Fcgr3 gene is such that there is a duplication of exon 5 in the NTN-resistant Lewis genomic DNA with the presence of a shorter exon lacking a sequence of 226 bp in its 3′-untranslated region. This shorter exon 5 was deleted in the WKY genome, suggesting a copy number variation in the Fcgr3 gene. Sequence analysis of this shorter copy of exon 5 revealed deletion of a single guanine nucleotide at position 129 (ΔG129) in the coding sequence of the cytoplasmic domain, resulting in a frameshift and generating a novel cytoplasmic domain 6 amino acids longer than that encoded by Fcgr3. We designated this copy number variant Fcgr3-related sequence (Fcgr3-rs) and showed that this novel variant is transcribed and translated in the Lewis strain, whereas it is deleted from the WKY genome (9.Aitman T.J. Dong R. Vyse T.J. Norsworthy P.J. Johnson M.D. Smith J. Mangion J. Roberton-Lowe C. Marshall A.J. Petretto E. Hodges M.D. Bhangal G. Patel S.G. Sheehan-Rooney K. Duda M. Cook P.R. Evans D.J. Domin J.

Given the increased macrophage activity and associated NTN susceptibility in the WKY rat that lacks the Fcgr3-rs molecule, it is important to understand how the presence of this molecule might be influencing macrophage activity. Thus, we have studied the role of Fcgr3-rs in macrophage activation. We first investigated whether the genomic duplication/deletion event giving rise to Fcgr3-rs occurred during the derivation of inbred Wistar-related colonies. We have then generated U937 cells stably expressing either Fcgr3 or Fcgr3-rs and have studied the role of Fcgr3-rs in macrophage activation both in U937 cells and WKY bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) transduced with Fcgr3-rs. Our results show that the absence of Fcgr3-rs is not specific to the WKY strain but is widely distributed throughout the rat phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, in both human monocyte cell lines and primary rat macrophages, expression of Fcgr3-rs inhibits Fcgr3-mediated signaling and phagocytosis, suggesting that the rat possesses a unique mechanism by which Fc receptor-mediated cell activation can be modulated. WKY (WKY/NCrl) rats were purchased from Charles River. All of the procedures were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm l-glutamine was purchased from Biowhittaker (Berkshire, UK). FCS was from PAA (Yeovil, UK) or Labtech (East Sussex, UK). All of the growth media were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), supplied as a 100× sterile solution from Biowhittaker. LPS was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies were from Millipore (anti-Myc), Santa Cruz (F(ab′)2, anti-Syk, anti-CD16), GE Healthcare (HRP-conjugated antibodies for Western blot), or Upstate Biotech (anti-γ chain). pCSGW vector was a gift from Richard Jenner (University College London, London, UK). Fcgr3 exon 5 genotype was determined by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis by using primers to amplify exon 5 genomic DNA from 134 laboratory rat strains and substrains available in the National BioResource project for the rat in Japan. The primer sequence used is as follows: 5′-GTCCCTAAATTCTGAATTTC-3′ and 5′-AAAGAAGTCACAGAAAGGAG-3′.

All α subunit constructs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) expression vector (Invitrogen).

Constructs and PCR products were cut with HindIII and BamHI and ligated to each other. Lentivirus constructs were prepared as follows: DNA was excised from pCDNA3.1 by digestion with HindIII/XbaI, and blunt ends were created using Pfu DNA polymerase. This was ligated into a SmaI cut pENTR4.3F. This “in house” modified version of the pENTR4 gateway vector contains a multiple cloning site downstream of a CMV promoter and upstream of an internal ribosome entry sequence, which mediates expression of an enhanced GFP sequence. Inserts in the correct orientation were identified by diagnostic restriction enzyme digests. Subsequent digestion of this vector with SalI and NotI released a DNA “cassette” containing the “gene of interest” internal ribosome entry sequence-EGP sequences. This was then cloned into the pCSGW lentiviral transfer vector (10.Bainbridge J.W. Stephens C. Parsley K. Demaison C. Halfyard A. Thrasher A.J. Ali R.R.

Transfer vector (pCSGW), lentiviral mammalian expression vector (envelope, pMD2.G), and packaging vector (psPAX2) were mixed at a ratio of 4:3:1 and used to infect confluent monolayers of 293T17 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The medium was replaced after 16 h. Media containing virus were collected after a subsequent 24 and 48 h of culture. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μ filters. This crude viral supernatant was stored at −80 °C until use. Titers of viral preparations produced in this way were established by infection of U937 cells as follows. Briefly, U937 cells were mixed with varying dilutions of viral supernatant (typically 1/5 to 1/500) in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma). The cells were “spinoculated” by spinning at 2200 rpm for 2 h at 30 °C. After 72 h, the percentage of GFP-positive cells (FITC channel) was determined by FACS analysis (using a LSRII FACS). The lowest dilution factor with GFP+ score of <20% was used to calculate viral titer. Human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells were infected with lentivirus carrying the gene of interest at a ratio of 1:1 (cells:virus) as described above. The cells were then cultured overnight before removal of virus containing media. Cell surface Myc-positive cells (Myc-Fcgr3 or Myc-Fcgr3RS) were isolated by panning on 10-cm Petri dishes coated with anti-Myc antibody (Millipore). Adherent cells were expanded in culture and used in subsequent experiments. GFP-positive cells expressing pCSGW (no surface Myc) were isolated by cell sorting based on FITC fluorescence. Subsequent analysis of cell lines by FACS analysis confirmed 90–100% of cells to be FITC-positive. The cells were resuspended in ice-cold serum-free RPMI and anti-Myc antibody (Millipore) added to a final concentration of 130 μg/ml. After 60 min of incubation on ice, the cells were washed three times and resuspended in serum free RPMI with 8 mg/ml goat anti-mouse IgGF(ab′)2. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of gel sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8). The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8, 1% digitonin), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) with 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate). The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose. Myc-labeled proteins were then precipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Millipore) or isotype matched control antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed in lysis buffer and were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Criterion). After electrotransfer on to nitrocellulose membrane, the membranes were blocked in 2% BSA/TBS/Tween (0.05%) and probed with the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). At 24 h after stimulation, the supernatants were harvested. The concentrations of TNFα and IL-10 were determined by ELISA (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was read and analyzed at 450 nm on a spectrophotometric ELISA plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan Biochromic) using the Ascent software program. Femurs from adult WKY rats were isolated and flushed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Total BM-derived cells were plated and infected with lentivirus carrying the gene of interest at a ratio of 5:1 (cells: virus). 48 h following the infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM that contained 25 mm HEPES (Sigma), 25% L929 conditioned medium, 25% decomplemented FBS (Biosera), penicillin (100 units/ml; Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and cultured for 5 days. These cells were characterized as macrophages by ED-1 staining. To assess phagocytosis, latex polystyrene 6.0-μm microspheres (50 beads/macrophage; Polysciences Inc.) were opsonized with BSA-anti-BSA IgG (Sigma) and added to transduced WKY macrophages cultured in 8-well glass chamber slides. Following staining with Diff-Quick fix (Dade Behring), 200 macrophages were counted to determine the number of beads ingested per cell. Stably transduced U937 cells were differentiated in macrophages after adding PMA (100 nm) for 48 h and stimulated with LPS (Sigma; 1 μg/ml) for 3 h. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and one-step qRT-PCR was performed using 100 ng of total RNA and Brilliant II SYBR® Green QRT-PCR Master Mix Kit (Agilent) with specific primers for Tnfa and IL1b1 in an ABI 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). In rat BMDMs, Fcgr3 levels relative to total Fcgr3 (Fcgr3 + Fcgr3-rs) were assessed by selecting a forward primer where Fcgr3 differs from Fcgr3-rs by two single nucleotide polymorphisms at the end of the 3′-end. The selected primers were Fcgr3-Forward: 5′TCTAGTGTGGTTCCATGCCG-3′ and Fcgr3-Reverse: 5′-TGTCCTGTGGAGCCTTGTACT-3′; total Fcgr3 (Fcgr3+Fcgr3-rs)-Forward: 5′-CTCCAGACCCCTCAACTGGT-3′ and total Fcgr3 (Fcgr3+Fcgr3-rs)-Reverse: 5′-GCAGTAGTAGTTCCCACTGT-3′. Statistical differences in mean values were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison post-test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Exon 5 of Fcgr3-rs contains a deletion of a single guanine nucleotide at position 129 (ΔG129) in the coding sequence of the cytoplasmic domain (9.Aitman T.J. Dong R. Vyse T.J. Norsworthy P.J. Johnson M.D. Smith J. Mangion J. Roberton-Lowe C. Marshall A.J. Petretto E. Hodges M.D. Bhangal G. Patel S.G. Sheehan-Rooney K. Duda M. Cook P.R. Evans D.J. Domin J. Flint J. Boyle J.J. Pusey C.D. Cook H.T. Copy number polymorphism in Fcgr3 predisposes to glomerulonephritis in rats and humans.Nature. 2006; 439: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). When compared with Fcgr3, this ΔG129 variant results in a frameshift in the Fcgr3-rs coding sequence and generates a novel cytoplasmic domain 6 amino acids longer than that encoded by Fcgr3 that was not found in any other species (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that Fcgr3-rs was deleted from NTN-susceptible Kyoto-derived strains (9.Aitman T.J. Dong R. Vyse T.J. Norsworthy P.J. Johnson M.D. Smith J. Mangion J. Roberton-Lowe C. Marshall A.J. Petretto E. Hodges M.D. Bhangal G. Patel S.G. Sheehan-Rooney K. Duda M. Cook P.R. Evans D.J. Domin J. Flint J. Boyle J.J. Pusey C.D. Cook H.T. Copy number polymorphism in Fcgr3 predisposes to glomerulonephritis in rats and humans.Nature. 2006; 439: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), but to investigate the distribution of this deletion throughout the rat genealogical tree, we carried out a phylogenetic tree analysis of 94 inbred laboratory strains and 40 of their substrains (Fig. 2). The results show that the deletion of Fcgr3-rs is widespread throughout the rat phylogeny (32 of 94 strains), suggesting that the origin of the deletion event is earlier then the derivation of these strains. We also investigated the relative levels of Fcgr3 and Fcgr3-rs mRNA levels in Lewis rat BMDMs by qRT-PCR and showed that although there is relatively increased Fcgr3 expression when compared with Fcgr3-rs, LPS stimulation did not change the relative levels of both receptors (Table 1).FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of 134 laboratory rat strains according to the presence or absence of Fcgr3-rs in the genome. A phylogenetic tree of 94 strains is shown. Strains having numerous substrains (i.e. SHR, F344) are shown in capital letters, and all of the substrains showed the same genotype as the founder strain. The tree was developed through a heuristic search for maximum parsimony implemented in PAUP 4.0b10. TreeView was used to display the radial tree. For BD IX, LEC/Tj, and WM/Tj, genotypes could not be determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Relative mRNA levels of Fcgr3 and Fcgr3-rs in Lewis rat BMDMsExpressionBMDMBasalLPSFcgr3/(Fcgr3 + Fcgr3-rs)0.73 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.01Fcgr3-rs/(Fcgr3 + Fcgr3-rs)0.27 ± 0.020.33 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab The U937 cell line does not express any endogenous FcgRIIIA (11.Floto R.A.

Thus, to study the role of Fcgr3-rs in macrophage activation, we generated U937 cells stably transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing the protein of interest. U937 cells were infected with either Myc-tagged Fcgr3 (Myc-Fcgr3), Myc tagged-Fcgr3-rs (Myc-Fcgr3RS), or empty (pCSGW) lentiviral vectors. All of the lentiviral vectors contained GFP. Expression of Myc-Fcgr3 and Myc-Fcgr3-rs was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, detecting GFP+ cells and also by a Myc Western blot on lysates from stably transduced U937 cells (Fig. 3A). We then investigated whether Myc-Fcgr3 and Myc-Fcgr3-rs are expressed on the surface of U937 cells. Flow cytometry analysis using an anti-Myc-APC mouse antibody (mAb) showed that both Myc-Fcgr3 and Myc-Fcgr3-rs are expressed on the cell surface at similar levels in these cells (Fig. 3B). Because Fcgr3 transport to and expression at the cell surface is known to be dependent on its association with the common γ chain (12.Park J.G. Isaacs R.E. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. In the absence of other Fc receptors, Fc γ RIIIA transmits a phagocytic signal that requires the cytoplasmic domain of its γ subunit.J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), these findings implied that both the Fcgr3 and Fcgr3-rs molecules were associated with γ chain at the cell surface. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of U937 cells expressing either Fcgr3 or Fcgr3-rs demonstrated that this was indeed the case (Fig. 3C). Thus, although Fcgr3-rs has an additional cytoplasmic domain 6 amino acids longer than its paralogue Fcgr3, it binds the γ-chain on the surface of stably transduced and PMA-differentiated U937 macrophages. In most macrophage Fc receptor complexes (with the exception of FcgrII), the ITAM-containing common γ-chain is necessary for downstream signaling (13.Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. Functional separation of pseudopod extension and particle internalization during Fc γ receptor-mediated phagocytosis.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14.Davis W. Harrison P.T. Hutchinson M.J. Allen J.M. Two distinct regions of FC γ RI initiate separate signalling pathways involved in endocytosis and phagocytosis.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the dimeric γ-chain forms multichain complexes with the ligand binding α-chain of Fcgr3 to allow signal transduction (3.Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Fcγ receptors as regulators of immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). This signaling starts with tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAMs by kinases of the SRC family (15.Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. Physical and functional association of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases with Fc γ RII in monocytic THP-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wang A.V. Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Physical and functional association of the high affinity immunoglobulin G receptor (Fc γ RI) with the kinases Hck and Lyn.J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and leads to the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of the Syk kinase, followed by the activation of various downstream targets such as PI3K and NF-κB. Subesquent changes in gene expression led to the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. We were therefore keen to understand whether the Fcgr3-rs is able to transduce signals similar to those described for Fcgr3. However, despite its interaction with the γ-chain, cross-linking of Fcgr3-rs with anti-Myc antibody does not lead to phosphorylation of Syk or the degradation of IκBα (Fig. 4A). This was not the case for the U937 macrophages stably transduced with Fcgr3 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Fc receptor-mediated TNFα production and IgG-opsonized bead phagocytosis were also significantly less in U937 macrophages expressing Fcgr3-rs when compared with U937 macrophages stably transduced with Fcgr3 (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that the rat-specific Fcgr3-rs is unable to mediate the same intracellular signals as the wild type receptor. To test whether the relative reduction in TNFα production in U937 cells transduced with Myc-Fcgr3RS is specific to receptor cross-linking, we have stimulated the stably transduced PMA-differentiated U937 cells with LPS for 3 h and measured TNFα and IL-1β expression levels by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5). Although the results have confirmed the previously shown up-regulation of these genes in U937 cells (17.Sharif O. Bolshakov V.N. Raines S. Newham P. Perkins N.D. Transcriptional profiling of the LPS induced NF-κB response in macrophages.BMC Immunol. 2007; 8: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), there was no significant difference in the up-regulation of TNFα and IL-1β between U937 + Myc-Fcgr3 and U937 + Myc-Fcgr3RS, demonstrating that the inability of these cells to produce TNFα is not an intrinsic property of these cells and is specific to Fcgr3 stimulation (Fig. 5). To study the effect of Fcgr3-rs on the phagocytic activity of primary WKY BMDMs where other endogenous, FcRs (Fcgr3 and others) are expressed, we transduced these cells with lentivirus encoding either Myc-Fcgr3rs or Myc-Fcgr3 and used cells transduced with the empty vector (pCSGW) as controls. Because the Fcgr3-rs also contains a number of single-base pair substitutions in its extracellular domain, we were also keen to establish whether"
https://openalex.org/W1967480610,"Tnrc6 family members (Tnrc6a/b/c) are key components of the RNA-induced silencing complex in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene suppression. Here, we show that Tnrc6a, also known as GW182, is selectively expressed in the yolk sac endoderm and that gene trap disruption of GW182 leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. We found that targets of miRNAs highly expressed in the yolk sac are significantly derepressed in GW182(gt/gt) mutant mice, although levels of miRNAs are not altered. Specifically, growth arrest and apoptosis phenotype are associated with significant derepression of Cdkn1a (p21), Cdkn1c (P27), Lats1, Lats2, Rb1, Rbl, Bim, and Pten, known targets of miRNAs from miR-17/20/93/106 clusters highly expressed in yolk sac endoderm. Together, these data strongly suggest that GW182 is an essential functional component in the RNA-induced silencing complex for miRNA-mediated gene silencing in vivo, and selectively regulation of miRNA activity plays an important role in the proper development of yolk sac."
