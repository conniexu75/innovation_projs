The statistical convergence of neutron scattering factors in more or less random structures, such as KH2PO4 and NH4Cl, was demonstrated. The coupling of this convergence with the effects of natural thermal oscillation or artificial convergence factors will permit a rather general use of Fourier methods in neutron crystallography. Extinction effects in single crystals were negligible. Neutron scattering data were considered more amenable to algebraic phase-determining methods than x-ray data. Effects on structure analysis of variations of the neutron scattering power for various nuclei are discussed."
