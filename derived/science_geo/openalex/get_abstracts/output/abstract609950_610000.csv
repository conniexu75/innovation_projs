https://openalex.org/W2800125502,"Climate change–reflected in significant environmental changes such as warming, sea level rise, shifts in salinity, oxygen and other ocean conditions–is expected to impact marine organisms and associated fisheries. This study provides an assessment of the potential impacts on, and the vulnerability of, marine biodiversity and fisheries catches in the Arabian Gulf under climate change. To this end, using three separate niche modelling approaches under a ‘business-as-usual’ climate change scenario, we projected the future habitat suitability of the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf) for 55 expert-identified priority species, including charismatic and non-fish species. Second, we conducted a vulnerability assessment of national economies to climate change impacts on fisheries. The modelling outputs suggested a high rate of local extinction (up to 35% of initial species richness) by 2090 relative to 2010. Spatially, projected local extinctions are highest in the southwestern part of the Gulf, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the projected patterns provided useful indicators of potential climate change impacts on the region’s diversity, the magnitude of changes in habitat suitability are more uncertain. Fisheries-specific results suggested reduced future catch potential for several countries on the western side of the Gulf, with projections differing only slightly among models. Qatar and the UAE were particularly affected, with more than a 26% drop in future fish catch potential. Integrating changes in catch potential with socio-economic indicators suggested the fisheries of Bahrain and Iran may be most vulnerable to climate change. We discuss limitations of the indicators and the methods used, as well as the implications of our overall findings for conservation and fisheries management policies in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2800941002,"An end-to-end network traffic matrix is significantly helpful for network management and for Software Defined Networks (SDN). However, the end-to-end network traffic matrix's inferences and estimations are a challenging problem. Moreover, attaining the traffic matrix in high-speed networks for SDN is a prohibitive challenge. This paper investigates how to estimate and recover the end-to-end network traffic matrix in fine time granularity from the sampled traffic traces, which is a hard inverse problem. Different from previous methods, the fractal interpolation is used to reconstruct the finer-granularity network traffic. Then, the cubic spline interpolation method is used to obtain the smooth reconstruction values. To attain an accurate the end-to-end network traffic in fine time granularity, we perform a weighted-geometric-average process for two interpolation results that are obtained. The simulation results show that our approaches are feasible and effective."
https://openalex.org/W2786125546,"Background Street imagery is a promising and growing big data source providing current and historical images in more than 100 countries. Studies have reported using this data to audit road infrastructure and other built environment features. Here we explore a novel application, using Google Street View (GSV) to predict travel patterns at the city level. Methods We sampled 34 cities in Great Britain. In each city, we accessed 2000 GSV images from 1000 random locations. We selected archived images from time periods overlapping with the 2011 Census and the 2011–2013 Active People Survey (APS). We manually annotated the images into seven categories of road users. We developed regression models with the counts of images of road users as predictors. The outcomes included Census-reported commute shares of four modes (combined walking plus public transport, cycling, motorcycle, and car), as well as APS-reported past-month participation in walking and cycling. Results We found high correlations between GSV counts of cyclists (‘GSV-cyclists’) and cycle commute mode share (r = 0.92)/past-month cycling (r = 0.90). Likewise, GSV-pedestrians was moderately correlated with past-month walking for transport (r = 0.46), GSV-motorcycles was moderately correlated with commute share of motorcycles (r = 0.44), and GSV-buses was highly correlated with commute share of walking plus public transport (r = 0.81). GSV-car was not correlated with car commute mode share (r = –0.12). However, in multivariable regression models, all outcomes were predicted well, except past-month walking. The prediction performance was measured using cross-validation analyses. GSV-buses and GSV-cyclists are the strongest predictors for most outcomes. Conclusions GSV images are a promising new big data source to predict urban mobility patterns. Predictive power was the greatest for those modes that varied the most (cycle and bus). With its ability to identify mode of travel and capture street activity often excluded in routinely carried out surveys, GSV has the potential to be complementary to new and traditional data. With half the world’s population covered by street imagery, and with up to 10 years historical data available in GSV, further testing across multiple settings is warranted both for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments."

In this study, we tested to what extent comprehensively phenotyped individuals reveal differences in metabolic responses to a standardized mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and how these responses change when individuals experience moderate weight loss. Metabolome analysis was used in 70 healthy individuals. with profiling of ~300 plasma metabolites during an MMTT over 8 h. Multivariate analysis of plasma markers of fatty acid catabolism identified 2 distinct metabotype clusters (A and B). Individuals from metabotype B showed slower glucose clearance, had increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue mass and higher hepatic lipid levels when compared with individuals from metabotype A. An NMR- based urine analysis revealed that these individuals also to have a less healthy dietary pattern. After a weight loss of ~5.6 kg over 12 wk, only the subjects from metabotype B showed positive changes in the glycemic response during the MMTT and in markers of metabolic diseases. Our study in healthy individuals demonstrates that more comprehensive phenotyping can reveal discrete metabotypes with different outcomes in a dietary intervention and that markers of lipid catabolism in plasma could allow early detection of the metabolic syndrome.—Fiamoncini, J., Rundle, M., Gibbons, H., Thomas, E.

https://openalex.org/W2800661493,"The application of meta-heuristic algorithms for t-way testing has recently become prevalent. Consequently, many useful meta-heuristic algorithms have been developed on the basis of the implementation of t-way strategies (where t indicates the interaction strength). Mixed results have been reported in the literature to highlight the fact that no single strategy appears to be superior compared with other configurations. The hybridization of two or more algorithms can enhance the overall search capabilities, that is, by compensating the limitation of one algorithm with the strength of others. Thus, hybrid variants of the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) are proposed in the current work. Four hybrid variants of FPA are considered by combining FPA with other algorithmic components. The experimental results demonstrate that FPA hybrids overcome the problems of slow convergence in the original FPA and offers statistically superior performance compared with existing t-way strategies in terms of test suite size."
https://openalex.org/W2801758271,"Pregnancy determination is difficult in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanolecua), representing a challenge for ex situ conservation efforts. Research in other species experiencing pseudopregnancy indicates that urinary/fecal concentrations of 13,14, dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2α (PGFM) can accurately determine pregnancy status. Our objective was to determine if urinary PGFM concentrations are associated with pregnancy status in the giant panda. Urinary PGFM concentrations were measured in female giant pandas (n = 4) throughout gestation (n = 6) and pseudopregnancy (n = 4) using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. Regardless of pregnancy status, PGFM excretion followed a predictable pattern: 1) baseline concentrations for 11–19 weeks following ovulation; 2) a modest, initial peak 14–36 days after the start of the secondary urinary progestagen rise; 3) a subsequent period of relatively low concentrations; and 4) a large, terminal peak at the end of the luteal phase. Pregnant profiles were distinguished by an earlier initial peak (P = 0.024), higher inter-peak concentrations (P < 0.001), and a larger terminal peak (P = 0.003) compared to pseudopregnancy profiles. Parturition occurred 23 to 25 days from the initial PGFM surge and within 24 hours of the start of the terminal increase. These pattern differences indicate that urinary PGFM monitoring can be used to predict pregnancy status and time parturition in the giant panda. Furthermore, this is the only species known to exhibit a significant PGFM increase during pseudopregnancy, suggesting a unique physiological mechanism for regulating the end of the luteal phase in the giant panda."
https://openalex.org/W2802588208,"Introduction Activity-monitoring devices may increase activity, but their effectiveness in sedentary, diseased, and less-motivated populations is unknown. Methods Subjects with diabetes or pre-diabetes were given a Fitbit and randomized into three groups: Fitbit only, Fitbit with reminders, and Fitbit with both reminders and goal setting. Subjects in the reminders group were sent text-message reminders to wear their Fitbit. The goal-setting group was sent a daily text message asking for a step goal. All subjects had three in-person visits (baseline, 3 and 6 months). We modelled daily steps and goal setting using linear mixed-effects models. Results 138 subjects participated with 48 in the Fitbit-only, 44 in the reminders, and 46 in the goal-setting groups. Daily steps decreased for all groups during the study. Average daily steps were 7123, 6906, and 6854 for the Fitbit-only, the goal-setting, and the reminders groups, respectively. The reminders group was 17.2 percentage points more likely to wear their Fitbit than the Fitbit-only group. Setting a goal was associated with a significant increase of 791 daily steps, but setting more goals did not lead to step increases. Conclusion In a population of patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes, individualized reminders to wear their Fitbit and elicit personal step goals did not lead to increases in daily steps, although daily steps were higher on days when goals were set. Our intervention improved engagement and data collection, important goals for activity surveillance. This study demonstrates that new, more-effective interventions for increasing activity in patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2799367753,"Castration of dogs is a widespread practise with clear justification in population control and knock-on benefits for animal welfare. Deleterious behavioural consequences of castration are believed to be negligible. Gonadectomy is widely recommended as part of a multi-factorial approach to prevent problems including aggression in dogs. However, the consequences of early castration on health are still being debated. The current study focused on the reported behaviour of 6,235 male dogs castrated before 520 weeks of life for reasons other than behavioural management, and calculated their percentage lifetime exposure to gonadal hormones (PLGH) as a proportion of their age at the time of being reported to the online Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Forty behaviors differed between entire and castrated dogs, of which 25 were associated with PLGH and 14 with age-at-castration (AAC). Only 2 behaviours, indoor urine marking and howling when left alone, were significantly more likely in dogs with longer PLGH. In contrast, longer PLGH was associated with significantly reduced reporting of 26 (mostly unwelcome) behaviours. Of these, 8 related to fearfulness and 7 to aggression. The current data suggest that dogs’ tendency to show numerous behaviours can be influenced by the timing of castration. They indicate how dog behaviour matures when gonadal hormones are allowed to have their effect. The differences reported here between undesirable behaviours of castrated and intact dogs were in the range of 5.04% and 12.31%, suggesting that, for some dogs, partial or complete denial of puberty may reduce indoor urine-marking but have many other undesirable consequences. Veterinarians may use these data to discuss unwelcome consequences with owners of male dogs before castration."
https://openalex.org/W2801314896,"While the functionality and healthy food value of red rice have increased its popularity, such that market demand for it is expected to rise, most strains suffer from low grain yield. To perform diversity and population structure analyses of red rice germplasm, therefore, becomes essential for improving yields for commercial production. In this study, fifty red rice germplasm from the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) genebank were characterized both morphologically and genetically using fifty simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Overall, 162 alleles were detected by the markers with the detected allele number varying from two to seven. Additionally, 22 unique alleles were identified for use as a germplasm diagnostic tool. The highest and lowest polymorphic information content (PIC) indices were 0.75 and 0.04 found in markers RM282 and RM304, respectively, and genetic diversity was moderate, varying from 0.05 to 0.78 (average: 0.35). While phylogenetic cluster analysis of the fifteen distance-based agro-morphological traits divided the germplasm into five clusters (I, II, III, IV and V), a similar SSR analysis yielded only three major groups (I, II, and III), and a model-based population structure analysis yielded four (A, B, C and D). Both principal component and neighbors joining tree analysis from the population structure method showed the tested germplasm as highly diverse in structure. Moreover, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), as well as a pairwise FST analysis, both indicated significant differentiation (ranging from 0.108 to 0.207) among all pairs of populations, suggesting that all four population structure groups differed significantly. Populations A and D were the most differentiated from each other by FST. Findings from this study suggest that the diverse germplasm and polymorphic trait-linked SSR markers of red rice are suitable for the detection of economically desirable trait loci/genes for use in future molecular breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2801714038,"We assessed dairy cows’ body postures while they were performing different stationary activities in a loose housing system and then used the variation within and between individuals to identify potential connections between specific postures and the valence and arousal dimensions of emotion. We observed 72 individuals within a single milking herd focusing on their ear, neck and tail positions while they were: feeding from individual roughage bins, being brushed by a mechanical rotating brush and queuing to enter a single automatic milking system. Cows showed different ear, neck and tail postures depending on the situation. When combined, their body posture during feeding was ears back up and neck down, with tail wags directed towards the body, during queuing their ears were mainly axial and forward, their neck below the horizontal and the tail hanging stationary, and during brushing their ears were backwards and asymmetric, the neck horizontal and the tail wagging vigorously. We then placed these findings about cow body posture during routine activities into an arousal/valence framework used in animal emotion research (dimensional model of core affect). In this way we generate a priori predictions of how the positions of the ears, neck and tail of cows may change in other situations, previously demonstrated to vary in valence and arousal. We propose that this new methodology, with its different steps of integration, could contribute to the identification and validation of behavioural (postural) indicators of how positively or negatively cows experience other activities, or situations, and how calm or aroused they are. Although developed here on dairy cattle, by focusing on relevant postures, this approach could be easily adapted to other species."
https://openalex.org/W2801437912,"Genetic information of pathogens is an essential input for infectious disease control, public health and for research. Efficiency in preventing and responding to global outbreaks relies on timely access to such information. Still, ownership barriers stand in the way of timely sharing of genetic data from pathogens, frustrating efficient public health responses and ultimately the potential use of such resources in innovations. Under a One Health approach, stakeholders, their interests and ownership issues are manifold and need to be investigated. We interviewed key actors from governmental and non-governmental bodies to identify overlapping and conflicting interests, and the overall challenges for sharing pathogen data, to provide essential inputs to the further development of political and practical strategies for improved data sharing practices.To identify and prioritize barriers, 52 Key Opinion Leaders were interviewed. A root-cause analysis was performed to identify causal relations between barriers. Finally, barriers were mapped to the innovation cycle reflecting how they affect the range of surveillance, innovation, and sharing activities. Four main barrier categories were found: compliance to regulations, negative consequences, self-interest, and insufficient incentives for compliance. When grouped in sectors (research institutes, public health organizations, supra-national organizations and industry) stakeholders appear to have similar interests, more than when grouped in domains (human, veterinary and food). Considering the innovation process, most of barriers could be mapped to the initial stages of the innovation cycle as sampling and sequencing phases. These are stages of primary importance to outbreak control and public health response. A minority of barriers applied to later stages in the innovation cycle, which are of more importance to product development.Overall, barriers are complex and entangled, due to the diversity of causal factors and their crosscutting features. Therefore, barriers must be addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Stakeholders have different interests highlighting the diversity in motivations for sharing pathogen data: prioritization of public health, basic research, economic welfare and/or innovative capacity. Broad inter-sectorial discussions should start with the alignment of these interests within sectors. The improved sharing of pathogen data, especially in upstream phases of the innovation process, will generate substantial public health benefits through increased availability of data to inform surveillance systems, as well as to allow the (re-)use of data for the development of medical countermeasures to control infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2800550248,Plants can detect the presence of their neighbours and modify their growth behaviour accordingly. But the extent to which this neighbour detection is mediated by abiotic stressors is not well known. In this study we tested the acclimation response of Zea mays L. seedlings through belowground interactions to the presence of their siblings exposed to brief mechano stimuli. Maize seedling simultaneously shared the growth solution of touched plants or they were transferred to the growth solution of previously touched plants. We tested the growth preferences of newly germinated seedlings toward the growth solution of touched (T_solution) or untouched plants (C_solution). The primary root of the newly germinated seedlings grew significantly less towards T_solution than to C_solution. Plants transferred to T_solution allocated more biomass to shoots and less to roots. While plants that simultaneously shared their growth solution with the touched plants produced more biomass. Results show that plant responses to neighbours can be modified by aboveground abiotic stress to those neighbours and suggest that these modifications are mediated by belowground interactions.
https://openalex.org/W2802889977,"Separate lines of research suggest that people who are better at estimating numerical quantities using the approximate number system (ANS) have better math performance, and that people with high levels of math anxiety have worse math performance. Only a handful of studies have examined both ANS acuity and math anxiety in the same participants and those studies report contradictory results. To address these inconsistencies, in the current study 87 undergraduate students completed assessments of ANS acuity, math anxiety, and three different measures of math. We considered moderation models to examine the interplay of ANS acuity and math anxiety on different aspects of math performance. Math anxiety and ANS acuity were both unique significant predictors of the ability to automatically recall basic number facts. ANS acuity was also a unique significant predictor of the ability to solve applied math problems, and this relation was further qualified by a significant interaction with math anxiety: the positive association between ANS acuity and applied problem solving was only present in students with high math anxiety. Our findings suggest that ANS acuity and math anxiety are differentially related to various aspects of math and should be considered together when examining their respective influences on math ability. Our findings also raise the possibility that good ANS acuity serves as a protective factor for highly math-anxious students on certain types of math assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2799755800,"Both ovarian E2 and hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are critical for energy homeostasis and white adipose tissue browning. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is abundantly expressed in liver. However, whether FGF21 has a role in E2-induced white adipose tissue browning remains uncertain. In this study, we showed that hepatic Fgf21 expression and secretion during estrus cycle changed with the tetradian oscillatory secretion of circulation E2 in adult, female mice, with their peak expressions and secretions at the proestrus. In addition, exogenous E2 robustly stimulated liver Fgf21 expression and elevated serum FGF21 concentrations, which induced browning gene expression and reduced the tissue weight in subcutaneous white adipose in mice with ovariectomies. The inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and of ERα blocked the induction effect of E2 on the expression of Fgf21 in primary hepatocytes, which revealed that E2 might stimulate FGF21 expression via the ERα-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, FGF21 liver-specific deficiency abolished E2-induced white adipose browning in mice with ovariectomies. This study indicates that ovarian E2 increased liver FGF21 expression directly, which in turn, functioned as an endocrine signal to influence inguinal white adipose tissue browning.—Hua, L., Zhuo, Y., Jiang, D., Li, J., Huang, X., Zhu, Y., Li, Z., Yan, L., Jin, C., Jiang, X., Che, L., Fang, Z., Lin, Y., Xu, S., Li, J., Feng, B., Wu, D.

https://openalex.org/W2802562230,"Intravenous (IV) resuscitation of burn patients has greatly improved outcomes and become a cornerstone of modern burn care. However, the heavy fluids and vascular access required may not be feasible in austere environments, mass casualty, or delayed transport scenarios. Enteral resuscitation has been proposed for these situations; we sought to examine the effectiveness of this strategy on improving burn-induced kidney injury. Anesthetized Yorkshire swine sustaining 40% TBSA full-thickness contact burns were randomized to three groups (n = 6/group): fluid deprivation, ad libitum water access, or 70 mL/kg/d Oral Rehydration Salt solution (ORS). Urine and blood were collected at baseline (BL), 6, 12, 24, 32, and 48h post-burn, at which point tissue was harvested and CT angiography performed. Although fluid consumption by ad libitum and ORS groups were matched (132±54mL/kg versus 120±24mL/kg, respectively), ORS intake increased urine output compared with water and no water (47.3±9.0 mL/kg versus 16.1±2.5 mL/kg, and 24.5±1.7 mL/kg respectively). Plasma creatinine peaked 6h following burn (1.67±0.07mg/dL) in all animals, but at 48h was comparable to BL in animals receiving water (1.23±0.06mg/dL) and ORS (1.30±0.09mg/dL), but not fluid deprived animals (1.56±0.05mg/dL) (P<0.05). Circulating levels of blood urea nitrogen steadily increased, but also decreased by 48h in animals receiving enteral fluids (P<0.05). Water deprivation reduced renal artery diameter (-1.4±0.17mm), whereas resuscitation with water (-0.44±0.14 mm) or ORS maintained it (-0.63±0.20 mm;P< 0.02). Circulating cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and GM-CSF were moderately elevated in the fluid-deprived group. Taken together, the data suggest that enteral resuscitation with ORS rescues kidney function following burn injury. Incorporating enteral fluids may improve outcomes in resource-poor environments and possibly reduce IV fluid requirements to prevent co-morbidities associated with over-resuscitation. Studies into different volumes/types of enteral fluids are warranted. While ORS has saved many lives in cholera-associated dehydration, it should be investigated further for use in burn patients."
https://openalex.org/W2802013665,"Obligate river dolphins occur only in the rivers of Asia and South America, where they are increasingly subject to damaging pressures such as habitat degradation, food competition and entanglement in fishing gear as human populations expand. The Amazon basin hosts two, very different, dolphins-the boto or Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and the smaller tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Both species have wide geographical ranges and were once considered to be relatively abundant. Their IUCN Red List conservation status of Data Deficient (DD), due to limited information on threats, ecology, population numbers and trends, did not initially cause alarm. However, the development of dolphin hunting to provide fish bait at around the beginning of this millennium broadly coincided with the onset of a widespread perception that numbers of both species were in decline. Consequently, the need for population trend data to inform conservation advice and measures became urgent. This paper presents a 22-year time series of standardised surveys for both dolphins within the Mamirauá Reserve, Amazonas State, Brazil. Analysis of these data show that both species are in steep decline, with their populations halving every 10 years (botos) and 9 years (tucuxis) at current rates. These results are consistent with published, independent information on survival rates of botos in this area, which demonstrated a substantial drop in annual survival, commencing at around the year 2000. Mamirauá is a protected area, and is subject to fewer environmental pressures than elsewhere in the region, so there is no reason to suspect that the decline in dolphins within the Reserve is more pronounced than outside it. If South America's freshwater cetaceans are to avoid following their Asian counterparts on the path to a perilous conservation status, effective conservation measures are required immediately. Enforcement of existing fishery laws would greatly assist in achieving this."
https://openalex.org/W2800464467,"Under-reporting of pertussis cases is a longstanding challenge. We estimated the true number of pertussis cases in Ontario using multiple data sources, and evaluated the completeness of each source.We linked data from multiple sources for the period 2009 to 2015: public health reportable disease surveillance data, public health laboratory data, and health administrative data (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and physician office visits). To estimate the total number of pertussis cases in Ontario, we used a three-source capture-recapture analysis stratified by age (infants, or aged one year and older) and adjusting for dependency between sources. We used the Bayesian Information Criterion to compare models.Using probable and confirmed reported cases, laboratory data, and combined hospitalizations/emergency department visits, the estimated total number of cases during the six-year period amongst infants was 924, compared with 545 unique observed cases from all sources. Using the same sources, the estimated total for those aged 1 year and older was 12,883, compared with 3,304 observed cases from all sources. Only 37% of infants and 11% for those aged 1 year and over admitted to hospital or seen in an emergency department for pertussis were reported to public health. Public health reporting sensitivity varied from 2% to 68% depending on age group and the combination of data sources included. Sensitivity of combined hospitalizations and emergency department visits varied from 37% to 49% and of laboratory data from 1% to 50%.All data sources contribute cases and are complementary, suggesting that the incidence of pertussis is substantially higher than suggested by routine reports. The sensitivity of different data sources varies. Better case identification is required to improve pertussis control in Ontario."
https://openalex.org/W2800113954,"In Chile, agriculture is a relevant economic activity and is concomitant with the use of pesticides to improve the yields. Acute intoxications of agricultural workers occur with some frequency and they must be reported to the surveillance system of the Ministry of Health. However the impacts of chronic and environmental pesticide exposure have been less studied. Among pesticides frequently used in Chile for insects control are organophosphates (OP) and carbamates (CB). They are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). In this study we determined the pattern of both biomarkers activity in three populations with different type of chronic exposure to OP/CB: environmentally exposed (EE), occupationally exposed (OE) and a reference group (RG) without exposure. Besides this, we also measured the activity of acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), an enzyme involved in relevant functions in the central synapses that is also expressed in erythrocytes and previously reported to be highly inhibited by some OP. A baseline measurement was done in both exposure groups and then a second measurement was done during the spraying season. The RG was measured only once at any time of the year. Our results indicate that people under chronic OP/CB exposure showed an adaptive response through an increase of basal BChE activity. During the spray season only BChE activity was decreased in the EE and OE groups (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively) and the higher magnitude of BChE inhibition was observed in the EE group. The analysis of the frequencies of inhibition above 30% (biological tolerance limit declared by Chilean legislation) indicated that BChE was most frequently inhibited in the EE group (53% of the individuals displayed inhibition) and AChE in the OE group (55% of the individuals displayed AChE inhibition). APEH activity showed the highest frequency of inhibition in the EE group independent of its magnitude (64%). Our results demonstrate that the rural population living nearby agricultural settings displays high levels of environmental exposure. APEH activity seems to be a sensitive biomarker for acute low-level exposure and its usefulness as a routine biomarker must to be explored in future studies. Systematic biomonitoring and health outcomes studies are necessary as well as obtaining the baseline for BChE and AChE activity levels with the aim to improve environmental and occupational health policies in Chile."
https://openalex.org/W2800519377,"Female genital cutting (FGC) has major implications for women’s physical, sexual and psychological health, and eliminating the practice is a key target for public health policy-makers. To date one of the main barriers to achieving this has been an inability to infer privately-held views on FGC within communities where it is prevalent. As a sensitive (and often illegal) topic, people are anticipated to hide their true support for the practice when questioned directly. Here we use an indirect questioning method (unmatched count technique) to identify hidden support for FGC in a rural South Central Ethiopian community where the practice is common, but thought to be in decline. Employing a socio-demographic household survey of 1620 Arsi Oromo adults, which incorporated both direct and indirect direct response (unmatched count) techniques we compare directly-stated versus privately-held views in support of FGC, and individual variation in responses by age, gender and education and target female (daughters versus daughters-in-law). Both genders express low support for FGC when questioned directly, while indirect methods reveal substantially higher acceptance (of cutting both daughters and daughters-in-law). Educated adults (those who have attended school) are privately more supportive of the practice than they are prepared to admit openly to an interviewer, indicating that education may heighten secrecy rather than decrease support for FGC. Older individuals hold the strongest views in favour of FGC (particularly educated older males), but they are also more inclined to conceal their support for FGC when questioned directly. As these elders represent the most influential members of society, their hidden support for FGC may constitute a pivotal barrier to eliminating the practice in this community. Our results demonstrate the great potential for indirect questioning methods to advance knowledge and inform policy on culturally-sensitive topics like FGC; providing more reliable data and improving understanding of the “true” drivers of FGC."
https://openalex.org/W2801551851,"The decomposition of diversity into within site (α) and between site (β) components is especially interesting in subterranean communities because of their isolated nature and limited dispersal potential The aquatic epikarst fauna, sampled from water drips in caves affords a unique opportunity to provide comparable, quantitative samples of a portion of the obligate subterranean dwelling fauna in multiple hierarchical levels. We focused on three interrelated questions—(1) what is the spatial pattern of epikarst species diversity; (2) how does species diversity partition between local, and regional components (nested and replacement); and (3) whether epikarst hotspots are subterranean hotspots in general. We analyzed the geographic pattern of species richness of 30 species of obligate subterranean copepods found in 81 drips in Slovenian caves in three karst regions—Alpine, Dinaric, and Isolated. Comparison of Chao1 and observed (Mao-tau) estimates of species richness indicated sampling in most drips was complete, but species accumulation curves indicated roughly half of the sites in the Dinaric karst had not reached an asymptote. Overall, within drip diversity accounted for three species, different drips in a cave another three, different caves in a region six species, and different regions accounted for the remaining 18 species. Sites in the Dinaric karst had much higher species richness than the other sites, which is in agreement with studies of other components of the subterranean fauna. The fauna associated with drips in Županova jama (jama = cave), in the east-central Dinaric karst was the richest found. While turnover explained the majority of β-diversity, nestedness in the form of hotspot drips was important as well. A consequence is that a small number of drips largely determine cave and regional species diversity."

Our previous studies showed that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) led to fetal overexposure to maternal glucocorticoids (GCs) and increased serum total cholesterol levels in adult rat offspring. This study further confirms the intrauterine programming of PCE-induced hypercholesterolemia in female adult rat offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/d) from gestational day (GD)9 to 20. Female rat offspring were euthanized at GD20 and postnatal wk 12; several adult rat offspring were additionally subjected to ice-water swimming stimulation to induce chronic stress prior to death. The effects of GCs on cholesterol metabolism and epigenetic regulation were verified using the L02 cell line. The results showed that PCE induced hypercholesterolemia in adult offspring, which manifested as significantly higher levels of serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as higher ratios of LDL-C/HDL cholesterol. We further found that the cholesterol levels were increased in fetal livers but were decreased in fetal blood, accompanied by increased maternal blood cholesterol levels and reduced placental cholesterol transport. Furthermore, analysis of PCE offspring in the uterus and in a postnatal basal/chronic stress state and the results of in vitro experiments showed that hepatic cholesterol metabolism underwent GC-dependent changes and was associated with cholesterol synthase via abnormalities in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) histone acetylation. We concluded that, to compensate for intrauterine placentally derived decreases in fetal blood cholesterol levels, high intrauterine GC levels activated fetal hepatic CCAAT enhancer binding protein α signaling and down-regulated Sirtuin1 expression, which mediated the high levels of histone acetylation (via H3K9ac and H3K14ac) and expression of HMGCR. This GC- dependent cholesterol metabolism programming effect was sustained through adulthood, leading to the occurrence of hypercholesterolemia.—Xu, D., Luo, H. W., Hu, W., Hu, S.

https://openalex.org/W2802915493,"The thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus licheniformis U1 is used for the optimization of bacterial growth (R1), laccase production (R2) and synthetic disperse blue DBR textile dye decolorization (R3) in the present study. Preliminary optimization has been performed by one variable at time (OVAT) approach using four media components viz., dye concentration, copper sulphate concentration, pH, and inoculum size. Based on OVAT result further statistical optimization of R1, R2 and R3 performed by Box-Behnken design (BBD) using response surface methodology (RSM) in R software with R Commander package. The total 29 experimental runs conducted in the experimental design study towards the construction of a quadratic model. The model indicated that dye concentration 110 ppm, copper sulphate 0.2 mM, pH 7.5 and inoculum size 6% v/v were found to be optimum to maximize the laccase production and bacterial growth. Whereas, maximum dye decolorization achieved in media containing dye concentration 110 ppm, copper sulphate 0.6 mM, pH 6 and inoculum size 6% v/v. R package predicted R2 of R1, R2 and R3 were 0.9917, 0.9831 and 0.9703 respectively; likened to Design-Expert (Stat-Ease) (DOE) predicted R2 of R1, R2, and R3 were 0.9893, 0.9822 and 0.8442 respectively. The values obtained by R software were more precise, reliable and reproducible, compared to the DOE model. The laccase production was 1.80 fold increased, and 2.24 fold enhancement in dye decolorization was achieved using optimized medium than initial experiments. Moreover, the laccase-treated sample demonstrated the less cytotoxic effect on L132 and MCF-7 cell lines compared to untreated sample using MTT assay. Higher cell viability and lower cytotoxicity observed in a laccase-treated sample suggest the impending application of bacterial laccase in the reduction of toxicity of dye to design rapid biodegradation process."
https://openalex.org/W2800752600,"Twenty-Seven Lower and Middle Paleolithic sites from Europe and the Middle East are reported in the literature to have yielded incised stones. At eleven of these sites incisions are present on flint cortexes. Even when it is possible to demonstrate that the engravings are ancient and human made, it is often difficult to distinguish incisions resulting from functional activities such as butchery or use as a cutting board, from those produced deliberately, and even more difficult to identify the scope of the latter. In this paper we present results of the analysis of an engraved cortical flint flake found at Kiik-Koba, a key Mousterian site from Crimea, and create an interpretative framework to guide the interpretation of incised cortexes. The frame of inference that we propose allows for a reasoned evaluation of the actions playing a role in the marking process and aims at narrowing down the interpretation of the evidence. The object comes from layer IV, the same layer in which a Neanderthal child burial was unearthed, which contains a para-Micoquian industry of Kiik-Koba type dated to between c.35 and 37 cal kyr BP. The microscopic analysis and 3D reconstruction of the grooves on the cortex of this small flint flake, demonstrate that the incisions represent a deliberate engraving made by a skilled craftsman, probably with two different points. The lines are nearly perfectly framed into the cortex, testifying of well controlled motions. This is especially the case considering the small size of the object, which makes this a difficult task. The production of the engraving required excellent neuromotor and volitional control, which implies focused attention. Evaluation of the Kiik-Koba evidence in the light of the proposed interpretative framework supports the view that the engraving was made with a representational intent."
https://openalex.org/W2802527275,"Recent studies suggest a paradoxical association between smoking status and clinical outcome after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Little is known about relationship between smoking and stroke outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT).We analyzed data of all stroke patients treated with EVT at the tertiary stroke centre of Berne between January 2005 and December 2015. Using uni- and multivariate modeling, we assessed whether smoking was independently associated with excellent clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-1) and mortality at 3 months. In addition, we also measured the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and recanalization.Of 935 patients, 204 (21.8%) were smokers. They were younger (60.5 vs. 70.1 years of age, p<0.001), more often male (60.8% vs. 52.5%, p = 0.036), had less often from hypertension (56.4% vs. 69.6%, p<0.001) and were less often treated with antithrombotics (35.3% vs. 47.7%, p = 0.004) as compared to nonsmokers. In univariate analyses, smokers had higher rates of excellent clinical outcome (39.1% vs. 23.1%, p<0.001) and arterial recanalization (85.6% vs. 79.4%, p = 0.048), whereas mortality was lower (15.6% vs. 25%, p = 0.006) and frequency of sICH similar (4.4% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.86). After correcting for confounders, smoking still independently predicted excellent clinical outcome (OR 1.758, 95% CI 1.206-2.562; p<0.001).Smoking in stroke patients may be a predictor of excellent clinical outcome after EVT. However, these data must not be misinterpreted as beneficial effect of smoking due to the observational study design. In view of deleterious effects of cigarette smoking on cardiovascular health, cessation of smoking should still be strongly recommended for stroke prevention."

In order to understand the mitogenome characteristics and phylogenetic position of the genus Dosinia, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of Dosinia altior and Dosinia troscheli (Bivalvia: Veneridae), compared them with that of Dosinia japonica and established a phylogenetic tree for Veneridae. The mitogenomes of D. altior (17,536 bp) and D. troscheli (17,229 bp) are the two smallest in Veneridae, which include 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and non-coding regions. The mitogenomes of the Dosinia species are similar in size, gene content, AT content, AT- and GC- skews, and gene arrangement. The phylogenetic relationships of family Veneridae were established based on 12 concatenated protein-coding genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, which supported that Dosininae and Meretricinae have a closer relationship, with Tapetinae being the sister taxon. The information obtained in this study will contribute to further understanding of the molecular features of bivalve mitogenomes and the evolutionary history of the genus Dosinia."
https://openalex.org/W2800961806,"Background The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood has implications for their future health. There are many potential contributors to overweight and obesity in childhood. The aim was to investigate the association between postulated risk factors and body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents. Methods Secondary analysis of data from a multi-centre, multi-country, cross-sectional study (ISAAC Phase Three). Parents/guardians of children aged 6–7 years completed a questionnaire about their child’s current height and weight, and the postulated risk factors. Adolescents aged 13–14 years reported their own height and weight and answered questions about the postulated risk factors. A general linear mixed model was used to determine the association between BMI and the postulated risk factors. Imputation was used if there were missing responses for 3 or fewer explanatory variables. Results 65,721 children (27 centres, 15 countries) and 189,282 adolescents (70 centres, 35 countries) were included in the final analyses. Many statistically significant associations were identified, although for most variables the effect sizes were small. In children birth weight (for each kg increase in birth weight the BMI increased by +0.43 kg/m2, p<0.001), television viewing (5+ hours/day +0.33 kg/m2 vs. <1 hour/day, p<0.001), fast food (≥3 times/week +0.16 kg/m2 vs. never, p<0.001) vigorous physical activity (3+ hours/week 0.071 kg/m2 vs. never, p = 0.023) and maternal smoking in the first year of life (+0.13 kg/m2, p<0.001) were associated with a higher BMI in the adjusted model. Nut consumption (≥3 times/week -0.11 kg/m2 vs. never, p = 0.002) was associated with a lower BMI. Early life exposures (antibiotics, paracetamol and breast feeding) were also associated with BMI. For adolescents statistically significant associations with BMI and were seen with maternal smoking (+0.25 kg/m2, p<0.001), television viewing (5+ hours/day +0.23 kg/m2 vs. <1 hour/day, p<0.001), fast food (≥3 times/week -0.19 kg/m2 vs. never, p<0.001), vigorous physical activity (3+ hours/week 0.047 kg/m2 vs. never, p<0.001) and nuts (≥3 times/week -0.22 kg/m2 vs. never, p<0.001). Conclusions Although several early life exposures were associated with small differences in BMI, most effect sizes were small. Larger effect sizes were seen with current maternal smoking, television viewing (both with higher BMI) and frequent nut consumption (lower BMI) in both children and adolescents, suggesting that current behaviours are more important than early exposures. Although many variables may influence BMI in childhood, the putative factors studied are not of sufficient magnitude to support major public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2799501475,"Background Several studies have found that the loss of a child is associated with psychiatric health problems, yet few studies examined whether child loss influences psychotropic medication use. This study examined short- and long-term use of psychotropic medication, both before and after the death of a child, and its potential effect modifiers. Methodology/Principal findings A random sample of 205,456 parents, including 902 bereaved parents, were selected from a Finnish total population registry. The analyses were based on linear regressions using generalised estimation equations (GEE) and adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Annual psychotropic use was defined as having purchased prescribed psychotropic medication between 1996 and2012. Bereaved parents were followed for four years prior to and up to four years after the death of their child. An increase in the use of antidepressants and anxiolytics was found in parents following their loss. The highest percentage of use was found around one year after bereavement, followed by a steady decrease although this remained higher than the level of use among non-bereaved four years after the death. Between 20–25% of bereaved mothers and 10–15% of bereaved fathers used antidepressants or anxiolytics one year after bereavement while the corresponding number in non-bereaved was 5–10%. An increase in psychotropic medication was also found several years before the disease-related loss of a child. Conclusions/Significance The use of psychotropic medication is markedly higher among parents after losing a child. Patterns of use leading up to and following the death of a child should be further examined in relation to clinical risk factors so as to identify at risk populations.

https://openalex.org/W2802956043,"The process of corpse cremation generates numerous harmful air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals. These pollutants could have severe effects on the surrounding environment and human health. Currently, the awareness of the emission levels of harmful air pollutants from cremators and their emission characteristics is insufficient. In this study, we obtained the emission characteristics of flue gas from cremators in Beijing and determined the localized emission factors and emission levels of harmful air pollutants based on actual monitoring data from nine typical cremators. The results show that the emissions of air pollutants from the cremators that directly discharge flue gas exceed the emission standards of China and Beijing. The installation of a flue gas post-treatment system could effectively reduce gaseous pollutants and the emission levels of PM. After being equipped with a flue gas post-treatment system, the emission concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2 and VOCs from the cremators are reduced by 97.6, 99.2, 19.6, 85.2 and 70.7%, respectively. Moreover, the emission factors of TSP, PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2 and VOCs are also reduced to 12.5, 9.3, 3.0, 164.1, 8.8 and 19.8 g/body. Although the emission concentration of VOCs from the cremators is not high, they are one of major sources of ""odor"" in the crematories and demand more attention. Benzene, a chemical that can seriously harm human health, constitutes the largest proportion (~50%) of the chemical components of VOCs in the flue gas from the cremators."
https://openalex.org/W2802813672,"Schistosomiasis, which is caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma and by the species Schistosoma mansoni in Brazil, is transmitted primarily by Biomphalaria glabrata mollusks. Infections occur in humans and mollusks in freshwater environments contaminated with feces from infected humans. This study aimed to evaluate potential foci of schistosomiasis based on the identification of infection sites for the snails, factors that increased the human infection probability of S. mansoni infection, and the relationship of the disease with abiotic, biotic, and sociocultural factors. The study was conducted in an urban area on the northeast coast of Brazil; this location was chosen based on the following factors: the presence of B. glabrata, nearby freshwater, and the absence of sewer treatment. A parasitological analysis was performed to evaluate infections of the mollusks and residents inside the perimeter defined by the collection points. Questionnaires were applied to obtain demographic data and to identify behaviors that led to human infection. To verify the contamination of freshwater by human feces, a microbiological analysis of the water was performed at the mollusk collection points to determine the rate of contamination with fecal coliforms. A total of 10,270 B. glabrata mollusks were collected between August 2013 and August 2014, of which 8.8% were positive for S. mansoni; the prevalence ranged from 0 to 34.5% over the study period. A total of 232 coprological samples from the residents were analyzed. The S. mansoni infection prevalence rate was 16.4%, and the S. mansoni parasitic load in the infected residents was 54.9 eggs per gram of feces on average. Males were more affected by the parasite, especially in the 8-17-year-old age range. Thermotolerant coliforms were observed at the mollusk collection sites, which indicated that freshwater and sewage were in continuous contact. This contamination indicated poor sanitary conditions, as was previously observed, which could be combined with detrimental behavior due to the residents' habits. These conditions cause a predisposition for both intermediate and definitive infections of the hosts by creating a socioenvironmental scenario that is conducive to the formation and maintenance of potential schistosomiasis foci. This and similar areas deserve special attention from the government with an aim of improving sanitation services and local resident knowledge to prevent future contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2799380039,"Laser-induced cell transfer has been developed in recent years for the flexible and gentle printing of cells. Because of the high transfer rates and the superior cell survival rates, this technique has great potential for tissue engineering applications. However, the fact that material from an inorganic sacrificial layer, which is required for laser energy absorption, is usually transferred to the printed target structure, constitutes a major drawback of laser based cell printing. Therefore alternative approaches using deep UV laser sources and protein based acceptor films for energy absorption, have been introduced. Nevertheless, deep UV radiation can introduce DNA double strand breaks, thereby imposing the risk of carcinogenesis. Here we present a method for the laser-induced transfer of hydrogels and mammalian cells, which neither requires any sacrificial material for energy absorption, nor the use of UV lasers. Instead, we focus a near infrared femtosecond (fs) laser pulse (λ = 1030 nm, 450 fs) directly underneath a thin cell layer, suspended on top of a hydrogel reservoir, to induce a rapidly expanding cavitation bubble in the gel, which generates a jet of material, transferring cells and hydrogel from the gel/cell reservoir to an acceptor stage. By controlling laser pulse energy, well-defined cell-laden droplets can be transferred with high spatial resolution. The transferred human (SCP1) and murine (B16F1) cells show high survival rates, and good cell viability. Time laps microscopy reveals unaffected cell behavior including normal cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2799779902,"The occurrence of livestock-associated (LA) MRSA (ST398) in pig herds has emerged as a threat to occupational safety in many parts of the world. Recently, an outbreak of skin lesions due to MRSA occurred in workers at a pig farm in regional Australia and both the humans and pigs were shown to have a high prevalence of carriage of either the human-strain ST93 or porcine strain ST398. This study closely scrutinises this outbreak to determine factors associated with MRSA carriage amongst the workers.Information on potential risk factors was collected from employees by means of a questionnaire. The carriage status of MRSA by workers was assessed by nasal swabs processed using standard laboratory techniques with confirmed isolates subjected to sequence typing. Associations between MRSA carriage in workers and their questionnaire responses were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.Nasal carriage of MRSA was identified in 60% (31/52) of participants. Workers having contact with pigs had 24 times the odds of MRSA carriage compared to workers with no direct contact (OR 23.6; CI 5.2-172.8). In addition, the probability of MRSA carriage in workers was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the number of hours in contact with pigs and each hour of contact-time per day increased the risk of MRSA carriage by 1.44 times (CI 1.14-1.96). These associations were significant (P < 0.001) for both strains, ST398 and ST93, present on this farm. Using a multivariable logistic regression model that incorporated human exposure to five different pig age groups (dry sows, farrowing, weaner, grower, and finisher) as fixed effects, a significant (P = 0.027) increased odds of MRSA carriage was found for persons working with farrowing sows compared with those who did not (OR 6.39, CI 1.23-39.36).This study shows that workers in close contact with pigs on a pig farm where MRSA is present had a higher risk of MRSA carriage as the number of hours of direct contact with pigs increased. Since we have detected a significant association for the human-derived CA-MRSA ST93, similar to the pig-adapted LA-MRSA ST398, we consider ST93 as a potential occupational risk for piggery workers. The risk of MRSA carriage is greatest when working with the farrowing group; therefore, an emphasis is required on personal protective equipment while working in the farrowing house. The study has ramifications for the conduct of surveillance for MRSA in people exposed to pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2800559519,"The Philippine island of Palawan is highly biodiverse. During fieldwork there in 2011 & 2014 we found five unknown species in the large genus Begonia. The species are similar in their rhizomatous stems, four-tepaled flowers, inferior two- or three-locular ovaries with bilamellate placentas, and are assignable to Begonia sect. Baryandra. Our observations support the recognition of these as five new species endemic to Palawan: B. elnidoensis, B. gironellae, B. quinquealata, B. tabonensis and B. tenuibracteata which are described here. The five new species were added to phylogenies based Bayesian analysis of nrDNA (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (ndhA, ndhF-rpl32, rpl32-trnL, trnC-trnD), along with 45 other allied ingroup species. A majority of the species show incongruent positions in the two phylogenies, with evidence of prevalent chloroplast capture. Models show chloroplast capture is more likely in plant populations with high levels of inbreeding following a reduction in selfing rate after hybridisation; we suggest that this is a possible explanation for the massive amount of chloroplast exchange seen in our phylogeny, as Begonia species often exist as small isolated populations and may be prone to inbreeding depression. Our data also indicate a level of nuclear genetic exchange between species. The high prevalence of hybrid events in Begonia is potentially an important factor in driving genomic change and species evolution in this mega-diverse genus."
https://openalex.org/W2801429878,"Human activities cause changes to occur in the environment that affect resource availability for wildlife. The increase in the human population of cities has led to a rise in the amount of waste deposited in landfills, installations that have become a new food resource for both pest and threatened species such as vultures. In this study we used stable isotope analysis (SIA) and conventional identification of food remains from Egyptian Vultures (Neophron percnopterus) to assess the applicability of SIA as a new tool for determining the composition of the diets of vultures, a group of avian scavengers that is threatened worldwide. We focused on an expanding Egyptian Vulture population in NE Iberian Peninsula to determine the part played by landfills and livestock in the diet of these species, and aimed to reduce the biases associated with conventional ways of identifying food remains. We compared proportions of diet composition obtained with isotope mixing models and conventional analysis for five main prey. The greatest agreement between the two methods was in the categories ‘landfills’ and ‘birds’ and the greatest differences between the results from the two methods were in the categories ‘livestock’, ‘carnivores’ and ‘wild herbivores’. Despite uncertainty associated to SIA, our results showed that stable isotope analysis can help to distinguish between animals that rely on waste and so present enriched levels of δ 13C than those that feed on the countryside. Indeed, a high proportion of food derived from landfills (nearly 50%) was detected in some breeding pairs. Furthermore we performed GLMM analyses that showed that high values of δ 13C in Egyptian Vulture feathers (a proxy of feeding in landfills) are related with high levels of humanization of territories. This method has the potential to be applied to other threatened vulture species for which there is a lack of information regarding resources they are consuming, being especially important as the main causes of vultures decline worldwide are related to the consumption and availability of food resources."

With regard to the increasing burden of disease due to mental disorders worldwide, the association between the macrosystem and mental distress should be further explored, too. In this context, the subjective evaluation of the macrosystem might play an important role. In the present exploratory study, we assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress as well as perceived wealth, justice and freedom in population-based surveys in Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (n ≈ 1000 per country). The Swedish sample presented the lowest symptom ratings of depression, anxiety and stress and the highest self-rated health. The results also indicated that the subjective evaluation of the macrosystem matters in respect to mental distress. The complete model, including the control variables country, gender, age and education, and perceived wealth, justice and freedom predicted depression, anxiety and stress symptoms explained 8% of the variance of each symptom cluster. The present results encourage research to consider the macrosystem, and the subjective evaluation of macro-level factors, as a relevant component in biopsychosocial models of mental distress."

https://openalex.org/W2802648551,"Objective We estimated the average annual cost per patient of ART per facility (unit cost) in Nigeria, described the variation in costs across facilities, and identified factors associated with this variation. Methods We used facility-level data of 80 facilities in Nigeria, collected between December 2014 and May 2015. We estimated unit costs at each facility as the ratio of total costs (the sum of costs of staff, recurrent inputs and services, capital, training, laboratory tests, and antiretroviral and TB treatment drugs) divided by the annual number of patients. We applied linear regressions to estimate factors associated with ART cost per patient. Results The unit ART cost in Nigeria was $157 USD nationally and the facility-level mean was $231 USD. The study found a wide variability in unit costs across facilities. Variations in costs were explained by number of patients, level of care, task shifting (shifting tasks from doctors to less specialized staff, mainly nurses, to provide ART) and provider´s competence. The study illuminated the potentially important role that management practices can play in improving the efficiency of ART services. Conclusions Our study identifies characteristics of services associated with the most efficient implementation of ART services in Nigeria. These results will help design efficient program scale-up to deliver comprehensive HIV services in Nigeria by distinguishing features linked to lower unit costs."
https://openalex.org/W2950470654,"Although critical for studies of gut motility and intestinal regeneration, the in vitro culture of intestinal muscularis with peristaltic function remains a significant challenge. Periodic contractions of intestinal muscularis result from the coordinated activity of smooth muscle cells (SMC), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Reproducing this activity requires the preservation of all these cells in one system. Here we report the first serum-free culture methodology that consistently maintains spontaneous and periodic contractions of murine and human intestinal muscularis cells for months. In this system, SMC expressed the mature marker myosin heavy chain, and multipolar/dipolar ICC, uniaxonal/multipolar neurons and glial cells were present. Furthermore, drugs affecting neural signals, ICC or SMC altered the contractions. Combining this method with scaffolds, contracting cell sheets were formed with organized architecture. With the addition of intestinal epithelial cells, this platform enabled up to 11 types of cells from mucosa, muscularis and serosa to coexist and epithelial cells were stretched by the contracting muscularis cells. The method constitutes a powerful tool for mechanistic studies of gut motility disorders and the functional regeneration of the engineered intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2802779553,"Type-II l-arginine:ureahydrolase, arginase-II (Arg-II), is abundantly expressed in the kidney. The physiologic role played by Arg-II in the kidney remains unknown. Herein, we report that in mice that are deficient in Arg-II (Arg-II-/-), total and membrane-associated aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein levels were significantly higher compared with wild-type (WT) controls. Water deprivation enhanced Arg-II expression, AQP2 levels, and membrane association in collecting ducts. Effects of water deprivation on AQP2 were stronger in Arg-II-/- mice than in WT mice. Accordingly, a decrease in urine volume and an increase in urine osmolality under water deprivation were more pronounced in Arg-II-/- mice than in WT mice, which correlated with a weaker increase in plasma osmolality in Arg-II-/- mice. There was no difference in vasopressin release under water deprivation conditions between either genotype of mice. Although total AQP2 and phosphorylated AQP2-S256 levels (mediated by PKA) in kidneys under water deprivation conditions were significantly higher in Arg-II-/- mice compared with WT animals, there is no difference in the ratio of AQP2-S256:AQP2. In cultured mouse collecting duct principal mCCDcl1 cells, expression of both Arg-II and AQP2 were enhanced by the vasopressin type 2 receptor agonist, desamino- d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP). Silencing Arg-II enhanced the expression and membrane association of AQP2 by dDAVP without influencing cAMP levels. In conclusion, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that Arg-II negatively regulates AQP2 and the urine-concentrating capability in kidneys via a mechanism that is not associated with the modulation of the cAMP pathway.-Huang, J., Montani, J.-P., Verrey, F., Feraille, E., Ming, X.-F., Yang, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2799353335,"A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is known to regulate inflammatory signaling and cell death. However, A20 mutations are also frequently found in multiple malignancies suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor as well. We recently described a novel role for A20 in regulating the wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway and suppressing colonic tumor development in mice. The underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon are unclear. To study this, we first generated A20 knockout cell lines by genome-editing techniques. Using these cells, we show that loss of A20 causes dysregulation of wnt-dependent gene expression by RNAseq. Mechanistically, A20 interacts with a proximal signaling component of the wnt-signaling pathway, receptor interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4), and regulation of wnt-signaling by A20 occurs through RIPK4. Finally, similar to the mechanism by which A20 regulates other members of the receptor interacting protein kinase family, A20 modifies ubiquitin chains on RIPK4 suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for A20’s control over the wnt-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2802025350,"There is extensive knowledge on the relationship of posterior scleral biomechanics and intraocular pressure (IOP) load on glaucomatous optic neuropathy; however, the role for biomechanical influence of the perilimbal scleral tissue on the aqueous humor drainage pathway, including the distal venous outflow system, and IOP regulation is not fully understood. The purpose of this work is to study the outflow characteristics of perfused porcine eyes relative to the biomechanical properties of the perilimbal sclera, the posterior sclera and the cornea. Enucleated porcine eyes from eleven different animals were perfused with surrogate aqueous at two fixed flow rates while monitoring their IOP. After perfusion, mechanical stress-strain and relaxation tests were conducted on specimens of perilimbal sclera, posterior sclera, and cornea from the same perfused eyes. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated a strong correlation between increased tangent modulus of the perilimbal sclera tissues and increased perfusion IOP (R2 = 0.74, p = 0.0006 at lower flow rate and R2 = 0.71, p = 0.0011 at higher flow rate). In contrast, there were no significant correlations between IOP and the tangent modulus of the other tissues (Posterior sclera: R2 = 0.17 at lower flow rate and R2 = 0.30 at higher flow rate; cornea: R2 = 0.02 at lower flow rate and R2<0.01 at higher flow rate) nor the viscoelastic properties of any tissue (R2 ≤ 0.08 in all cases). Additionally, the correlation occurred for IOP and not net outflow facility (R2 ≤ 0.12 in all cases). These results provide new evidence that IOP in perfused porcine eyes is strongly influenced by the tangent modulus, sometimes called the tissue stiffness, of the most anterior portion of the sclera, i.e. the limbus."
https://openalex.org/W2802463561,"In year 2016, the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) updated Recommendations for the assessment and grading of diastolic dysfunction (DD). We aimed to assess the applicability of this DD grading method and its association with prognosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We retrospectively identified 237 consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent trans-femoral TAVI. Baseline transthoracic echocardiography was evaluated to assess pre- and post-TAVI diastolic function according to the current ASE/EACVI Recommendations. Prior to TAVI, 41 (17%) patients were diagnosed as having grade I DD, 111 (47%) patients had grade II DD, 80 (34%) had grade III DD. DD grade after TAVI decreased (p < 0.001) with 75 patients (32%) reclassified to a lower DD grade. During the median follow-up of 1,320 days, 136 (57%) patients died. In univariable Cox proportional hazards model analysis, neither pre- nor post-TAVI DD grade were associated with prognosis. However, patients with grade III DD detected before TAVI and AR≥ 2 after TAVI had poorer survival (p<0.008). Patients with grade III DD detected after TAVI and AR≥ 2 after TAVI had poorer prognosis (p = 0.002). TAVI improves DD grade. While poor DD grade was not associated with mortality after treatment of AS by TAVI, concomitant presence of DD and post-procedural AR carried a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2800781594,"Objectives Little is known about patterns and correlates of Complementary Health Approaches (CHAs) in chronic pain populations, particularly in rural, underserved communities. This article details the development and implementation of a new survey instrument designed to address this gap, the Complementary Health Approaches for Pain Survey (CHAPS). Design Following pilot-testing using pre-specified criteria to assess quality and comprehension in our target population, and after feedback regarding face-validity from content experts and stakeholders, the final cross-sectional self-report survey required 10–12 minutes to complete. It contained 69 demographic, lifestyle and health-related factors, and utilized a Transtheoretical Model (TTM) underpinning to assess short- and long-term use of 12 CHAs for pain management. Twenty additional items on pain severity, feelings, clinical outcomes, and activities were assessed using the Short-Form Global Pain Scale (SF-GPS); Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Settings/location Investigators conducted consecutive sampling in four West Virginia pain management and rheumatology practices. Participants 301 Appalachian adult patients seeking conventional care for pain management. Results Response rates were high (88% ± 4.1%). High quality and comprehension deemed the CHAPS an appropriate measurement tool in a rural population with pain. Missing data were unrelated to patient characteristics. Participants predominantly experienced chronic pain (93%), had five or more health conditions (56%, Mean = 5.4±3.1), were white (92%), female (57%), and middle-aged (Mean = 55.6 (SD = 13.6) years). Over 40% were disabled (43%) and/or obese (44%, Mean BMI = 33.4±31.5). Additionally, 44% used opioids, 31% used other prescription medications, and 66% used at least one CHA for pain, with 48% using CHAs for greater than 6 months. There was high internal reliability of the SF-GPS (alpha = .93) and satisfactory internal reliability for each of the five TTM stages across (all) twelve CHAs: precontemplation (0.89), contemplation (0.72), preparation (0.75), action (0.70), and maintenance (0.70). Conclusions The CHAPS is the first comprehensive measurement tool to assess CHA use specifically for pain management. Ease of administration in a population with pain support further use in population- and clinic-based studies in similar populations."
https://openalex.org/W2800161574,"The high frequency of prophage insertions in the mlrA gene of clinical serotype O157:H7 isolates renders such strains deficient in csgD-dependent biofilm formation but prophage induction may restore certain mlrA properties. In this study we used transcriptomics to study the effect of high and low sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TM) concentrations on prophage induction, biofilm regulation, and virulence gene expression in strain PA20 under environmental conditions following 5-hour and 12-hour exposures in broth or on agar. SMX-TM at a sub-lethal concentration induced strong RecA expression resulting in concentration- and time-dependent major transcriptional shifts with emphasis on up-regulation of genes within horizontally-transferred chromosomal regions (HTR). Neither high or low levels of SMX-TM stimulated csgD expression at either time point, but both levels resulted in slight repression. Full expression of Ler-dependent genes paralleled expression of group 1 pch homologues in the presence of high glrA. Finally, stx2 expression, which is strongly dependent on prophage induction, was enhanced at 12 hours but repressed at five hours, in spite of early SOS initiation by the high SMX-TM concentration. Our findings indicate that, similar to host conditions, exposure to environmental conditions increased the expression of virulence genes in a clinical isolate but genes involved in the protective biofilm response were repressed."
https://openalex.org/W2801834207,"Naupactus cervinus (Boheman) (Curculionidae, Naupactini) is a parthenogenetic weevil native to the Paranaense Forest which displays high levels of genetic variation. Two divergent clades were identified, one ranging in forest areas (Forest clade), and the other in open vegetation areas (Grassland clade). Both of them have individuals with high levels of heterozygosity in ribosomal sequences. Investigation of intraindividual variation in ITS1 sequences through cloning and posterior sequencing suggested that mating between both groups most likely occurred in the Paranaense Forest after a secondary contact, which led to fixed heterozygotes as a consequence of parthenogenesis. Otherwise, sexual segregation would have disrupted multilocus genotypes. Only a small number of heterozygous genotypes of all the possible combinations are found in nature. We propose the occurrence of a hybrid zone in the Paranaense Forest. The fact that it is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots of the world, together with its key role for investigating evolutionary processes, makes it worthy of conservation. This is the first genetic evidence of bisexuality in N. cervinus."
https://openalex.org/W2799621447,"Methods An open randomized clinical trial was developed at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP) in Recife and at Petronila Campos Municipal Hospital in São Lourenço da Mata, both in Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, including 226 low-risk pregnant women bearing a single, full-term, live fetus after delayed cord clamping, 113 randomized to placental cord drainage and 113 to a control group not submitted to this procedure. Women incapable of understanding the study objectives and those who went on to have an instrumental or cesarean delivery were excluded. Results Duration of the third stage of labor did not differ between the two groups (14.2±12.9 versus 13.7±12.1 minutes (mean ± SD), p = 0.66). Likewise, there was no significant difference in mean blood loss (248±254 versus 208±187ml, p = 0.39) or in postpartum hematocrit levels (32.3±4.06 versus 32.8±4.25mg/dl, p = 0.21). Furthermore, no differences were found between the groups for any of the secondary outcomes (postpartum hemorrhage >500 or >1000ml, therapeutic use of oxytocin, third stage >30 or 60 minutes, digital evacuation of the uterus or curettage, symptoms of postpartum anemia and maternal satisfaction). Conclusion Placental cord drainage had no effect in reducing duration or blood loss during the third stage of labor.

https://openalex.org/W2799976179,"It has been suggested that Canadian-born Major League Baseball (MLB) players are more likely to bat left-handed, possibly owing to the fact that they learn to play ice hockey before baseball, and that there is no clear hand-preference when shooting with a hockey stick; approximately half of all ice hockey players shoot left. We constructed a database on active (i.e., October, 2016) MLB players from four countries/regions based on place of birth (Canada, United States of America [USA], Dominican Republic and South Asia [i.e., Japan, Taiwan and South Korea]), including information on which hand they use to bat and throw. We also extracted information on all Canadian-born MLB players, dating back to 1917. Our results confirm that the proportion of left-handed batters born in Canada is higher when compared to the other countries selected; also, since 1917, the proportion of Canadian MLB players who bat left has been consistently higher than the league average. We also compared the proportion of left-handed batters in Canada with players born in states in the USA grouped into high, average and low based on hockey participation. The proportion of MLB players born in states with a high level of hockey participation were more likely to bat left, although the differences were significant at trend level only (p < .10). Lastly, we found that while Canadians were more likely to bat left-handed, this did not correspond with a greater left-hand dominance, as determined by throwing hand. In conclusion, the present study confirms that Canadian-born MLB players are more likely to bat left-handed when compared to American, Dominican Republic and South Asian-born MLB players, providing partial support for the hockey influence on batting hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2949183692,"Understanding how groups of neurons interact within a network is a fundamental question in system neuroscience. Instead of passively observing the ongoing activity of a network, we can typically perturb its activity, either by external sensory stimulation or directly via techniques such as two-photon optogenetics. A natural question is how to use such perturbations to identify the connectivity of the network efficiently. Here we introduce a method to infer sparse connectivity graphs from in-vivo, two-photon imaging of population activity in response to external stimuli. A novel aspect of the work is the introduction of a recommended distribution, incrementally learned from the data, to optimally refine the inferred network. Unlike existing system identification techniques, this “active learning” method automatically focuses its attention on key undiscovered areas of the network, instead of targeting global uncertainty indicators like parameter variance. We show how active learning leads to faster inference while, at the same time, provides confidence intervals for the network parameters. We present simulations on artificial small-world networks to validate the methods and apply the method to real data. Analysis of frequency of motifs recovered show that cortical networks are consistent with a small-world topology model."
https://openalex.org/W2799996481,"This study investigated the effect of handedness on pianists' abilities to adjust their keyboard performance skills to new spatial and motor mappings. Left- and right-handed pianists practiced simple melodies on a regular MIDI piano keyboard (practice) and were then asked to perform these with modified melodic contours (the same or reversed melodic contour causing a change of fingering) and on a reversed MIDI piano keyboard (test). The difference of performance duration between the practice and the test phase as well as the amount of errors played were used as test measures. Overall, a stronger effect for modified melodic contours than for the reversed keyboard was observed. Furthermore, we observed a trend of left-handed pianists to be quicker and more accurate in playing melodies when reversing their fingering with reversed contours in their left-hand performances. This suggests that handedness may influence pianists' skill to adjust to new spatial and motor mappings."
https://openalex.org/W2800993952,"Finding optimal markers for microorganisms important in the medical, agricultural, environmental or ecological fields is of great importance. Thousands of complete microbial genomes now available allow us, for the first time, to exhaustively identify marker proteins for groups of microbial organisms. In this work, we model the biological task as the well-known mathematical “hitting set” problem, solving it based on both greedy and randomized approximation algorithms. We identify unique markers for 17 phenotypic and taxonomic microbial groups, including proteins related to the nitrite reductase enzyme as markers for the non-anammox nitrifying bacteria group, and two transcription regulation proteins, nusG and yhiF, as markers for the Archaea and Escherichia/Shigella taxonomic groups, respectively. Additionally, we identify marker proteins for three subtypes of pathogenic E. coli, which previously had no known optimal markers. Practically, depending on the completeness of the database this algorithm can be used for identification of marker genes for any microbial group, these marker genes may be prime candidates for the understanding of the genetic basis of the group's phenotype or to help discover novel functions which are uniquely shared among a group of microbes. We show that our method is both theoretically and practically efficient, while establishing an upper bound on its time complexity and approximation ratio; thus, it promises to remain efficient and permit the identification of marker proteins that are specific to phenotypic or taxonomic groups, even as more and more bacterial genomes are being sequenced."
