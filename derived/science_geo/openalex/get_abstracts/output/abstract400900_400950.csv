https://openalex.org/W2054866841,"Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a mammalian homolog of the yeast Sir2 deacetylase. Mice deficient for SIRT6 exhibit genome instability. Here, we show that in mammalian cells subjected to oxidative stress SIRT6 is recruited to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and stimulates DSB repair, through both nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination. Our results indicate that SIRT6 physically associates with poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and mono-ADP-ribosylates PARP1 on lysine residue 521, thereby stimulating PARP1 poly-ADP-ribosylase activity and enhancing DSB repair under oxidative stress."

They are based on the spectral shift of the scattering spectrum when two plasmonic nanoparticles approach one another. However, the one-dimensionality of current plasmon rulers hampers the comprehensive understanding of many intriguing processes in soft matter, which take place in three dimensions. We demonstrated a three-dimensional plasmon ruler that is based on coupled plasmonic oligomers in combination with high-resolution plasmon spectroscopy. This enables retrieval of the complete spatial configuration of complex macromolecular and biological processes as well as their dynamic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2080107084,"The adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates whole-body and cellular energy balance in response to energy demand and supply. AMPK is an αβγ heterotrimer activated by decreasing concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increasing AMP concentrations. AMPK activation depends on phosphorylation of the α catalytic subunit on threonine-172 (Thr(172)) by kinases LKB1 or CaMKKβ, and this is promoted by AMP binding to the γ subunit. AMP sustains activity by inhibiting dephosphorylation of α-Thr(172), whereas ATP promotes dephosphorylation. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP), like AMP, bound to γ sites 1 and 3 and stimulated α-Thr(172) phosphorylation. However, in contrast to AMP, ADP did not directly activate phosphorylated AMPK. In this way, both ADP/ATP and AMP/ATP ratios contribute to AMPK regulation."

The Arabidopsis PRR FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) senses bacterial flagellin and initiates immune signaling through association with BAK1. The molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuation of FLS2 activation are largely unknown. We report that flagellin induces recruitment of two closely related U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases, PUB12 and PUB13, to FLS2 receptor complex in Arabidopsis. BAK1 phosphorylates PUB12 and PUB13 and is required for FLS2-PUB12/13 association. PUB12 and PUB13 polyubiquitinate FLS2 and promote flagellin-induced FLS2 degradation, and the pub12 and pub13 mutants displayed elevated immune responses to flagellin treatment. Our study has revealed a unique regulatory circuit of direct ubiquitination and turnover of FLS2 by BAK1-mediated phosphorylation and recruitment of specific E3 ligases for attenuation of immune signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1994368354,"Gas accretion onto some massive black holes (MBHs) at the centers of galaxies actively powers luminous emission, but most MBHs are considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too near an MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). Although the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass about 10(6) to 10(7) solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar."

EPOXI (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation) flew past comet 103P/Hartley 2, one with an unusually small but very active nucleus, taking both images and spectra. Unlike large, relatively inactive nuclei, this nucleus is outgassing primarily because of CO(2), which drags chunks of ice out of the nucleus. It also shows substantial differences in the relative abundance of volatiles from various parts of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1967875390,"We investigated the electron-pairing mechanism in an iron-based superconductor, iron selenide (FeSe), using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Tunneling conductance spectra of stoichiometric FeSe crystalline films in their superconducting state revealed evidence for a gap function with nodal lines. Electron pairing with twofold symmetry was demonstrated by direct imaging of quasiparticle excitations in the vicinity of magnetic vortex cores, Fe adatoms, and Se vacancies. The twofold pairing symmetry was further supported by the observation of striped electronic nanostructures in the slightly Se-doped samples. The anisotropy can be explained in terms of the orbital-dependent reconstruction of electronic structure in FeSe."

https://openalex.org/W1978915732,"Root hairs are single cells that develop by tip growth and are specialized in the absorption of nutrients. Their cell walls are composed of polysaccharides and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) that include extensins (EXTs) and arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs). Proline hydroxylation, an early posttranslational modification of HRGPs that is catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs), defines the subsequent O-glycosylation sites in EXTs (which are mainly arabinosylated) and AGPs (which are mainly arabinogalactosylated). We explored the biological function of P4Hs, arabinosyltransferases, and EXTs in root hair cell growth. Biochemical inhibition or genetic disruption resulted in the blockage of polarized growth in root hairs and reduced arabinosylation of EXTs. Our results demonstrate that correct O-glycosylation on EXTs is essential for cell-wall self-assembly and, hence, root hair elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana."
https://openalex.org/W2069164541,"Circadian rhythms in mammals are generated by a feedback loop in which the three PERIOD (PER) proteins, acting in a large complex, inhibit the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 dimer, which represses their own expression. Although fundamental, the mechanism of negative feedback in the mammalian clock, or any eukaryotic clock, is unknown. We analyzed protein constituents of PER complexes purified from mouse tissues and identified PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor). Our analysis indicates that PSF within the PER complex recruits SIN3A, a scaffold for assembly of transcriptional inhibitory complexes and that the PER complex thereby rhythmically delivers histone deacetylases to the Per1 promoter, which repress Per1 transcription. These findings provide a function for the PER complex and a molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback."

https://openalex.org/W2171062007,"In the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), E2 enzymes mediate the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates and thereby control protein stability and interactions. The E2 enzyme hCdc34 catalyzes the ubiquitination of hundreds of proteins in conjunction with the cullin-RING (CRL) superfamily of E3 enzymes. We identified a small molecule termed CC0651 that selectively inhibits hCdc34. Structure determination revealed that CC0651 inserts into a cryptic binding pocket on hCdc34 distant from the catalytic site, causing subtle but wholesale displacement of E2 secondary structural elements. CC0651 analogs inhibited proliferation of human cancer cell lines and caused accumulation of the SCFSkp2 substrate p27Kip1. CC0651 does not affect hCdc34 interactions with E1 or E3 enzymes or the formation of the ubiquitin thioester but instead interferes with the discharge of ubiquitin to acceptor lysine residues. E2 enzymes are thus susceptible to noncatalytic site inhibition and may represent a viable class of drug target in the UPS."
https://openalex.org/W2158360711,"Adipose stromal cells (ASCs) serve as mesenchymal progenitors in white adipose tissue (WAT). Intercellular interactions involving ASCs have remained obscure. By merging phage display technology with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we screened a combinatorial library for peptides that target mouse ASCs in vivo. We isolated peptide CSWKYWFGEC that specifically homes to ASCs, used it as bait to purify the corresponding ASC surface receptor, and identified it as a previously unreported cleavage product of decorin (DCN) lacking the glycanation site (termed ΔDCN). We demonstrate that ΔDCN is differentially expressed on ASC surface. In a screen for ΔDCN-binding proteins, we identified resistin, an adipokine for which the receptor has been unknown. Expression of ΔDCN in 3T3-L1 cells promoted proliferation and migration but suppressed lipid accumulation upon adipogenesis induction, which was resistin dependent. We conclude that ΔDCN serves as a functional receptor of resistin in adipocyte progenitors and may regulate WAT expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2078440186,"Glass lacks the long-range periodic order that characterizes a crystal. In the Ce(75)Al(25) metallic glass (MG), however, we discovered a long-range topological order corresponding to a single crystal of indefinite length. Structural examinations confirm that the MG is truly amorphous, isotropic, and unstrained, yet under 25 gigapascals hydrostatic pressures, every segment of a centimeter-length MG ribbon devitrifies independently into a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal with the identical orientation. By using molecular dynamics simulations and synchrotron x-ray techniques, we elucidate that the mismatch between the large Ce and small Al atoms frustrates the crystallization and causes amorphization, but a long-range fcc topological order still exists. Pressure induces electronic transition in Ce, which eliminates the mismatch and manifests the topological order by the formation of a single crystal."

Both DGAT enzymes reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but DGAT2 also co-localizes with mitochondria and lipid droplets. In this report, we demonstrate that murine DGAT2 is part of a multimeric complex consisting of several DGAT2 subunits. We also identified the region of DGAT2 responsible for its localization to the ER. A DGAT2 mutant lacking both its transmembrane domains, although still associated with membranes, was absent from the ER and instead localized to mitochondria. Unexpectedly, this mutant was still active and capable of interacting with lipid droplets to promote TG storage. Additional experiments indicated that the ER targeting signal was present in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1) of DGAT2. When fused to a fluorescent reporter, TMD1, but not TMD2, was sufficient to target mCherry to the ER. Finally, the interaction of DGAT2 with lipid droplets was dependent on the C terminus of DGAT2. DGAT2 mutants, in which regions of the C terminus were either truncated or specific regions were deleted, failed to co-localize with lipid droplets when cells were oleate loaded to stimulate TG synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1978904320,"Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual interpretations (“percepts”) that alternate over time. Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive, suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a gradual subjective report. We find that the “reflexes” reflect the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both reflexes show a gradual dependence on the time relative to perceptual transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick deflections, which are highly correlated with the reflex measures, indicate gradual transitions. Physically simulating wave-like transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal rivalry (i.e., different regions of space belonging to distinct percepts) as one possible explanation for the gradual transitions. Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance durations depend on whether or not the percept is actively reported. In addition, reflexes respond to transitions with shorter latencies than the subjective report and show an abundance of short dominance durations. This failure to report fast changes in dominance may result from limited access of introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal that rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is modulated by the required action (response mode), and that rapid transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from awareness."
https://openalex.org/W1965417249,"Differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes capable of efficiently storing lipids is an important regulatory mechanism in obesity. Here, we examined the involvement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in the regulation of adipogenesis. We find that among the various members of the HDAC and HAT families, only HDAC9 exhibited dramatic down-regulation preceding adipogenic differentiation. Preadipocytes from HDAC9 gene knock-out mice exhibited accelerated adipogenic differentiation, whereas HDAC9 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes suppressed adipogenic differentiation, demonstrating its direct role as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. HDAC9 expression was higher in visceral as compared with subcutaneous preadipocytes, negatively correlating with their potential to undergo adipogenic differentiation in vitro. HDAC9 localized in the nucleus, and its negative regulation of adipogenesis segregates with the N-terminal nuclear targeting domain, whereas the C-terminal deacetylase domain is dispensable for this function. HDAC9 co-precipitates with USF1 and is recruited with USF1 at the E-box region of the C/EBPα gene promoter in preadipocytes. Upon induction of adipogenic differentiation, HDAC9 is down-regulated, leading to its dissociation from the USF1 complex, whereas p300 HAT is up-regulated to allow its association with USF1 and accumulation at the E-box site of the C/EBPα promoter in differentiated adipocytes. This reciprocal regulation of HDAC9 and p300 HAT in the USF1 complex is associated with increased C/EBPα expression, a master regulator of adipogenic differentiation. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of adipogenic differentiation and document a critical regulatory role for HDAC9 in adipogenic differentiation through a deacetylase-independent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2004710090,"The enzyme acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (Lpcat1) is a critical cytosolic enzyme needed for lung surfactant synthesis that catalyzes an acyltransferase reaction by adding a palmitate to the sn-2 position of lysophospholipids. Here we report that histone H4 protein is subject to palmitoylation catalyzed by Lpcat1 in a calcium-regulated manner. Cytosolic Lpcat1 was observed to shift into the nucleus in lung epithelia in response to exogenous Ca(2+). Nuclear Lpcat1 colocalizes with and binds to histone H4, where it catalyzes histone H4 palmitoylation. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that Ser(47) within histone H4 serves as a putative acceptor site, indicative of Lpcat1-mediated O-palmitoylation. Lpcat1 knockdown or expression of a histone H4 Ser(47A) mutant protein in cells decreased cellular mRNA synthesis. These findings provide the first evidence of a protein substrate for Lpcat1 and reveal that histone lipidation may occur through its O-palmitoylation as a novel post-translational modification. This epigenetic modification regulates global gene transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2055325357,"Activation of the bifunctional kinase/RNase enzyme IRE1α is part of an adaptive response triggered on accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To facilitate recovery of ER homeostasis, IRE1α molecules oligomerize, allowing for their transautophosphorylation and endoribonuclease activation. These, in turn, induce the activation of specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional programs. To identify novel and selective modulators of IRE1α activity, we investigated IRE1α oligomerization properties using IRE1α-derived peptides identified through an activity-based in vitro assay. We then used these peptides to probe IRE1α activity in vitro and in vivo using both cultured human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HuH7 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans experimental systems. We identified a peptide derived from the kinase domain of human IRE1α, which promoted IRE1α oligomerization in vitro, enhanced its Xbp1 mRNA cleavage activity in vitro (1.7×) in cell culture (1.8×) and in vivo (1.3×), and attenuated both ER stress-mediated JNK activation and regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD). This was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in survival on tunicamycin-induced ER stress and reduced apoptosis by 1.4-fold in cells expressing this peptide. Hence, targeted and selective activation of the catalytic properties of IRE1α may consequently define new strategies to protect cells from deleterious effects of ER stress signaling.—Bouchecareilh, M., Higa, A., Fribourg, S., Moenner, M., Chevet, E.

To evaluate the effect of audit at district level in Thyolo, Malawi, we assessed the incidence of facility-based severe maternal complications (severe acute maternal morbidity (SAMM) and maternal mortality) during two years of audit and feedback.Between September 2007 and September 2009, we included all cases of maternal mortality and SAMM that occurred in Thyolo District Hospital, the main referral facility in the area, using validated disease-specific criteria. During two- to three-weekly audit sessions, health workers and managers identified substandard care factors. Resulting recommendations were implemented and followed up. Feedback was given during subsequent sessions. A linear regression analysis was performed on facility-based severe maternal complications. During the two-year study period, 386 women were included: 46 died and 340 sustained SAMM, giving a case fatality rate of 11.9%. Forty-five cases out of the 386 inclusions were audited in plenary with hospital staff. There was a reduction of 3.1 women with severe maternal complications per 1000 deliveries in the district health facilities, from 13.5 per 1000 deliveries in the beginning to 10.4 per 1000 deliveries at the end of the study period. The incidence of uterine rupture and major obstetric hemorrhage reduced considerably (from 3.5 to 0.2 and from 5.9 to 2.6 per 1000 facility deliveries respectively).Our findings indicate that audit and feedback have the potential to reduce serious maternal complications including maternal mortality. Complications like major hemorrhage and uterine rupture that require relatively straightforward intrapartum emergency management are easier to reduce than those which require uptake of improved antenatal care (eclampsia) or timely intravenous medication or HIV-treatment (peripartum infections)."
https://openalex.org/W2135790901,"Lymphatic metastasis constitutes a critical route of disease dissemination, which limits the prognosis of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). As lymphangiogenesis has been implicated in stimulation of lymphatic metastasis by vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D, we studied the effect of the angioregulatory growth factor angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) on PDAC progression. Ang-2 was found to be expressed in transformed cells of human PDAC specimens, with corresponding Tie-2 receptors present on blood and lymphatic endothelium. In vitro in PDAC cells, Ang-2 was subject to autocrine/paracrine TGF-β stimulation (2-fold induction, P= 0.0106) acting on the –61- to +476-bp element of the human Ang-2 promoter. In turn, Ang-2 regulated the expression of genes involved in cell motility and tumor suppression. Orthotopic PDAC xenografts with forced expression of Ang-2, but not Ang-1, displayed increased blood and lymphatic vessel density, and an enhanced rate of lymphatic metastasis (6.7- to 9.1-fold, P<0.01), which was prevented by sequestration of Ang-2 via coexpression of soluble Tie-2. Notably, elevated circulating Ang-2 in patients with PDAC correlated with the extent of lymphatic metastasis. Furthermore, median survival was reduced from 28.4 to 7.7 mo in patients with circulating Ang-2 ≥ 75th percentile (P=0.0005). These findings indicate that Ang-2 participates in the control of lymphatic metastasis, constitutes a noninvasive prognostic biomarker, and may provide an accessible therapeutic target in PDAC.—Schulz, P., Fischer, C., Detjen, K.

The main physiological role of Fxr is to maintain bile acid homeostasis and to regulate genes encoding enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport. bile acid triacyl glycerol salmon protein hydrolysate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor interscapular brown adipose tissue epididymal white adipose tissue cholestyramine farnesoid X receptor. In addition to bile acid homeostasis, Fxr is important for normal lipid metabolism. Fxr−/− mice display higher triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations in serum and liver (8Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M.

In line with these findings, bile acid treatment has been reported, in a Fxr-dependent manner, to induce liver very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) transcription (10Sirvent A. Claudel T. Martin G. Brozek J. Kosykh V. Darteil R. Hum D.W. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and to prevent hepatic TAG accumulation, VLDL secretion, and elevated serum TAG concentration in mice (11Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Thus, bile acids and Fxr play central roles in VLDL lipoprotein metabolism and in the control of TAG levels. Glucose metabolism is also regulated by bile acids, and mice treated with cholic acid are protected from diet-induced hyperglycemia (12Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Itakura H. Kawanaka K. Tabata I. Higuchi M. Tange T. Yamamo T.T. Ezaki O. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Furthermore, Fxr−/− mice are glucose-intolerant and insulin-resistant, and insulin signaling is blunted in several tissues (15Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M.

Activation of Fxr with a synthetic ligand, GW4064, or hepatic overexpression of constitutively active Fxr lowered blood glucose in both diabetic db/db and wild-type mice (15Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Barrera G. Lee H. Vales C. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that bile acid signaling and Fxr function are essential for normal glucose regulation. Bile acids are also endogenous activators of the G-protein-coupled receptor Tgr5 (also referred to as GB37/M-BAR/Gpbar1) (18Maruyama T. Miyamoto Y. Nakamura T. Tamai Y. Okada H. Sugiyama E. Nakamura T. Itadani H. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 19Kawamata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Harada M. Yoshida H. Miwa M.

Stimulation of Tgr5 by bile acids has been shown to increase energy expenditure and to protect mice from diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance (20Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of Tgr5 in the control of energy expenditure, female Tgr5−/− mice show increased adiposity when challenged with a high fat diet (21Maruyama T. Tanaka K. Suzuki J. Miyoshi H. Harada N. Nakamura T. Miyamoto Y. Kanatani A. Tamai Y. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 191: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Also, Tgr5 activation by bile acids has been reported to promote production and release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in enteroendocrine cell lines (22Katsuma S. Hirasawa A. Tsujimoto G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and in mice (23Thomas C. Gioiello A. Noriega L. Strehle A. Oury J. Rizzo G. Macchiarulo A. Yamamoto H. Mataki C. Pruzanski M. Pellicciari R. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), adding another aspect of bile acid treatment for the prevention of diet-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Thus, bile acid signaling through Tgr5 might be important for the maintenance of normal energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. The benefits of activating Tgr5 or Fxr for the prevention of the metabolic syndrome have stimulated the development of synthetic ligands for these receptors (24Sato H. Macchiarulo A. Thomas C. Gioiello A. Une M. Hofmann A.F. Saladin R. Schoonjans K. Pellicciari R. Auwerx J. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 25Evans M.J. Mahaney P.E.

Liver Physiol. 2009; 296: G543-G552Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another strategy to increase Tgr5 and/or Fxr signaling would be to alter endogenous BA metabolism. As hepatic bile acid conjugation is important for secretion of BAs into bile (2Vessey D.A. Whitney J. Gollan J.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and rats conjugate BAs to both taurine and glycine with high efficiency (26Zhang R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G351-G358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the dietary levels of these amino acids might be crucial for BA conjugation and secretion (27Hardison W.G. Gastroenterology. 1978; 75: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Feeding rats casein-based diets supplemented with either glycine or taurine led to reduced plasma cholesterol and liver TAG concentrations, whereas only taurine supplementation reduced plasma TAG levels (28Park T. Oh J. Lee K. Nutr. Res. 1999; 19: 1777-1789Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, taurine administration has been reported to induce hepatic protein expression of the canalicular transporter proteins ATP-binding cassette b11, Abcb11 (also called Bsep) and Abcc2 (also called Mrp2). Concomitantly, bile flow and taurocholate excretion were induced in experiments with perfused rat livers (29Mühlfeld A. Kubitz R. Dransfeld O. Häussinger D. Wettstein M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In rats fed low fat diets, we have previously shown that BA metabolism can be modulated by dietary proteins with different endogenous glycine and taurine contents (30Liaset B. Madsen L. Hao Q. Criales G. Mellgren G. Marschall H.U. Hallenborg P. Espe M. Frøyland L. Kristiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, evidence is accumulating that BA metabolism can be modulated by dietary levels of glycine and taurine in normal energy diets. However, development of the metabolic syndrome is tightly associated with intake of energy-dense diets. Therefore, this study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that rats treated with a taurine- and glycine-rich protein source, salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH), would be protected from developing high fat diet-induced pathological characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. We demonstrate that bile acid metabolism can be modulated by the protein source in high fat fed rats and that such a modulation may protect against development of the metabolic syndrome. Male Wistar Hannover GALAS rats (HanTac:WH) were obtained from Taconic Europe (Ejby, Denmark) and divided into experimental groups (n = 6). The rats were kept at a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room at 22 °C. After acclimatization, the animals were fed experimental diets with either SPH or casein as the sole protein source (supplemental Table 1). The composition of the protein sources has been described elsewhere (31Liaset B. Espe M. Proc. Biochem. 2008; 43: 42-48Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Feed intake and body weight were recorded throughout the experiments, and feces were collected the last 5 days. The rats were killed by cardiac puncture under anesthesia (0.23 mg/kg body weight Fentanyl (Janssen) and 0.45 mg/kg BW Dormitor Vet (Orion Pharma)). Heparin-plasma and EDTA-plasma containing aprotinin were prepared from blood. Tissues were dissected out and weighed. A portion of the liver was used for subcellular fractionation and measurement of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 capacity, and portions of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) were homogenized and used for determination of palmitoyl coenzyme A oxidation capacity. The rest of the tissues were freeze-clamped and frozen at −80 °C. All animal experiments were approved by the National State Board of Biological Experiments with Living Animals (Norway and Denmark). Adverse events were not observed. After 40 days of feeding, rats were anesthetized (0.4 mg Dormitor Vet (Medetomidin Hydrochlorid)/kg BW rat (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland)), and whole body composition was determined by a dual x-ray absorptiometry scanner equipped with a small animal option (Discovery QDR Series, Hologic, Bedford, MA). A separate set of rats (n = 6/group) was fed experimental diets for 17 days. Heat production was calculated from gas exchange measurements, as described previously (32Lauridsen C. Yong C. Halekoh U. Bugel S.H. Brandt K. Christensen L.P. Jorgensen H. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2008; 88: 720-732Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gas exchange was determined twice, each time for 22 h. From the average gas exchange measurements, heat production was calculated by the respiratory quotient method and reported per 24 h. A separate set of rats (n = 5/group) was fed experimental diets for 25 days. After termination in the fed state, 200 μl of heparin plasma from each sample was mixed with a solution of 400 μl of 0.9% saline and 20% D2O. Measurements were performed at 310 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer, operating at a 1H frequency of 600.13 MHz, and equipped with a 5-mm 1H TXI probe (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin-echo pulse sequence with water suppression. All spectra were referenced to the lactate doublet signal at 1.33 ppm. The spectra were segmented into 0.013 ppm bins, and each of the bins was integrated. The reduced spectra excluding the residual water signal were normalized to the whole spectrum. Principal component analysis and partial least squares regression discriminate analysis was performed using the Unscrambler software version 9.8 (Camo, Oslo, Norway) to elucidate biochemical differences between pre-defined classes. Martens' uncertainty test was applied to find significant variables on the full cross-validated data (33Martens H.A. Dardenne P. Chemometrics Intell. Lab. Syst. 1998; 44: 99-121Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 34Martens H. Martens M. Food Qual. Pref. 2000; 11: 5-16Crossref Google Scholar). For total bile acid measurements in feces, bile acids were extracted according to Suckling et al. (35Suckling K.E. Benson G.M. Bond B. Gee A. Glen A. Haynes C. Jackson B. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 89: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Amounts of total bile acids in fecal extracts and in nonfasted EDTA-plasma were determined enzymatically by the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction (Dialab, Vienna, Austria). Bile acids in liver samples were extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and electrospray-mass spectrometry as described previously in detail (36Marschall H.U. Wagner M. Bodin K. Zollner G. Fickert P. Gumhold J. Silbert D. Fuchsbichler A. Sjövall J. Trauner M. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 582-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified tissues using TRIzol, and cDNA was synthesized from individual rats. Gene expression was determined in individual samples by real time quantitative PCR using ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) carried out in 96-well plates and in duplicate as earlier described (37Madsen L. Petersen R.K. Sørensen M.B. Jørgensen C. Hallenborg P. Pridal L. Fleckner J. Amri E.Z. Krieg P. Furstenberger G. Berge R.K. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Primers for real time PCR (supplemental Table 2) were designed using Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). The following procedures were all performed according to Affymetrix standard procedures. Briefly, equal amounts of RNA isolated from livers were pooled (n = 6), and 5 μg of total RNA was used as starting material for the target preparation. First and second strand cDNA syntheses were performed using the SuperScript II system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions except using an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. Labeled aRNA was prepared using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo) using biotin-labeled CTP and UTP (Enzo) in the reaction together with unlabeled NTPs. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Fifteen μg of cRNA were fragmented, loading onto the Affymetrix Rat Genome RAE 230 2.0 probe array cartridge, and hybridized for 16 h. The arrays were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station and scanned using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (GeneChip® Scanner 3000 System with workstation and autoloader). The raw images files from the quantitative scanning were analyzed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Software (MAS 5.0) resulting in cell files containing background corrected probe values. Liver microarray data were used to identify metabolic pathways regulated by treatments, using the KEGG resource (38Kanehisa M. Goto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18879) Google Scholar, 39Kanehisa M. Goto S. Hattori M. Aoki-Kinoshita K.F. Itoh M. Kawashima S. Katayama T. Araki M. Hirakawa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D354-D357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), release 43. Genes with at least 2-fold change in expression level between the two treatment groups were taken as differentially expressed genes. The enrichment of these differentially expressed genes among KEGG pathways was measured by two-tailed Fisher's exact test. The pathways with p value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and were further studied. Lipids in cryosections of frozen liver samples were stained by the standard Oil Red-O method. Parts of the eWAT were subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin staining as described previously (40Madsen L. Pedersen L.M. Lillefosse H.H. Fjaere E. Bronstad I. Hao Q. Petersen R.K. Hallenborg P. Ma T. De Matteis R. Araujo P. Mercader J. Bonet M.L. Hansen J.B. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Wang J. Cinti S. Voshol P. Døskeland S.O. Kristiansen K. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11391Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Lipids, metabolites, and enzyme activities in plasma were determined by commercially available enzymatic kits as follows: alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol (Dialab, Vienna, Austria); glucose and TAG (MaxMat, Montpellier, France); and OH-butyrate (Randox, Crumlin, UK). Hormones were measured in EDTA-plasma containing aprotinin, insulin by an ELISA kit (DRG Diagnostics, Germany), and glucagon by a radioimmunoassay kit (LINCO Research, St. Charles, MO). Glycogen in liver samples was converted to glucose by treatment with amyloglucosidase as described elsewhere (41Bär A. Lina B.A. de Groot D.M. de Bie B. Appel M.J. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1999; 29: S11-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glucose content after the treatment was determined using a commercial glucose quantification kit (Dialab, Vienna, Austria). Total lipids were extracted from liver samples with chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v). The lipid classes (TAG, cholesterol, and sterol esters) were analyzed on an automated Camaq HPTLC system and separated on HPTLC Silica Gel 60 F plates as described previously (42Liaset B. Julshamn K. Espe M. Proc. Biochem. 2003; 38: 1747-1759Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Liver mitochondrion-enriched fractions were prepared as described previously (30Liaset B. Madsen L. Hao Q. Criales G. Mellgren G. Marschall H.U. Hallenborg P. Espe M. Frøyland L. Kristiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared mitochondrion-enriched fractions were used for determination of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase capacity, as described previously (43Madsen L. Berge R.K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with or without addition of the CPT-1 inhibitor malonyl-CoA (5 μm). After removal of the mitochondrion-enriched fraction, the homogenates were further centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant collected after this centrifugation was used as the liver cytosolic fraction, and total glutathione (GSH) content was determined by a colorimetric assay, Bioxytech GSH-400 (OXISResearchTM, Portland, OR). Samples from eWAT and iBAT were homogenized in a glycine-glycine buffer as described previously (44Bas S. Giacobino J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected (post-nuclear fraction). Fatty acid oxidation capacity was measured in the postnuclear fractions by the acid-soluble product method using radiolabeled palmitoyl coenzyme A as the substrate, as described previously in detail (30Liaset B. Madsen L. Hao Q. Criales G. Mellgren G. Marschall H.U. Hallenborg P. Espe M. Frøyland L. Kristiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The stromal vascular fraction was isolated from eWAT dissected out from rats as earlier described (37Madsen L. Petersen R.K. Sørensen M.B. Jørgensen C. Hallenborg P. Pridal L. Fleckner J. Amri E.Z. Krieg P. Furstenberger G. Berge R.K. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Contaminating erythrocytes were eliminated from the stromal-vascular fraction by a wash with sterile distilled water. Cells were plated and induced to differentiate as described (37Madsen L. Petersen R.K. Sørensen M.B. Jørgensen C. Hallenborg P. Pridal L. Fleckner J. Amri E.Z. Krieg P. Furstenberger G. Berge R.K. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells were treated with increasing concentrations of taurocholic acid in the medium for 24 h. Afterward, the cells were scraped and homogenized in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Fatty acid oxidation capacity was evaluated by the total amount of acid-soluble products using radiolabeled palmitoyl coenzyme A as the substrate, as described previously in detail (30Liaset B. Madsen L. Hao Q. Criales G. Mellgren G. Marschall H.U. Hallenborg P. Espe M. Frøyland L. Kristiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The gross energy content was determined in a bomb calorimeter following the manufacturer's instruction (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Analysis of variance was performed by post hoc pairwise comparison Student's t test or Tukey's HSD test. Data that failed to show homogeneity in variance by Levenes' test were tested by the nonparametric tests Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Data were considered statistically different at p < 0.05. To demonstrate that endogenous BA metabolism could be altered by dietary protein source, rats were fed SPH- or casein-based high fat diets for 46 days. As expected, and in agreement with our previous findings (30Liaset B. Madsen L. Hao Q. Criales G. Mellgren G. Marschall H.U. Hallenborg P. Espe M. Frøyland L. Kristiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), plasma BA concentrations were higher in SPH-treated rats, whereas total liver BA amounts were not statistically different (Fig. 1, A and B). The SPH-treated rats had significantly higher liver α-muricholic acid and tended to have lower cholic acid but higher β-muricholic acid levels (both p = 0.06), relative to the casein-fed rats (Fig. 1B). Body weight gain was reduced and at the end of the experiment mean body weight was 110 g lower in SPH-treated rats (Fig. 1C). The accumulated energy intake was slightly but significant lower (−11%, p < 0.01) in the SPH-treated rats. Still, after correcting for the difference in energy intake, energy efficiency was reduced by 44% (Fig. 1D). Rats fed the SPH high fat diet exhibited reduced white adipose depot weights, epididymal (eWAT, −56%), and mesenteric WAT (−46%), although no difference was observed in iBAT (Fig. 1E). No difference was observed in apparent energy digestibility (Fig. 1F). Thus, our data supported the hypothesis that endogenous BA levels could be altered by diet and that this might be important for the observed reduced adiposity. To further test this hypothesis, we chose to pharmacologically remove BAs from circulation. Thus, we fed a new set of rats the experimental diets, including a group that received a small amount, 0.5 weight %, of the BA-binding resin cholestyramine (c'am) added to the SPH diet. To secure equal energy intake, the rats were pair-fed. As predicted, inclusion of cholestyramine successfully lowered plasma BA concentrations in the SPH-based diet, whereas liver BA levels remained unaltered (Fig. 1, G and H). Quantification of whole body fat content by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed that the reduced plasma BA concentration was associated with increased body fat content (Fig. 1J). Despite lower plasma BA concentrations, and increased adiposity, no significant difference in body weight gain was found between the SPH and the SPH + c'am-treated groups (Fig. 1I). However, the lean body mass, including bones, was borderline-reduced in the SPH-treated rats (231 ± 4 g, p = 0.052) but was significantly reduced in the SPH + cholestyramine-treated rats (223 ± 1 g, p = 0.005), relative to the casein-fed rats (259 ± 7 g). Because bile acids are known to increase energy expenditure and energy dissipation in the form of heat (20Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), we considered it likely that the reduced fat content in the SPH-treated rats was accompanied by higher energy dissipation. To demonstrate this, we determined energy expenditure in the rats by indirect calorimetry. Indeed, SPH-treated rats had significantly higher O2 consumption and heat production, as well as CO2 elimination relative to the casein-treated rats (Fig. 1"
https://openalex.org/W1998369828,"p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase. Based on the crystal structure of the oxygenase component (C2), His-396 is 4.5 Å from the flavin C4a locus, whereas Ser-171 is 2.9 Å from the flavin N5 locus. We investigated the roles of these two residues in the stability of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate. The results indicated that the rate constant for C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN formation decreased ∼30-fold in H396N, 100-fold in H396A, and 300-fold in the H396V mutant, compared with the wild-type enzyme. Lesser effects of the mutations were found for the subsequent step of H2O2 elimination. Studies on pH dependence showed that the rate constant of H2O2 elimination in H396N and H396V increased when pH increased with pKa >9.6 and >9.7, respectively, similar to the wild-type enzyme (pKa >9.4). These data indicated that His-396 is important for the formation of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate but is not involved in H2O2 elimination. Transient kinetics of the Ser-171 mutants with oxygen showed that the rate constants for the H2O2 elimination in S171A and S171T were ∼1400-fold and 8-fold greater than the wild type, respectively. Studies on the pH dependence of S171A with oxygen showed that the rate constant of H2O2 elimination increased with pH rise and exhibited an approximate pKa of 8.0. These results indicated that the interaction of the hydroxyl group side chain of Ser-171 and flavin N5 is required for the stabilization of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN. The double mutant S171A/H396V reacted with oxygen to directly form the oxidized flavin without stabilizing the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate, which confirmed the findings based on the single mutation that His-396 was important for formation and Ser-171 for stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate in C2. p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase is a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase. Based on the crystal structure of the oxygenase component (C2), His-396 is 4.5 Å from the flavin C4a locus, whereas Ser-171 is 2.9 Å from the flavin N5 locus. We investigated the roles of these two residues in the stability of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate. The results indicated that the rate constant for C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN formation decreased ∼30-fold in H396N, 100-fold in H396A, and 300-fold in the H396V mutant, compared with the wild-type enzyme. Lesser effects of the mutations were found for the subsequent step of H2O2 elimination. Studies on pH dependence showed that the rate constant of H2O2 elimination in H396N and H396V increased when pH increased with pKa >9.6 and >9.7, respectively, similar to the wild-type enzyme (pKa >9.4). These data indicated that His-396 is important for the formation of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate but is not involved in H2O2 elimination. Transient kinetics of the Ser-171 mutants with oxygen showed that the rate constants for the H2O2 elimination in S171A and S171T were ∼1400-fold and 8-fold greater than the wild type, respectively. Studies on the pH dependence of S171A with oxygen showed that the rate constant of H2O2 elimination increased with pH rise and exhibited an approximate pKa of 8.0. These results indicated that the interaction of the hydroxyl group side chain of Ser-171 and flavin N5 is required for the stabilization of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN. The double mutant S171A/H396V reacted with oxygen to directly form the oxidized flavin without stabilizing the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate, which confirmed the findings based on the single mutation that His-396 was important for formation and Ser-171 for stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate in C2."
https://openalex.org/W2075431236,"Many tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins self-associate, forming dimers and higher order complexes. For example, dimers of TRIM5α, a host factor that restricts retrovirus infection, assemble into higher order arrays on the surface of the viral capsid, resulting in an increase in avidity. Here we show that the higher order association of different TRIM proteins exhibits a wide range of efficiencies. Homologous association (self-association) was more efficient than the heterologous association of different TRIM proteins, indicating that specificity determinants of higher order self-association exist. To investigate the structural determinants of higher order self-association, we studied TRIM mutants and chimeras. These studies revealed the following: 1) the RING domain contributes to the efficiency of higher order self-association, which enhances the binding of TRIM5α to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) capsid; 2) the RING and B-box 2 domains work together as a homologous unit to promote higher order association of dimers; 3) dimerization is probably required for efficient higher order self-association; 4) the Linker 2 region contributes to higher order self-association, independently of effects of Linker 2 changes on TRIM dimerization; and 5) for efficiently self-associating TRIM proteins, the B30.2(SPRY) domain is not required for higher order self-association. These results support a model in which both ends of the core TRIM dimer (RING-B-box 2 at one end and Linker 2 at the other) contribute to the formation of higher order arrays."
https://openalex.org/W2143183540,"The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) regulates cellular [Ca2+]i and plays a central role in health and disease, but its molecular regulation is poorly understood. Here we report on how protons affect this electrogenic transporter by modulating two critically important NCX C2 regulatory domains, Ca2+ binding domain-1 (CBD1) and CBD2. The NCX transport rate in intact cardiac ventricular myocytes was measured as a membrane current, INCX, whereas [H+]i was varied using an ammonium chloride “rebound” method at constant extracellular pH 7.4. At pHi = 7.2 and [Ca2+]i < 120 nm, INCX was less than 4% that of its maximally Ca2+-activated value. INCX increases steeply at [Ca2+]i between 130–150 nm with a Hill coefficient (nH) of 8.0 ± 0.7 and K0.5 = 310 ± 5 nm. At pHi = 6.87, the threshold of Ca2+-dependent activation of INCX was shifted to much higher [Ca2+]i (600–700 nm), and the relationship was similarly steep (nH = 8.0±0.8) with K0.5 = 1042 ± 15 nm. The Vmax of Ca2+-dependent activation of INCX was not significantly altered by low pHi. The Ca2+ affinities for CBD1 (0.39 ± 0.06 μm) and CBD2 (Kd = 18.4 ± 6 μm) were exquisitely sensitive to [H+], decreasing 1.3–2.3-fold as pHi decreased from 7.2 to 6.9.

Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Ca2+ enters the myocytes through the L-type Ca2+ channel and triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to produce the [Ca2+]i transient that activates contraction. All of this “trigger” Ca2+ that enters the cell must be extruded, and the NCX is largely or wholly responsible (2Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). NCX is an electrogenic transporter and, when extruding net Ca2+, produces an inward current, INCX, the magnitude of which is a direct measure of the transport rate of NCX(3Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J.

Although multiple NCX control elements exist to regulate its function, we focus here on one that is critically important and one that is both complex and controversial; that is, the action of [Ca2+]i on NCX transport rate.

Two kinds of Ca2+-dependent regulation of NCX are appreciated: “translocation” effects and “allosteric” effects (5Bers D.M. Ginsburg K.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1099: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The translocation actions of [Ca2+]i reflect how the availability of Ca2+ and its binding to a translocation site affects the NCX transport rate. Such translocation effects depend both on the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the system. The allosteric effect depends on Ca2+ binding to a site that itself does not produce translocation but regulates transport kinetics. The cytosolic loop of NCX includes two closely spaced domains named Ca2+ binding domain 1 (CBD1) and CBD2 (7Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol.

Such C2 domains are known to interact with diverse effectors (e.g. Ca2+, phosphatidylinositol diphosphate, lipids, and other proteins) (10Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Here we investigate the two C2 domains and their competitive modulation by Ca2+ and protons. Proton actions on NCX function were investigated using state of the art electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical methods. [Ca2+]i, pHi, and INCX were measured in single ventricular myocytes (13Blank P.S. Silverman H.S. Chung O.Y. Hogue B.A. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J.

We have identified and characterized the Ca2+ sensitivity of NCX at CBD1 and CBD2 and discovered a process that is profoundly modulated by pH. Furthermore, we have characterized the proton-dependent block of NCX. This proton-dependent regulation of the Ca2+ modulation of NCX appears to arise as an allosteric action on the NCX protein. Taken together, our new findings suggest a pivotal role for protons in the physiological and pathologic regulation of NCX. The DNA constructs of CBD1, CBD2, and CBD12 (AD-splice variant) were cloned into a pET23b vector and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen) as described (16Boyman L.

Overexpressed proteins were purified on nickel beads (<95% purity, judged by SDS-PAGE). Protein preparations were repeatedly washed in the Ultracel-3k (Millipore) device to remove EDTA. For accurate measurement of high affinity Ca2+ binding, the residual levels of EDTA must be <1 nm in final preparations of proteins (see supplemental Fig. 4S). The 45Ca2+ binding to proteins was measured as outlined before (16Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol.

The assay medium (1 ml) contained 0.02 mm CBD1 or 0.04 mm CBD2 or 0.02 mm CBD12, 100 mm KCl, and either 20 mm Bistris propane for experiments carried at pH 6.3–9.0, 10 mm MES for experiments carried at pH < 6.3, or 10 CAPS at pH > 10. In the buffers prepared for 45Ca2+ binding assay, residual free Ca2+ was measured by fluo-3 (16Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6185-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); whereas the Kd values of Ca2+ binding to fluo-3 is pH-sensitive, it is experimentally derived at each given pH and not assumed. All Ca2+ binding assays were done at 22–23 °C. The 45Ca2+ titration curves were fitted to a Hill or Adair equation (16Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol.

In the stopped-flow machine SFM-3 (BioLogic), 150 μl (syringe A) of proteins in buffer (100 mm KCl and 10 mm Bistris propane) were mixed with 150 μl of buffer plus 200–600 μm Quin-2 (syringe B). Quin-2 was excited at λex = 333 nm, and emission was monitored at λem > 495 nm. The data were analyzed with Bio-Kine 32 Version 4.45 (Bio-Logic). Cardiomyocytes were isolated from euthanized adult Sprague-Dawley rats (18Boyman L. Hiller R. Lederer W.J. Khananshvili D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Myocytes were attached to laminin-coated coverslips placed in a custom designed chamber and were used within 4–5 h from the time of isolation. A whole-cell dialysis patch clamp method was combined with confocal microscopy to enable simultaneous measurement of INCX, pHi, and [Ca2+]i in myocytes. Voltage control and current measurement was accomplished using an Axopatch 200A amplifier; data were digitized and recorded using a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) attached to a PC. Confocal imaging was performed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning microscope (inverted) equipped with a 63 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Cardiomyocytes were co-loaded through the patch pipette with the salt form of fluo-4 and carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor-1 (C-SNARF-1). To avoid spectral bleed-through of individual indicators, confocal recordings were made in the multi-track mode, where line-scan emissions along the longitudinal axis of the cardiomyocyte were acquired at one excitation at a time, sequentially. Fluo-4 fluorescence emission was taken at 505–550 nm, whereas excitation was at 488 nm with an argon ion laser. The C-SNARF-1 dual emission was collected at λ1 (>635 nm) and λ2 (560–615 nm), excitation was at 543 nm with a He-Ne laser. All experiments were performed at 20–23 °C. Fluo-4 fluorescence was calibrated with respect to [Ca2+]i using a method developed by Trafford et al. (19Trafford A.W. Díaz M.E. Eisner D.A. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in which the maximal fluorescence (Fmax) was directly measured from each cardiomyocyte at the end of the experiment. Fluo-4 Kd values were determined experimentally by in vitro fluorometric titration assay performed at various pH values (16Boyman L. Mikhasenko H. Hiller R. Khananshvili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6185-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The intracellular Kd values of 1 μm at pH 7.2 and 1.5 μm at pH 6.8 were used for calculating [Ca2+]i. An in situ calibration method was adapted to convert the C-SNARF-1 emission ratio (λ1:λ2) to pHi (14Buckler K.J. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Pflugers Arch. 1990; 417: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Calibration curves were obtained from a separate set of cardiomyocytes patch-loaded in a manner that was identical to that used in the electrophysiological experiments. Patched cells were pretreated (1–2 min) with 20 μm nigericin locally applied by a pneumatic pico-pump; nigericin treatment permits equilibration of pHi with the pH of the external superfusion recording solution. The calibration curves of C-SNARF-1 performed here yielded an apparent pK value of 7.29 ± 0.15 (n = 4 cells), which is in good agreement with previous reports in rat cardiomyocytes (13Blank P.S. Silverman H.S. Chung O.Y. Hogue B.A. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H276-H284PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate any contribution of the SR to Ca2+ handling, cells were pretreated for 10 min with Ca2+/Na+ free Tyrode's solution containing 0.001 mm thapsigargin, 10 mm caffeine, 140 mm LiCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with LiOH. Patch pipettes (1.8–2.2 megaohms) were filled with a solution containing 59 mm CsCl, 80 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.91 mm MgCl2, 1 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm Na2GTP, 3.99 mm KCl, 0.1 mm C-SNARF-1, and 0.05 mm K5fluo-4; pH was set to 7.2 with CsOH. Gigaohm seals were attained while perfusing the recording chamber with normal Tyrode's solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, with pH set to 7.4 using NaOH. After whole-cell configuration was attained, to better isolate INCX and to enable clamping of the pHi to the displaced level, the external solution was switched to the recording solution, a normal Tyrode's solution supplemented with the following combination of drugs: 3 mm 4-aminopyridine, 20 μm nifedipine, 30 μm niflumic acid, and 8 μm (4-cyanobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carbonyl)guanidine methanesulfonate an Na+/H+ exchanger-1 inhibitor. To manipulate pHi, cells were perfused for 2–4 min with the Tyrode's solution containing 40 mm NH4Cl (with an appropriate reduction in NaCl to keep the overall osmolarity constant; also see supplemental Fig. 2). The electrophysiological protocol (Fig. 1) and off-line analysis of the currents (Fig. 2) were based upon the approach of Weber et al. (15Weber C.R. Ginsburg K.S. Philipson K.D. Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Weber C.R. Piacentino 3rd, V. Houser S.R. Bers D.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2224-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After break-in and again before any repetition of the protocol, the cells were held at Em of −100 mV for 3–5 min to facilitate Ca2+ efflux via inward INCX, resulting in low initial [Ca2+]i. Each experimental protocol included repetitive step pulses from −100 to +100 mV applied at ∼4.5 Hz. The number of pulses (15–60) and the duration in which the cells were held at +100 allowed specific control of [Ca2+]i. We initially repeated the experimental protocol 2–4 times at basal pHi (usually ∼7.2); immediately after the lower pHi was established (via acid loading by NH4Cl rebound) we repeated the experimental protocol for as long as the cardiomyocytes remained quiescent, i.e. the leak currents were stable and <300 pA (at Em of −80mV). The magnitude of the leak currents was taken from the first pulse to −100 mV, and INCX was calculated as the current after off-line subtraction of the leak currents (for details see supplemental Fig. 1) In the presence of Ni2+ (10 mm), no Ca2+-activated current was seen (see supplemental Fig. 1). The magnitude of the measured leak currents in the absence of Ni2+ noted above were indistinguishable from those observed after the application of Ni2+. During each Em step, the average INCX (excluding the capacitive transient) was plotted versus instantaneous [Ca2+]i, and half-maximal Ca2+-induced activation of INCX (K0.5) was calculated from the least-square fits to a Hill equation (Origin 8.1 software; Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2[Ca2+]i-dependent activation of INCX in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.

After subtraction of background leak currents from the total membrane current record, INCX is the Ca2+-activated membrane current when all other currents are blocked.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test for unpaired samples (SPSS 11.5). An investigation of the regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger function by [Ca2+]i and [H+]i was carried out in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. This work involved an examination of INCX under conditions when [Ca2+]i and [H+]i can be readily measured and, to some extent, controlled. Finally, we examined where protons bind to the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and whether or not they may compete with Ca2+ as regulatory ions. To investigate the influence of [H+]i on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger function, INCX was measured at different pHi levels. The NH4Cl rebound method was used to transiently acidify the intracellular compartment of a single cardiomyocytes, whereas INCX was examined using patch clamp measurements (whole-cell configuration). Simultaneously [Ca2+]i was measured using fluo-4, and pHi was monitored using carboxy-SNARF-1. Fig. 1, A–C, shows a typical experimental result. During the experimental procedure the membrane potential was stepped from −100 mV (100 ms) to +100 mV (125 ms); see the Fig. 1 inset. At +100 mV there is net transport of Ca2+ into the cell by NCX. In addition, there was some Ca2+ leak into the cell through other pathways (e.g. Ca2+ channels); this is particularly true at −100 mV. Together, NCX and the other Ca2+ leak pathways led to an elevation of [Ca2+]i. The time-dependent, voltage-sensitive current Im shows background (leak) current and INCX. ICa, IK, and other currents were blocked pharmacologically (see “Materials and Methods”). INCX is the Ca2+-activated membrane current measured when all other currents are blocked. The gradual increase in Im that was observed before NH4Cl application reflects the change in [Ca2+]i during the procedure (Fig. 1B, left). After the wash-off of NH4Cl (see gap between the left panel and right panel in Fig. 1, A–C), the acidification of the cytosol was clear (Fig. 1C, right panel). The increase in [Ca2+]i was also significant as shown in Fig. 1B, right panel. Despite the increase in [Ca2+]i, INCX is less than before the application of NH4Cl. Although the full range of the allosteric effect of acidification on INCX can be seen in Fig. 3, in Fig. 1 we see that at acidic pHi NCX can still be activated by elevated [Ca2+]i (see the beginning of each of the top panels). In addition, Fig. 1 shows that these effects are not simply time-dependent artifacts but instead require an elevation of [Ca2+]i. The observation that acidification inhibits INCX is not new (21Doering A.E. Lederer W.J. J. Physiol. 1993; 466: 481-499PubMed Google Scholar, 22Doering A.E. Lederer W.J. J.

Here, we establish this phenomenon in the intact cellular system. Although the data are clear, several important technical issues deserve comment. First, the Kd of fluo-4 for Ca2+ is sensitive to pH and should be higher as the cells becomes more acidic. This means that as pHi becomes more acidic, an elevation of [Ca2+]i would be needed to keep fluo-4 fluorescence unchanged. This underscores the significant increase in [Ca2+]i observed in Fig. 1B (pHi of about 6.8) compared with that measured in Fig. 1A (pHi of 7.2). The base-line fluo-4 emission level at the lower pHi was higher by a factor of 2.14 ± 0.14 compared with control pHi (p < 0.01, 17 measurements at control pH and 24 measurements at acidic pHi, n = 6 cells). Second, typically the pHi of cells that are patched in a whole-cell configuration is tightly stabilized by proton-buffering agents (such as HEPES), which were included in the internal pipette solution in these experiments but at a lower level (HEPES was 1 mm). Thus a significant and sustained decrease of pHi after perfusion with 40 mm NH4Cl was achieved because of the low HEPES concentration and the addition of an Na+/H+ exchanger-1 inhibitor in the extracellular recording solution (for more details see supplemental Fig. 2). In 6 of 14 cells it was possible to perform acid loading procedure and to proceed to experiments at lower pHi. The control experiments were performed at a starting pHi of 7.23 ± 0.03 (n = 6 cells). During the superfusion with 40 mm NH4Cl, pHi increased (became more basic) until reaching a maximal plateau of 7.51 ± 0.03 (n = 6 cells, p < 0.001). The experiments reported here (acidic conditions) were done during the acidic plateau observed during the NH4Cl-free superfusion where the pHi was measured at 6.87 ± 0.05 (n = 6 cells, p < 0.001 versus control). The acid loading procedure performed here resulted in consistent pHi reduction with minor pHi deviation between independent experiments; therefore, these experiments were pooled together to form one group referred to as pHi = 6.87. To provide more quantitative examination of the INCX and its [Ca2+]i and [H+]i dependences, experiments were performed using the same voltage protocol described for Fig. 1 with the addition of calibrated [Ca2+]i values. Fig. 2A shows a typical experiment that reports the time course of the changes in membrane current (Fig. 1A) as a function of [Ca2+]i. With repeated depolarizations to +100 mV there was a slow net Ca2+ influx that accumulated with time, leading to an elevation of [Ca2+]i (see Fig. 2B). The increase in [Ca2+]i activates the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and leads to a gradual enhancement of Im as shown in the raw current traces (Fig. 2A). The voltage-dependent leak current was subtracted from the raw current to produce the INCX (see “Materials and Methods”) shown in Fig. 2C. The outward INCX is shown with a sigmoidal curve fitted to the experimental data (K0.5 = 257.5 ± 4.8 nm; nH = 7.70 ± 0.89). The net inward INCX is shown on the bottom portion of Fig. 2C and is largely similar to the inverse of the outward data (also see supplemental Fig. 3S). Fig. 2D shows the average K0.5 of 348.2 ± 20.6 nm and an average nH value of 8.57 ± 1.04 from cells (pHi = 7.2) that displayed a clear saturation of activation (n = 9 of14 cells). The remarkably large Hill coefficient (nH) of >8 suggests that the [Ca2+]i dependence of INCX may be due to a allosteric effect of Ca2+ on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, a suggestion supported by diverse experiments (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 5Bers D.M. Ginsburg K.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1099: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Direct investigation of such a hypothesis depends on the identification and “fingerprinting” of an appropriate Ca2+ binding site(s). Central to our investigation, however, is the observed pHi dependence of INCX. INCX was measured over a range of [Ca2+]i at different [H+]i levels. Using the NH4Cl rebound method (see supplemental Fig. 2), intracellular acidification was produced. Fig. 3A shows the magnitude of INCX, and Fig. 3B shows the results obtained in these experiments normalized to the maximal INCX. In Fig. 3B data obtained at pHi 7.2 is shown as blue and black open circles, whereas pHi = 6.87 is shown with red open circles. There is a clear difference in the Ca2+ sensitivity of INCX at pHi = 7.2 with a K0.5 = 310 ± 5.4 nm (n = 14 cells), roughly 3-fold less than the K0.5 at pHi = 6.87 (1042.8 ± 15.0 nm, n = 6 cells). The decreased sensitivity of INCX in an acidic environment is consistent with diverse clinical observation (see “Discussion”). Importantly, the maximum INCX observed at pHi = 7.2 and at pHi = 6.87 was found to be similar, albeit at different [Ca2+]i levels. Nevertheless this finding shown in Fig. 3A supports the normalization of data used in Fig. 3B to compare the [Ca2+]i dependence of INCX at different pHi levels. Note also that after the normalization of the data, the Hill coefficients were also indistinguishable (8 ± 0.67 in control versus 8 ± 0.78 at pHi of 6.87). If the Ca2+ sensitivity of INCX depends significantly on an allosteric effect, there may be Ca2+ binding sites that play a central role in this process. Furthermore, the pHi sensitivity of the Ca2+ dependence of INCX may also have a parallel in Ca2+ binding. Two obvious candidates are the recently described Ca2+ binding domains CBD1 and CBD2. CBD1 and CBD2 were identified by Hilge et al. (7Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Mol.

If Ca2+ binds to NCX to provide allosteric regulation of its behavior and if this affect of Ca2+ binding is pH-dependent (as it appears from our data), then the Ca2+ binding itself may also depend on [H+]i.

https://openalex.org/W2031511515,"Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of aggressive pediatric malignancies driven by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor up-regulating specific target genes, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 and Y5 receptors (Y5Rs). Previously, we have shown that both exogenous NPY and endogenous NPY stimulate ESFT cell death via its Y1 and Y5Rs. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is prevented by dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs), which cleave NPY to its shorter form, NPY3–36, not active at Y1Rs. We have shown that NPY-induced cell death can be abolished by overexpression of DPPs and enhanced by their down-regulation. Both NPY treatment and DPP blockade activated the same cell death pathway mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Moreover, the decrease in cell survival induced by DPP inhibition was blocked by Y1 and Y5R antagonists, confirming its dependence on endogenous NPY. Interestingly, similar levels of NPY-driven cell death were achieved by blocking membrane DPPIV and cytosolic DPP8 and DPP9. Thus, this is the first evidence of these intracellular DPPs cleaving releasable peptides, such as NPY, in live cells. In contrast, another membrane DPP, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), did not affect NPY actions. In conclusion, DPPs act as survival factors for ESFT cells and protect them from cell death induced by endogenous NPY.

https://openalex.org/W1969804608,"Here, we report that the natural compound pentachloropseudilin (PClP) acts as a reversible and allosteric inhibitor of myosin ATPase and motor activity. IC(50) values are in the range from 1 to 5 μm for mammalian class-1 myosins and greater than 90 μm for class-2 and class-5 myosins, and no inhibition was observed with class-6 and class-7 myosins. We show that in mammalian cells, PClP selectively inhibits myosin-1c function. To elucidate the structural basis for PClP-induced allosteric coupling and isoform-specific differences in the inhibitory potency of the compound, we used a multifaceted approach combining direct functional, crystallographic, and in silico modeling studies. Our results indicate that allosteric inhibition by PClP is mediated by the combined effects of global changes in protein dynamics and direct communication between the catalytic and allosteric sites via a cascade of small conformational changes along a conserved communication pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2067393680,"The giant cadherin FAT1 is one of four vertebrate orthologues of the Drosophila tumor suppressor fat. It engages in several functions, including cell polarity and migration, and in Hippo signaling during development. Homozygous deletions in oral cancer suggest that FAT1 may play a tumor suppressor role, although overexpression of FAT1 has been reported in some other cancers. Here we show using Northern blotting that human melanoma cell lines variably but universally express FAT1 and less commonly FAT2, FAT3, and FAT4. Both normal melanocytes and keratinocytes also express comparable FAT1 mRNA relative to melanoma cells. Analysis of the protein processing of FAT1 in keratinocytes revealed that, like Drosophila FAT, human FAT1 is cleaved into a non-covalent heterodimer before achieving cell surface expression. The use of inhibitors also established that such cleavage requires the proprotein convertase furin. However, in melanoma cells, the non-cleaved proform of FAT1 is also expressed at the cell surface together with the furin-cleaved heterodimer. Moreover, furin-independent processing generates a potentially functional proteolytic product in melanoma cells, a persistent 65-kDa membrane-bound cytoplasmic fragment no longer in association with the extracellular fragment. In vitro localization studies of FAT1 showed that melanoma cells display high levels of cytosolic FAT1 protein, whereas keratinocytes, despite comparable FAT1 expression levels, exhibited mainly cell-cell junctional staining. Such differences in protein distribution appear to reconcile with the different protein products generated by dual FAT1 processing. We suggest that the uncleaved FAT1 could promote altered signaling, and the novel products of alternate processing provide a dominant negative function in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2149707780,"The ubiquitous enzyme carbonic anhydrase isoform II (CAII) has been shown to enhance transport activity of the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 in a non-catalytic manner. In this study, we investigated the role of cytosolic CAII and of the extracellular, membrane-bound CA isoform IV (CAIV) on the lactate transport activity of the high-affinity monocarboxylate transporter MCT2, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to MCT1 and MCT4, transport activity of MCT2 was not altered by CAII. However, coexpression of CAIV with MCT2 resulted in a significant increase in MCT2 transport activity when the transporter was coexpressed with its associated ancillary protein GP70 (embigin). The CAIV-mediated augmentation of MCT2 activity was independent of the catalytic activity of the enzyme, as application of the CA-inhibitor ethoxyzolamide or coexpressing the catalytically inactive mutant CAIV-V165Y did not suppress CAIV-mediated augmentation of MCT2 transport activity. Furthermore, exchange of His-88, mediating an intramolecular H(+)-shuttle in CAIV, to alanine resulted only in a slight decrease in CAIV-mediated augmentation of MCT2 activity. The data suggest that extracellular membrane-bound CAIV, but not cytosolic CAII, augments transport activity of MCT2 in a non-catalytic manner, possibly by facilitating a proton pathway other than His-88."
https://openalex.org/W2165246446,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor, plays a key role in the pluripotency of stem cells. We sought to determine the function of KLF4 in T-cell development and differentiation by using T-cell-specific Klf4-knockout (KO) mice. We found that KLF4 was highly expressed in thymocytes and mature T cells and was rapidly down-regulated in mature T cells after activation. In Klf4-KO mice, we observed a modest reduction of thymocytes (27%) due to the reduced proliferation of double-negative (DN) thymocytes. We demonstrated that a direct repression of Cdkn1b by KLF4 was a cause of decreased DN proliferation. During in vitro T-cell differentiation, we observed significant reduction of IL-17-expressing CD4+ T cells (Th17; 24%) but not in other types of Th differentiation. The reduction of Th17 cells resulted in a significant attenuation of the severity (35%) of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in vivo in Klf4-KO mice as compared with the Klf4 wild-type littermates. Finally, we demonstrated that KLF4 directly binds to the promoter of Il17a and positively regulates its expression. In summary, these findings identify KLF4 as a critical regulator in T-cell development and Th17 differentiation.—An, J., Golech, S., Klaewsongkram, J., Zhang, Y., Subedi, K., Huston, G. E., Wood, W.

https://openalex.org/W2144355950,"It has long been suspected that chronic stress can exacerbate, or even cause, disease. We now propose that the RCAN1 gene, which can generate several RCAN1 protein isoforms, may be at least partially responsible for this phenomenon. We review data showing that RCAN1 proteins can be induced by multiple stresses, and present new data also implicating psychosocial/emotional stress in RCAN1 induction. We further show that transgenic mice overexpressing the RCAN1-1L protein exhibit accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (AT8 antibody), an early precursor to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration of the kind seen in Alzheimer disease. We propose that, although transient induction of the RCAN1 gene might protect cells against acute stress, persistent stress may cause chronic RCAN1 overexpression, resulting in serious side effects. Chronically elevated levels of RCAN1 proteins may promote or exacerbate various diseases, including tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease. We propose that the mechanism by which stress can lead to these diseases involves the inhibition of calcineurin and the induction of GSK-3β by RCAN1 proteins. Both inhibition of calcineurin and induction of GSK-3β contribute to accumulation of phosphorylated tau, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and eventual neurodegeneration.—Ermak, G., Pritchard, M.

https://openalex.org/W2166559041,"Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of septicemia and meningitis. The hypervirulent clonal complex 41/44 (cc41/44) has emerged as the predominant cause of serogroup B meningococcal disease, having been responsible for recent outbreaks and epidemics worldwide. However, the meningococcal factors that enable transition from asymptomatic carriage to rapidly progressing disease are poorly understood. Here we describe a novel phase-variable DNA methyltransferase, ModD, which was identified in the genome sequence of a New Zealand epidemic isolate. Investigation of the distribution of modD in the wider meningococcal population, by PCR and sequence analysis of genetically diverse N. meningitidis strains, revealed the presence of modD in 20/27 strains in cc41/44, but in only 2/47 strains from other clonal complexes, indicating a significant association of modD with cc41/44 (Fisher's exact P value=3 × 10−10). The modD gene contains 5'ACCGA-3' repeats that mediate phase variation, leading to reversible on/off switching of modD expression. Microarray analysis of modD-on/off variants revealed that ModD regulates expression of multiple genes involved in colonization, infection, and protection against host defenses, with increased catalase expression in the modD-on variant conferring increased resistance to oxidative stress. The modulation of gene expression via the ModD phase-variable regulon (phasevarion), and its significant association with the cc41/44, suggest a role in the fitness and/or pathogenesis of strains belonging to the cc41/44.—Seib, K.

https://openalex.org/W2143163950,"The early onsets of breast cancer metastasis involve cell retention, survival, and resistant to apoptosis and subsequent growth at target vascular beds and tissues in distant organs. We previously reported that angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), an angiogenic regulator stimulates MCF-7 breast tumor metastasis from their orthotopic sites to distant organs through the α(5)β(1) integrin/integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/Akt pathway. Here, by using an experimental tumor metastasis model and in vitro studies, we further dissect the underlying mechanism by which Ang2 promotes the initial growth and survival of MCF-7 breast cancer metastasis in the lung of animals. We show that Ang2 increases cell survival and suppresses cell apoptosis through ILK-induced phosphorylation of Akt1, Akt2, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 in breast cancer cells. Inhibition of ILK, Akt1, and Akt2, and their effector Bcl-2 diminishes Ang2-stimulated breast cancer cell survival and Ang2-attenuated apoptosis in vitro, and initial survival and growth of breast cancer metastasis in the lung of animals. Additionally, siRNA knockdown of endogenous Ang2 in three human metastatic breast cancer cell lines also inhibits phosphorylation of Akt, expression of Bcl-2, and tumor cell survival, migration, and increases cell apoptosis. Since increased expression of Ang2 correlates with elevated potential of human breast cancer metastasis in clinic, our data underscore the importance that up-regulated Ang2 not only stimulates breast cancer growth and metastasis at late stages of the process, but is also critical at the initiating stages of metastases onset, thereby suggesting Ang2 as a promising therapeutic target for treating patients with metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091806132,"The Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP), a consensus framework for coordinated action, aims to end malaria deaths by 2015 and eventually to eradicate malaria ( 1 ). The plan calls for universal access to effective antimalarial drugs and universal coverage with appropriate vector interventions. Strategic planning for how best to reach these goals has been left to individual countries, some of which have already made plans to eliminate malaria, i.e., to rid their countries of malaria parasites and to suppress transmission from imported malaria (travelers carrying malaria infections from one region into another) so that locally acquired cases are rare ( 2 ). Critics have argued that plans for national elimination distract attention and resources from the priority of reducing malaria's heavy burden in sub-Saharan Africa ( 3 ) and that a better strategy would be “control,” i.e., reducing malaria to a minor public health problem. These sides reflect the bipolar history of antimalaria efforts. When funding collapsed for a previous attempt to eradicate malaria, control defined the malaria agenda through decades of neglect. Control and elimination are often presented as opposite sides of a debate over how to allocate billions of dollars allocated globally for malaria aid. But a recent study in Zanzibar ( 4 ) concluded the dichotomy was false. A more urgent problem is continuity. How can enthusiasm for funding malaria be sustained?"
https://openalex.org/W2170636329,"The vascular endothelium responds to damage through activation of multiple signaling events that restore cell-cell adhesion and vascular integrity. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate these events are not clearly defined. Herein, we identify a previously unexpected role for adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) repair. PMVECs selectively express the AMPKα1 catalytic subunit, pharmacological and short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of which attenuates Ca(2+) entry in these cells induced by the inflammatory Ca(2+)-signaling mimetic thapsigargin. We find that AMPKα1 activity is required for the formation of PMVEC cell-cell networks in a prorepair environment and for monolayer resealing after wounding. Decreasing AMPKα1 expression reduces barrier resistance in PMVEC monolayers, results consistent with a role for AMPKα1 in cell-cell adhesion. AMPKα1 colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with the adherens junction protein N-cadherin and cofractionates with proteins selectively expressed in caveolar membranes. Assessment of permeability, by measuring the filtration coefficient (K(f)) in isolated perfused lungs, confirmed that AMPK activation contributes to barrier repair in vivo. Our findings thus provide novel evidence for AMPKα1 in Ca(2+) influx-mediated signaling and wound repair in the endothelium."

Targeted therapies employing ectodomain-specific p185(her2/neu) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated clinical efficacy for breast cancer. Our previous studies have shown that p185(her2/neu) mAbs are able to disable the kinase activity of homomeric and heteromeric kinase complexes and induce the conversion of the malignant to normal phenotype. We previously developed a chimeric antibody chA21 that specifically inhibits the growth of p185(her2/neu)-overexpressing cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the single-chain Fv of chA21 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of p185(her2/neu), which reveals that chA21 binds a region opposite to the dimerization interface, indicating that chA21 does not directly disrupt the dimerization. In contrast, the bivalent chA21 leads to internalization and down-regulation of p185(her2/neu). We propose a structure-based model in which chA21 cross-links two p185(her2/neu) molecules on separate homo- or heterodimers to form a large oligomer in the cell membrane. This model reveals a mechanism for mAbs to drive the receptors into the internalization/degradation path from the inactive hypophosphorylated tetramers formed dynamically by active dimers during a ""physiologic process."""

Although pivotal for such processes, the effect of this biomechanical force on venous remodeling has not yet been delineated. To this end, we raised the filling pressure in veins of the mouse auricle, which led to a 2.5-fold enlargement of these blood vessels within 4 d along with an increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression and gelatinase activity. These changes were likewise observed in tissue samples of human varicose veins. Topical treatment of the auricles with a decoy oligonucleotide-neutralizing activator protein 1 (AP-1) inhibited these effects. Likewise, proliferation, MMP-2 expression, and gelatinase activity in both native and cultured venous smooth muscle cells exposed to enhanced stretch was decreased by up to 80% through inhibiting AP-1. In contrast, mutant control oligonucleotides had no effect on smooth muscle cell activation. These findings indicate that an increase in venous filling pressure and thus CWT is sufficient to activate AP-1, which, in turn, triggers varicose remodeling through fuelling MMP-2 activity and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in the venous vessel wall."

Using siRNA and dominant negative approaches we demonstrate here that generalized disruption of the host SNARE machinery results in a significant reduction in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and equine infectious anemia virus particle production. Further analysis of the mechanism involved revealed a defect at the level of HIV-1 Gag localization to the plasma membrane.

Although this gain-of-function mechanism is likely responsible for development of FSGS in patients with mutations in the actin-binding region of α-actinin-4, two lines of evidence suggesting that there are probably other mechanisms. First, genetic analyses of human patients with FSGS have identified a number of α-actinin-4 mutations outside of the actin-binding region (18Weins A. Kenlan P. Herbert S. Le T.C. Villegas I. Kaplan B.S. Appel G.B. Pollak M.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting that alterations of other α-actinin-4 interactions could also be involved in the development of human glomerulopathies. Second, loss of α-actinin-4 in a mouse model causes defects in podocytes, proteinuria, and glomerular failure (17Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E.

It was not known, however, whether loss of α-actinin-4 protein or activity occurs in human glomerulopathies.In this study, we report that deficiencies of α-actinin-4 and CLP36, an α-actinin-4-binding protein (27Bauer K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11100-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), occur in multiple human glomerulopathies. Furthermore, we show that the formation of an α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex is crucial for maintenance of a proper level of CLP36 in podocytes. Additionally, we demonstrate that two mutations in α-actinin-4 (R310Q and Q348R) found in human FSGS patients inhibit the complex formation between α-actinin-4 and CLP36. Finally, using molecular approaches, we show that depletion of CLP36 or disruption of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex impedes RhoA signaling and traction force generation in podocytes. Collectively, these studies suggest an important role of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex in podocytes and provide an explanation as to how α-actinin-4 deficiency or mutations that inhibit CLP36-binding could contribute to podocyte defects in human glomerular diseases.DISCUSSIONRecent human genetic studies have identified a number of genetic alterations that are associated with glomerular diseases. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which genetic alterations cause defects in glomeruli is important for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of glomerular failure, the leading cause of end stage kidney disease. Of note, many genetic alterations associated with glomerular failure appear to impede the integrity of podocyte cytoskeleton, manifesting important roles of podocyte cytoskeleton for glomerular filtration barrier function. One of the well recognized targets of genetic mutations that impede glomerular podocyte functions is ACTN4. Although a subset of the disease-associated α-actinin-4 mutations (e.g. K255E) can cause podocyte damage through a gain-of-function mechanism (16Kaplan J.M. Kim S.H. North K.N. Rennke H. Correia L.A.

Cytoskeleton. 2009; 66: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there is evidence from studies in mouse models suggesting that loss of α-actinin-4 can also impair podocyte structure and consequently cause failure of glomerular filtration barrier (17Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E. Pollak M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whether or not α-actinin-4 deficiency actually occurs in human patients was not clear. The findings obtained from this study demonstrate that the level of α-actinin-4 is reduced in several (albeit not all) primary glomerulopathies, including minimal change glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, and FSGS (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, in FSGS the extent of the reduction in α-actinin-4 closely correlates with the severity of proteinuria (Fig. 1C). Thus, in at least a subset of human glomerulopathies, α-actinin-4 deficiency likely contributes to the failure of glomerular filtration barrier.A second major finding of our studies is that concomitant to the reduction of α-actinin-4 in human glomerulopathies, the level of CLP36 is also reduced (Fig. 1, B and D). This finding raised two important questions. First, is there a mechanistic link between the level of CLP36 and that of α-actinin-4? Second, what is the functional significance of the reduction of the CLP36 level? To address these questions, we have performed a series of experiments using multiple approaches including RNA interference and dominant negative inhibition of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex. The results show that there is indeed a mechanistic link between the level of CLP36 and that of α-actinin-4. Specifically, we have found that the level of CLP36 is controlled by the complex formation between α-actinin-4 and CLP36 because depletion of α-actinin-4 (Fig. 3) or disruption of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex (Fig. 4) substantially reduced the level of CLP36 in podocytes. Functionally, we have found that loss of CLP36 or disruption of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex significantly impairs RhoA signaling and traction force generation in podocytes (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Thus, CLP36 is important for maintenance of the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and generation of traction force, which are likely critical for glomerular filtration barrier function (10Faul C.

It was not clear how these mutations can contribute to defects in podocytes. The studies presented in this paper demonstrate that R310Q or Q348R mutation inhibits the interaction of α-actinin-4 with CLP36 (Fig. 5). This finding, together with our findings that (i) inhibition of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 interaction reduces the level of CLP36 and (ii) reduction of the level of CLP36 compromises RhoA signaling and generation of traction force in podocytes provide a plausible “loss-of-function” mechanism through which the α-actinin-4 mutations (or α-actinin-4 deficiency) could contribute to podocyte defects and glomerular failure in human patients.

Although this gain-of-function mechanism is likely responsible for development of FSGS in patients with mutations in the actin-binding region of α-actinin-4, two lines of evidence suggesting that there are probably other mechanisms. First, genetic analyses of human patients with FSGS have identified a number of α-actinin-4 mutations outside of the actin-binding region (18Weins A. Kenlan P. Herbert S. Le T.C. Villegas I. Kaplan B.S. Appel G.B. Pollak M.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting that alterations of other α-actinin-4 interactions could also be involved in the development of human glomerulopathies. Second, loss of α-actinin-4 in a mouse model causes defects in podocytes, proteinuria, and glomerular failure (17Kos C.H. Le T.C. Sinha S. Henderson J.M. Kim S.H. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. Gerszten R.E.

It was not known, however, whether loss of α-actinin-4 protein or activity occurs in human glomerulopathies.In this study, we report that deficiencies of α-actinin-4 and CLP36, an α-actinin-4-binding protein (27Bauer K.

Furthermore, we show that the formation of an α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex is crucial for maintenance of a proper level of CLP36 in podocytes. Additionally, we demonstrate that two mutations in α-actinin-4 (R310Q and Q348R) found in human FSGS patients inhibit the complex formation between α-actinin-4 and CLP36. Finally, using molecular approaches, we show that depletion of CLP36 or disruption of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex impedes RhoA signaling and traction force generation in podocytes. Collectively, these studies suggest an important role of the α-actinin-4-CLP36 complex in podocytes and provide an explanation as to how α-actinin-4 deficiency or mutations that inhibit CLP36-binding could contribute to podocyte defects in human glomerular diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2040498594,"The biological activities of NGF and of its precursor proNGF are quite distinct, due to different receptor binding profiles, but little is known about how proNGF regulates gene expression. Whether proNGF is a purely pro-apoptotic molecule and/or simply a ""less potent NGF"" is still a matter of debate. We performed experiments to address this question, by verifying whether a proNGF specific transcriptional signature, distinct from that of NGF, could be identified. To this aim, we studied gene expression regulation by proNGF and NGF in PC12 cells incubated for 1 and 4 hours with recombinant NGF and proNGF, in its wild-type or in a furin-cleavage resistant form. mRNA expression profiles were analyzed by whole genome microarrays at early time points, in order to identify specific profiles of NGF and proNGF. Clear differences between the mRNA profiles modulated by the three neurotrophin forms were identified. NGF and proNGF modulate remarkably distinct mRNA expression patterns, with the gene expression profile regulated by NGF being significantly more complex than that by proNGF, both in terms of the total number of differentially expressed mRNAs and of the gene families involved. Moreover, while the total number of genes modulated by NGF increases dramatically with time, that by proNGFs is unchanged or reduced. We identified a subset of regulated genes that could be ascribed to a ""pure proNGF"" signalling, distinct from the ""pure NGF"" one. We also conclude that the composition of mixed NGF and proNGF samples, when the two proteins coexist, influences the profile of gene expression. Based on this comparison of the gene expression profiles regulated by NGF and its proNGF precursor, we conclude that the two proteins activate largely distinct transcriptional programs and that the ratio of NGF to proNGF in vivo can profoundly influence the pattern of regulated mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2086151486,"Two Drosophila myosin II point mutations (D45 and Mhc5) generate Drosophila cardiac phenotypes that are similar to dilated or restrictive human cardiomyopathies. Our homology models suggest that the mutations (A261T in D45, G200D in Mhc5) could stabilize (D45) or destabilize (Mhc5) loop 1 of myosin, a region known to influence ADP release. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism that causes the cardiomyopathic phenotypes to develop, we determined whether the kinetic properties of the mutant molecules have been altered. We used myosin subfragment 1 (S1) carrying either of the two mutations (S1A261T and S1G200D) from the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila. The kinetic data show that the two point mutations have an opposite effect on the enzymatic activity of S1. S1A261T is less active (reduced ATPase, higher ADP affinity for S1 and actomyosin subfragment 1 (actin·S1), and reduced ATP-induced dissociation of actin·S1), whereas S1G200D shows increased enzymatic activity (enhanced ATPase, reduced ADP affinity for both S1 and actin·S1). The opposite changes in the myosin properties are consistent with the induced cardiac phenotypes for S1A261T (dilated) and S1G200D (restrictive). Our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause different cardiomyopathy phenotypes for these mutants. In addition, we report that S1A261T weakens the affinity of S1·ADP for actin, whereas S1G200D increases it. This may account for the suppression (A261T) or enhancement (G200D) of the skeletal muscle hypercontraction phenotype induced by the troponin I held-up2 mutation in Drosophila.

This may account for the suppression (A261T) or enhancement (G200D) of the skeletal muscle hypercontraction phenotype induced by the troponin I held-up2 mutation in Drosophila. Myosins are a large family of actin-based molecular motor proteins, of which at least 35 different classes are known (1Odronitz F. Kollmar M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R196Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). They show a wide variety of different mechanical activities, such as muscle contraction, phagocytosis, cell motility, tension maintenance, and vesicle transport (2O'Connell C.B. Tyska M.J. Mooseker M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 615-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Striated muscle myosin is a class II molecular motor and consists of two myosin heavy chains (MHC), two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains. Muscle contraction results from cyclic interactions between myosin II motors and actin filaments, also known as the cross-bridge cycle. These force-generating interactions are driven by the hydrolysis of ATP at the myosin active site (3Geeves M.A. Fedorov R. Manstein D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1462-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutations in human myosin II domains have been associated with both skeletal and cardiac myopathies (4Seidman J.G. Seidman C.

A recent study of myosin heavy chain mutations in Drosophila has shown that two mutations in the myosin motor domain generate defects in the Drosophila heart. The mutation known as D45 4The two mutants used throughout this study are: Mhc5, which indicates the myosin heavy chain mutation G200D; and D45, which indicates the myosin heavy chain mutation A261T.

The two myosin mutations identified are localized in the transducer region (Fig. 1), which is encoded by constitutive exons of the alternatively spliced Mhc transcript. D45 (A261T) is located on one of the β-strands (β7) close to the β-bulge between β6 and β7, whereas Mhc5 (G200D) is at the N-terminal side of loop 1 (using chicken skeletal myosin residue numbers as introduced by Kronert et al. (8Kronert W.A. Acebes A. Ferrús A. Bernstein S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); the analogous Drosophila residues are Gly200 and Ala258). The transducer region is thought to integrate the structural changes from different parts of the motor domain and includes the seven-stranded β-sheet plus various flexible elements such as loop 1, the β-bulge between β6 and β7, the HO-linker, and the nucleotide-sensing elements such as the phosphate binding loop (P-loop), switch-1, and switch-2 (11Coureux P.D. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The seven-stranded β-sheet becomes distorted when myosin switches between the rigor-like and post-rigor states, and this distortion is facilitated by the flexible elements. dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy myosin subfragment 1 actomyosin subfragment 1 caged ATP caged ADP 3′-O-{N-[2-(7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxamido)ethyl]carbamoyl}-ATP 3′-O-{N-[2-(7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxamido)ethyl]carbamoyl}-ADP indirect flight muscle isoform indirect flight muscle troponin troponin I embryonic myosin S1. In an earlier study, D45 and Mhc5 were shown to interact with a mutation in troponin I (held-up2 (hdp2)) that causes hypercontractility of the indirect flight muscle (IFM) (8Kronert W.A. Acebes A. Ferrús A. Bernstein S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). D45 is a suppressor of the TnI mutation (A116V) in the IFM, and in Drosophila hearts, it leads to a DCM-like phenotype in the presence of normal troponin I, whereas Mhc5 leads to RCM in the heart and is lethal in combination with hdp2. This suggests the likelihood of opposite effects of the two myosin mutations in regard to TnI interaction and that such differential activity may lead to the observed alternative cardiomyopathies. Although a large number of human cardiomyopathies have been linked with specific mutations in sarcomeric proteins, including myosins, the causal relationship is not well understood. For mutations in the thin filament proteins tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn), there is an emerging paradigm that mutations that increase calcium sensitivity of the thin filament regulation of contraction result in HCM, whereas a decrease in calcium sensitivity is associated with DCM (9Robinson P. Griffiths P.J. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Dweck D. Hus N. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33119-33128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the held-up2 TnI mutation leads to over-contraction, the myosin mutation may reduce calcium sensitivity (D45) to compensate for the TnI mutation or increase it further (Mhc5) to cause lethality. Indeed, Drosophila D45 myosin has reduced ATPase activity and reduced in vitro motility, whereas Mhc5 myosin displays an increase in both ATPase activity and in vitro motility (7Cammarato A. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Kronert W.A. Bodmer R. Ocorr K. Bernstein S.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was argued that this is consistent with D45 suppressing the TnI mutation and Mhc5 enhancing it. However, the molecular mechanism for this interaction remains to be explored. In this study, we used myosin subfragment 1 (S1) to investigate the transient and steady-state kinetics of the two transducer mutants of myosin S1 that suppress (A261T) or enhance (G200D) the TnI defect (A116V). We will use S1A261T and S1G200D nomenclature for the two mutants throughout this study, and the properties and nomenclature of these mutants are summarized in Table 1. The kinetic data show that the two point mutations have an opposite effect on the enzymatic activity of S1 myosin as compared with wild type, resulting in a less active myosin (S1A261T) or more active myosin (S1G200D). These observations are consistent with the induced cardiac phenotypes for the two mutants. In addition, we report that the two mutations change the affinity of S1·ADP for actin in opposite directions and that these changes can account for the differential interaction of the two mutations with the TnI held-up2 mutation in Drosophila.TABLE 1Overview of the two Drosophila myosin transducer mutantsMhc5D45Point mutationG200DA261TLocation in transducerLoop 1β7Interaction with flightless TnI (A116V) held-up2 alleleLethalRescuedDrosophila cardiac phenotypeRCMDCM Open table in a new tab Myosin was isolated from IFM of less than 1-day-old wild-type and D45(A261T) or Mhc5(G200D) mutant flies as described previously (12Swank D.M.

The final myosin pellet obtained after centrifugation was resuspended in digestion buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm DTT). Samples were incubated on ice for ∼6 min. The myosin solution was then placed in a 20 °C water bath for 5 min for temperature equilibration. The addition of α-chymotrypsin (0.2 mg/ml final concentration from 10 mg/ml stock solution) to the myosin solution was carried out in the 20 °C water bath followed by incubation for 6 min. To quench the reaction, 1.5 mm (final concentration) of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added. To pellet undigested myosin or myosin rod, the sample was immediately centrifuged at 68,000 rpm (250,000 × g, TLA 100.3 rotor) for 30 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was removed and diluted 10-fold with low salt buffer (30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm DTT) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Any remaining uncut myosin or rod contamination was eliminated by centrifugation at 68,000 rpm for 20 min. For S1 concentration, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a Sorvall MC 12 V at 4 °C using a Millipore Ultrafree 0.5-μm centrifugal Biomax-5 filter with a 5-kDa cutoff. The final volume of the supernatant was 40–60 μl. S1 concentration was determined from A280 (= 0.75 cm−1 for 1 mg of S1 per ml) and a molecular mass of 115 kDa. A single band of S1 was detected on SDS polyacrylamide gels for all samples. All steady-state kinetic measurements were performed with freshly prepared S1, and transient kinetics experiments were performed within 1 week after S1 preparation. G-actin was isolated from acetone powder of chicken skeletal muscle as described previously (1Odronitz F. Kollmar M.

After multiple cycles of polymerization-depolymerization, soluble G-actin was obtained after dialysis against 2 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 0.2 mm ATP, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT and quantified spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm− (A310 nm–A290 nm) for 1 mg of actin ml−1. To obtain a G-actin solution of 150–250 μm, the G-actin solution was concentrated using a Millipore Biomax-5 filter as described above. F-actin was prepared by adding 1 volume of 10× polymerization buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.5 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm ATP) to 9 volumes of G-actin. Actin was stored on ice at 4 °C and used within 1 month of preparation for actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase assays. ATPase activities were determined using [γ-32P]ATP as described previously in detail for full-length myosin (7Cammarato A. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Kronert W.A. Bodmer R. Ocorr K. Bernstein S.I.

Ca2+ ATPase was carried out as per full-length myosin, but basal Mg2+ and actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase procedures involved some modifications. Briefly, 2 μg of S1 were added to Mg-ATPase solution without KCl (10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP), in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of F-actin. After 30 min at room temperature (21–23 °C), the reaction was quenched using 1.8 n HClO4. Extraction and scintillation counting were carried out essentially as for full-length myosin (7Cammarato A.

Basal Mg2+-ATPase activities obtained in the absence of actin were subtracted from all data points. Actin-activated Vmax and Km values for actin were obtained by fitting all data points from several preparations of wild-type or mutant S1 with the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot. Values were averaged to give mean ± S.D. Statistical differences of Ca2+ ATPase, Mg2+ ATPase, Vmax, and Km between wild-type and mutant S1 were carried out using Student's t tests. Caged ATP (cATP) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Coumarin-labeled ATP (3′-O-{N-[2-(7-diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxamido)ethyl]carbamoyl}-ATP, abbreviated to eda-deac-ATP) was a gift from Martin Webb (National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK) and was prepared for use in the transient kinetic studies according to methods described previously (16Webb M.R.

Due to the small amount of protein available and the relatively poor fluorescence signal changes observed with pyrene-labeled actin, flash photolysis was the method of choice to investigate the kinetic properties of the Drosophila myosin S1 proteins (18Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ATP-induced dissociation of the actin·S1 complex changes the light-scattering signal, and the dissociation of nucleotide from S1 was followed by fluorescence changes. All light-scattering experiments were conducted in a low salt buffer (pH 7.0: 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, and 10 mm DTT, 20 °C) with 1 μm actin, 1–3 μm S1, and 500 μm cATP. eda-deac-ADP dissociation experiments were also performed in this low salt buffer and contained 4 μm S1, 10 μm eda-deac-ATP (source of eda-deac-ADP), and 100 μm cATP (S1A261T) or caged ADP (cADP) (S1G200D). The following equation was derived from the interaction of actin and S1 with ATP and ADP shown in Scheme 1 and was used to determine KAD kobs=K1k+2([ATP]/(1+[ADP]/KAD))(Eq. 1) where kobs is the observed rate constant for the ATP-induced dissociation of actin·S1; K1k+2 is the second-order rate constant for ATP binding to actin·S1; and KAD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of ADP to actin·S1. The equation krel = kobs/k0 was used to determine the relative rate constant (krel) shown in Fig. 5, where k0 is the value when [ADP] = 0.FIGURE 5The affinity of ADP (KAD) for actin·S1. The dissociation of actin·S1 was induced by ATP in the presence of ADP ranging from 0 to 1200 μm. The light-scattering traces were fitted with single exponentials to determine the kobs. Hyperbolic plots of the krel (kobs/k0) versus ADP concentration were fitted with an equation derived from Scheme 1 (kobs = K1k+2([ATP]/(1 + [ADP]/KAD)) to determine KAD. The fits yielded a value of 293 ± 61 μm for S1A261T (▴) and 604 ± 157 μm for S1G200D (■) as compared with 409 ± 26 μm for wild-type IFI (○).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Co-sedimentation assays were done as described previously with some minor modifications (14Miller B.M.

S1 (100 nm) was incubated with increasing actin concentrations (0–500 nm) in low salt buffer (30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm DTT) with a total volume of 100 μl and then centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min at low temperature (4 °C) to determine KA. Measurements were repeated in the presence of 10 mm ADP with 500 nm S1 and increasing actin concentrations (0–5 μm) to determine KDA. The supernatant was separated from the pellet at each actin concentration, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of water. All samples were applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The density of each protein band was quantified and used to determine the affinity of S1 for actin as described previously (14Miller B.M. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. J. Biol.

Homology models of the wild-type indirect flight muscle isoform (IFI) and the two point mutants S1A261T and S1G200D were built as described using SWISS-MODEL (19Miller B.M. Bloemink M.J. Nyitrai M.

When aligning the IFI myosin head sequence with class II scallop myosin, the sequence identity is 60 ± 1%, enabling us to build well resolved homology models (20Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6037) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the various states of scallop myosin during the cross-bridge cycle were chosen to generate three-dimensional homology models of IFI, S1A261T, and S1G200D: the near-rigor state of myosin (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1sr6), the post-rigor actin-detached state (PDB code 1kk8) that contains ADP·BeFx, the pre-powerstroke state (PDB code 1qvi) that contains ADP·VO4, and a novel conformation that contains partially bound ADP·SO4 (PDB code 1s5g). For regions of insertions or deletions in the target-template alignment, SWISS-MODEL constructs an ensemble of fragments compatible with the neighboring stems using constraint space programming or a loop library (20Arnold K.

The basal and actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of wild-type myosin S1 and the two point mutants (S1A261T and S1G200D) were measured (Fig. 2), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The TnI hdp2 suppressor mutant S1A261T showed a more than 2-fold reduction in basal Mg2+-ATPase activity (0.04 s−1), a nearly 3-fold reduction in basal Ca2+-ATPase (1.97 s−1), and a 10-fold reduction in Vmax (0.23 s−1) as compared with wild type (0.09, 5.33, and 2.54 s−1, respectively) (difference significance at <0.001 in each case). In contrast, the hdp2 enhancer mutant S1G200D showed nearly a 2-fold increase in basal Mg2+-ATPase (0.14 s−1) and no significant change in basal Ca2+-ATPase or Vmax.TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters measured for wild-type, G200D and A261T Drosophila myosin S1Myosin S1Basal Ca-ATPaseBasal Mg-ATPaseVmaxKmVmax/Kms−1s−1s−1μmμm−1 s−1Wild-type IFI5.33 ± 0.620.09 ± 0.012.54 ± 0.295.77 ± 0.830.45 ± 0.09S1G200D(Mhc5)5.36 ± 0.270.14 ± 0.01ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.2.60 ± 0.183.79 ± 0.67bp < 0.01 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.0.70 ± 0.08bp < 0.01 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.S1A261T(D45)1.97 ± 0.46ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.0.04 ± 0.01ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.0.23 ± 0.04ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.2.15 ± 0.73ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.0.11 ± 0.02ap < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.a p < 0.001 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI.b p < 0.01 determined by Student's t test as compared with IFI. Open table in a new tab The earlier ATPase measurements for full-length myosin (7Cammarato A. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Kronert W.A. Bodmer R. Ocorr K. Bernstein S.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) cannot be compared directly with the S1 ATPases described here because the two assays use different salt concentrations and the filamentous two-headed full-length myosin has a different affinity for actin than the soluble S1. However, the relative effects of the mutations on the S1 and the full-length myosin basal Mg2+-ATPases and the Vmax are similar (full-length myosin basal Mg2+-ATPase, 0.2, 0.48, and 0.11 s−1, and Vmax of 1.8, 1.5, and 0.69 s−1 for wild type, G200D, and A261T, respectively). The Km for actin with the S1 constructs of either S1A261T (Km = 2.15 μm) or S1G200D (Km = 3.79 μm) showed a decrease relative to wild type (Km = 5.77 μm), which was not seen previously with full-length myosin. The ratio Vmax/Km, referred to as the catalytic efficiency, shows a significant (p < 0.01) increase for S1G200D (0.70 μm−1s−1) as compared with wild type (0.45 μm−1s−1), whereas for S1A261T, this ratio decreases 4-fold (0.11 μm−1s−1, significance p < 0.001). Using flash photolysis, the turnover number (kcat) was measured at a fixed actin concentration (2 μm) for the point mutants S1G200D and S1A261T and compared with wild type (Fig. 3). The catalytic activity of S1A261T (kcat = 0.064 s−1) is reduced as compared with wild type (0.172 s−1), whereas kcat of S1G200D (0.210 s−1) is increased. This demonstrates that the differences seen in the lower ionic strength ATPase assay above remain at the higher salt concentrations (30 mm KCl) used for the transient kinetic measurements. The second-order rate constant governing the dissociation of acto-S1 by ATP (K1k+2: see Scheme 1) was measured as described previously (14Miller B.M. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50293-50300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μm actin and 1–3 μm S1 were preincubated and then dissociated by ATP released from cATP. In the presence of apyrase, a single sample was subjected to a series of laser flashes decreasing in intensity to release varying concentrations of ATP. The rate of change in light scattering was recorded for each laser flash and could be well described by a single exponential at each ATP concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). The slope of a graph of kobs versus ATP concentration determines the apparent second-order rate constant K1k+2 for the dissociation of actin·S1 by ATP (Fig. 4C). As compared with the value for wild type (0.75 μm−1 s−1), S1A261T showed a reduced ATP-induced dissociation rate (0.47 μm−1s−1), whereas the rate measured for S1G200D (0.64 μm−1 s−1) was similar to wild type (Table 3).TABLE 3Transient kinetic parameters measured for wild-type, G200D and A261T Drosophila myosin S1Myosin S1K1k+2KADk−ADaData are estimated from KAD assuming an association rate constant of 107 m−1 s−1.k−DKDbData are estimated from k−D assuming an association rate constant of 106 m−1 s−1.KAD/KDKDAμm−1 s−1μms−1s−1μmnmWild-type IFI0.75 ± 0.08cData are from Miller et al.

Open table in a new tab The ADP affinity for S1 in the presence of actin, defined by the equilibrium dissociation constant KAD, was determined as described previously (14Miller B.M. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50293-50300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the presence of increasing concentrations of ADP, the ATP-induced dissociation of actin·S1 was measured using light scattering, and plotting the relative kobs (krel) versus ADP concentration allows the measurement of the ADP affinity KAD for actin·S1 (Fig. 5 and Scheme 1). The KAD of S1A261T (KAD = 293 μm) is reduced by almost 30% as compared with wild type (KAD = 409 μm), whereas for S1G200D, the KAD value is increased (KAD = 604 μm) (Fig. 5 and Table 3). Thus the ADP affinity of the two point mutants is affected in opposing ways with S1G200D having a weaker ADP affinity and S1A261T displaying a stronger ADP affinity as compared with wild type. To estimate the rate constant of ADP dissociation from S1 in the absence of actin, the change in fluorescence of coumarin-labeled ADP (eda-deac-ADP) was measured upon displacement of eda-deac-ADP by ATP binding to S1. It was shown previously that this coumarin-labeled analog has very similar kinetic properties as compared with ADP (17Webb M.R. Corrie J.E.T. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1562-1569Abstract"

Class I MHC molecules are crucially tasked with presenting repertoires of peptides at the cell surface for inspection by CD8+ T cells, thereby allowing the immune system to respond to degradation products of proteins that are indicative of exposure to infectious disease or cellular transformation. The rational design of vaccines and immunotherapeutics depends on the accurate identification and characterization of those peptide antigens capable of precipitating a robust immune response. Such efforts are confronted with both an overwhelming diversity of potentially immunogenic peptide sequences and the polymorphism of the MHC system whereby each allelic product has a distinct peptide-binding motif that dictates their interactions. This has led to the development of a myriad of assays to probe either the ability of peptide-MHC (pMHC) 4The abbreviations used are: pMHCpeptide-MHCβ2mβ2-microglobulinHLAhuman leukocyte antigensJ3-amino-3-(2-nitro)phenyl-propanoic acid residueMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBPacific BluePEphycoerythrin. molecules to stimulate a specific population of T cells or ascertain the specificity and affinity of the peptide for a particular MHC variant (1Provenzano M.

Here, we describe a novel method for the site-specific capture of arrays of MHC products on distinctly coded beads, thus creating artificial antigen-presenting surfaces that are compatible with flow cytometry analysis. Each bead set is a collection of beads with a range of distinct fluorescent intensities that can be combinatorially coded with additional dyes, thereby leveraging on the high content multiparametric analysis of flow cytometry. Using the encoded bead sets, the binding properties of MHC molecules can be determined for individual epitopes by measuring the stability of the complex through subunit-specific antibody staining as demonstrated for MHC variants of both human and murine origin. The exact contribution of amino acids within a T cell epitope to MHC binding and T cell recognition can be explored as exemplified here by alanine, arginine, and aspartic acid scan analysis. By employing fluorescently labeled peptide ligands, the assay can be also modified to accommodate peptide competition assays through which the affinity of particular ligands for their MHC counter structure can be precisely quantified, further showcasing the versatility of this technology.

Precoating of a 384-well flat bottom polystyrene microtitre plate (Corning) was accomplished with 50 μl of streptavidin (Invitrogen) at 2 μg ml−1 in PBS. Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (four times 100 μl) wash buffer, treated with 100 μl of blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS), and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 25 μl of UV-exchanged samples that were 25× diluted with blocking buffer were added in quadruplicate. The samples were incubated for 1 h on ice, washed with blocking buffer (4 × 100 μl), treated for 1 h with 25 μl of HRP-conjugated anti-β2m (1 μg/liter in blocking buffer) on ice, washed with blocking buffer (four times 100 μl), and developed for 10–15 min with 25 μl of ABTS-solution (Invitrogen), and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 12.5 μl of stop buffer (0.01% sodium azide in 0.1 m citric acid). Absorbance was subsequently measured at 415 nm using a spectrophotometer (Spectramax M2; Molecular Devices). Recombinant caged pMHC was diluted to 5 μm using filtered PBS, and the exchange peptides were diluted to 500 μm in Me2SO. In Eppendorf tubes, 12.5 μl of caged pMHC and 12.5 μl of the diluted peptides were mixed with 100 μl of filtered PBS. The tubes were placed on ice and subjected to irradiation for 15 min in a UV cross-linker (CL-1000, UVP) equipped with 365-nm UV amps. The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking, after which each sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Fluorescent particles kits Yellow (Spherotech SVFA-2552-6K and SVFB-2552-6K), Pink (Spherotech SVFA-2558-6K and SVFB-2558-6K), and Blue (Spherotech SVPAK-5067-5A and SVPAK-5067-5B) that are surface-coated with streptavidin were used to capture the pMHC. Thus, in a 96-well V-bottom plate (Corning), 20 μl of the fluorescent bead population of choice was washed with 200 μl of NaHCO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5) and pelleted by 5 min centrifuging at 800 × g. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were incubated with 100 μl of blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) for 30 min with shaking. Subsequently, 25 μl of a designated UV-irradiated pMHC sample was added to the well. Following 1 h of incubation with shaking, (a) the beads were washed with blocking buffer (3 × 200 μl) and 50 μl of Pacific Blue anti-human β2m (Biolegend 316310) at 0.5 μg ml−1 was added, followed by 20 min of shaking incubation, and subsequently, the beads were washed with blocking buffer (3 × 200 μl) and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, mixed, and transferred to FACS tubes for flow cytometry analysis; or alternatively, (b) unoccupied streptavidin binding sites were blocked by the addition of 50 μl of biotin (62.5 mm in PBS) followed by 15 min of shaking, after which beads could be mixed, washed, stained, fixed, and analyzed as described above. The immobilization of secondary colors onto streptavidin-coated fluorescent Yellow (Spherotech SVFA-2552-6K and SVFB-2552-6K) and Pink (Spherotech SVFA-2558-6K and SVFB-2558-6K) particle array kits employed a Live/Dead® fixable near-IR dead cell stain kit (L10119; Invitrogen), whereas Blue beads (SVPAK-5067-10K; Spherotech) were labeled with a Live/Dead® fixable green dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen L23101). The secondary dyes were dissolved in 50 μl of anhydrous Me2SO according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reconstituted dyes were aliquoted and stable for prolonged periods (>3 months) when stored at −80 °C. In a representative experiment, the Blue bead set was deposited in an 96-well V-bottom plate (Corning) preloaded with 200 μl of NaHCO3 buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5) in three rows of 10 populations (20 μl/independent well) and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. After removal of the supernatant, 100 μl of amine-reactive green fluorescent dye solutions that were diluted in NaHCO3 buffer in the ratios 1:80, 1:1280, and no dye (blank) were immediately added to the rows of fluorescent particles, thus furnishing 30 populations of two-dimensionally labeled high (one row), medium (one row), and low (one row) beads, respectively. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min with shaking. Subsequently, unbound secondary color was quenched by washing twice using 200 μl of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8), and a further 30 min of shaking incubation with 200 μl of Tris buffer, before pelleting the beads at 800 × g for 5 min. These particles with unique fluorescent signature were either directly taken up in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, mixed, and transferred to FACS tubes for flow cytometry analysis or used in the beads-based pMHC binding assay. Transduced CD8+ T cell lines specific for HBc18–27 were obtained as described earlier and cultured in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) with 2% pooled human AB serum supplemented with 100 units ml−1 of IL-2 for 10 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (18Gehring A.J. Xue S.A. Ho Z.Z. Teoh D. Ruedl C. Chia A. Koh S. Lim S.G. Maini M.K. Stauss H. Bertoletti A. J. Hepatol. 2011; 55: 103-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Short term T cell lines and control T cell lines that were not transduced with the HBc18–27-specific T cell receptor were washed with PBS. Cell viability staining was done using Live/Dead® fixable near-IR stain (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to tetramer staining. The cells were washed and stained with 1 μg of PE-conjugated A*0201 tetramers/50 μl of PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide on ice for 20 min. The cells were then stained with Pacific Blue anti-human CD8 (clone RPA-T8; BD Biosciences) for an additional 15 min, washed with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and transferred to FACS tubes for flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry data were analyzed off line with FlowJo Software (Tree Star). In the competition assays, which were determined in triplicate for the various peptides, the percentage inhibition of FITC-labeled parent peptide binding was calculated using the formula: (1 − (MFreference+competitor peptide − MFbackground) × (MFreference peptide − MFbackground)−1) × 100%. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad) was used for fitting the data to a four-parameter dose-response curve to derive the fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50). The concept of the MHC stability assay performed on fluorescently labeled beads employs caged MHCs that are loaded with conditional ligands (Fig. 1). After UV irradiation, the peptide fragments are believed to be liberated from the complex (5Toebes M. Coccoris M. Bins A. Rodenko B. Gomez R. Nieuwkoop N.J. van de Kasteele W. Rimmelzwaan G.F.

The uncaged complex can be rescued from degradation when UV-mediated cleavage is performed in the presence of a ligand capable of stabilizing the MHC molecule (Fig. 1, top row). On the other hand, peptide ligands that fail to stabilize the MHC will allow the disintegration of the complex followed by the dissociation of the noncovalently bound β2m subunit (Fig. 1, bottom row). Thus, probing the beads for the presence of β2m with fluorescently labeled antibodies is a measure of the ability of a ligand to stabilize the MHC. The site-specific immobilization of the MHC to the bead by streptavidin-biotin interaction is a strict requirement, because the indiscriminate conjugation of the complex by alternative chemistries could impede the release of the β2m subunit. As proof-of-principle, we employed the odd-numbered set of Pink beads whose increasing intensity of fluorescence could be readily distinguished in both the PE and PE-TR channels (supplemental Fig. S1). This provided a platform of six independent bead populations onto which we could capture and detect simultaneously the various MHC molecules. We exchanged HLA-A*02:01 holding the UV-light sensitive GILGFVFJL (where J denotes the 3-amino-3-(2-nitro)phenyl-propanoic acid (Anp) residue) with ligands P1, P2, and P3 (Table 1) and then loaded each exchange reaction onto an individual bead population. Bead populations presenting distinct pMHC combinations were mixed into a single tube and stained for β2m to monitor class I MHC stability. For controls, the soluble MHC molecules were either not exposed to UV irradiation (−UV), irradiated in the absence of peptide (+UV), or irradiated in the presence of noncanonical epitope P6. The four conditions in which HLA-A*02:01 was predicted to remain stabilized (i.e. the canonical epitopes and −UV, corresponding to peaks 1, 3, 7 and 11) show an approximate 7-fold increase in mean fluorescence in the PB channel for β2m (Fig. 2A), as compared with the negative controls (i.e. populations 5 and 9).TABLE 1Sequences of peptides usedSequenceRestriction elementSourceProteinPositionP1GILGFVFTLHLA-A*02:01Influenza A virusMatrix protein 158–66P2NLVPMVATVHLA-A*02:01Human cytomegalovirusLower matrix phosphoprotein pp65495–504P3FLPSDFFPSIHLA-A*02:01Hepatitis B virus (Genotype B)Core protein18–27P4SVLAFRRLH-2KbToxoplasma gondiiTgd05759–66P5SIYRYYGLH-2KbSynthetic superagonistSynthetic superagonistNAP6SIINFEKLH-2KbGallus gallusOvalbumin257–264P7SAVSNLFYVH-2DbChlamydia trachomatis (Serovar L2)Polymorphic outer membrane protein612–620P8ASNENMETMH-2DbInfluenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1))Nucleoprotein366–374P9ASFVNPIYLH-2DbChlamydia trachomatis (Serovar L2)Cysteine-rich membrane protein A63–71P10FLPSDFFPSVHLA-A*02:01Hepatitis B virus (Genotype D)Core Protein18–27P11AVFDRKSDAKHLA-A*11:01Human herpesvirus 4 (strain B95-8)Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 4399–408 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that this assay could be successfully used for a variety of MHC products, we turned our attention to the murine H-2Kb and the H-2Db gene products bound with the SV9-P7* ligand (8Grotenbreg G.M.

Biol. 2006; 356: 382-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), thus affording the possibility of employing the same anti-β2m antibodies for detection as used for HLA molecules. In fact, the xenogenic complex, consisting of human β2m and murine class I MHC heavy chains, has improved stability and peptide binding potential as compared with that of the syngenic complex. The increased stability imparted by human β2m was envisioned to improve the overall peptide binding capacity of the complex, thereby facilitating the detection of weakly binding ligands in the bead-based assay. In the case of H-2Kb, an approximate 10-fold increase in β2m staining was observed for the −UV control as well as with T cell epitopes P4, P5, and P6 that are known to stabilize H-2Kb (Fig. 2B; populations 1, 5, 9, and 11) when compared with populations 3 and 7, which were exposed to +UV and P8, respectively. For H-2Db, the dissociation of β2m was less apparent, with only a 5-fold mean fluorescence difference maximally attainable (Fig. 2C). For the +UV control, the complex could only be coaxed to loose stability using low pH (MES, pH 6) and elevated temperatures (50 °C). Thus, variable amounts of MHC, corresponding to the ability of particular epitopes to rescue UV-induced destabilization of conditional ligand-loaded MHC, could be detected on a single series of fluorescent beads. The assay functioned independently of the bead population chosen for detection (i.e. the odd numbered peaks 1–11) because the allocation of conditions ensured that each bead population stained both positive and negative for human β2m at least once over the three experiments combined (Fig. 2). Qualitatively, the bead-based assay generated data consistent with that from the established ELISA format for the range of epitopes, MHCs, and control conditions used (supplemental Fig. S2) (6Rodenko B. Toebes M. Hadrup S.R. van Esch W.J. Molenaar A.M. Schumacher T.N. Ovaa H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1120-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Hadrup S.R. Toebes M. Rodenko B. Bakker A.H. Egan D.A. Ovaa H. Schumacher T.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 524: 383-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We subsequently investigated whether every currently available set of streptavidin-coated beads of the colors Yellow, Pink and Blue, each with their separate range of fluorescence intensities, could be employed for the bead-based assay. For these collections, there was no particular single flow cytometry channel with the available instrument in which all three bead sets were simultaneously nonfluorescent to use one generically labeled antibody to probe for MHC stability (supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, the Blue and Pink beads proved to combine well with PB-conjugated anti-β2m, whereas PE could be used complementary to the Yellow beads. To limit the number of experimental variables, we focused on a single MHC and explored the exact binding parameters of an established HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell epitope, the decameric hepatitis B virus core 18–27 peptide (HBc18–27, FLPSDFFPSV, P10) by alanine scan (23Bertoletti A. Chisari F.V. Penna A. Guilhot S. Galati L. Missale G. Fowler P. Schlicht H.J. Vitiello A. Chesnut R.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2376-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bertoletti A. Sette A. Chisari F.V. Penna A. Levrero M. De Carli M. Fiaccadori F. Ferrari C. Nature. 1994; 369: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This entails sequential alanine point substitutions to the epitope to identify amino acid residues critical for either MHC binding or T cell responsiveness. In a single experiment using Yellow beads, binding of all 10 alanine variants to HLA-A*02:01 could be compared with the parent peptide (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that in the Qdot525 channel, where maximal resolution of the independent peaks could be accomplished for this bead set, peaks 2 and 3 were insufficiently separated, leaving 11 instead of 12 distinct populations. We further demonstrated that this type of systematic but conservative amino acid scan can be extended to the larger and positively charged arginine (Fig. 3B) on Pink beads or the negatively charged aspartic acid (Fig. 3C) on Blue beads, thereby increasing the rigor of the analysis of the contribution of specific residues to MHC binding. From these experiments, it follows that four positions (Phe18, Leu19, Phe24, and Val27) of the HBc18–27 epitope were significantly affected by the replacements, with Leu19 being most resistant to amino acid substitution regardless of the nature of the side chain. The C-terminal anchor position Val27 was averse to the introduction of charged residues, whereas the N-terminal anchor Phe18 and central Phe24 did not permit the introduction of an Asp or Arg residue, respectively, without negative consequences for peptide binding to HLA-A*02:01, as was expected (25Bertoletti A.

These data for the multiple amino acid-substituted variants of the P10 epitope generated with the bead-based assay again compared well with the data obtained from established ELISA protocols (supplemental Fig. S3) (6Rodenko B.

https://openalex.org/W2068750071,"HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) catalyzes a rate-limiting step in sterol biosynthesis and is a key control point in the feedback inhibition that regulates this pathway. Through the action of the membrane protein Insig, HMGR synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain sterol homeostasis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes homologs of HMGR and Insig called hmg1(+) and ins1(+), respectively. In contrast to the mammalian system, Ins1 regulates Hmg1 by a nondegradative mechanism involving phosphorylation of the Hmg1 active site. Here, we investigate the role of the Ins1-Hmg1 system in coupling glucose sensing to regulation of sterol biosynthesis. We show that Ins1-dependent Hmg1 phosphorylation is strongly induced in response to glucose withdrawal and that HMGR activity is correspondingly reduced. We also find that inability to activate Hmg1 phosphorylation under nutrient limiting conditions results in overaccumulation of sterol pathway intermediates. Furthermore, we show that regulation of Hmg1 phosphorylation requires the protein phosphatase 2A-related phosphatase Ppe1 and its regulator Sds23. These results describe a mechanism by which cells tune the rate of sterol synthesis to match nutrient availability."

While phage display has been used extensively in the cancer field to characterize high-affinity peptides recognizing tumor cells, its application in the stromal/stem cell arena has been limited (Brown, 2010Brown K.C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2010; 16: 1040-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Dr. Mikhail Kolonin, the senior author on this UT-Houston team effort, had prior expertise in the application of phage display methods to cancer biology and adipose tissue (referenced in Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C.

Using high-throughput screening of a combinatorial library, he had identified high-affinity peptides recognizing surface proteins on a panel of tumor cell lines. Additionally, Kolonin and his colleagues had extended this approach in vivo, using it to identify organ selective peptides in the pancreas and to target adipose tissue for ablation. Building on this foundation, the authors here combined murine tissue-specific phage screening in vivo with flow cytometry to target novel surface markers on adipose progenitor cells (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C.

By focusing on CD34+CD31−CD45− stromal cells in adipose tissue and lung in sequential screens, they identified a peptide (WAT7) enriched in adipose tissue relative to lung by a 15-fold ratio (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C.

Confocal microscopy was used to pinpoint the colocalization of the fluorochrome-labeled WAT7 peptide to cells positive for the pericytic markers CD146 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C.

Using affinity chromatography and protein sequencing methods, the ligand for the WAT7 peptide was identified as the nonglyconated isoform of decorin, a secreted extracellular matrix protein associated with obesity and diabetes (Bolton et al., 2008Bolton K. Segal D. McMillan J. Jowett J. Heilbronn L. Abberton K. Zimmet P. Chisholm D. Collier G. Walder K. Int. J. Obes. (Lond). 2008; 32: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Taking it a step further, the authors raised antibodies against WAT7 to identify the corresponding endogenous peptide (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C. Zhang Y. Amaya-Manzanares F. Simmons P.J. Kolonin M.G. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9 (in press. Published online June 16, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2011.05.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the anti-WAT7 antibodies recognized resistin, an adipokine first identified as a murine fat cell-secreted protein implicated in insulin resistance (Schwartz and Lazar, 2011Schwartz D.R.

When the nonglyconated decorin protein identified as the WAT7 ligand was overexpressed in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line, it stimulated proliferation and cell migration while inhibiting adipogenesis in a resistin-responsive manner (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C.

The development of monoclonal antibody reagents recognizing cell-specific surface antigens revolutionized the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) field. Using selective panels of antibodies, it has been possible to map the developmental pathway for B- and T-lymphocyte lineages. Historically, the stromal/stem cell field in bone marrow and adipose tissue has continued to lag behind that of HSCs due to the lack of cell-and tissue-specific antibodies and surface markers. Multiple groups, including that of Simmons and Torok-Storb, 1991Simmons P.J. Torok-Storb B. Blood. 1991; 78: 55-62PubMed Google Scholar, among others, developed monoclonal antibodies such as Stro-1 against bone marrow stromal cell lines, and these remain valuable and widely used reagents. Nevertheless, there remains a need for novel approaches to identify and distinguish stromal/stem cells across tissues and species. The in vivo phage display technology presented by Daquinag et al. offers a next-generation, functional approach to addressing this unmet need. Their current manuscript focuses exclusively on the adipogenic potential of adipose tissue-derived cells (Daquinag et al., 2011Daquinag A.C. Zhang Y. Amaya-Manzanares F. Simmons P.J. Kolonin M.G.

The work raises intriguing questions whether this lineage-specific cell population has direct links to multipotent mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells were originally isolated in bone marrow and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from this tissue source have received the greatest attention in the literature. More recently, similar populations have since been characterized in amnion, placenta, skeletal muscle, tendon, and fat, as well as other tissues. While these various cell populations share many features in common, they differ with respect to their surface immunophenotype and differentiation potential. In direct comparisons, adipose-derived adipose stromal cells (ASCs) exhibited superior adipogenesis, while bone marrow-derived bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) showed greater osteogenesis (Sakaguchi et al., 2005Sakaguchi Y. Sekiya I. Yagishita K. Muneta T. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2521-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Recently, the concept of ASCs and MSCs as “perivascular” or “pericytic” cells based on their expression of CD146 and related markers has received attention (Crisan et al., 2008Crisan M. Yap S. Casteilla L. Chen C.W. Corselli M. Park T.S. Andriolo G. Sun B. Zheng B. Zhang L. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar, Zannettino et al., 2008Zannettino A.C.W. Paton S. Arthur A. Khor F. Itescu S. Gimble J.M. Gronthos S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 214: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, long-term BrdU labeling studies have localized putative progenitor cells not only to the perivascular space but also to extravascular sites adjacent to mature adipocytes within adipose tissue (Staszkiewicz et al., 2009Staszkiewicz J. Gimble J. Cain C. Dietrich M. Burk D. Kirk-Ballard H. Gawronska-Kozak B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This background highlights the need for novel biomarkers, such as the decorin isoform described in the current paper, as potential tools to distinguish and enrich tissue-specific progenitors which may prove to be MSC-like cells. Such reagents have the potential to accelerate the pace for the translation of MSC-like cells to the clinic, as well as to advance our understanding of their basic science at the mechanistic level. Additionally, phage display may yield peptides suitable for targeted manipulation and/or selective homing of MSC-like cells in situ. Indeed, Kolonin and colleagues have employed such approaches to selectively ablate adipose tissue in vivo (Kolonin et al., 2004Kolonin M.G. Saha P.K. Chan L. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). While resistin has been studied for over a decade, its receptor and signal transduction mechanism remains an active area of investigation (Schwartz and Lazar, 2011Schwartz D.R. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2011; (in press. Published online April 14, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Few studies have reported evidence of a resistin receptor (Schwartz and Lazar, 2011Schwartz D.R. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2011; (in press. Published online April 14, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The current work provides novel evidence that resistin interacts directly with decorin. It remains to be seen if and how decorin mediates resistin signal transduction in multiple tissues. Of course, there are always caveats. For example, there are species-specific differences in the expression and functionality of resistin (Schwartz and Lazar, 2011Schwartz D.R. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2011; (in press. Published online April 14, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). While resistin is associated with adipocytes in the mouse, human macrophages also express this protein, so the biology of the WAT7/decorin interaction in the mouse may not mimic that in man (Schwartz and Lazar, 2011Schwartz D.R. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2011; (in press. Published online April 14, 2011)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2011.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Still, such minor points should not detract from the bigger story, namely, that phage display methods have emerged as an unbiased in vivo discovery tool for the characterization and identification of novel surface markers and signal transduction pathways for stem cells. This method has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of how stem cells in solid organs interact with their microenvironmental niche in situ. The next challenge will be for other stem cell laboratories to reproduce and expand on the UT-Houston team's exciting approach. Dr. Gimble has been associated with companies involved in developing adipose-derived stem cell therapies (Artecel Sciences, Johnson & Johnson, Lacell LCC). An Isoform of Decorin Is a Resistin Receptor on the Surface of Adipose Progenitor CellsDaquinag et al.Cell Stem CellJune 16, 2011In BriefAdipose stromal cells (ASCs) serve as mesenchymal progenitors in white adipose tissue (WAT). Intercellular interactions involving ASCs have remained obscure. By merging phage display technology with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we screened a combinatorial library for peptides that target mouse ASCs in vivo. We isolated peptide CSWKYWFGEC that specifically homes to ASCs, used it as bait to purify the corresponding ASC surface receptor, and identified it as a previously unreported cleavage product of decorin (DCN) lacking the glycanation site (termed ΔDCN).
