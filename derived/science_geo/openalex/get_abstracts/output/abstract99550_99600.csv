https://openalex.org/W1989963027,"Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a major role in development and tissue regeneration. Basement membrane extracellular matrix (ECM), but not fibronectin or collagen, was shown to suppress apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells in tissue culture and in vivo. Apoptosis was induced by antibodies to β1 integrins or by overexpression of stromelysin-1, which degrades ECM. Expression of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) correlated with the loss of ECM, and inhibitors of ICE activity prevented apoptosis. These results suggest that ECM regulates apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells through an integrin-dependent negative regulation of ICE expression."
https://openalex.org/W2049314578,"Background/Aims: Ginseng regulates gastrointestinal (GI) motor activity but the underlying components and molecular mechanisms are unknown. We investigated the effect of gintonin, a novel ginseng-derived G protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand, on the pacemaker activity of the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in murine small intestine and GI motility. Materials and Methods: Enzymatic digestion was used to dissociate ICC from mouse small intestines. The whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record pacemaker potentials and currents from cultured ICC in the absence or presence of gintonin. In vivo effects of gintonin on gastrointestinal (GI) motility were investigated by measuring the intestinal transit rate (ITR) of Evans blue in normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Results: We investigated the effects of gintonin on pacemaker potentials and currents in cultured ICC from mouse small intestine. Gintonin caused membrane depolarization in current clamp mode but this action was blocked by Ki16425, an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist, and by the addition of GDPβS, a GTP-binding protein inhibitor, into the ICC. To study the gintonin signaling pathway, we examined the effects of U-73122, an active PLC inhibitor, and chelerythrine and calphostin, which inhibit PKC. All inhibitors blocked gintonin actions on pacemaker potentials, but not completely. Gintonin-mediated depolarization was lower in Ca2+-free than in Ca2+-containing external solutions and was blocked by thapsigargin. We found that, in ICC, gintonin also activated Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (TMEM16A, ANO1), but not TRPM7 channels. In vivo, gintonin (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) not only significantly increased the ITR in normal mice but also ameliorated STZ-induced diabetic GI motility retardation in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: Gintonin-mediated membrane depolarization of pacemaker activity and ANO1 activation are coupled to the stimulation of GI contractility through LPA1/3 receptor signaling pathways in cultured murine ICC. Gintonin might be a ingredient responsible for ginseng-mediated GI tract modulations, and could be a novel candidate for development as a prokinetic agent that may prevent or alleviate GI motility dysfunctions in human patients."

https://openalex.org/W1983683479,"To investigate the role of NF-IL6 in vivo, we have generated NF-IL6 (-/-) mice by gene targeting. NF-IL6 (-/-) mice were highly susceptible to infection by Listeria monocytogenes. Electron microscopic observation revealed the escape of a larger number of pathogens from the phagosome to the cytoplasm in activated macrophages from NF-IL6 (-/-) mice. Furthermore, the tumor cytotoxicity of macrophages from NF-IL6 (-/-) mice was severely impaired. However, cytokines involved in macrophage activation, such as TNF and IFN gamma, were induced normally in NF-IL6 (-/-) mice. Nitric oxide (NO) formation was induced to a similar extent in macrophages from both wild-type and NF-IL6 (-/-) mice. These results demonstrate the crucial role of NF-IL6 in macrophage bactericidal and tumoricidal activities as well as the existence of a NO-independent mechanism of these activities. We also demonstrate that NF-IL6 is essential for the induction of G-CSF in macrophages and fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1970839214,"<i>crmA</i> is a cowpox virus gene that encodes a protease inhibitor of the serpin family. The only reported target for the CrmA protein is the cysteine protease interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE). ICE, by virtue of its homology to the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> cell death protein Ced-3, has been suggested to play a fundamentally important role in mammalian apoptosis. We hypothesized that a function of <i>crmA</i> may be to inhibit cell death, since a major mechanism of viral clearance is the immune system-mediated induction of apoptosis of infected cells. The tumor necrosis factor receptor and the Fas antigen are two cytokine receptors which, by engaging and activating the death pathway, can eliminate virus-infected cells. Remarkably, <i>crmA</i> was found to be an exceptionally potent inhibitor of apoptosis induced by both these receptors, capable of blocking the cell death program even at pharmacological doses of the death stimulus. Therefore, an important new function for <i>crmA</i> is the inhibition of cytokine-induced apoptosis. Further, the data suggest that a protease, either ICE or a related <i>crmA</i>-inhibitable protein, is a component of the Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1977233251,"An RNA has been selected that rapidly aminoacylates its 2′(3′) terminus when provided with phenylalanyl-adenosine monophosphate. That is, the RNA accelerates the same aminoacyl group transfer catalyzed by protein aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases. The best characterized RNA reaction requires both Mg2+ and Ca2+. These results confirm a necessary prediction of the RNA world hypothesis and represent efficient RNA reaction (≥ 105times accelerated) at a carbonyl carbon, exemplifying a little explored type of RNA catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2050843429,"A 36-kDa protein that binds AU-rich RNA was purified from human spleen and identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). GAPDH has been previously demonstrated to bind tRNA with high affinity. Competition studies suggested that cytoplasmic GAPDH binds the AU-rich elements (AREs) of lymphokine mRNA 3'-untranslated regions with higher affinity than tRNA. The AUUUA-specific RNA binding activity of GAPDH was inhibited by NAD+, NADH, and ATP in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that RNA binding of GAPDH might involve the NAD(+)-binding region, or dinucleotide-binding (Rossmann) fold. This hypothesis was supported by experiments that localized RNA binding to the predicted N-terminal 6.8-kDa peptide, known to be involved in the formation of the NAD(+)-binding domain. The direct demonstration of ARE-specific binding protein activity localized to the NAD(+)-binding region of GAPDH supports the general concept that enzymes containing this domain may exhibit specific RNA binding activity and play additional roles in nucleic acid metabolism. Finally, cytoplasmic GAPDH was found in the polysomal fraction of T lymphocytes. Thus, the RNA binding specificity of GAPDH as well as its localization within the cell merit its strong consideration as a protein important in the regulation of ARE-dependent mRNA turnover and translation in addition to its well described role in glycolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2112997504,"B-cell precursor (BCP) leukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer and the second most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Human BCP leukemia was treated in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse model by targeting of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein (Gen) to the B cell-specific receptor CD19 with the monoclonal antibody B43. The B43-Gen immunoconjugate bound with high affinity to BCP leukemia cells, selectively inhibited CD19-associated tyrosine kinases, and triggered rapid apoptotic cell death. At less than one-tenth the maximum tolerated dose more than 99.999 percent of human BCP leukemia cells were killed, which led to 100 percent long-term event-free survival from an otherwise invariably fatal leukemia. The B43-Gen immuno-conjugate might be useful in eliminating leukemia cells in patients who have failed conventional therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2023090301,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are phosphotyrosine binding modules found within many cytoplasmic proteins. A major function of SH2 domains is to bring about the physical assembly of signaling complexes. We now show that, in addition, simultaneous occupancy of both SH2 domains of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 (Syp, PTP 1D, PTP-2C) by a tethered peptide with two IRS-1-derived phosphorylation sites potently stimulates phosphatase activity. The concentration required for activation by the tethered peptide is 80-160-fold lower than either corresponding monophosphorylated peptide. Moreover, the diphosphorylated peptide stimulates catalytic activity 37-fold, compared with 9-16-fold for the monophosphorylated peptides. Mutational analyses of the SH2 domains of SH-PTP2 confirm that both SH2 domains participate in this effect. Binding studies with a tandem construct comprising the N- plus C-terminal SH2 domains show that the diphosphorylated peptide binds with 60-90-fold higher affinity than either monophosphorylated sequence. These results demonstrate that SH-PTP2 activity can be potently regulated by interacting via both of its SH2 domains with phosphoproteins having two cognate phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2020471821,"The nitric oxide synthases (NOS) comprise a family of enzymes which differ in primary structure, biological roles, subcellular distribution, and post-translational modifications. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) is unique among the NOS isoforms in being modified by N-terminal myristoylation, which is necessary for its targeting to the endothelial cell membrane. The subcellular localization of the ecNOS, but not enzyme myristoylation, is dynamically regulated by agonists such as bradykinin, which promote ecNOS translocation from membrane to cytosol, as well as enhancing enzyme phosphorylation. Using transiently transfected endothelial cells, we now show that a myristoylation-deficient mutant ecNOS undergoes phosphorylation despite restriction to the cytosol, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a consequence rather than a cause of ecNOS translocation. We therefore explored whether other post-translational modifications might regulate ecNOS targeting and now report that ecNOS is reversibly palmitoylated. Biosynthetic labeling of endothelial cells with [3H]palmitic acid followed by immunoprecipitation of ecNOS revealed that the enzyme is palmitoylated; the label is released by hydroxylamine, consistent with formation of a fatty acyl thioester, and authentic palmitate can be recovered from labeled ecNOS following acid hydrolysis. Importantly, pulse-chase experiments in endothelial cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate show that bradykinin treatment promotes ecNOS depalmitoylation. We conclude that ecNOS palmitoylation is dynamically regulated by bradykinin and propose that depalmitoylation of the enzyme may result in its cytosolic translocation and subsequent phosphorylation.

INTRODUCTIONNitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a ubiquitous signaling and effector molecule involved in diverse physiological processes, including neurotransmission, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and blood pressure regulation(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 287-346PubMed Google Scholar). NO is synthesized by a family of NO synthases (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOSnitric oxide synthaseecNOSendothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthaseHAinfluenza hemagglutininBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsmyr –myristoylation-deficient mutant of ecNOSecNOS-HAHA epitope-tagged ecNOSmyr –-HAHA epitope-tagged myr –PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. which share many structural and biochemical properties despite their divergent tissue distribution, regulatory mechanisms, and biological functions(3Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the vasculature, the endothelial isoform of NOS (ecNOS) plays a key role in the transduction of signals from the bloodstream to the underlying smooth muscle to induce vascular relaxation(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). ecNOS is unique among the NOS isozymes in being predominantly membrane-associated, but in response to agonists, such as bradykinin, the enzyme translocates from membrane to cytosol(5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated subcellular translocation has been described for other proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, including G-proteins and protein kinases, and has been implicated in their functioning in signal transduction(6Walker F. deBlaquiere J. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19552-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The subcellular redistribution of ecNOS in response to extracellular signals may also be important to its specific biological functions.The ecNOS undergoes N-terminal myristoylation, and this modification is necessary for membrane association(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), primarily via hydrophobic interactions between the ecNOS myristate moiety and membrane phospholipids(11Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, translocation of the enzyme from membrane to cytosol does not appear to result from loss of the myristate moiety; this modification is co-translational and typically irreversible, precluding its dynamic regulation by agonists(8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 12Sefton B.M. Buss J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated proteins are in fact found both in the soluble and particulate subcellular fractions. Moreover, the stable membrane association of myristoylated proteins may require hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions in addition to those between myristate and membrane lipids(14Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), although we have previously found no evidence for a polybasic domain that might stabilize ecNOS association with the membrane(11Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or palmitoylation, may determine the subcellular localization of myristoylated proteins and provide a mechanism for their regulation(7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that ecNOS undergoes phosphorylation and that its phosphorylation is enhanced by agonists, such as bradykinin, which also stimulate dissociation of the enzyme from cell membranes(5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylated ecNOS is found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction even when the majority of the protein is membrane bound. These observations raised the possibility that phosphorylation of ecNOS at the cell membrane triggers its translocation to the cytosol, perhaps by altering electrostatic interactions with membrane lipids, as has been described for the myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein(15Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this paper we demonstrate that an exclusively cytosolic, myristoylation-deficient mutant of ecNOS is, nevertheless, phosphorylated when expressed in endothelial cells, suggesting that phosphorylation may follow, rather than cause, enzyme translocation to the cytosol. We now provide evidence that the subcellular localization of ecNOS may be determined by palmitoylation: membrane-bound ecNOS is palmitoylated via a reversible thioester linkage, and palmitoylation is regulated by enzyme agonists such as bradykinin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructsThe epitope-tagged ecNOS was prepared using a plasmid (gift of Dr. Tomas Kirchausen) containing the sequence of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope followed by a stop codon cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene). The ecNOS cDNA (18Lamas S. Marsden P.M. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of this plasmid, upstream from the HA epitope, and then a fragment of the C terminus was prepared by PCR in which the stop codon was replaced by a BamHI site. After blunting this BamHI site, the PCR fragment was used to replace the C terminus of ecNOS and the vector sequence between the EcoRI site and the EcoRV site at the start of the HA epitope. The sequence of the PCR fragment was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. This construct was subsequently cloned into the pBK-CMV expression vector (Stratagene), between the NheI and XhoI sites, to form ecNOS-HA. An epitope-tagged form of a previously characterized myristoylation-deficient mutant (myr –) (10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of ecNOS was subsequently prepared by substituting the 5′ 1.5 kilobases of the myristoylation-deficient mutant for that of the epitope-tagged ecNOS at a propitious BglII restriction site to form myr –-HA.Cell Culture and TransfectionBovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Cell Systems and cultured as described previously(18Lamas S. Marsden P.M. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Cells were used between passages 4 and 10. BAEC were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The COS-7 cell line was grown and transfected with previously described (10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) wild-type or myr – mutant ecNOS cDNAs using the DEAE-dextran method. NOS enzymatic activity in transfected COS-7 cells was assayed as described previously (10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring the conversion of [3H]arginine (Amersham Corp.) to [3H]citrulline.Biosynthetic LabelingCultures were labeled with [ 35S]methionine (Tran 35S-label, ICN) or with [ 32P]orthophosphate (DuPont NEN) as described previously (5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To label cells with [3H]palmitate, cultures were incubated in RPMI containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate (DuPont NEN) for 2 h. To examine depalmitoylation, pulse-chase experiments were performed; after labeling with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate in RPMI plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 2 h, cultures were washed with RPMI plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μM unlabeled palmitate, then incubated in RPMI plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μM unlabeled palmitate in the presence or absence of 10 μM bradykinin for the indicated time. For cell fractionation, cells were lysed by sonication in hypotonic buffer and separated into soluble and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) as described previously(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisImmunoprecipitations with polyclonal antiserum to ecNOS were performed as described previously(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (BabCo.) at a final dilution of 1:100(19Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were eluted from Protein A-Sepharose with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing either 5 mM dithiothreitol (for [3H]palmitate-labeled samples) or 5%β-mercaptoethanol (all others). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (for 32P) or fluorography (for 35S and 3H). To test for hydroxylamine-sensitive [3H]palmitate labeling, gels containing replicate samples were incubated for 4 h in either 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7 (control), or 1 M hydroxylamine, pH 7, as described previously(20Hess D.T. Patterson S.I. Smith D.S. Skene J.H.P. Nature. 1993; 366: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and then processed for fluorography.Analysis of Bound Fatty AcidsThe identity of the tritiated fatty acids attached to immunoprecipitated ecNOS was determined as described previously(21Paiges L.A. Nadler M.J.S. Harrison M.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8669-8674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ecNOS from [3H]palmitate-labeled cells was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The region of the membrane containing ecNOS was excised and treated with 6 N HCl in vacuo at 110°C for 18 h. The acid hydrolysis products were extracted with toluene, dried under nitrogen, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on KC-18 reverse phase plates (Whatman) developed with 1:1 acetic acid:acetonitrile, using samples of [3H]myristate and [3H]palmitate (both from DuPont NEN) as standards. The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN), and the tritiated fatty acids were detected by fluorography.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo explore the relationship between ecNOS phosphorylation and subcellular translocation in endothelial cells, we constructed epitope-tagged wild-type and myristoylation-deficient mutant (myr –) ecNOS cDNAs that would express protein that could be selectively immunoprecipitated from transfected endothelial cells by an antibody to the epitope tag. To check that addition of this epitope did not alter the subcellular distribution of ecNOS, we analyzed the localization of the epitope-tagged wild-type ecNOS and the epitope-tagged myr – mutant in transfected BAEC. The epitope-tagged, wild-type ecNOS is predominantly membrane-associated (Fig. 1A, upper panel), as is the endogenous enzyme, immunoprecipitated alone from sham transfected cells with the ecNOS antiserum (Fig. 1A, lowerpanel). Epitope-tagged, myristoylation-deficient ecNOS is found exclusively in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, upperpanel), as was previously observed for the untagged myristoylation mutant in heterologous expression systems(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, addition of the epitope tag does not in itself appear to influence the subcellular localization of ecNOS. In separate experiments we also found no difference in the enzymatic activity of wild-type and epitope-tagged ecNOS transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (as measured by formation of [3H]citrulline from [3H]arginine in cell lysates: 6.7 ± 1.9 versus 6.9 ± 1.2 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein for the wild-type and epitope-tagged ecNOS, respectively). To determine whether membrane association was necessary for phosphorylation, BAEC transfected with epitope-tagged wild-type (ecNOS-HA) or myristoylation-deficient (myr –-HA) ecNOS cDNAs were biosynthetically labeled with [ 32P]orthophosphate and then immunoprecipitated using either ecNOS antiserum or the antibody to the epitope tag (Fig. 1B). Both the wild-type and myristoylation-deficient mutant ecNOS were phosphorylated, despite restriction of the latter to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, both constructs yielded the same single phosphopeptide on two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis that was previously reported for the endogenous ecNOS (data not shown; see (5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of ecNOS in BAEC may occur in the cytosol. As we have previously reported, the majority of phosphorylated ecNOS is found in the cytosol, even with a preponderance of total ecNOS protein in the membrane fraction(5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Myristoylation and, more generally, membrane association of ecNOS thus do not appear to be prerequisites for phosphorylation, arguing strongly against the hypothesis that phosphorylation at the cell membrane triggers the dissociation and translocation of ecNOS from membrane to cytosol. We speculated that other post-translational modifications might be responsible for the agonist-regulated association of ecNOS with the cell membrane. Palmitoylation, like phosphorylation, is a reversible, post-translational modification that can determine the subcellular distribution of proteins, including other myristoylated signaling proteins(8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 17Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ecNOS might be palmitoylated as well as myristoylated, we biosynthetically labeled BAEC with [3H]palmitate and then immunoprecipitated ecNOS. As shown in Fig. 2A, ecNOS is indeed labeled under these conditions. However, because palmitate may be converted to myristate in cells, it was possible that the labeling we observed reflected the known N-terminal myristoylation of ecNOS. To address this question, we investigated the nature of the chemical linkage between the tritiated moiety and ecNOS by treating samples of the 3H-labeled enzyme in SDS-PAGE gels with hydroxylamine, which will cleave the fatty acyl thioester bonds, characteristic of protein palmitoylation via a cysteine sulfhydryl, but will not hydrolyze the N-terminal acyl amide linkage to myristate(12Sefton B.M. Buss J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev.

As shown in Fig. 2A, hydroxylamine treatment releases all of the label from ecNOS immunoprecipitated from BAEC biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate, indicating that this acylation is distinct from the known N-terminal myristoylation, and probably represents palmitoyl thioester formation at a cysteine residue(s) in ecNOS. To confirm the chemical identity of the tritiated group attached to ecNOS, we subjected ecNOS immunoprecipitated from [3H]palmitate-labeled cells to acid hydrolysis, which releases fatty acids linked by either amide or ester bonds(12Sefton B.M. Buss J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse-phase thin layer chromatography revealed that the tritiated fatty acid released from ecNOS co-migrated with a [3H]palmitate standard (Fig. 2B). Thus, the labeling of ecNOS did not result from metabolism of palmitate to myristate and subsequent N-terminal myristoylation, but clearly represents a second, distinct acylation of this protein.Figure 2:ecNOS labeling by [3H]palmitate via an hydroxylamine sensitive bond. A, shown are the results of SDS-PAGE and autofluorography of ecNOS immunoprecipitated with ecNOS antiserum from BAEC biosynthetically labeled for 2 h with [3H]palmitate. Following SDS-PAGE, the gel was treated either with Tris-HCl, pH 7 (Control) or hydroxylamine, pH 7 (NH2OH) for 4 h, as described in the text. The fluorogram was exposed for 30 days on Kodak XAR film at −70°C using an intensifying screen. B, shown is a fluorogram of a reverse phase thin layer chromatographic separation of tritiated fatty acids: [3H]palmitic acid standard, [3H]myristic acid standard, and tritiated fatty acid released by acid hydrolysis from ecNOS immunoprecipitated from BAEC that were biosynthetically labeled for 2 h with [3H]palmitate. The fluorogram was exposed for 8 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next explored the subcellular distribution of the palmitoylated protein. If palmitoylation of ecNOS anchors ecNOS to the membrane by providing additional hydrophobic interactions with membrane lipids, then palmitoylated ecNOS should be restricted to the particulate fraction. As shown in Fig. 3, in transiently transfected COS-7 cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate, we found that the palmitoylated wild-type ecNOS is located exclusively in the particulate subcellular fraction. To confirm that the absence of signal from cytosolic ecNOS was not due simply to the smaller amounts of ecNOS in this subcellular fraction, equal quantities of ecNOS (as determined by Western blotting) from cytosolic and membrane fractions of [3H]palmitate-labeled BAEC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography; again, no signal was observed for the cytosolic protein, although membrane-associated ecNOS was clearly labeled (data not shown). Fig. 3 also shows that the myr – mutant ecNOS does not undergo palmitoylation. This is consistent with previous observations for myristoylation-deficient mutants of other dually acylated proteins(23Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol.

Myristoylation may be required for initial targeting to the cell membrane, where subsequent palmitoylation (perhaps by a membrane-bound palmitoyl transferase) may stabilize ecNOS membrane association.Figure 3:Palmitoylation is restricted to membrane-associated, myristoylated ecNOS. Shown is a fluorogram of the SDS-PAGE analysis of wild-type and myr – mutant ecNOS immunoprecipitated with ecNOS antiserum from transiently transfected COS-7 cells biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate, lysed to form homogenates (H), then fractionated by ultracentrifugation into cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) fractions as described in the text. This fluorogram was exposed for 1 month.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because palmitoylation, unlike myristoylation, is a reversible post-translational modification, it provides a potential mechanism for agonist regulation of ecNOS subcellular localization. Agonist regulation of protein palmitoylation has been described previously for membrane receptors, such as the β-adrenergic receptor(26Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, more recently, for a variety of G-protein α subunits(7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, for the latter, peripheral membrane proteins, the loss of palmitate may correlate with protein redistribution to the cytosolic subcellular fraction(7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Agonists for receptors linked to G-protein αs appear to stimulate palmitate turnover, specifically accelerating depalmitoylation(7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether agonists of ecNOS might also stimulate its depalmitoylation, we performed pulse-chase experiments in the presence or absence of bradykinin. As shown in Fig. 4, bradykinin clearly stimulates depalmitoylation of ecNOS. The half-life of the palmitoyl-ecNOS declines from ˜40 min to less than 10 min after addition of bradykinin (Fig. 4B). Bradykinin does not alter the half-life of the ecNOS protein (t ½ = ˜20 h).2 Loss of palmitate, and its hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes, could be the mechanism for release of ecNOS from the cell membrane and translocation to the cytosol in response to bradykinin.Figure 4:Agonist-stimulated depalmitoylation of ecNOS. BAEC were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]palmitate for 2 h and then incubated for the indicated times in medium plus either H2O (Control) or 10 μM bradykinin (+Bradykinin), and ecNOS was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autofluorography as described in the text.

Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 9Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical processes that regulate reversible palmitoylation of these proteins remain less well understood, and few enzymes involved in the formation or hydrolysis of palmitoyl-protein thioesters have been characterized extensively. No general consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation has been identified, although some dually acylated G-protein α-subunits and members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases are palmitoylated at a cysteine residue within a conserved N-terminal sequence: MGCXXS. However, this cysteine-containing sequence is not found in ecNOS. Very recently, a protein palmitoylthioesterase was isolated and cloned(28Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574.Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its regulatory characteristics are not fully defined, and its relationship to ecNOS palmitoylation is completely unknown. The mechanisms by which bradykinin promotes ecNOS depalmitoylation are thus unclear. It is possible that stimulation of the bradykinin receptor leads directly to activation of a protein palmitoyl thioesterase. Alternatively, ecNOS activation and nitric oxide production may influence depalmitoylation, as it has recently been shown that nitric oxide reduces [3H]palmitate labeling of two nerve growth cone-associated proteins(20Hess D.T. Patterson S.I. Smith D.S. Skene J.H.P. Nature. 1993; 366: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). NO might regulate palmitoyl thioesterase activity or directly influence ecNOS palmitoylation via nitrosothiol formation at the site(s) of palmitoylation; these possibilities represent novel mechanisms for product regulation of an enzyme.The regulation of ecNOS palmitoylation is likely to have important implications for NO-mediated signal transduction. For example, depalmitoylation and translocation of ecNOS could influence NO signaling in the vasculature by removing the enzyme from proximity to membrane receptors and/or intracellular effectors, thereby modulating the response to extracellular signals. Reversible palmitoylation of ecNOS may thus represent an important control point for the regulation of NO biological activities in the vascular wall. INTRODUCTIONNitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a ubiquitous signaling and effector molecule involved in diverse physiological processes, including neurotransmission, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and blood pressure regulation(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 287-346PubMed Google Scholar). NO is synthesized by a family of NO synthases (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOSnitric oxide synthaseecNOSendothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthaseHAinfluenza hemagglutininBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsmyr –myristoylation-deficient mutant of ecNOSecNOS-HAHA epitope-tagged ecNOSmyr –-HAHA epitope-tagged myr –PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. which share many structural and biochemical properties despite their divergent tissue distribution, regulatory mechanisms, and biological functions(3Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the vasculature, the endothelial isoform of NOS (ecNOS) plays a key role in the transduction of signals from the bloodstream to the underlying smooth muscle to induce vascular relaxation(1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). ecNOS is unique among the NOS isozymes in being predominantly membrane-associated, but in response to agonists, such as bradykinin, the enzyme translocates from membrane to cytosol(5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated subcellular translocation has been described for other proteins involved in cell signaling pathways, including G-proteins and protein kinases, and has been implicated in their functioning in signal transduction(6Walker F. deBlaquiere J. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19552-19558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 9Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The subcellular redistribution of ecNOS in response to extracellular signals may also be important to its specific biological functions.The ecNOS undergoes N-terminal myristoylation, and this modification is necessary for membrane association(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), primarily via hydrophobic interactions between the ecNOS myristate moiety and membrane phospholipids(11Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, translocation of the enzyme from membrane to cytosol does not appear to result from loss of the myristate moiety; this modification is co-translational and typically irreversible, precluding its dynamic regulation by agonists(8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 12Sefton B.M. Buss J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated proteins are in fact found both in the soluble and particulate subcellular fractions. Moreover, the stable membrane association of myristoylated proteins may require hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions in addition to those between myristate and membrane lipids(14Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), although we have previously found no evidence for a polybasic domain that might stabilize ecNOS association with the membrane(11Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25016-25020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or palmitoylation, may determine the subcellular localization of myristoylated proteins and provide a mechanism for their regulation(7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that ecNOS undergoes phosphorylation and that its phosphorylation is enhanced by agonists, such as bradykinin, which also stimulate dissociation of the enzyme from cell membranes(5Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylated ecNOS is found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction even when the majority of the protein is membrane bound. These observations raised the possibility that phosphorylation of ecNOS at the cell membrane triggers its translocation to the cytosol, perhaps by altering electrostatic interactions with membrane lipids, as has been described for the myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein(15Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this paper we demonstrate that an exclusively cytosolic, myristoylation-deficient mutant of ecNOS is, nevertheless, phosphorylated when expressed in endothelial cells, suggesting that phosphorylation may follow, rather than cause, enzyme translocation to the cytosol. We now provide evidence that the subcellular localization of ecNOS may be determined by palmitoylation: membrane-bound ecNOS is palmitoylated via a reversible thioester linkage, and palmitoylation is regulated by enzyme agonists such as bradykinin."

The efflux of IGF binding proteins from these cultured cells correlates with changes in the secretion of IGF-1. Thus, during C2 skeletal muscle cell line differentiation, increased secretion of IGF-1 is accompanied by increased release of IGF binding proteins(1Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are no reports on IGF binding protein efflux during either skeletal muscle repair or skeletal muscle hypertrophy. This study was conducted to first establish whether primary cultures of differentiated avian skeletal muscle cells secrete IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins in a manner similar to tissue-cultured mammalian skeletal muscle cell lines. Second, using blocking antibodies, we determined whether IGF-1 secreted by the muscle cells could act as a autocrine/paracrine growth stimulator. Third, we determined the effect of repetitive mechanical stimulation on the sensitivity of the cells to exogenous IGF-1. Finally, the effect of mechanical stimulation on the autocrine secretion of IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins from the cultured avian pectoralis muscle cells was examined. The results indicate that IGF-1 is an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in differentiated avian pectoralis skeletal muscle cultures. Repetitive mechanical stimulation of the muscle cells increased the sensitivity of the cells to exogenous IGF-1, and acutely stimulated IGF-1 release; but it had no long-term effect on either IGF-1 or IGF binding protein release. In contrast, the release of IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins from the muscle cells was dramatically stimulated by embedding the cells in a three-dimensional collagen type I matrix after myofiber formation. This stimulated release of IGF-1 by type I collagen may be responsible for its ability to stimulate skeletal myofiber growth in vitro(24Vandenburgh H.H. Karlisch P. Farr L. In Vitro (Rockville). 1988; 24: 166-174Google Scholar). Fertilized Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Beaver River Farm, Kingstown, RI. Silicone rubber elastic membranes were from Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI. Rat tail type I collagen was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA. Eagle's basal medium, penicillin, glutamine, and trypsin were from Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY. C18 Sep-Pak cartridges were obtained from Waters, Division of Millipore, Bedford, MA. Protein assay kits were purchased from Pierce. I-Insulin-like growth factor-1, donkey anti-rabbit antibody, and L-[U-14C]phenylalanine were from Amersham. Anti-IGF-1 rabbit antibody was obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Hormone and Pituitary Program. IGF-1 standards were from Intergen Co., Purchase, NY. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Embryonic avian skeletal muscle cells were enzymatically isolated from 12-day in ovo pectoralis muscle using standard dissection techniques(25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated on collagen-coated wells of plastic culture dishes or the elastic substratum wells of a mechanical cell stimulator (Cell Kinetics Inc., Providence, RI) at a final density of 7,950 cell/mm2 as described previously(25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Eagle's basal medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% chicken embryo extract, 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 mM glutamine (85/10/5). At the high plating density used in these studies myofiber formation was initiated within 36 h of plating and well formed myofibers were evident by 72 h. Some cultured cells were embedded in a three-dimensional collagen gel matrix (400 μg of collagen/well) 72 h postplating as described previously (25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare cultures depleted of fibroblasts and enriched for myofibers, the cultures were treated with 10 μM cytosine arabinoside for 24 h at day 3 postplating. After cytosine arabinoside treatment, the cells were rinsed once, and incubated in 85/10/5 medium, or embedded in the collagen gel matrix. Fibroblast enriched cultures were obtained by plating newly isolated avian muscle cells in culture flasks for 50 min at 37°C. The attached cells, which are mainly fibroblasts, were rinsed twice in 85/10/5 medium, and incubated in this medium for 72 h. The cells were resuspended with 0.025% trypsin for 15 min, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 85/10/5 medium, filtered through 20-30-μm pore-size Nitex filters to remove residual myofibers, and plated in a culture flask. After reaching confluency, the cells were subcultured a second time by the same protocol, plated on collagen coated 4-well plates at a final density of 530 cells/mm2, and used for the experiments when confluent. In some experiments, the confluent fibroblast cultures were also embedded in a collagen gel 72 h postplating(24Vandenburgh H.H. Karlisch P. Farr L. In Vitro (Rockville). 1988; 24: 166-174Google Scholar). On day 6 postplating, collagen-embedded and noncollagen-embedded muscle cells were rinsed for 2 h (four 30-min rinses) in basal Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mM glutamine. The rinsed cells were incubated in defined serum-free medium consisting of basal medium Eagle's, 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.835 mg/liter ferrous sulfate, 0.05 mg/liter sodium selenate, and 125 mg/100 ml of bovine serum albumin (muscle maintenance medium: MM medium) as described previously(25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Half of the 36 culture wells were maintained as static controls in the mechanical cell stimulator while the other 18 wells were mechanically stimulated by a pattern of activity which induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy (25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (five 12% substratum stretches and relaxations over a 20-s period followed by a 10-s rest period). This pattern was repeated twice more, followed by a 30-min rest period after the third mechanical stimulus (TRIAL39.PGM, Fig. 1). The cells were mechanically stimulated by stretching the substratum with 2-mm diameter vertically moving prongs centered on the bottom of each well. Cell stretch equals substratum stretch in this model system, as determined by morphometric measurements(25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments involving changes in stretch intensity, cells were mechanically stimulated by TRIAL39.PGM but the percent stretch was varied from 6.7 to 21% by varying prong height in the different wells. In experiments where the frequency of stretch was increased, the skeletal muscle cells were stretched and relaxed 12% by TRIAL39.PGM but with a rest period of 5 min rather than 30 min. All cells grown in plastic culture plates or in the mechanical cell stimulator were kept on a rotary shaker (40 rpm) at 37°C when mechanically stimulated to eliminate medium stirring differences between control and stretch groups. Conditioned medium was collected at various times and stored at −80°C. Insulin-like growth factor-1 was extracted from the medium following the procedure of Brier et al.(26Breier B.H. Gallaher B.W. Gluckman P.D. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 128: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was thawed, and incubated for 1 h at 21°C with an equal volume of 0.5 N HCl to free IGF-1 from its binding proteins. The acidic medium was passed through C18 Sep-Pak columns (prewashed with isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and 4% (v/v) acetic acid), and recycled once. IGF binding proteins were washed through the columns with 4% acetic acid, and IGF-1 was eluted from the columns with absolute methanol. Recovery of IGF-1 with this method was approximately 70% based on the extraction and collection of IGF-1 standards. The IGF-1 containing eluates were dried under nitrogen for approximately 40 min, and stored at −80°C. Control culture medium incubated at 37°C for an equal time period but in the absence of cells contained no measurable IGF-1 by this assay technique. IGF-1 was determined using a modification of the radioimmunoassay technique of Furlanetto et al.(27Furlanetto R.W. Underwood L.E. Van Wyk J. D'Ercole J. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Dried samples were reconstituted in RIA buffer (200 mg/liter protamine sulfate, 30 mmol/liter NaH2PO4•H2O, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.01 M EDTA, pH 7.4). Sample aliquots were incubated 48 h at 4°C with anti-rabbit IGF-1 primary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C with approximately 20,000 cpm of I-IGF-1 tracer. IGF-1-primary antibody complexes were precipitated with donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 15 min at room temperature, and collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was decanted, and the radioactivity in the pellet measured with a Berthold Multi-Crystal Counter LB2104. This method could reproducibly detect 12 to 1,000 pg of IGF-1 standards. Differentiated myofiber cultures were rinsed and incubated from day 5 to day 7 postplating in MM medium with either 25 or 250 μg/ml anti-IGF-1 antibody. During the last 4-6 h of incubation, protein synthesis rates were measured as outlined below. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAzol B method (CINNA/Biotecx, Houston, TX), and yielded 1-2 μg/106 cells, as determined spectrophotometrically. The integrity of the RNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis by standard techniques(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blots for IGF-1 mRNA were performed by separating 10-20 μg of total RNA on 1% agarose gels, transferring the RNA by capillary action to Biotrans membranes (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), baking for 2 h at 68°C, prehybridizing at 42°C for 1 h (5 × Denhardt's, 5 × SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide), and hybridizing overnight at 42°C in prehybidization solution containing 106 cpm of P-labeled IGF-1 antisense probe. Posthybridization washes were performed according to the ICN Biotrans protocol. The membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm x-ray film (Amersham) for 24 h at −80°C using 1 intensifying screen. Ribonuclease protection assays for IGF-1 mRNA determination were also performed (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) on 20-40 μg of total RNA, using a commercially available kit (RBA-II, Ambion, Austin, TX). A pPCR2 BlueScript plasmid (gift of P. Rotwein) containing the cDNA sequence for chicken IGF-1 was used to prepare the IGF-1 mRNA probe. The plasmid was linearized at the BamHI site, and P-labeled antisense IGF-1 probe prepared with [P]CTP (Amersham) MAXIscript T3 transcription kit (Ambion). The probe was purified on 5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. Linearized pTRIPLEscript plasmid (Ambion) containing 1 250-base pair mouse actin gene fragment was utilized as a control template. In all experiments, Torula yeast RNA served as a negative control, while adult mouse liver total RNA, chicken 12-day embryo skeletal muscle, and eye total RNA served as positive controls. Cells were collected, rinsed twice in phenol red-free Earle's balanced saline solution, and stored at −80°C. Protein assays were performed on cell sonicate aliquots using the bicinchonic acid protein assay as described previously(25Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C674-C682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was determined using L-[U-14C]phenylalanine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material during a 4-6-h incubation period as described previously by Vandenburgh et al.(29Duclos M.J. Wilkie R.S. Goddard C. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 128: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Incorporation is linear during this time period and excess nonradioactive phenylalanine was included in the medium (0.5 mM) to allow rapid equilibration of the intracellular and extracellular amino acid pools(30Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Sohar I. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C232-C240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was measured fluorometrically by the modified method of Labarca and Paigen(31Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 102: 344-352Crossref Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). IGF binding proteins in the conditioned medium were examined using gel electrophoresis and ligand blotting(23Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 33Armstrong D.G. McKay C.O. Morrell D.J. Goddard C. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 120: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Four parts of conditioned medium were mixed with one part nonreducing sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 12.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and cooled to 21°C. The proteins in the conditioned medium were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prepared according to Laemmli(32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper by Western blotting(33Armstrong D.G. McKay C.O. Morrell D.J. Goddard C. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 120: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and identified by the I-IGF-1 ligand blotting technique (23Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nitrocellulose membrane was air-dried at room temperature, soaked for 30 min (4°C) in saline (0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml sodium azide, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with 3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 h (4°C) in saline with 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 min (4°C) in saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The washed membranes were incubated overnight (4°C) in saline, 1% (w/v) powdered milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 500,000 cpm of I-IGF-1. After extensive rinsing in saline, the membrane was air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film for varying times at −80°C with two intensifying screens. The amounts of labeled binding proteins were determined quantitatively by densitometric scanning of preflashed x-ray autoradiographs using a computerized image analysis system (JAVA and PEAK FIT, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Statistical analyses of the data were performed by t tests for unpaired values using a statistical software program (SIGMASTAT, Jandel Scientific). The relationship between mechanical stimulation, cell growth, and IGF-1 was first examined by performing protein synthesis-IGF-1 dose-response studies on collagen-embedded static control and mechanically stimulated skeletal muscle cultures. As previously reported for control muscle cell cultures(4Vandenburgh H.H. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Feldstein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C475-C484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nanomolar concentrations of IGF-1 did not stimulate protein synthesis or cell growth (Fig. 2A). In contrast, at concentrations which were ineffective in static cultures, IGF-1 stimulated cell growth (Fig. 2A) and protein synthesis (Fig. 2B) in mechanically-stimulated cells. In addition, myosin heavy chain content was also increased in mechanically-stimulated cells by doses of IGF-1 (12 nM) that were ineffective in control static cultures (3.5 nMversus 12 nM, Fig. 2D). Insulin, at a concentration of 5 μM, was inactive in stimulating cell growth in static cultures, but the same concentration caused a significant increase in protein/DNA ratios in mechanically-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). The effect of insulin on protein synthesis in the muscle cell cultures was also enhanced significantly by stretch (Fig. 2C). Insulin was active only at pharmacological doses in stimulating muscle cell growth since most of its growth-stimulatory effects are via the IGF-1 receptor, for which it has a low affinity (4Vandenburgh H.H. Karlisch P. Shansky J. Feldstein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C475-C484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. These data indicate that mechanical stimulation increases the sensitivity of skeletal muscle cells to exogenously added IGF-1 and insulin. One mechanism by which stretch could increase the cell's growth response to exogenously added IGF-1 would be by supplementing this with endogenously produced IGF-1. Insulin-like growth factors have been reported in conditioned medium from mammalian skeletal muscle cell lines but not primary avian muscle. Therefore, the endogenous secretion of IGF-1 from differentiated avian skeletal muscle cells was examined. The influence of embedding the muscle cells in a three-dimensional collagen gel matrix on IGF-1 efflux was measured first since the muscle cells withstand long-term repetitive stretch better when supported by an extracellular matrix (24Vandenburgh H.H. Karlisch P. Farr L. In Vitro (Rockville). 1988; 24: 166-174Google Scholar). Collagen-embedded day 6 muscle cultures grown in plastic culture dishes were found to release 5.1 ± 0.9 pg of IGF-1/μg of protein from 0 to 24 h and 3.4 ± 0.6 pg of IGF-1/μg of protein from 24 to 48 h, which was 3-11 times greater than IGF-1 efflux from noncollagen-embedded cells (Fig. 3). The level of IGF-1 release varied significantly between different cell preparations, from 3 to 34 pg/μg of protein/24 h. The reason for this wide fluctuation in IGF-1 release from primary cell cultures is not known but it has been also found for other growth factors released from these cells(30Vandenburgh H.H. Hatfaludy S. Sohar I. Shansky J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C232-C240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment was therefore repeated with at least two different cell preparations. Within the same cell preparation, IGF-1 release was always greater when the muscle cells were grown on the elastic membranes of the mechanical cell stimulator compared to plastic culture dishes. Thus, noncollagen-embedded skeletal muscle cells grown on elastic membranes released 2.6-fold more IGF-1 after 24 h, and 7.8-fold more after 48 h, compared to cells on rigid plastic dishes (Fig. 3). When embedded in a collagen matrix, the muscle cells growing on the elastic membranes released 1.3- and 1.8-fold more IGF-1/μg of protein after 24 and 48 h of incubation in defined medium, respectively, compared to those grown on plastic culture dishes (Fig. 3). In subsequent experiments, controls were therefore always run with the same cell preparation growing on identical substrata. To ascertain whether the increased IGF-1 found in conditioned medium from collagen-embedded cells was trapped within the collagen gels from prior incubation with serum and chicken embryo extract containing medium, collagen gels were prepared in 4-well plates with 85/10/5 medium, but without cells, and treated the same way as the muscle cell cultures. After rinsing the gels by the normal protocol, they were incubated in serum-free medium for a 24-h period, and conditioned medium collected for IGF-1 analysis. The collagen gels without cells released an average of 381 ± 42 pg of IGF-1/well/24 h, compared to 1,790 ± 270 pg of IGF-1/well/24 h observed in conditioned medium from collagen-embedded cells grown in plastic culture plates. To further examine this question, the amount of IGF-1 trapped from 85/10/5 medium in collagen gels in the presence of skeletal muscle cells was determined by preparing the collagen gels with medium containing tracer levels of I-IGF-1. Fresh medium containing tracer levels of I-IGF-1 was added to the cultures every 24 h. The 6-7-day-old cultures were then rinsed by the normal protocol, and the release of radioactivity measured over a 24-h period. The rinsed muscle cells embedded in the collagen matrix released 6.88% of the total initial medium radioactivity over a 24-h period. This equaled 42 pg of IGF-1/well trapped by the collagen gels, 10-15-fold less than the IGF-1 released from collagen-embedded cells into"
https://openalex.org/W2087144342,"tyk2 belongs to the JAK family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases recently found implicated in signaling through a large number of cytokine receptors. These proteins are characterized by a large amino-terminal region and two tandemly arranged kinase domains, a kinase-like and a tyrosine kinase domain. Genetic and biochemical evidence supports the requirement for tyk2 in interferon-α/β binding and signaling. To study the role of the distinct domains of tyk2, constructs lacking one or both kinase domains were stably transfected in recipient cells lacking the endogenous protein. Removal of either or both kinase domains resulted in loss of the in vitro kinase activity. The mutant form truncated of the tyrosine kinase domain was found to reconstitute binding of interferon-α8 and partial signaling. While no contribution of this protein toward interferon-β binding was evident, increased signaling could be measured. The mutant form lacking both kinase domains did not exhibit any detectable activity. Altogether, these results show that a sequential deletion of domains engenders a sequential loss of function and that the different domains of tyk2 have distinct functions, all essential for full interferon-α and -β binding and signaling. tyk2 belongs to the JAK family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases recently found implicated in signaling through a large number of cytokine receptors.

The kinase-like domain (or KL domain) contains the subdomains shared by protein kinases, but lacks several residues thought to be essential for protein kinase activity, and thus it would not be predicted to exhibit kinase activity. The function of this domain has yet to be established. The remaining five blocks of homology exhibit varying degrees of conservation among the family members and their functional role is to be elucidated. It is likely that some of them might be responsible for the association of the JAKs with members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Recent studies have in fact established the involvement of these enzymes in signaling through interferon (IFN) receptors and a large number of cytokine/growth factor receptors(1Ziemiecki A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) represents a component of the receptor unit possibly interacting with IFNAR1. The signaling cascade initiated by binding of IFN-α/β to its receptor relies on the activity of tyk2 and JAK1, as was first demonstrated through the study of the IFN-resistant cell lines 11,1 (or U1A) and U4A, deficient in one or the other of these protein tyrosine kinases (18Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 19Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O.

The absence of either protein prevents high affinity binding of IFN-α, phosphorylation of the downstream transcriptional components (p113 or STAT2 and p91/p84 or STAT1α/β) and activation of inducible genes(20Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). Thus, complementation of 11,1 cells with a cosmid or the cDNA encoding tyk2 was shown to restore IFN-α/β responsiveness(18Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas complementation of mutant U4A with JAK1 cDNA restored both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ signaling(19Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C.

Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In an initial study of the tyk2-deficient cell line 11,1 we found a residual sensitivity of these cells to IFN-β, that suggested the existence of a minor IFN-β-specific pathway and possibly a different utilization of tyk2 by the two IFN species(22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 23John J. McKendry R. Pellegrini S. Flavell D. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have recently reported on the biochemical characterization of tyk2 as a 134-kDa protein mostly cytosolic, with a minor membrane-associated fraction. The protein is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IFN-α/β treatment and possesses an inducible tyrosine kinase activity measurable in vitro(21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the kinase domains of tyk2, here we have constructed deleted forms of the protein lacking either or both kinase domains and stably expressed them in the tyk2-deficient cell line. The binding of IFN-α and IFN-β and the signaling activities induced in these transfectants were analyzed and compared. Parental 2fTGH cells, mutants 11,1, U1B, and U1C were previously described(22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Müller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and hygromycin (250 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA transfections of 11,1 cells were carried out using calcium phosphate as described previously(22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were seeded 1:10 in medium containing 450 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Resistant colonies were ring-cloned 2 weeks later and expanded. Survival in hypoxanthine/aminopterine/thymidine (HAT) medium was assayed in the presence of different concentrations of IFN. Wellferon is a highly purified mixture of human IFN-α subtypes (108 IU/mg of protein, Wellcome Research Laboratories)(25Allen G. Fantes K.H. Burke D.C. Morser J. J. Gen. Virol. 1982; 63: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IFN-α8, purified to homogeneity, was a gift from CIBA-GEIGY (Basel, Switzerland). Purified recombinant human IFN-β at 250 μg/ml was a gift from Biogen Inc. (Boston, MA). All constructs were made in the pRc/CMV expression vector (InVitrogen). In this vector, the cDNA of interest is under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. All plasmids were tagged at their 3′ end with an oligonucleotide encoding an epitope of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) as previously described(21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A SalI fragment, comprising nucleotides 777-4146 of tyk2 cDNA in plasmid H9S (21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the phagemid vector pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to facilitate subsequent deletion constructs (b.s.3.3 B-Sal). To delete the tyrosine kinase domain, a 2.1-kb EcoRI-Eco47III fragment (nucleotides 777-2950) from b.s.3.3 B-Sal was cloned into the EcoRI-SmaI site of a plasmid containing the VSV-G epitope sequence. The new plasmid was digested with SalI and XbaI, the 2.2-kb fragment was purified, and, together with an 850-base pair fragment comprising the 5′-untranslated sequence and nucleotides 1-777 of tyk2 cDNA, it was ligated to the HindIII-XbaI-digested vector. The final construct, ΔTK, encodes a protein containing amino acids 1-895 of tyk2. To delete the kinase-like domain, b.s.3.3 B-Sal was digested with AatII and EcoRV, treated with DNA polymerase to form blunt ends and religated. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI, blunted as before and then digested with SpeI. The SpeI site is in the vector portion of the plasmid. The 3.9-kb band was isolated and ligated to a 1.3-kb SpeI-PvuII fragment (nucleotides 777-2040) of b.s. 3.3 B-Sal. A 2.2-kb SalI-XbaI fragment was prepared from this plasmid, and a three-part ligation, with the 850-base pair HindIII-SalI fragment and the HindIII-XbaI vector band as described for ΔTK, was performed. The final construct generates a protein, ΔKL, in which amino acids 594-877 have been deleted, and an additional Tyr has been inserted after amino acid 593. To generate a protein deleted of both kinase domains, a 2.1-kb HindIII-Eco47III fragment from plasmid ΔKL was purified and ligated to the VSV-G plasmid digested with HindIII-SmaI. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the subsequent 2.2-kb fragment was ligated to the HindIII-XbaI-digested vector. This construct encodes a protein, N, that contains amino acids 1-591, followed by a three-amino acid insertion of Ile-Glu-Phe and finally amino acids 878-895 of tyk2. All final plasmids were sequenced across the junctions of the deletions to confirm that the coding region remained in frame. Sequence analysis was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and double-stranded plasmid DNA as template. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent cultures with guanidinium thiocyanate(26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of RNA per sample were fractionated in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized under standard conditions (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) to specific cDNA probes. IFN-α8 and IFN-β were labeled with 125I (Amersham Corp., IMS 30). IFN-α8 was labeled to a specific radioactivity of 25 Bq/fmol of monomeric IFN and stored at −80°C at a concentration of 20 nM, as described previously(27Mogensen K.E. Uzé G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The labeling procedure was slightly modified for IFN-β, using a protein/iodine ratio 2.5 times higher than for IFN-α8, to give a specific radioactivity of 10 Bq/fmol of monomeric IFN at 50 nM. Cell binding was carried out on subconfluent monolayer cultures (1.5 × 105 cells/cm2). Each point is an average from three replicate cultures, each containing 1.5 × 106 cells. Binding measured at 37°C was terminated by placing the cultures on ice and aspirating the supernatant. The cultures were then washed three times with equivalent volumes of ice-cold medium containing 1% of fetal calf serum, detached in trypsin and EDTA for transfer to a γ counter (Kontron, counting efficiency 75%). Conversion of radioactive counts to molecules of IFN was as described previously(28Mogensen K.E. Bandu M.-T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding at 4°C was carried out by equilibrating the cultures on ice for 30 min before adding labeled IFN and terminated as above by aspiration and washing. As incubation times were necessarily longer at 4°C than at 37°C, the culture medium was buffered by addition of Hepes to 50 mM. After several hours at 4°C, cells detach easily, and extreme care was exercised during the washing. Binding results are presented as receptor-specific with background (estimated from cultures treated with labeled IFN in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled IFN) substracted. Backgrounds were typically at 0.05% of the input radioactivity. Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations were done as described elsewhere(21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with anti-91C antibody, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) containing 300 mM NaCl. p91 immunoblots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, 96-99% albumin) in 1 × TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) buffer. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p91 was detected with a mixture of PY20 (ICN) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies. Antisera to p113 and p91 (a gift of C. Schindler) were used at a 1:1,000 and 1:500 dilution respectively for immunoprecipitation and at a 1:10,000 dilution for immunoblotting. Affinity-purified anti-JAK1 antibodies (a gift of A. Ziemiecki) were used at a 1:250 dilution for immunoprecipitation and at a 1:2,000 dilution for immunoblotting. An ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously reported(21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gel was transferred to Hybond-C Super membrane (Amersham Corp.), and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To carry out a structure-function analysis of tyk2, we generated three deleted cDNA forms lacking one or both kinase domains. The proteins encoded by these constructs are schematically depicted in Fig. 1A. The mutant protein designated ΔTK is a truncated tyk2 form lacking the tyrosine kinase domain. The ΔKL protein lacks the kinase-like domain but retains an intact tyrosine kinase domain, whereas the protein designated N corresponds to the NH2-terminal region. The wild-type and the deleted cDNAs were cloned in the pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector, which contains the neomycin-resistance marker. Mutant 11,1 cells were transfected with the four constructs, selected in G418, and independent neor clones arising from each transfection were analyzed for the presence of tyk2 by immunoblot. All transfectants analyzed expressed tyk2 forms of the predicted size, at levels ranging from 0.5- to 10-fold the endogenous tyk2 level present in parental 2fTGH cells (21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Minor tyk2 forms of higher mobility were routinely detected in tyk2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B) and might result from in vivo degradation. Four representative clones (Fig. 1B) expressing almost comparable levels of protein (approximately 5-fold the endogenous tyk2 level in 2fTGH cells) were chosen for further studies. We tested the ability of the four neor transfectants to grow in the selective medium (HAT) in the presence of different concentrations of IFN-α. This medium allows survival of 11,1 derivatives which have reverted to IFN sensitivity (22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and constitutes our biological assay for tyk2 activity. Wild-type tyk2-expressing cells showed IFN-dependent growth with as little as 10 IU/ml IFN-α (Wellferon, a mixture of purified human α subtypes). ΔTK-expressing cells survived in HAT medium only when a higher concentration of IFN-α was used. In contrast, 11,1 cells and ΔKL- and N-expressing cells failed to grow at any given concentration of IFN-α tested (Fig. 2A). To rule out the possibility that this behavior was unique to 11,1 derivatives, we generated ΔTK and ΔKL neor transfectants from cell lines U1B and U1C, two independent mutants of the same complementation group as 11,1(24McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Müller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The IFN responsiveness of each transfectant gave comparable results (data not shown). We next tested the sensitivities of the 11,1 transfectants to recombinant IFN-α8 and -β. These results are summarized in Fig. 2B. The specific activity of IFN-β was higher than that of IFN-α8 on all clones tested. There was a 30-100-fold difference in the sensitivities of ΔTK-expressing cells and 11,1 to either IFN. Interestingly, the sensitivity of ΔTK-expressing cells to IFN-α8 attained the level of sensitivity of 11,1 cells to IFN-β. The analysis of the ΔKL- and N-expressing clones gave results essentially identical to 11,1. These data indicate that both tyk2 kinase domains are required to restore a wild-type response to both IFN species. The truncated ΔTK form can, however, partially reconstitute sensitivity to both IFNs. As a measure of the response of the transfectants to IFN-α, we studied the transcriptional induction of the endogenous IFN-responsive 6-16 gene by Northern blot. Analysis of total RNA from wild-type tyk2-expressing cells treated for 4 h showed accumulation of the 6-16 transcript with as little as 10 IU/ml IFN-α (Fig. 3). A comparable level of transcript accumulated in ΔTK-expressing cells treated with 5000 IU/ml IFN-α. In contrast, ΔKL-expressing cells failed to induce the 6-16 message, behaving as mutant 11,1. These results confirm the fine correlation between the transcriptional activation of the 6-16 gene promoter by IFN and the ability of the cells to grow in HAT medium. The steady-state mRNA level of three other IFN-responsive genes (ISG-54, GBP, and IRF-1) was analyzed in the various cell lines. None of these transcripts accumulated in cells expressing the deleted tyk2 forms, treated with up to 5000 IU/ml IFN-α (data not shown). Previous work had suggested that tyk2 exerts an effect on receptor-mediated uptake of IFN-α, i.e. mutant 11,1 cells lacking tyk2 showed reduced uptake of labeled IFN-α2(22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whereas complementing the defect by tyk2 transfection restored binding as well as signaling(18Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 11,1 cells are known to be partially responsive to IFN-β (Fig. 2B)(22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 23John J. McKendry R. Pellegrini S. Flavell D. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To complete these observations, we studied the kinetics of uptake of radiolabeled IFN-β and IFN-α8 in the mutant cell line and in its derivatives (Fig. 4). The kinetic results shown here are for a single concentration of IFN (∼300 pM), but the relative form of the curves was similar across the dose range 50-500 pM. Since essentially identical curves were obtained from ΔKL- and N-expressing cells and 11,1 cells, only data from 11,1 were represented in Fig. 4, A and B. Cells expressing wild-type tyk2 showed the characteristic binding dynamics for IFN-β seen in parental 2fTGH cells (Fig. 4A). While a similar level of uptake was attained in both 11,1 cells and ΔTK-expressing cells, there was no down phase as in parental cells. Similar results were obtained with IFN-α8 (Fig. 4B) except that 11,1 cells showed a much reduced uptake than ΔTK-expressing cells. To investigate this further and to eliminate the dynamic aspects of cellular uptake, we compared the binding of IFN-α8 and IFN-β at 4°C on the partially sensitive ΔTK-expressing cells and on the IFN-insensitive ΔKL-expressing cells. The results, in the form of Scatchard graphs, are shown in Fig. 4C. The binding of IFN-β was nearly the same on the two cell lines, showing that, for IFN-β, receptor expression appears to be unaffected by the status of tyk2. The binding of IFN-α8 on the ΔTK-expressing cells was greater and shows a Scatchard plot with a slope 2.4 times greater than that obtained on the ΔKL-expressing cells. This suggests that the mutant protein ΔTK contributes to the affinity of binding of IFN-α over the concentration range used. The Scatchard coefficient gave Kd equivalent to 0.54 nM and 0.62 nM for IFN-β, 0.87 nM and >2.1 nM for IFN-α8, on ΔTK- and ΔKL-expressing cells, respectively (the Kd of 2.1 nM falls outside the range of experimental points). The linear regressions extrapolated to infinite ligand concentration meet the intercept at values close enough to suggest that the main reason for the reduced uptake of IFN-α8 on ΔKL cells is a lower binding affinity. It has been previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 occurs within min of IFN-α/β treatment(11Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the in vivo phosphorylation state of deleted tyk2 forms in the transfected clones. Cells were left untreated or treated with IFN-α for 5 min and tyk2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by blotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine and, after stripping, with anti-tyk2 antibodies. In response to IFN-α, wild-type tyk2 was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine above a basal level of phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2, upper panel; see also Fig. 3 in (21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The N and ΔTK mutant forms were not phosphorylated (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 8). Conversely, the ΔKL mutant protein showed an IFN-independent phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6). Comparable levels of protein were present in all extracts analyzed (Fig. 5A, lower panel). IFN-α induces tyk2 kinase activity and this can be measured in vitro in an anti-tyk2 immunocomplex(21Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether the deletions had an effect on the kinase activity of the protein, in vitro kinase assays were performed on the wild-type tyk2 and the ΔTK and ΔKL mutant forms. As shown in Fig. 5B, wild-type tyk2 exhibited increased autophosphorylating activity upon IFN-α treatment. In contrast, ΔTK and ΔKL did not exhibit autophosphorylating activity. A similar result was obtained when the two deletion constructs were co-expressed in 11,1 cells (data not shown). To investigate the ability of these proteins to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate, the in vitro kinase assay was performed in the presence of acid-denatured enolase. Upon IFN-α treatment, enolase was markedly phosphorylated by wild-type tyk2 (Fig. 5B, lane 2). In contrast, the exogenous substrate was not phosphorylated in ΔKL and ΔTK-expressing cells treated with IFN (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 6). The abundance of the immunoprecipitated proteins was visualized by blotting"

The AT1 receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor characterized by a putative seven-transmembrane helical structure motif (Fig. 1A; (4Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Besides Ang II-peptide analogues, a family of non-peptide antagonists binds to the AT1 receptor with high affinity (Fig. 1B). These non-peptides presumably function like the classical G-protein-coupled receptor antagonists that utilize residues located in the putative transmembrane helices for their binding. Because Ang II is substantially larger, its binding is likely to involve the extracellular loops of the AT1 receptor in addition. Lys has been suggested to be involved in binding of the C-terminal carboxylate group of Ang II-peptides but has not been implicated in binding the non-peptide ligands(5Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S.

They contain the core structure of S8307 with a biphenyl-acidic extension, which is thought to be a better mimic of the Ang II structure(3Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.G. Chin A.T. Herblin W.F.

Modeling of the three-dimensional structural overlay of several non-peptides indicates that a common geometry of critical pharmacophores is present in all high affinity angiotensin receptor antagonists(11Prendergast K.

Peptide antagonists have higher affinity toward the AT1 receptor, suggesting that they bind in a unique conformation to the receptor(2Marshall G.R. Bosshard H.E. Vine W.H. Glickson J.D. Needleman P.

Therefore it is possible that the same pharmacophore geometry exists in the receptor bound conformation of Ang II-peptide antagonists as well (Fig. 1B). Presumably the same residues on the receptor are utilized for docking the pharmacophore presented by peptide and non-peptide antagonists. For example, the α-carboxyl group of the Ang II-peptides and the carboxylic acid or carboxamide and sulfonamide, or tetrazole group on the biphenyl portion of various non-peptides, are equivalent in structure-activity relationship(3Timmermans P.B.M.W.M.

In this report we present evidence to suggest that the peptide and non-peptide antagonists indeed occupy the same AT1 receptor binding pocket, but may employ dissimilar interactions for stabilization of bound ligands. The relevance of these results to the pharmacophore overlay of peptide and non-peptide AT1 receptor ligands is discussed. A rat AT1 receptor gene with 41 unique restriction sites was designed by strategies used previously(14Ferretti L. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. Nassal M.N. Oprian D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and synthesized and cloned into the shuttle expression vector pMT2(15Kauffman R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The synthetic gene encodes 359 amino acids of the rat vascular AT1 receptor with an 8-residue epitope tag (ETSQVAPA) at the C terminus. The epitope is the binding site for the monoclonal antibody 1D4, which can be used to detect polypeptide expression in transfected cells as described previously(16Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total membrane preparations from transfected COS cells were frozen at −85°C in 50 mM HEPES, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol until assayed(16Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K and Bmax of the receptor were estimated by I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II equilibrium binding and Scatchard plot analysis. Extensive analysis of affinity, expression levels and agonist-induced inositol phosphate formation suggests that the AT1 receptors expressed from cDNA and the epitope-tagged synthetic DNA exhibit identical properties. Mutations were constructed in the synthetic gene by the technique of restriction fragment replacement, and all of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis(16Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). AT1 receptor binding was determined using total membrane prepared from transfected COS cells as described earlier(18Pucell A.G. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7076-7080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide were radioiodinated by the lactoperoxidase method, and the radiolabeled peptides were purified by the reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography method(19Husain A. Pajka S.F. Taylor S.M. Speth R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 2339: 71-77Google Scholar). The specific activity of both these peptides was 2200 Ci/mmol. [3H]Losartan (specific activity 42.3 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham. All binding data were analyzed and IC values determined by nonlinear regression analysis. K values for radiolabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were estimated from competition binding data with 8-10 different concentrations of the corresponding unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II using the equation: K = IC/(1 - L/K), where L is concentration of radioligand, and IC is the concentration of competing ligand required to reduce specific radioligand binding by 50%, and K is the dissociation constant for I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II(20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). K values (nanomolar) represent mean ± S.E., n = 3-10. Multiple interactions of Ang II with the receptor contribute to its binding enthalpy. Among these, the ion pair interaction of the C-terminal carboxyl group of Ang II with the receptor is well defined. The contractile response to [acetyl-Asn1,Val5]Ang II, an agonist analogue of Ang II that contains a single carboxylate at the peptide C terminus, is pH-sensitive, and the modification of its carboxylate to hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic groups reduces biological activity(1Bumpus F.M. Khosla M.C. Geneset J. Koiw E. Kuchel O. Hypertension: Physiology and Treatment. McGraw-Hill, New York1977: 183-201Google Scholar, 21Hsieh K.-H. Marshall G.R. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Structure-activity analysis and modeling studies of non-peptide antagonists predict that a similar ion pair interaction is essential for them to bind with high affinity to the AT1 receptor(3Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.G. Chin A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar, 11Prendergast K. Adams K. Greenlee W.J.

We decided to define this interaction by systematic mutagenesis of receptor combined with group-specific modification of the ligand, since an earlier study (5Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-F. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) did not investigate all potential residues in the receptor that could be involved in this interaction. We restricted our search to basic residues (Arg, Lys, and His in its protonated state) located in the putative transmembrane helices and the extracellular loops of the AT1 receptor because the majority of small molecule ligands bind to G-protein-coupled receptors within this region(22Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Basic residues conserved in all losartan-selective AT1 receptors were selected for mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). Several different single residue substitutions at each position were tested. Binding of the radiolabeled antagonist I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II by the expressed AT1 receptor is potently inhibited by I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II > Ang II > [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide > losartan > Ang II-amide, as shown in Table 1. In addition, the binding of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II is pH-sensitive (Fig. 2). The influence of pH on [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide, and losartan binding shown in Fig. 2 is reversible. In addition, Marshall et al.(2Marshall G.R. Bosshard H.E. Vine W.H. Glickson J.D. Needleman P. Wesson L.G. Fanelli Jr., G.M. Recent Advances in Renal Physiology and Pharmacology. University Park Press, Baltimore1974: 215-256Google Scholar) have reviewed the body of evidence suggesting that the conformation of Ang II is not affected by pH changes in this range. Therefore, the profile represents pH-sensitive interaction between the ligand and receptor. However, in [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide and Ang II-amide the loss of the C-terminal negative charge results in a 10-fold loss of binding affinity. This illustrates that [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and Ang II binding by the AT1 receptor involves a salt bridge interaction, which confirms earlier bioassay results (Refs. 1Bumpus F.M. Khosla M.C. Geneset J. Koiw E. Kuchel O. Hypertension: Physiology and Treatment. McGraw-Hill, New York1977: 183-201Google Scholar, 2Marshall G.R. Bosshard H.E. Vine W.H. Glickson J.D. Needleman P. Wesson L.G. Fanelli Jr., G.M. Recent Advances in Renal Physiology and Pharmacology. University Park Press, Baltimore1974: 215-256Google Scholar, and 21Hsieh K.-H. Marshall G.R. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The profile of losartan binding to the AT1 receptor is somewhat similar to that of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide. It is comparatively distinct from that of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, with a sharp optimum near pH 7.0, and is especially sensitive to higher pH values (Fig. 2). Because the substitution of the tetrazole moiety with azoles or sulfonamides of higher pKa results in a loss of binding affinity toward the native AT1 receptor, it was predicted that the tetrazole moiety is involved in an ion pair interaction with the receptor(12Duncia J.-V. Chiu A.T. Carini D.J. Gregory G.B. Johnson A.L. Price W.A. Wells G.J. Wong P.C. Calabrese J.C. Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. J. Med.

Wong P.C. Yoo S.-E. Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2525-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This putative salt bridge between losartan and the AT1 receptor is unassigned as yet. Assuming that the same residue of the receptor is involved in the putative salt bridge interaction with all AT1 receptor-specific ligands, its substitution with a neutral hydrogen-bonding residue must result in a 10-fold loss of affinity for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and Ang II, without affecting the affinity for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide and Ang II-amide. Because losartan and related non-peptides likely make fewer contacts with the AT1 receptor than do peptide ligands, the predicted effect of such a mutation is likely to be greater on their binding. On the other hand, substitution of a residue involved in some other interaction with the ligands should lead to a decrease in the affinity of all types of ligands.Table 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:The effect of pH on the binding of I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide and 3H-losartan to the wild-type AT1 receptor and its mutants. The upperpanel shows binding to wild-type AT1 receptor. The middlepanel shows binding of I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to wild-type and mutant receptors. The lowerpanel shows binding to wild-type receptor only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since substitution of Gln for Arg, His, or Lys results in the removal of the positive charge without substantial change in the side chain size, the effect of Gln substitution on ligand binding was examined initially (Table 1). The mutants H183Q, H256Q, and H272Q had no effect on the binding of either peptide or non-peptide ligands. Substitution of 3 residues in the putative transmembrane domain (Lys, Arg, and Lys) leads to a decrease of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding affinity. All of the Arg mutants expressed receptor proteins at the same level, which were glycosylated as for the wild-type receptor. The expressed mutant proteins did not specifically bind any of the peptide and non-peptide antagonists. Therefore, the role of Arg in ligand binding remains unclear. The K102Q mutant showed loss of binding affinity toward all ligands (Table 1). Interestingly, K102Q mutation did not alter pH profile of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding (Fig. 2) and the ability to discriminate differences between Ang II and [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, indicating that Lys does not interact with the carboxylate group of the Asp1 side chain of Ang II (Table 1). Thus, these results are consistent with the requirement of a positively charged, long side chain at this position for stabilization of the AT1 receptor conformation. The substitution of Lys with Gln did not significantly alter the binding of losartan. Surprisingly, however, the affinity of this mutant (K199Q) for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and Ang II was about 10- and 48-fold lower, respectively, than that of the wild-type receptor (Table 1, Fig. 3). The effect of pH on [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding of the K199Q mutant is shown in Fig. 2. The binding profile shows a shift of maximal binding to pH 7.0. When the pH is raised to 8.0, specific binding dropped to about 40% of that at pH 7.0 for the mutant, while it did not change for the wild type. This indicates that the positive charge of Lys plays a predominant role in the pH dependence of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding. Similar profile is observed when [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide binds to wild-type AT1 receptor (Fig. 2). This clearly establishes the complementarity of interaction between Lys and C-terminal carboxylate of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. However, the pH-binding profiles of losartan with the mutant K199Q and the wild-type receptor were identical. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding to wild-type receptor at pH 6-9 is consistent with a salt bridge involving a Lys, but the pH optimum of 6.5-7.0 for losartan binding suggests that its negatively charged tetrazole group (pKa = 6, see (13Carini D.J. Duncia J.V. Aldrich P.E. Chiu P.T. Johnson A.L. Pierce M.E. Price W.A. Santella III, J.B. Wells G.J. Wexler R.R. Wong P.C. Yoo S.-E. Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2525-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) interacts with a basic residue that deprotonates closer to neutral pH. These observations lead us to question if Lys is indeed the common counterion for both carboxylate- and tetrazole-containing ligands. We investigated this question by substitution of Ala (K199A), Glu (K199E), or Arg (K199R) for Lys (Fig. 3, Table 1). Electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding could account for interaction of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide with these mutants (21Hsieh K.-H. Marshall G.R. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We conclude that the effects of modifying the Lys positive charge are consistent with its being the exclusive counterion for peptidyl ligands. This conclusion supports the observation of Yamano et al.(5Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-F. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The role of the positive charge of Lys in losartan binding is unclear because a Gln substitution does not affect its binding and an Arg substitution unexpectedly led to reduction of binding affinity. It is possible that the binding interaction of tetrazole might be different from a conventional salt bridge interaction. This viewpoint is supported by the observation that the affinity of a variety of carboxyl-containing non-peptide antagonists is reduced (5-fold for Exp7711 and 14-fold for L-159,810; see (11Prendergast K. Adams K. Greenlee W.J. Nachbar R.B. Patchett A.A. Underwood D.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Design. 1994; 8: 491-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in the K199Q mutant (Table 1, Fig. 3). Therefore, the carboxyl-containing non-peptides display all properties of a salt bridge interaction with Lys. Moreover, this indicates that peptide to non-peptide differences do not drive non-peptide antagonists to bind at a different basic residue on the receptor. Assuming that the tetrazole group of losartan occupies the same space as the carboxyl group of EXP7711 within the receptor binding pocket, then the enthalpic contribution of Gln or Lys side chains should be identical for losartan binding. Alternatively, because of its larger size, the tetrazole may make additional contacts with potential neighboring residues. In a molecular model of the AT1 receptor, the His side chain from helix 6 (Fig. 1A) appeared to point toward Lys, 2S. Karnik and S.-S. Sung, unpublished observations. and, thus, could potentially act as an additional counterion residue or as a hydrogen bond donor. As shown in Table 1, single-residue replacement of His with Ala, Gln, and Glu indicated that its contribution to losartan binding affinity is small if any. However, double mutant K199A/H256A showed a loss of affinity that is larger than the additive single mutant affinities toward both the ligands (Table 2). Substitution of an Arg at position 256 caused 30-fold loss of losartan binding affinity without significantly affecting [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding. In the double mutant K199A/H256R, however, the binding affinities of losartan and [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were significantly improved, in comparison to the double mutant K199A/H256A. Hence, for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding, an Arg substituted for His can restore the loss of the Lys side chain. However, the restoration of losartan binding affinity is only partial, indicating that the configuration of the residue at position 199 is also important to losartan binding. We conclude that in both K199R and H256R mutants, the Arg substitution might disrupt the normal function of His and Lys, respectively, in losartan binding.Table 2 Open table in a new tab These results indicate that the positive charge of the 199 residue is the most important electrostatic interaction required for [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding affinity. By contrast, losartan binding requires a side chain bearing an amino group, but it is not necessary that this group be protonated. The straightforward explanation may be that both Lys and His participate in tetrazole binding. The role of His may be secondary in the wild-type receptor. Therefore, in the K199Q and K199A mutants, removal of the charge is presumably compensated by His through a change of its pKa(23Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), which then allows it to function as an alternate counterion in the same microenvironment as Lys (see (24Rao V.R. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) for similar examples). In the double mutant K199A/H256A, this environment for tetrazole binding may be altered substantially, since the Ala side chain is smaller than that of either Lys or His (Table 2). This could result in the formation of a cavity in the receptor structure(25Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.-J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Mathews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 179-183Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar), such that the tetrazole group probably cannot make van der Waals contacts with either of the substituted Ala residues. The cavity in the pocket is expected to affect [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding affinity as well (Table 2). The Arg substitution in the mutant K199A/H256R probably allowed the restoration of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding by filling the cavity in addition to restoring the positive charge. The positive charge of Arg could satisfy losartan but the bulkier Arg side chain may cause steric problems, explaining partial improvement of affinity compared to that of K199A/H256A mutant. A conventional hydrogen bond interaction between tetrazole and receptor must also be considered because such an interaction is probably involved in the binding of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-amide and Ang II-amide(21Hsieh K.-H. Marshall G.R. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 1968-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, since conventional hydrogen bonds are weak interactions, loss of such an interaction in the mutant K199A, for example, could not account for the observed 10-fold decrease in binding affinity. The observation that a Gln can perfectly substitute for Lys must indicate that either the -amide group of Gln or the -amino group of Lys are involved in a direct interaction with the tetrazole of losartan. Receptor/ligand interactions in which sp2 nitrogen atoms form a stacked interaction with aromatic rings or form an amino/aromatic hydrogen bond are known(26Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1994; 362: 350-353Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell J.B.O. Nandi L. McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 315-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Lys with its sp3 nitrogen cannot form stacked interaction but could interact with planar aromatic rings. 3J. B. O. Mitchell and J. Thornton, personal communication. This might explain why Lys and Gln side chains have the same effect on losartan binding affinity and on the apparent pH dependence of binding. Such interactions may be further stabilized by additional interactions, with His, for instance. A Lys-aromatic interaction between receptor and ligand has not been reported before. In support of this suggestion, Duncia et al.(12Duncia J.-V. Chiu A.T. Carini D.J. Gregory G.B. Johnson A.L. Price W.A. Wells G.J. Wong P.C. Calabrese J.C. Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. J. Med.

Furthermore, disruption of the conjugation in the terminal ring of the biphenyl reduces the binding affinity(3Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.G. Chin A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J.

Thus, exploitation of the novel interaction in the tetrazole binding subsite of the AT1 receptor might be worthy of consideration in future drug design. The conclusion that the same space is occupied by tetrazole and the carboxylate groups seems justified. This provides an experimental basis for docking peptides and non-peptide ligands to a common site on the AT1 receptor in modeling the receptor-ligand complex. In structurally related peptide hormone receptors for the neurokinins, research so far has shown that critical binding determinants for peptide ligands do not participate in the binding of the non-peptide ligands(22Strader C.D.

https://openalex.org/W1970734629,"FKBP-12 (FKBP), the soluble receptor for the immunosuppresant drug FK-506, is tightly bound to the calcium release channel (CRC)/ryanodine receptor (RyR) of skeletal muscle terminal cisternae (TC) of sarcoplasmic reticulum with a stoichiometry of 4 mol of FKBP per tetrameric RyR complex. FKBP displays cis/trans-peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity which is inhibited by FK-590 or rapamycin. In skeletal muscle TC, FK-590 or rapamycin binds to and dissociates FKBP from the RyR in a time- and temperature-dependent manner which increases the open probability of the channel. Therefore, the net energized Ca2+ uptake rate of TC vesicles devoid of FKBP is reduced due to the increased leak of Ca2+ from the TC specifically via the RyR, which is reversed upon rebinding of FKBP. Thus, the RyR is modulated by FKBP (Timerman, A. P., Ogunbumni, E., Freund, E. A., Wiederrecht, G., Marks, A. R., and Fleischer, S.(1993) J. Biol.

We now find that FKBP can be displaced from the FKBP•RyR complex by exchange with FKBP in solution. The EC50 for exchange is 0.30 μM for wild type FKBP versus 0.6 to 2.4 μM for three different site-directed mutants that are practically devoid of any measurable PPIase activity. Substitution of wild-type FKBP on the RyR complex with these PPIase-deficient mutants did not alter the Ca2+ flux of TC vesicles, whereas dissociation of FKBP from TC with FK-590 increased the Ca2+ leak rate. Our studies show that, in vivo, the FKBP•RyR complex is in equilibrium with the cytosolic pool of FKBP (∼3 μM) and suggest that modulation of the CRC by FKBP is independent of PPIase activity.

INTRODUCTIONThe intracellular calcium release channels are a new class of channels characterized by their large size and 4-fold symmetry. Their importance is in intracellular signaling via Ca2+. There are two types, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: RyRryanodine receptorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonateCRCcalcium release channelE-C couplingexcitation-contraction couplingFKBP refers to FKBP-12the FK-506 binding protein of 12 kda; GST/FKBP is the fusion protein of glutathione transferase with FKBPIHMimidazole homogenization mediumLTlongitudinal tubules of sarcoplasmic reticulumPPIasecis/trans-peptidyl-prolyl isomeraseSRsarcoplasmic reticulumTCterminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. )and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The ryanodine receptors from skeletal muscle (isoform 1, RyR-1) and heart (isoform 2, RyR-2) are involved in Ca2+ release in excitation-contraction coupling (Fleischer and Inui, 1989).Most of the ryanodine receptor extends out from the junctional face membrane of the terminal cisternae of SR into the myoplasm. In skeletal muscle, the ryanodine receptor is in junctional contact with the transverse tubule to form the triad junction. The receptor is activated to release Ca2+ from the SR by sensing the depolarization of the transverse tubule. The ryanodine receptor or calcium release channel (CRC) has now been extensively characterized and has been cloned and expressed. (For reviews, see Coronado et al. (1994), Fleischer and Inui(1989), and McPherson and Campbell(1993).) The mass of the native CRC is 2.3 million daltons (Saito et al., 1989) which is, by far, the largest ion channel complex known. Image enhancement analysis of electron micrographs of the purified CRC reveals a striking 4-fold symmetry (Wagenknecht et al., 1989). Until recently, the native CRC was considered to be a homotetramer, consisting of four 565,000-dalton protomers (Takeshima et al., 1989; Zorzatto et al., 1990).Recently, FKBP has been found to be tightly associated with the ryanodine receptor (Jayaraman et al., 1992). FKBP, the soluble receptor for the immunosuppressive drug FK-506, is a polypeptide of 12 kDa found in the cytosol of most eukaryotic cells. The discovery of the association of FKBP with the RyR derives from our cloning and sequencing studies (Marks et al., 1989, 1990). Peptide sensitivity mapping was carried out on the purified skeletal muscle CRC. Twenty-four peptides were generated and located on the surface of the CRC (Marks et al., 1990). One additional peptide was isolated (Marks et al., 1989) which was not part of the primary sequence of the ryanodine receptor protomer (Takeshima et al., 1989) and was not in Genbank at that time. A later search identified this peptide as the N-terminal sequence of FKBP-12 (Collins, 1991). The CRC from skeletal muscle TC was then shown to contain tightly bound FKBP (Jayaraman et al., 1992). The stoichiometry of FKBP•RyR receptor was found to be 4. Thus, the native CRC of skeletal muscle SR is a heterooligomer consisting of four ryanodine receptor protomers and 4 molecules of FKBP. Its chemical formula can therefore be represented as (FKBP)4/(RyR protomer)4 (Timerman et al., 1993).FK-506 and cyclosporin A are potent immunosuppressant drugs used to prevent graft rejection following organ transplantation. Although structurally unrelated, these drugs block the same calcium-dependent mechanism necessary for transcription of the early lymphokine genes required for T-lymphocyte activation (Sigal and Dumont, 1992). FK-506 and cyclosporin A are specific ligands for two distinct families of soluble, intracellular receptors (immunophilins) termed FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP) (Siekierka et al., 1989) and cyclophilins (CyP) (Handschumaker et al., 1984), respectively. The immunophilins possess cis/trans-peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (PPIase or rotamase); that is, they catalyze the cis/trans isomerization about peptidyl-proline bonds (Harding et al., 1989; Siekierka et al., 1989). Although the PPIase activity of each immunophilin is inhibited by its specific drug, inhibition of rotamase activity is unrelated to the immunosuppressive action of the drugs. Instead, the action of these drugs results from the inhibition of calcineurin, a calmodulin-dependent/calcium-activated protein phosphatase, by the FKBP•FK-506 or cyclophilin-cyclosporin A complexes (Liu et al., 1991). The inhibition of calcineurin blocks translocation into the nucleus of the cytosolic component of NF-AT, a key transcription factor required for activation of T-lymphocytes (Schreiber and Crabtree, 1992).The finding that the CRC is tightly associated with FKBP provides a system to study the role of this immunophilin in skeletal muscle E-C coupling. We found that the characteristics of the CRC were profoundly altered by removal of FKBP and restored to normal by its rebinding. These studies provided the first evidence of a physiological role for FKBP (Mayrleitner et al., 1994; Timerman et al., 1993). FKBP regulates the CRC, by altering the sensitivity of the channel to Ca2+ (Mayrleitner et al., 1994) and/or Mg2+ (this study) and stabilizes the closed state. Our conclusion is supported by a recent study on the single channel characteristics of the cloned skeletal muscle RyR expressed in Sf9 cells in the presence and absence of FKBP (Brillantes et al., 1994). In this study, we examine the possible role of PPIase activity by FKBP on the function of the CRC by replacing bound FKBP with site-directed mutants of FKBP which are practically devoid of PPIase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following materials were provided by Merck Research Laboratories: L-683,590, or simply FK-590 (a closely related structural analogue of FK-506; FK-590 is also referred to as FK-520 in the literature); L688-977 or FK-977, an analogue of FK-590 with weaker binding affinity for FKBP-12 than FK-590; L685-818 or FK-818, an analogue of FK-590 with similar binding affinity, yet the complex of FKBP with FK-818 does not bind to or inhibit calcineurin; [3H]FK-816, a dihydropropyl derivative of FK-506; [35S]Cys-labeled wild-type FKBP; and unlabeled wild-type and mutant FKBPs. FKBPs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in TSK column buffer (20 mM NaPO4, pH 6.8, 50 mM Na2SO4, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography on either: 1) a Bio-Sil TSK-125 column (21.5 mm × 60 cm, Bio-Rad) or 2) a TSK-GEL G2000SW column (21.5 mm × 60 cm, TosoHaas) as described previously (Wiederrecht et al., 1992). The gel exclusion purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon stir cell fitted with a YM3 membrane. The specific activity of the [35S]FKBP-12 used in the time span of these experiments ranged from 950 to 250 cpm/pmol.With regard to the net calcium loading rate assay (see later), preincubation of TC with TSK column buffer up to 10% (v/v) enhances the net calcium loading rate of TC in the cuvette assay, while incubation with 20% (v/v) or more TSK buffer reduced the net loading rate. In order to achieve final FKBP concentrations of up to 30 μM FKBP without exceeding an acceptable level of TSK column buffer, several of the recombinant FKBP preparations were further concentrated on a Centricon 3 ultrafiltration device (Amicon) and diluted with PS buffer (20 mM NaPO4, pH 6.8, containing 100 mM NaCl) to final protein concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 6.5 mg/ml. Recombinant FKBP preparations isolated at higher concentrations were diluted 5- to 10-fold into PS buffer to final concentrations of 3 to 5 mg/ml. For all experiments in this study, TC vesicles were diluted from stocks of 7.5 to 15 mg of protein/ml in imidazole homogenization medium (IHM; 5 mM imidazole chloride, pH 7.4, 0.3 M sucrose, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) to 2.5 mg of protein/ml in IHM containing 5% (v/v) TSK column buffer.General MethodsThe protein concentrations of SR membrane fractions and purified FKBPs were determined by the Folin reaction (Lowry et al., 1951) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were performed on at least three different preparations of TC vesicles with either wild-type or mutant FKBPs.Isolation of Longitudinal Tubules, Terminal Cisternae, and Skeletal Muscle CytosolLongitudinal tubules (LT) and TC of SR were isolated from New Zealand White rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (Chu et al., 1988; Saito et al., 1984; Inui et al., 1987). The cytosolic fraction of skeletal muscle was the high speed supernatant fraction obtained following sedimentation of the microsomes from the initial blendate or I-series (Chu et al., 1988).[3H]FK-816 Binding Assays[3H]FK-816 binding isotherms to the cytosol fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle was determined as described previously (Timerman et al., 1993) in the presence of 0.5% CHAPS from 1 to 30 nM [3H]FK-816 (which has essentially the same binding characteristics as FK-506) using the Sephadex LH-20 column method (Handschumaker et al., 1984) to separate bound from free ligand.Measurement of FKBP in the Myoplasm of Skeletal MuscleThe [3H]FK-816 binding parameters to rabbit skeletal cytosol were determined by Scatchard analysis using conditions of the binding assay described above. The Bmax value for the cytosol fraction was obtained by multiplying the Bmax value for the I-series supernatant (Chu et al., 1988) by a factor of 20 (×5 (5:1 ratio of homogenization medium to muscle wet weight) and ×4 (estimate that the cytosol accounts for about 25% of the tissue wet weight)).FK-506 Binding ActivityThis refers to the [3H]FK-816 binding capacity for each wild type and mutant FKBP preparation. The binding capacity was determined from [3H]FK-816 binding assays at a constant concentration of 25 nM or 1.86 ng/ml [3H]FK-816 (which is 50 times the Kd value of 0.5 nM for [3H]FK-816 binding to wild-type FKBP-12) at a concentration range of 0.63 to 6.3 nM (7.4 to 74 ng of FKBP/ml).Peptidyl-Prolyl cis/trans-Isomerase Activity of Recombinant FKBPsThe PPIase activity of each FKBP preparation is presented as the first order rate constant for the hydrolysis of N-succinyl-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin (Siekierka et al., 1989). The precision of the assay is ±0.1%.Exchange Isotherms of [35S]FKBP to Terminal Cisternae and Longitudinal TubulesExchange isotherms of [35S]FKBP to TC or LT were performed by incubation of vesicles (at 2.5 mg/ml) with 0.125 to 3.0 μM [35S]FKBP for 20 min at 37°C. Nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of a 10-fold excess of cold FKBP at each concentration of labeled protein. The nonspecific exchange is about 10% of specific [35S]FKBP binding to TC, detectable after diluting the specific activity of [35S]FKBP by 10-fold (Fig. 2). A more accurate estimate of nonspecific binding to TC requires significantly greater concentrations of unlabeled FKBP, or the data could be corrected by calculation. The data given in the tables were not corrected. Thus, the apparent Bmax value for specific (i.e. total minus nonspecific) binding of [35S]FKBP to TC shown in Fig. 2B is an underestimate of the true Bmax value by about 10% or 10 pmol/mg of TC.Preparation of Prelabeled Terminal Cisternae 2Summary of terms used for modified terminal cisternae samples: TC vesicles typically bind about 100 pmol of [3H]FK-816 per mg of TC (Timerman et al., 1993). This is equivalent to a concentration of bound FKBP of about 0.25 μM at 2.5 mg of protein/ml of suspension of TC. A variety of treatments were carried out at this concentration of TC to yield modified types of TC, defined as follows. 1) Drug-control TC, samples incubated with FK-590 for up to several hours in the cold (0-4°C). Little or no drug binding or dissociation of bound FKBP occurs under these conditions. 2) Drug-treated TC, bound FKBP is dissociated from the CRC by incubation at 37°C for 20 min with 1.25 or 2.5 μM FK-590 (i.e. 5 to 10 times higher than the concentration of bound FKBP). 3) FKBP-stripped TC, drug-treated TC which have been sedimented to remove the released soluble FKBP which remains in the supernatant as the drug complex (80 to 90% of FKBP is removed). 4) Reconstituted TC, TC prepared from drug-treated or FKBP-stripped TC by rebinding FKBP in the cold (0-4°C) using a 2-fold molar excess of FKBP to drug (1.25 or 2.5 μM) which was used to dissociate bound FKBP. 5) Exchanged TC, bound FKBP is exchanged with soluble FKBP (∼2 μM) for 20 min at 37°C. 6) Prelabeled TC, TC exchanged with [35S]FKBP. 7) Re-exchanged TC, prelabeled TC which have been exchanged yet again with unlabeled FKBP.2Summary of terms used for modified terminal cisternae samples: TC vesicles typically bind about 100 pmol of [3H]FK-816 per mg of TC (Timerman et al., 1993). This is equivalent to a concentration of bound FKBP of about 0.25 μM at 2.5 mg of protein/ml of suspension of TC.

These protocols generally yield 80% recovery of total protein and greater than 90% recovery of the net calcium loading rate (expressed as micromoles of calcium per min per mg of protein). The prelabeled TC is useful for quantitation of displacement (by exchange or dissociation) of bound [35S]FKBP.Displacement of bound [35S]FKBP from prelabeled TC by dissociation with FKBP ligands (such as FK-590) or by “re-exchange” with unlabeled wild type or mutant FKBP preparations was performed by incubation of prelabeled vesicles (2.5 mg/ml) at 37°C for 20 min. Following incubation, the amount of [35S]FKBP bound to the SR, in this and all other experiments, was determined as follows: 1) a 20- or 40-μl sample of SR (50 or 100 μg of protein) was diluted into 200 μl of ice cold IHM buffer and immediately sedimented in a Beckman TL100.1 rotor at 95,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to separate bound from free [35S]FKBP; 2) the pellets were rinsed with 200 μl of deionized water (room temperature) before resuspension of the pellet with a second addition of 200 μl of deionized water; 3) 35S bound to the pellet was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 4.5 ml of Cytoscint (ICN).Preparation of Drug-treated and FKBP-stripped Terminal Cisternae2The endogenous FKBP was dissociated from TC (2.5 mg/ml, which contains 0.25 μM endogenous FKBP) by incubation with either 1.25 or 2.5 μM FK-590 at 37°C for 20 min. We refer to TC resulting from this treatment as “drug-treated TC”; subsequently, “FKBP-stripped TC” can be obtained by sedimentation of drug-treated TC, in a Beckman TL100.2 rotor at 30,000 rpm for 15 min at 2°C. The soluble FKBP•FK-590 complex remaining in the supernatant was discarded, while the pellet (designated FKBP-stripped TC) was resuspended to 2.5 mg/ml in IHM buffer containing 5% (v/v) TSK column buffer. Approximately 80 to 90% of the FKBP is removed from FKBP-stripped TC prepared in this manner. We have previously referred to this preparation as FKBP-deficient TC (Timerman et al., 1993).We examined the effect of PPIase-deficient FKBP mutants to restore the net calcium loading rate of both drug-treated and FKBP-stripped TC. While assessment of rebinding (i.e. reconstitution) by each recombinant protein is more straightforward for FKBP-stripped TC (see below), the assessment of function (loading) is more complicated. For this reason, both untreated and drug-treated samples were sedimented in the same rotor to minimize handling error. Despite this precaution, small variations due to sample handling were still detectable. Therefore, the experiments shown in the results are only those performed with drug-treated TC, which eliminates one step of sample handling.Preparation of Reconstituted TC2The binding of [35S]FKBP to either drug-treated or FKBP-stripped TC vesicles is rapid (less than 3 min) even at 0-4°C. This is in contrast to the time and temperature dependence for either drug-induced dissociation or the exchange of bound FKBP with soluble [35S]FKBP (see “Results”). Therefore, ice-cold samples (200 μl) of drug-treated TC were reconstituted with FKBP by simply adding back a 2-fold molar excess of recombinant FKBP (2.5 or 5.0 μM FKBP) over the concentration of FK-590. Samples of untreated TC, drug-treated, and reconstituted TC were stored on ice until the net calcium loading rate assay (see below) for each sample was completed (4-5 h). Afterwards, reconstitution of drug-treated TC by mutant FKBPs was routinely assessed by “postlabeling” with [35S]FKBP as follows: 1) [35S]FKBP (10 μl) was directly added to 50 μl of ice-cold samples (125 μg) of either control TC, drug-treated TC, or reconstituted TC to a final concentration of 2.5 μM [35S]FKBP; 2) 25 μl of the mixture (50 μg) was immediately diluted into 200 μl of ice-cold IHM buffer, and the amount of [35S]FKBP bound to the pellet, after sedimentation in a Beckman TL100.1 rotor, was determined as described above. Since the exchange reaction is negligible in this short time at 0-4°C, the only significant binding to TC that occurs under these conditions is by direct binding (addition) of [35S]FKBP to unoccupied FKBP binding sites on TC. Therefore, drug-treated TC (i.e. FKBP dissociated but not separated from TC with FK-590) bind significantly more [35S]FKBP (85 pmol/mg) than do either control or reconstituted TC (about 15 pmol/mg TC) (Table 4)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab For FKBP-stripped TC, the interpretation of this post-labeling protocol is straightforward. For drug-treated TC, the probability that a significant percentage of endogenous FKBP that was dissociated by binding FK-590 rebinds to TC under these conditions is unlikely since 1) in the cold, added [35S]FKBP (or unlabeled FKBP) binds rapidly to drug-treated TC (less than 3 min), yet the exchange reaction is negligible; 2) recombinant FKBPs are added in 10- to 20-fold excess over endogenous FKBP. Therefore, the concentration of endogenous FKBP is no more than 5-10% of the total FKBP; and 3) the FKBP•drug complex does not bind to the RyR, and the endogenous wild-type FKBP has a higher affinity for FK-590 than the PPIase-deficient mutants used in these experiments (Table 1). Thus, the wild-type FKBP in the main remains in the supernatant complexed with FK-590. Western blot analysis of drug-treated TC, reconstituted with recombinant fusion proteins (for example GST/FKBP), which can be distinguished from wild-type FKBP by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirms that little (if any) endogenous FKBP rebinds to TC under these conditions (not shown). Therefore, this post-labeling protocol provides a rapid assay to assess reconstitution of drug-treated TC with mutant FKBPs. The more complete the reconstitution with unlabeled FKBP, the less [35S]FKBP is bound in the postlabeling assay (Table 4).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Calcium Loading Rate AssaysThe calcium loading rate of TC vesicles was monitored spectrophotometrically with the calcium indicator antipyrylazo III essentially as described previously (Fleischer et al., 1985; Timerman et al., 1993). TC vesicles (25 μg of protein) were added to 1 ml of loading medium (100 mM KPO4, pH 7.0, 0.2 mM antipyrylazo III, and 1 mM ATP) containing 3 to 20 mM MgCl2, as indicated. Ca2+ loading was initiated with the addition of 1 mM ATP. Following the uptake of contaminating calcium, aliquots of 5 to 50 μM CaCl2 (as indicated in each figure) were pulsed into the cuvette, and the calcium uptake rate was monitored by dual wavelength spectrophotometry (710-790 nm) in a Hewlett Packard 8451A diode array spectrophotometer. Following the various treatments described above (generally a 20-min incubation at 37°C), TC samples were stored on ice until the calcium loading rate was measured with little, if any, loss of activity for up to 6 or 7 h.Calcium loading rates were obtained in a medium containing either low (3 to 4 mM) or high (10 mM) Mg2+. In low Mg2+ buffer, the rate was calculated for several pulses of 12.5 μM calcium. Since the loading rate is sometimes reduced with each additional pulse (as shown in Fig. 7), the uptake rates were calculated by averaging the rates from the first three pulses of calcium. In high Mg2+ loading medium, the rate was determined in response to a single pulse of 50 μM calcium. With regard to the effect of FK-590 on the calcium loading rate of TC, similar results were obtained by the two different loading rate protocols, i.e. drug-treated TC consistently have about 60% of the net calcium loading rate of either untreated TC or drug-control TC.The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values obtained for either the calcium loading rates and/or [35S]FKBP displacement from prelabeled TC in Fig. 3, 5A, and 5B were generated by fitting the data to the generalized ligand binding equation: y = (a)/[1 + (x/b)c] by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot (Marquart-Levenberg algorithm), where a represents the 100% (or full range of) activity or binding values, b is the EC50 value, and c represents the slope response where a value of 1 indicates a normal, hyperbolic response (Limbird, 1986).Figure 3Exchange of FKBP mutants with [35S]FKBP on prelabeled TC. Prelabeled TC (88 pmol of [35S]FKBP per mg of protein) were incubated with graded concentrations of unlabeled wild-type or mutant FKBP for 20 min at 37°C; the amount of [35S]FKBP remaining in the pellet was then determined following sedimentation of the TC in a Beckman TL100.1 rotor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The unlabeled recombinant proteins used in this experiment include (from left to right): Y82F (◊), wild-type FKBP (○), F36Y (•), L30A (▿), W59H (▴), F99Y (▾), and Y26F (□). The EC50 values obtained from two experiments for each FKBP preparation is summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSExchange of Bound FKBP with Soluble [35S]FKBPWe have previously developed methodology to release the tightly bound FKBP from TC by incubation with FK-590 or rapamycin. The drugs bind to bound FKBP in a temperature-dependent manner and the resulting drug•FKBP complex is released from the TC (Timerman et al., 1993). We now describe an exchange reaction in which bound FKBP is displaced from the FKBP•RyR complex with soluble FKBP added to a suspension of TC vesicles.The time and temperature dependence for exchange of bound FKBP is presented in Fig. 1. The exchange rate is greatly accelerated by increasing the temperature from 0°C to 37°C. At 0-4°C, 15-20% of the total [35S]FKBP-12 binding sites are filled instantly with little additional binding or exchange thereafter for up to 2 h. Thus, the rate of exchange for soluble [35S]FKBP is very slow at 0-4°C, perhaps a few percent in 2 h. At 37°C, the half-time (t1/2) to saturate the remaining binding sites (i.e. those that are not rapidly filled at 0-4°C) is less than 5 min, while at 22°C the t1/2 is greater than 1 h. The temperature effect on the kinetics of the exchange reaction resembles that observed for [3H]FK-816 binding/dissociation of bound FKBP-12 (Timerman et al., 1993).Figure 1Time and temperature dependence for exchange of bound FKBP-12 by [35S]FKBP-12. The time course for total binding (i.e. exchange) of [35S]FKBP-12 to TC vesicles (2.5 mg/ml) was measured in IHM buffer containing 2 μM [35S]FKBP-12 at either 37°C (•), ambient temperature (22°C, ○), or on ice (0 to 4°C, ▄). The reaction was quenched at the indicated time point by diluting an aliquot of 20 μl (50 μg of TC) into 200 μl of ice-cold IHM buffer. The amount of bound [35S]FKBP-12 was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the TC following the separation of free from bound [35S]FKBP-12 by sedimentation in a Beckman TL 100.1 rotor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each data point represents the average ± S.D. obtained from four different TC preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

When mouse mast cells, derived by culture of bone marrow cells with WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin (IL)-3 (BMMC), were cultured in recombinant c-<i>kit</i> ligand (KL), sensitized with IgE, and stimulated with antigen, PGD<sub>2</sub> generation increased 3-fold; when KL was combined with IL-3, IL-9, or IL-10, PGD<sub>2</sub> generation increased 6-8-fold above that produced by the cells cultured in IL-3 alone. The increased IgE-dependent PGD<sub>2</sub> generation by BMMC was apparent after 1 day of culture, reached a maximum after 2-4 days of culture, and was dose-dependent for KL and for each of the accessory cytokines. IgE-dependent generation of leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> increased 2-fold after the cells were cultured with KL and was not increased by the addition of IL-3, IL-9, or IL-10. Assays for steady-state transcripts by RNA blotting, for protein by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, and for function by enzymatic activities revealed that KL alone stimulated the increased expression of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>), prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS)-1, and the terminal enzyme, hematopoietic PGD<sub>2</sub> synthase, without a change in expression of 5-lipoxygenase. IL-3, IL-9, and IL-10 each enhanced the KL-induced expression of PGHS-1. In contrast, transcripts for PGHS-2, which were detected transiently after the cells had been cultured for 5 h in KL + IL-3, were not expressed during the period of subsequent increase in IgE-dependent PGD<sub>2</sub> generation. These findings demonstrate that KL up-regulates expression of cPLA<sub>2</sub>, PGHS-1, and hematopoietic PGD<sub>2</sub> synthase, leading to a relatively selective increase in IgE-dependent production of PGD<sub>2</sub> from endogenously released arachidonic acid in BMMC, and they provide the first example of cytokine regulation of hematopoietic PGD<sub>2</sub> synthase."

PAO caused a rapid dosedependent inhibition of superoxide generation which was maximal at a concentration of 1 μM, irrespective of the stimulating agent. This inhibitory effect was not due to impaired transduction of activation signals since neither degranulation nor phagocytosis were modified. When cytosolic and membrane fractions from resting neutrophils were combined to reconstitute the NADPH oxidase, O2generation was inhibited by PAO while translocation of the NADPH oxidase components to the plasma membrane fraction was not affected. The inhibition was completely and specifically reversed by 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, not by dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, indicating that PAO binds covalently to spatially vicinal thiol groups. PAO inhibited the plasma membrane's capacity to initiate O2generation while it apparently did not affect the cytosol. When PAO was added subsequently to NADPH oxidase activation, no inhibition was observed, indicating that PAO cannot reach its target once the oxidase is functionally assembled.

They hypothesized that CD36 receptor function is controlled by two independent structural domains, one of which, located in the region from amino acids 139-155, binds TSP with low affinity and then induces a conformational change in TSP, resulting in high affinity binding to a region from amino acids 93-110 in CD36. Asch et al.(46Asch A.S. Liu I. Bricetti F.M. Barnwell J. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have further proposed that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CD36 at Thr92 might control TSP binding. They also showed, using small synthetic peptides that a domain encompassing residues 87-99 bound TSP, although its affinity, stoichiometry, and effect on TSP binding to cells were not measured. To address these issues we have constructed a series of recombinant bacterial GST/CD36 fusion proteins that span nearly all of the CD36 molecule and that include all of these putative domains, either alone or in combination. We have found that the CD36 region extending from amino acid 93 to 120 has all of the properties required of a TSP binding domain. Glutathione-agarose was obtained from Sigma.

These antibodies recognize a conformational-sensitive epitope that has not been mapped. They have been shown previously to block CD36-TSP binding(32Silverstein R.L. Asch A.S. Nachman R.L. J. Clin.

Rabbit antisera were raised against purified platelet CD36 and were specific as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot(48Pearce S.F.A. Wu J. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 384-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma and outdated platelet concentrates were obtained from the New York Blood Center. Bowes melanoma cells stably transfected with human CD36 cDNA (or control plasmid) were prepared and maintained as described previously (42Silverstein R.L. Baird M. Lo S.-K. Yesner L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16607-16612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD36 expression was confirmed prior to all studies by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats obtained from the Puget Sound Blood Center (Seattle, WA) by sequential centrifugation on Ficoll and Percoll gradients(47Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Purified monocytes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing gentamicin and supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma). Monocytes were >98% viable as determined by trypan blue exclusion. More than 90% of the purified cells were monocytes as determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a panel of anti-human monocyte monoclonal antibodies. CD36 cDNA was digested with restriction enzymes to yield seven fragments spanning ≈98% of the coding region. These include a 270-bp Sau3A fragment from bp 408-676 that encodes from amino acid 67 to 157 in intact CD36, a 620-bp SnaBI-HaeIII fragment from bp 483-1103 that encodes from amino acid 93 to 298, a 433-bp HaeIII fragment from bp 1103-1536 that encodes from amino acid 298 to 439, a 351-bp HincII fragment from bp 1376-1737 that encodes from amino acid 390 to 471 (the carboxyl terminus), a 416-bp HpaII-PvuII fragment from bp 222-638 that encodes from amino acid 5 to 143, a 194-bp NlaIV fragment from bp 565-759 that encodes from amino acid 118 to 182, and an 82-bp SnaBI-NlaIV fragment from bp 483-565 that encodes from amino acid 93 to 120. These fragments were gel-purified and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression plasmids pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) so as to maintain reading frames downstream to the inducible LacZ promotor, and adjacent to a fragment of the recombinant glutathione S-transferase gene. GST/CD36 fusion proteins were prepared from large scale bacterial cultures by chromatography of bacterial lysates on glutathione-agarose beads. Proteins were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline after purification to remove soluble glutathione and were stored at −20°C. Their orientation within native CD36 is shown in Fig. 1. All plasmid constructs were mapped and insertion sites sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to confirm that the fusion protein sequences were correct and in frame. The fusion proteins were also examined by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to confirm size and document CD36 immunoreactivity. Molecular weights of the fusion proteins were also determined by nondenaturing PAGE analysis as well as by gel filtration (Superose 12, Pharmacia). The molecular weights are listed in the legend of Fig. 1 and were within the calculated range with less than 5% difference between the calculated and experimentally determined values. Sizing chromatography also indicated that the fusion proteins did not form dimers or larger multimers. In addition, none of the fusion proteins bound to purified intact CD36 in solid phase binding assays. For some experiments the CD36 peptides were cleaved and eluted from the fusion proteins bound to the agarose beads by treatment with thrombin or factor Xa. The protease was then removed by incubation with benzamidine-Sepharose. TSP, CD36, and GST/CD36 fusion proteins were labeled with Na125I using immobilized chloramine T (IODOBEAD; Pierce) as described previously(41Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 79: 867-874Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 49McGregor J.L. Catimel B. Parmentier S. Clezardin P. Dechavanne M. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was determined for each of the labeled proteins prior to each experiment and ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 μCi/μg. Solid phase binding assays were used to quantify TSP interactions with CD36 and recombinant GST/CD36 fusion proteins. One of the ligands (e.g. TSP, CD36, or fusion protein) was immobilized on wells in a detachable 96 microwell plate by overnight incubation at 4°C. Saturable coating conditions were first determined using radiolabeled proteins. CD36 was thus adsorbed at 4 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, whereas TSP and fusion proteins were adsorbed at 10 μg/ml in carbonate buffer (100 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.8). The amount of protein coated on the wells ranged from 200-280 ng. The wells were then washed three times with 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) and then blocked with TBS-Tween containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Radiolabeled ligands were then added in TBS-Tween containing 1 mM CaCl2 and the mixture incubated for 3 h at 22°C. The wells were then washed thoroughly three to four times with TBS-Tween, dried, and bound radioactivity quantified by γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by carrying out the binding in the presence of 5 mM EDTA or excess unlabeled ligand and was generally less than 10% of total. For competition experiments the competing proteins were added along with the labeled protein and incubated for 3 h. Binding of 125I-TSP to suspensions of CD36-transfected Bowes melanoma cells or peripheral blood monocytes was measured as described previously(41Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 79: 867-874Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Silverstein R.L. Baird M. Lo S.-K. Yesner L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16607-16612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were done using 0.045 μM input concentrations of 125I-TSP and CD36 or GST/CD36 fusion proteins at concentrations of 100-500 nM. Binding of radiolabeled TSP to recombinant immobilized GST/CD36 fusion proteins was time-dependent, reaching equilibrium at ≈2 h. As shown in Fig. 2, binding of 125I-TSP (0.045 μM) to a representative fusion protein, 93-298, was completely reversed at equilibrium by the addition of a 10-fold excess (0.5 μM) of unlabeled TSP. Dissociation was rapid and complete by 30 min. Equilibrium binding studies were carried out for all seven fusion proteins both by immobilizing the fusion proteins and using labeled TSP as the ligand or by immobilizing TSP and using labeled fusion proteins as the ligand. As shown in Fig. 3, upper panel, three of the fusion proteins (67-157, 93-298, and 5-143) bound to immobilized TSP in a concentration-dependent manner with similar affinity as purified intact platelet CD36. Two proteins (390-471 and 298-439) did not bind TSP, demonstrating specificity. These data suggest that the TSP binding domain lies within the 50-amino acid overlap region between residues 93 and 143 shared by the three peptides. To define this domain more precisely and to explore the potential role of the regulatory sequence (residues 139-155) proposed by Leung et al.(45Leung L.L.K. Li W.-K. Mcgregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we studied the binding of TSP to two additional fusion proteins FP93-120 and FP118-182. As seen in Fig. 3, lower panel, both of these peptides bound to TSP in a saturable manner.Figure 3:Binding of 125I-GST/CD36 fusion proteins to immobilized TSP. 125I-CD36 or 125I-fusion proteins were added in increasing concentrations to immobilized TSP for 3 h at 22°C. The binding isotherms in the upper panel represent CD36 (○), FP93-298 (▵), FP67-157 ( ⋄), FP298-439 (▿), FP390-471 ( ▴), and FP5-143 ( ▾). The binding isotherms in the lower panel represent FP93-120 (○) and FP118-182 (▵). The figures are drawn from one data set whereas the dissociation constants are calculated as a mean of all the data sets (n = 6), and the errors are calculated as standard deviation (S.D.). The apparent dissociation constants for each curve were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting and are as follows: CD36, 227 ± 19.89 nM; FP93-298, 305 ± 32 nM; FP67-157, 153 ± 16.6 nM; FP5-143, 35 ± 3.7 nM; FP93-120, 8.6 ± 3.6 nM; and FP118-182, 67.3 ± 11.5 nM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar saturation binding isotherms to those in Fig. 3 were obtained when CD36 fusion proteins were immobilized and labeled TSP was used as a ligand or when CD36 peptides cleaved from the CD36/GST fusion proteins replaced the fusion proteins in these assays (data not shown). All of the binding data were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting program ENZFITTER (by Robin J. Leatherbarrow, Elsevier Biosoft). Apparent dissociation constants are listed in the figure legends. Analysis of these binding data using the program LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft) gave best fits for a single site model. To estimate stoichiometry, the amount of immobilized fusion protein was determined by measuring radiolabeled protein adsorbed to the wells at saturating (10 μg/ml) input concentrations. Bound TSP was then determined as the Bmax (maximal velocity) from the binding isotherm (Fig. 3). From these data we determined that ≈ 2.4 ± 0.2 GST/CD36 fusion protein molecules complexed with each TSP, consistent with the homotrimeric structure of TSP. Several approaches were used to demonstrate specificity of the binding interactions between GST/CD36 fusion proteins and TSP. We found, as shown in Fig. 4, that fluid phase CD36 blocked the interaction of 125I-TSP with the immobilized CD36/GST fusion proteins in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values very similar to the calculated kd values. Similarly, displacement studies using increasing amounts of unlabeled TSP along with a fixed concentration (3 nM) of labeled TSP (data not shown) revealed IC50 values similar to the calculated kd values. As shown in Fig. 5, we found that TSP binding was blocked by >95% by a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled TSP or by inhibitory murine monoclonal antibodies to either CD36 (8A6; 1 μg/ml) or TSP (11.4 or 46.4; 10 μg/ml). Control antibodies had no effect. Murine monoclonal anti-CD36 8A6 was only a partial inhibitor of TSP binding to FP93-120 and FP118-182.Figure 5:Specificity of TSP interactions with GST/CD36 fusion proteins. Binding of 125I-TSP to immobilized GST/CD36 fusion proteins was determined in the presence of 1 mM calcium (□), 5 mM EDTA ( ▪), 0.45 μM unlabeled TSP (open column with ×s), 1 μg/ml murine anti-CD36 IgG 8A6 (), and 10 μg•ml murine anti-TSP IgG 45.1 (n = 6; error calculated as S.D.). Bound TSP values for the GST/CD36 fusion proteins are compared with the values obtained with immobilized intact platelet-derived CD36.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6, the five GST/CD36 peptides that bound TSP in solid phase binding assays were also effective inhibitors of TSP complex formation with intact platelet-derived CD36. The control fusion proteins (298-439 and 390-471) had no effect. The IC50 values are listed in the figure legends and are comparable with the kd values derived from the radioligand binding studies. Inhibition of binding of TSP to cell surface CD36 was examined using Bowes melanoma cells stably transfected with the CD36 cDNA and purified peripheral blood monocytes. We have shown previously that Bowes CD36 transfectants acquired the capacity to bind TSP in a specific, calcium-dependent manner(42Silverstein R.L. Baird M. Lo S.-K. Yesner L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16607-16612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show, as seen in Fig. 7, that the GST/CD36 fusion proteins 93-298, 67-157, 93-120 and 118-182 at concentrations ≤ 500 nM blocked 125I-TSP binding to these cells, whereas FP298-439 or GST alone had no effect. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 8, these fusion proteins also blocked 125I-TSP binding to peripheral blood monocytes. Interestingly, FP93-120 which showed a 5-fold higher affinity than the other peptides in the solid phase in vitro assays did not show effective inhibition of cellular TSP binding at the lower concentration. Effective inhibition was only seen at the same concentration as that observed for the larger fusion proteins (100-200 nM), suggesting that the solid phase assay provided an overestimate of the true affinity.Figure 8:GST/CD36 fusion proteins block binding to 125I-TSP binding to peripheral blood monocytes. GST/CD36 fusion proteins were added to a cell suspension of purified peripheral blood monocytes (106 cells) in the presence of a fixed concentration of 125I-TSP. After incubation for 30 min at 4°C, bound and free radioactivity were separated by centrifugation through silicone oil. The binding of 125I-TSP to monocytes in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 (column 1), 5 mM EDTA (column 2), 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG 8A6 (column 3), 500 nM of FP93-298 (column 4), 500 nM of FP67-157 (column 5), 500 nM of FP93-120 (column 6), 500 nM of FP118-182 (column 7), 1 μM of FP298-439 (column 8), and 1 μM of GST (column 9) are shown (n = 4; error calculated as S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 5(closed bars) EDTA completely inhibited the specific binding of TSP to immobilized CD36 and to all of the GST/CD36 fusion proteins except FP118-182. The significance of this calcium-independent interaction between FP118-182 and TSP is unclear, since TSP did not bind to intact CD36 in the absence of calcium. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 9, in the absence of calcium, neither intact CD36 nor the fusion proteins containing the 50-amino acid overlap region (residues 93-143) were able to block the interaction between FP118-182 and TSP. FP93-298, which includes both the 93-143 overlap and the 118-182 domain, also did not block calcium independent binding to FP118-182. Murine monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG 8A6, which blocked TSP binding to purified platelet CD36, monocytes, CD36-transfected melanoma cells, and GST/CD36 fusion proteins 67-157, 93-298, and 5-143 only partially blocked binding of TSP to 118-182. No additive effect of FP118-182 on the calcium-dependent binding of TSP to cells by 93-120 was seen (Fig. 7). In contrast to the studies of Leung et al.(45Leung L.L.K. Li W.-K. Mcgregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a synthetic peptide containing residues 139-154, we did not observe any augmentation of TSP binding to cells or to purified CD36 in the presence of FP118-182 and calcium. In fact, as seen in Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:, FP118-182 inhibited TSP-CD36 and TSP-cell interactions. Recombinant GST/CD36 fusion proteins produced by bacteria were used to map the TSP binding domain of CD36. Bacterial fusion proteins may have certain advantages compared with synthetic peptides in domain analysis, because larger regions can be examined and radiolabeling can be accomplished without affecting the sequence. Our results showed specific, saturable, and reversible complex formation between TSP and four fusion proteins that share a 27-amino acid region of overlap between positions 93 and 120. As with intact CD36, we also found that binding was calcium-dependent. Numerous approaches were undertaken to demonstrate that these binding interactions were specific and not related to artifactual influences of protein immobilization on polystyrene. We found in all cases that binding of radiolabeled ligands was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled protein. In addition, binding was independent of which ligand was immobilized, and was blocked by monoclonal antibodies to both CD36 and TSP. Similar binding of TSP to CD36 peptides cleaved by thrombin or Factor Xa from the GST moiety and the lack of binding to fusion proteins not containing the 27-amino acid region demonstrated that complex formation was not related to the GST portion of the fusion proteins. We also demonstrated that these fusion proteins competitively inhibited binding of TSP to purified platelet CD36 and to cell surface CD36 on peripheral blood monocytes and CD36 cDNA transfected melanoma cells. From analysis of the equilibrium binding isotherms we found that the four fusion proteins had somewhat higher apparent affinities than CD36 for TSP. This can be accounted for by either the size of the peptides which may allow them to form conformations more advantageous for binding to TSP or by the lack of glycosylation on the recombinant bacterial proteins which might improve exposure of the amino acids required for binding. That the smallest peptide, FP93-120, had the highest affinity favors the first explanation. In sum, these data demonstrate that peptides containing the region between amino acids 93 and 120 have all of the characteristics required of the TSP binding domain: i.e. calcium-dependent complex formation with TSP, calcium-dependent inhibition of TSP complex formation with intact CD36, inhibition of calcium-dependent TSP binding to cell surface CD36, and stoichiometry and affinity consistent with that of the intact protein. Asch et al.(46Asch A.S. Liu I. Bricetti F.M. Barnwell J. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have shown that extracellular phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a Thr residue at position 92 of CD36 regulates TSP binding, i.e. that phosphorylation blocked TSP binding and that dephosphorylation led to “activation” of CD36 as a functional TSP receptor. FP93-120 begins at position 93 and therefore does not contain Thr92, whereas FP5-143 and FP67-157 both contain Thr92. All three of these peptides bind TSP and inhibit TSP-CD36 complex formation with similar kinetics, suggesting that Thr92 is not a necessary component of the TSP binding domain. However, in vitro phosphorylation of immobilized proteins by exposure to purified protein kinase C and ATP (46Asch A.S. Liu I. Bricetti F.M. Barnwell J. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) resulted in partial inhibition of TSP binding to FP67-157 and intact CD36, but not to FP93-298 (data not shown), suggesting that on the cell surface, phosphorylation at position 92 could sterically hinder contact between TSP and the immediately adjacent binding domain. Leung et al.(45Leung L.L.K. Li W.-K. Mcgregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the region between amino acids 93 and 110 also inhibited CD36-TSP complex formation. Unlike the slightly larger FP93-120, however, this peptide did not bind directly to TSP. They reported, however, that the 93-110 peptide bound TSP if a second peptide corresponding to the region from amino acids 139-155 was included in the reaction mixture. This latter peptide was shown to bind to TSP in a calcium-independent, low affinity manner, but not to inhibit TSP-CD36 complex formation. In fact, complex formation was enhanced in the presence of this second peptide. From these data the authors put forward a two step mechanism for TSP binding; one region (amino acids 139-155) attaches to TSP and induces a conformational change in the TSP molecule exposing a second site for the second CD36 region(93-110) to bind. Our kinetic data, however, do not show a two step binding process, a change in rate in the binding interaction, or two sites in the form of a high affinity site and a low affinity site in the calculation of the apparent dissociation constant. In addition, two of the fusion proteins, 93-120 and 118-182, each contain one of the putative domains, whereas two, 67-157 and 93-298, contain both. No improvement in binding of the two-domain peptides to TSP was seen compared with FP93-120 alone nor did addition of FP118-182 enhance TSP binding to intact CD36 or any of the fusion proteins. An alternative explanation of the role of peptide 139-155 may be in stabilizing peptide 93-110 spatially so that binding to TSP becomes possible. Our results would then suggest additional amino acids from position 110-119 could serve the same function. FP118-182, the protein containing only the putative regulatory domain, does, however, present an interesting anomaly. Rather than augmenting TSP binding it inhibited binding between CD36 and TSP. FP118-182 also bound TSP in a specific, although calcium-independent, manner. The physiological significance of this calcium-independent interaction between FP118-182 and TSP is unclear, since TSP did not bind to intact CD36 in the absence of calcium, and since neither intact CD36 nor fusion proteins containing either one or both regions were able to block the calcium-independent interaction between FP118-182 and TSP. However, that the inhibitory monoclonal antibody 8A6 partially blocked binding of TSP to both FP93-120 and FP118-182 suggests that the region of CD36 containing the 118-182 sequence may be structurally close to the TSP binding domain. The simplest conclusion from our studies is that the TSP binding domain in CD36 resides in the 27-amino acid region between positions 93 and 120. Although an important regulatory role of Thr92 is supported by its location immediately adjacent to the TSP binding domain, no strong evidence supports a role for the region between amino acids 118 and 182.

In addition, an increase in specific c-Src kinase activity was observed in the cytoskeleton as well as in the cytosol and the membrane fraction. Similar effects on both c-Src redistribution and activity were seen after stimulation with epidermal growth factor.

In order to identify the domains in CD14 required for function, we deleted increasing amounts of CD14 from the C terminus. Truncated CD14 cDNA sequences were transfected into COS-7 cells and serum-free conditioned medium was analyzed for mutant CD14 expression and bioactivity. Mutant CD14s containing as few as 152 amino acids were found to have activity equivalent to full-length sCD14. To further characterize the mutant CD14, we constructed a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing sCD141-152 and purified the protein to homogeneity. sCD141-152 bound radioactive LPS, enabled U373 cells to synthesize interleukin 6 in response to LPS, and enabled human neutrophils to respond to smooth LPS. In all of these assays, the behavior of sCD141-152 was quantitatively similar to full-length sCD14. We also found that two neutralizing anti-CD14 antibodies (3C10 and MEM-18) bound and neutralized sCD141-152. We conclude from these experiments that the N-terminal 152 amino acids of CD14 are sufficient to bind LPS and confer essentially wild-type bioactivity in vitro.

Mutant CD14s containing as few as 152 amino acids were found to have activity equivalent to full-length sCD14. To further characterize the mutant CD14, we constructed a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing sCD141-152 and purified the protein to homogeneity. sCD141-152 bound radioactive LPS, enabled U373 cells to synthesize interleukin 6 in response to LPS, and enabled human neutrophils to respond to smooth LPS. In all of these assays, the behavior of sCD141-152 was quantitatively similar to full-length sCD14. We also found that two neutralizing anti-CD14 antibodies (3C10 and MEM-18) bound and neutralized sCD141-152. We conclude from these experiments that the N-terminal 152 amino acids of CD14 are sufficient to bind LPS and confer essentially wild-type bioactivity in vitro. CD14 has been identified as the principal receptor that enables leukocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines and up-regulate integrin function in response to picomolar levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1Wright S.D.

An acute phase plasma protein known as LPS-binding protein (LBP; 13) acts catalytically to facilitate the binding of LPS to sCD14, but is not a part of LPS•sCD14 complex.

The mutant sCD14 bound LPS and this binding was facilitated by rLBP. In addition, the mutant sCD14 enabled LPS-dependent biological responses in both CD14-expressing and CD14-negative cells. Recombinant soluble CD14 (rsCD14) and recombinant LBP (rLBP) were constructed and purified as described(12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Concentrations of all recombinant proteins were determined with a Micro BCA protein kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's specification. Since full-length rsCD14 terminates at position 348 of the mature protein(12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

The anti-CD14 mAbs used were 3C10 (purified by chromatography on Protein G from the conditioned medium (CM) of ATCC TIB 228) and MEM-18 (purchased from SANBIO, The Netherlands). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against human rsCD141-348 and prepared by Antibodies, Inc. (Davis, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antisera was purchased from Amersham. Enzymes for DNA manipulation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. A modified version of a mammalian expression vector (pDSRα2, (12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S.

Each PCR used a common oligonucleotide (5′- GTCCCTCTAGACCACCATGGAGCGCGCGTCCTGC-3′) generated from the 5′ end of CD14 which was paired with 10 different oligonucleotides (5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTAGCGGGAGTACGCTAGCACACGC-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTATGCAAGTCCTGTGGCTTCCAGAG-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTAGCCTGGCTTGAGCCACTGCTGC-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTAGGCCGGGAAGGCGCGAACCTG-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTAGGCCGGGAACTTGTGGGGACAG-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTACTGCACACCTGCCGCCGCCAG-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTAGGCGCTGGACCACATGCATCTCG-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTACTTGGCTGGCAGTCCTTTAGGCACC-3′, 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTACTCGGGCAGCTCGTCAGGCTGC-3′, and 5′-AACTTCCAGTCGACTTACAGGAAGGGATTCCCGTCCAGTG-3′) specifying the 3′ ends of the truncated CD14 cDNAs indicated above. The PCR products were then digested with XbaI and SalI and ligated to pDSRα2 linearized with XbaI and SalI. All mutant constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutation. To express mutant sCD14 proteins, mammalian expression vectors containing sCD14 cDNA were introduced into COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651) cells by electroporation. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). For each transfection, five million cells were electroporated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA using a Gene pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were then washed three times with 1 × Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated 4 days with serum-free AIM-V (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium. To test for sCD14 expression, 20 μl of CM were electrophoresed on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Noval Experimental Technologies, San Diego, CA), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-CD14 polyclonal antisera in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antisera in TBS buffer for 1 h. For detection of immune complexes, enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL kit, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) was performed as described by the manufacturer. Concentrations of sCD14 were determined with the aid of a BIAcore biosensor instrument (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, mAb 3C10 (200 μg/ml) was immobilized on a sensor chip at an injection rate of 5 μl/min for 10 min. A standard curve was then generated relating the change in response unit (RU) to varying dilutions of purified sCD14 of known concentration. Conditioned medium from transfected COS-7 cells was injected onto the sensor chip containing immobilized 3C10 and sCD14 concentrations were calculated by measuring the change in RU and comparing it to the standard curve. The expression vector containing the cDNA encoding sCD141-152 was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase as described(12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). A single clone was grown without serum to generate CM containing sCD141-152. A 2.5 × 9-cm Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol. Four liters of CM, to which glycerol had been added to a final concentration of 10%, was then passed over the column. After loading, the column was then washed with the above buffer, and protein was eluted with a 280-ml gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol. Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-CD14 polyclonal antiserum was used to identify fractions containing sCD141-152. The fractions were then pooled and diluted 4-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10% glycerol and loaded onto an affinity column of mAb 3C10 which had been equilibrated with PBS, 10% glycerol. After washing with the same buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 100 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, 10% glycerol. Fractions were neutralized with 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The buffer of the eluted protein was then exchanged to PBS by passing through a Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column. For deglycosylation, 0.25 μg of sCD141-152 was treated with 0.25 units of N-glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), 0.01 units of neuraminidase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) in 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 16 h at 37°C. Purity of the sample was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Coomassie Blue staining. Human astrocytoma U373 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB 17, Rockville, MD) and maintained in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 × non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 × sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.). U373 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well 24 h before stimulation. The cells were washed three times with 1 × Hank's balanced salt solution and then incubated with 0.5 ml of COS-7 CM or varying concentrations of purified sCD14. After 24 h, the CM was harvested and IL-6 levels were quantitated by ELISA (R& Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's specification. LPS prepared from Salmonella minnesota strain Re595 (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml in those assays performed in the presence of LPS. Both sCD141-348 and sCD141-152 were tested for their ability to inhibit an LAL reaction. Purified sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 were added at various concentrations directly to Costar (no. 3596, Cambridge, MA) 96-well plates. rLBP (0.17 nM) and LPS (2 ng/ml in PBS) from Escherichia coli strain 055:B5 (Endosafe, Charleston, SC) were then added to yield a final volume of 50 μl/well. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, 50 μl of LAL reagent (Biowhittaker QCL-1000 kit, Walkersville, MD) were added and the mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 25 min. One hundred μl of chromogenic substrate from the kit were then added and the reaction was stopped 20 min later with 100 μl of 25% acetic acid. Optical density at 405 nm was measured with a Vmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). In our laboratory, this assay yields a maximal response with 2 ng/ml LPS and a half-maximal response with 1 ng/ml LPS. Thus, a 50% reduction in A405 signifies neutralization of 1 ng/ml LPS. To analyze binding of sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 to LPS, a gel shift assay was performed as described(12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Briefly, sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 were incubated at various concentrations (0, 101, 303, and 909 nM) with 3 μg/ml 3H-LPS prepared from E. coli K12 strain LCD25 (provided by Dr. Robert Munford, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) in the presence or absence of 16.7 nM rLBP. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then electrophoresed on native 4-20% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were prepared for fluorography by fixing for 45 min in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. EnlighteningTM solution (DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) was then added for 45 min and the gel was dried and exposed to X-Omat (Kodak, Rochester, NY) film for 48 h. The adhesive capacity of leukocyte integrins can be induced by LPS with LBP (2Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Rockwell P. Detmers P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or by complexes of LPS and sCD14(12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 21Detmers P.A. Zhou D. Powell D.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2137-2145Google Scholar). Here we used conditions under which both LBP and sCD14 are required to induce adhesion. Freshly isolated PMN were fluorescently labeled with 5- (and 6-)carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester as described(22van Kessel K.P.M. Park C.T. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mixtures containing smooth LPS (from E. coli O111:B4, List Biological Laboratories), rLBP (1 μg/ml), and sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 at various concentrations were diluted in 40 μl of Dulbecco's PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 0.5% human serum albumin. Ten μl of PMN (2 × 107 cells/ml in HAP buffer (Dulbecco's PBS with 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, 0.05% human serum albumin, and 3 mMD-glucose)) were then added, and the mixtures were allowed to incubate for 10 min at 37°C. PMN were then washed with HAP buffer and added to 72-well Terasaki plates pre-coated with fibrinogen. After 15 min incubation at 37°C, adhesion of PMN to the plate was quantitated. The fluorescence in each well was measured using a Cytofluor 2300 microplate reader (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to estimate the total number of cells per well. The plate was then washed with PBS and fluorescence was measured again. Binding is expressed as the percentage of cells remaining in the well after the washing step. Recognition of purified sCD14 preparations by anti-CD14 mAbs was measured with a BIAcore biosensor instrument. The instrument, CM5 sensor chips, and amine coupling kit were purchased from Pharmacia Biosensor (Piscataway, NJ). mAb 3C10 (200 μg/ml in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.4) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's specifications. To assess sCD141-348 recognition by mAbs 3C10 and MEM-18, the flow cell immobilized with 3C10 was incubated in succession with 5 solutions as detailed in the following steps: step 1, 10 μg/ml sCD141-348 for 2 min; step 2, HBS wash buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (Pharmacia Biosensor)) for 2 min; step 3, 50 μg/ml MEM-18 (in HBS buffer) for 2-3 min; step 4, HBS wash buffer for 2 min; step 5, 10 mM HCl for 2 min. All solutions were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. To assess recognition of sCD141-152 by mAb 3C10 and MEM-18, after step 5, the chip was incubated with 5 μg/ml sCD141-152 at 5 ml/min for 2 min and steps 2-5 were repeated. The CD14 protein possesses 10 leucine-rich repeats spanning amino acids 67-312(14Ferrero E. Hsieh C.L. Francke U. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 331-336PubMed Google Scholar). In order to assess the significance of these repeats relative to the biological activity of CD14, we systematically deleted increasing numbers of repeats and attempted to express the mutant CD14 molecules in COS-7 cells. From the 10 mutants generated, only four (sCD141-152, sCD141-176, sCD141-204, and sCD141-312) were found to be expressed by COS-7 cells at detectable levels (Fig. 1). To test whether the truncated sCD14s were biologically active, we utilized a U373 bioassay in which production of IL-6 by U373 cells is induced by the presence of LPS and sCD14. A representative experiment using CM containing sCD141-152 is shown in Fig. 2. The data illustrate that CM containing sCD141-152 is active in stimulating IL-6 production from U373 cells in the presence of LPS. In this experiment, the concentrations of sCD141-152 and sCD141-348 in COS-7 CM were 0.37 and 0.59 nM, respectively. We also observed that CM from the other three mutants was able to induce normal levels of IL-6 in the presence of LPS (data not shown). Since sCD141-152 was the most severely truncated mutant that retained biological activity, we chose to characterize this truncation mutant in greater detail.Figure 2:COS-7 CM containing sCD141-152 or sCD141-348 induces IL-6 secretion from U373 cells. Transfection, collection of CM, and treatment of U373 cells are described under “Materials and Methods.” MOCK refers to CM from COS-7 cells electroporated in the absence of DNA. Levels of IL-6 are determined by IL-6 ELISA as described under “Materials and Methods” and are presented as picograms/ml of CM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To produce large quantities of purified protein, a stable Chinese hamster ovary clone expressing sCD141-152 was generated and the mutant protein was purified from the serum-free CM of this cell line. Fig. 3(lane 2) shows that purified sCD141-152 ran with an apparent molecular weight ranging from 26,000 to 31,000 when analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. All bands of purified sCD141-152 reacted in a Western blot with the rabbit anti-CD14 polyclonal serum (data not shown). After deglycosylation and desialylation (Fig. 3, lane 3), purified sCD141-152 ran as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 22,000. Thus, multiple bands in our sCD141-152 preparation (lane 2) could represent alternative glycosylation forms of sCD141-152. An LAL assay was used to determine whether sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 interacts with LPS. In an LAL reaction, LPS binds to the proenzyme Factor C (23Mata T. Miyata T. Misumi T. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh V. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and initiates a protease cascade whose activity can be quantitated upon addition of chromogenic substrate. Inhibition of the LAL response by a protein may thus signify that the protein binds LPS and prevents activation of the proenzyme. In pilot experiments, we determined that at concentrations less than 100 nM, sCD141-348 did not inhibit the LAL reaction. However, addition of 0.17 nM rLBP (a concentration previously determined not to inhibit in the LAL reaction) enabled strong CD14-dependent inhibition of the LAL reaction. Further studies showed that in the presence of rLBP, but not in the absence of rLBP, both sCD141-348 and sCD141-152 completely inhibited the LAL response at a concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 4). The IC50 for CD141-348 was 30 nM while sCD141-152 had an IC50 of 40 nM. The previous experiment suggested that sCD141-152 interacts with LPS. To directly address whether sCD141-152 is capable of binding LPS, we utilized a native PAGE assay (12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) that detects complexes of sCD14 with 3H-LPS. In the absence of rLBP, both 909 nM sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 formed complexes with LPS after 30 min incubation (Fig. 5A). The complex of sCD141-152 migrated faster than the sCD141-348 complex due to the smaller size of the sCD141-152 protein. Addition of rLBP during the incubation of 3H-LPS with sCD14 dramatically increased the amount of 3H-LPS•sCD141-348 and 3H-LPS•sCD141-152 formed. Under these conditions, complexes with LPS were readily seen with 101 nM and 303 nM sCD14 (Fig. 5B). Thus, rLBP facilitates the binding of LPS to both sCD141-348 and sCD141-152. To confirm that sCD141-152 can interact with LBP and enable cellular responses to LPS, LPS-induced adhesion of PMN to fibrinogen was measured. We have previously shown that PMN express a low amount of cell surface CD14 (2Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Rockwell P. Detmers P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and that rough LPS (Re 595) with LBP stimulates the adhesivity of these cells in a CD14-dependent fashion(2Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Rockwell P. Detmers P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 12Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In contrast, when smooth LPS (such as 0111:B4) is used, the cell surface CD14 of PMN appears insufficient, and a sensitive adhesive response is only observed upon addition of sCD14. 2E. Hailman and S. D. Wright, unpublished observations. We asked whether mutant sCD141-152 could enable LBP-dependent responses of PMN to smooth LPS. Addition of either sCD141-152 or sCD141-348 enabled a strong adhesive response of PMN to smooth LPS and LBP (Fig. 6). The dose-response relationships for the two proteins were similar, suggesting that sCD141-152 retains full activity in this assay. No response was seen to LPS and sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 in the absence of rLBP, suggesting that both sCD141-348 and sCD141-152 are able to directly interact with rLBP. These data confirm that sCD141-152 is biologically active in vitro and can interact with both LPS and rLBP. Our initial experiments performed with COS-7 CM containing sCD141-152 (Fig. 2) suggested that the mutant protein could activate U373 cells. To rule out the possibility that this activation was caused by irrelevant proteins in COS-7 CM, we performed a dose-response experiment comparing the ability of purified sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 to induce IL-6 production from U373 cells. Both sCD141-348 and sCD141-152 induced similar levels of IL-6 from U373 cells at equivalent concentration (Fig. 7). Neither protein activated U373 cells in the absence of LPS. These results confirm the ability of sCD141-152 to interact with LPS and cells in a fashion identical with sCD141-348. Anti-CD14 mAbs 3C10 and MEM-18 have been previously characterized as specific blockers of CD14 function(1Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Kruger C. Schutt C. Circ. Shock. 1993; 39: 220-225PubMed Google Scholar). A BIAcore biosensor instrument was used to assess whether these mAbs recognize epitopes within sCD141-152. Fig. 8 shows that sCD141-152 recognized 3C10 (ΔRU of 400 between steps 6 and 8) and MEM-18 (ΔRU of 1000 between steps 7 and 9). This result was confirmed in the U373 bioassay in which both 3C10 and MEM-18 completely inhibited IL-6 production induced by sCD141-152 and LPS (data not shown). Here we provide evidence that the N-terminal 152 amino acids of CD14 is sufficient to mediate all of its known biological properties. sCD141-152 binds LPS, and studies measuring both inhibition of LAL (Fig. 4) and interaction with radiolabeled LPS (Fig. 5) indicate that this binding is quantitatively similar to that exhibited by sCD141-348. Furthermore, in both assays, sCD141-348 or sCD141-152 complexes with LPS were formed more efficiently in the presence of rLBP. This suggests that not only is the LPS-binding domain contained within sCD141-152, but sites for interaction with LBP must also be present. Presumably, CD14 interaction with LBP leads to an accelerated transfer of LPS into CD14. Another important biological property attributed to sCD14 is its ability to enable LPS-dependent signaling in a variety of cells. Here, we show that sCD141-152 is just as effective as sCD141-348 in initiating LPS-dependent responses in PMN (up-regulation of adhesion) and epithelial cells (up-regulation of IL-6 production). It has been hypothesized that CD14 possesses domains for binding LPS and for cell signaling through an interaction with an unidentified transmembrane signaling protein(8Frey E.A. Miller D.S.

Our results suggest that both of these putative domains must be contained within the N-terminal 152 amino acids of CD14, since this protein can bind LPS and can mediate signaling by cells. CD14 contains 10 leucine-rich repeats spanning amino acids 67 to 312. In other proteins, it has been proposed that leucine-rich repeats play a role in protein-protein or protein-membrane interactions. The fact that we produced a CD14 mutant lacking repeats 4 through 10 which still had wild-type function suggests that these repeats are not critical for LPS binding or CD14 bioactivity. The biological functions of these repeats remain to be determined. In this study, sCD14 truncation mutants lacking leucine-rich repeats 1-3 could not be expressed in COS-7 cells, thus it was not possible to distinguish whether LPS-binding domains or cell-signaling domains are localized to leucine-rich repeats 1-3 or to amino acids preceding this region. A recent hypothesis suggests that other LPS-binding proteins such as Limulus anti-LPS factor(27Warren H.S. Glennon M.L. Wainwright N. Amato S.F. Black K.M. Kirsch S.J. Riveau G.R. Whyte R.I.

Since amphipathic regions do exist in CD14 before leucine-rich repeats 1-3, it is possible that the amphipathic regions in CD14 are also involved in LPS binding. We are currently using the technique of site-directed mutagenesis to test whether the amphipathic regions in CD14 are involved in LPS recognition.

An early step in this growth process is stimulation of the expression of a set of genes known as immediate early (IE) genes, so named because their induction by PDGF requires no new protein synthesis. Whether the expression of any (or all) of these genes is a prerequisite for PDGF-induced mitogenesis is debated. The fact that many IE genes are proto-oncogenes, however, strongly suggests that precise regulation of their expression is at least important for cell growth regulation if not initiation. platelet-derived growth factor immediate early double-stranded RNA 2-aminopurine eukaryotic initiation factor-2α phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since PDGF-mediated induction of IE genes requires no de novo protein synthesis, it presumably occurs by directed modification or activation of pre-existing factors or “second messengers” in the cell. A complex cascade of intracellular events has been identified that takes place in response to exposure to PDGF-BB. These include dimerization and autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor, association and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (including phospholipase C, phosphoinositol kinase, Raf-1, and pp42), increased phosphoinositol and phosphatidylcholine turnover and calcium mobilization, and activation of protein kinase C (Meisenhelder et al., 1989; Morrison et al., 1989; Williams, 1989; Sultzman et al., 1991; Exton, 1990). Some causal and sequential relationships of these PDGF-induced phenomena to each other and to eventual DNA synthesis are beginning to be established. However, the events linking early second messenger activation with subsequent IE gene expression are unknown. While all of the known PDGF-activated second messengers described above reach their peak level of activation within 5-10 min of PDGF binding to its receptor, peak times of expression for the IE genes range from 30 min to several hours after PDGF stimulation (Muller et al., 1984; Sukhatme et al., 1988; Rollins et al., 1988). We therefore sought to identify second messengers that act later in the pathway. One candidate for such a PDGF-activated second messenger was suggested by several reports in which cells were treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or with the guanine analog 2-aminopurine (2-AP). The addition of dsRNA, in the form of poly(I)•poly(C), to the medium of quiescent fibroblasts was shown to induce transcription of the PDGF-inducible IE genes c-myc, c-fos, and JE, with a somewhat faster time course than that seen with PDGF (Zullo et al., 1985; Hall et al., 1989). Conversely, treatment of fibroblasts with 2-AP prior to stimulation with serum was shown to block induction of c-myc and c-fos (Zinn et al., 1988). The unifying aspect to these observations is that the only known intracellular target of both dsRNA and 2-AP is the dsRNA-dependent eIF-2α kinase PKR (Farrell et al., 1977). PKR (formerly known as dsI, DAI, dsKinase, p68, and p68ds) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, constitutively present at low levels in the cytoplasm in a latent state (Clemens et al., 1993; Dever et al., 1993; Petryshyn et al., 1983). First discovered as a component of the interferon-inducible cellular antiviral defenses, levels of latent enzyme are increased by interferons. In the presence of low concentrations (<1 μM) of dsRNA, PKR autophosphorylates, resulting in activation and the ability to phosphorylate other substrates, most prominently eIF-2α (Petryshyn et al., 1983). This phosphorylation of eIF-2α is responsible for the antiviral activity of PKR, inhibiting viral protein production by preventing recycling of this limiting factor in protein synthesis, thereby greatly reducing production of new virus particles (O'Malley et al., 1986). There are, however, several reasons to suspect that PKR also plays a direct role in the regulation of cell growth. As described above, activators and inhibitors of PKR have profound effects on growth factor-inducible genes. In addition, PKR protein levels are known to fluctuate during the cell cycle, being highest in G0 and early G1 (Petryshyn et al., 1984). Oncogenic Ras proteins have been shown to induce an inhibitor of PKR activation in BALB cells, suggesting that p21ras activation leads to down-regulation of PKR activity (Mundschau and Faller, 1992). Furthermore, the expression of a mutant and presumed dominant suppressor PKR protein containing a deletion of 6 amino acids between catalytic domains V and VI of the kinase results in malignant transformation in NIH3T3 cells (Koromilas et al., 1992). Given this substantial indirect evidence suggestive of PKR involvement in growth factor signal transduction, we tested the proposition that PKR functions as a signal transducer in PDGF-stimulated pathway(s) that induce transcription of the IE genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE. Assuming a common model for signal transduction pathways in which a pathway consists of a sequential series of biochemical events, each triggered by the one preceding it, we reasoned that the biochemical event of PKR activation may be concluded to be a component of the PDGF signal transduction pathway inducing c-fos, c-myc, and JE if 1) specific inhibitors of PKR activation block c-fos, c-myc, and JE gene induction; 2) specific down-regulation of PKR protein levels by antisense inhibition of translation results in a decrease or elimination of c-fos, c-myc, and JE induction by PDGF; and 3) PDGF can be shown to activate PKR in vivo. We demonstrate herein that all of these requirements are met with respect to the participation of the enzyme PKR in the PDGF signal transduction pathway resulting in the induction of the IE genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE. In addition, these criteria were tested by analysis of another PDGF-inducible IE gene, egr-1. egr-1 was inducible by PDGF, but not by a direct activator of PKR (poly(I)•poly(C)), suggesting that egr-1 is induced by PDGF via a PKR-independent, PDGF-stimulated pathway. As would be predicted from the three propositions above, PDGF induction of egr-1 was found to be unaffected by inhibitors or down-regulation of PKR. Finally, experiments measuring induction of the PKR-dependent genes by direct activators of protein kinase C in the presence and absence of 2-AP suggest that PKR activation lies downstream of protein kinase C activation in the pathway for induction of some IE genes. Clone A31 of Balb/c/3T3 cells and KBALB cells, a nonproducing Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/c/3T3 line, were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Morphological revertants of KBALB cells were produced by pharmacologically elevating intracellular levels of cAMP by treatment with 2 mMN6-2′-O-dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma) for at least 48 h or by stable transfection with the Krev-1 gene as described previously (Quinones et al., 1991). All cell lines were carried in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor bovine calf serum (Hazelton Research Products, Inc., Lenexa, KS), 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PDGF-BB was obtained from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). 2-Aminopurine was obtained as a nitrate salt 198.2 g/mol; Sigma) and was dissolved in 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until a neutral pH was obtained (as determined by the phenol red pH indicator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and the 2-aminopurine had dissolved. A 200 mM stock was made fresh for each experiment. Poly(I)•poly(C) was obtained in soluble form and as a conjugate to agarose beads (poly(I)•poly(C)-agarose, Type VI) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Total cellular RNA was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987), quantified, electrophoresed on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to supported nitrocellulose. Hybridizations and washes were carried out according to standard protocols with 32P-labeled DNA probes made by the random oligonucleotide primer method (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). Murine β-actin, c-fos, JE, c-myc, and egr-1 and rat sodium potassium ATPase DNA probes have been described previously (Mundschau and Faller, 1991). Preparation of cytoplasmic extracts and in vitro PKR phosphorylation assays were carried out as described previously (Mundschau and Faller, 1992; Katze et al., 1991). In a modification of the technique described by Erusalimsky et al.(1988), cells were grown to confluence in 35- or 60-mm wells and then starved in 0.5% calf serum for 24 h or allowed to become quiescent in 10% serum-containing medium. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline and twice with isotonic wash buffer (120 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM MnCl2, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)), the cells were overlaid with a permeabilization buffer consisting of isotonic wash buffer, 40 μM digitonin (Sigma), 1 μM ATP, and 50 μCi/ml [ γ-32P]ATP, with and without 20 ng/ml recombinant PDGF-BB or 10 μg/ml poly(I):poly(C), and incubated at 37°C for the periods of time indicated on the figures. The radioactive overlay was discarded, and each well of cells was gently washed once with 1 ml of isotonic wash buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Finally, cells were scraped into 300 μl of EDTA lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 50 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Precipitation of dsRNA-binding proteins on poly(I)•poly(C)-agarose was performed as described previously (Mundschau and Faller, 1992). The rinsing step just prior to cell lysis with Nonidet P-40 was found to be critical for achieving low background in this assay. Detergent lysis of the cells without prior removal of most of the remaining [ γ-32P]ATP stimulated PKR phosphorylation in the absence of any exogenous activators. That this PDGF and poly(I)•poly(C)-independent phosphorylation was occurring after lysis, and not before, was verified by control experiments in which cells were overlaid with [ γ-32P]ATP in buffer only, omitting digitonin. Phosphorothioate DNA oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-TGG GGT ATC ACT GGC CAT-3′ (antisense) and 5′-ACT CTA GTG GCG GTG ACT-3′ (missense control) were obtained from Marshall University (Huntington, WV) or Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). BALB cells were grown to confluence (with no treatment or with 18 h of pretreatment with 500 units/ml murine interferon-β), and the conditioned medium overlaying the cells was removed and mixed with either antisense oligonucleotide or missense oligonucleotide to a final concentration of 5 μM. The conditioned medium plus oligonucleotide was then filter-sterilized and returned to the cells for 48 h, at which time some cultures were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for an additional hour prior to harvesting of the cells for RNA or for Western blot analysis of PKR protein levels. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (Faller et al., 1994), except that the primary antibody was an anti-murine PKR rabbit antiserum (Barber et al., 1993), generously provided by Michael Katze and Glen Barber (University of Washington). If the genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE are induced by PDGF via a pathway dependent upon PKR activation, inhibitors of PKR activation should block PDGF induction of these genes. Two methods of inhibiting PKR activation while maintaining cell viability are known: treatment with high doses of purine analogs, such as 2-aminopurine (Farrell et al., 1977), or expression of an oncogenic (activated) ras gene for at least 18 h (Mundschau and Faller, 1992). The PKR inhibitor 2-AP has previously been shown to suppress serum induction of the IE genes c-fos and c-myc in NIH3T3 cells (Zinn et al., 1988). Concordant with this result, stimulation of quiescent BALB/c/3T3 murine fibroblasts (BALB cells) with PDGF-BB instead of serum in the presence of 10 mM 2-AP strongly inhibited induction of c-fos, c-myc, and JE (Fig. 1A and Table 1). However, PDGF induction of another IE gene, egr-1, was unaffected by 2-AP in BALB cells (Fig. 1A and Table 1). This verified that 2-AP was not indiscriminately cytotoxic during the time course of the experiment (90 min) and that it did not interfere with PDGF binding to its receptor. In addition, the ability of PDGF to induce egr-1 in the presence of 2-AP suggested that at least two PDGF-activated signal transduction pathways exist for IE gene induction in BALB cells, distinguishable in their sensitivity to 2-AP and possibly therefore in their dependence on PKR. The discovery of this 2-AP-insensitive signaling pathway would permit testing of predictions made about the role of PKR in the 2-AP-sensitive pathway.Tabled 1 The second method for inhibiting PKR activation, expression of an oncogenic ras gene, has been previously shown to act in BALB cells by inducing a cytoplasmic protein that inhibits PKR autophosphorylation without down-regulating or degrading the PKR protein itself (Mundschau and Faller, 1992). To test the effect of this ras-induced inhibitor on IE gene induction, we examined PDGF induction of IE genes in a BALB-derived cell line, KBALB, chronically transformed by the activated ras gene v-Ki-ras. The block to PKR autophosphorylation in KBALB cells was verified by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4) discussed below. RNA blot analysis of IE gene induction in KBALB cells in response to PDGF is summarized in Table 1, and representative blots of egr-1 and c-fos (Fig. 1B) and c-myc and JE (Fig. 2B) are shown. In a pattern identical to the results observed in 2-AP-treated cells, PDGF induction of the genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE was blocked or inhibited, while induction of egr-1 remained normal. Although utilizing v-ras as a PKR inhibitor might be somewhat complicated by the fact that v-ras appears to affect several steps in PDGF signal transduction (Rake et al., 1991; Benjamin et al., 1987, 1988; Zullo and Faller, 1989), ( 2M. Zubiaur and D. V. Faller, manuscript in preparation. )it is also made particularly powerful by the potential to create and study revertants of the ras-transformed phenotype (Kitayama et al., 1989; Olinger et al., 1989; Carchman et al., 1974; Quinones et al., 1991). Two methods specific for reversion of ras-induced transformation, pharmacologic elevation of intracellular cAMP levels and transfection with the Krev-1 gene, result in morphologically reverted cell lines derived from KBALB cells (referred to as KcAMP and Krev cells, respectively) that have a morphological phenotype intermediate to that of BALB and KBALB. Such revertants have been shown previously to demonstrate partial reconstitution of the PDGF signaling pathways (Quinones et al., 1991). This has permitted some determination of which of the phenomena associated with PDGF binding to its receptor revert as well and may thus be causally related. A Krev cell line and KBALB cells treated for 48 h with 2 mM dibutyryl-cAMP (KcAMP) were made quiescent by incubation in 0.5% serum for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 60 min and harvested for RNA. As shown in parallel with RNA from identically stimulated BALB and KBALB cells for comparison, PDGF induction of the IE genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE was found to be restored in the revertant cells (Fig. 2B) (c-fos not shown). Induction of egr-1 continued to be normal (data not shown). When extracts of these revertant cells were used in the in vitro PKR kinase assay, they now autophosphorylated PKR to equal or greater levels in response to exogenous poly(I)•poly(C) compared with extracts from BALB (normal) cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with PKR activity being causally related to induction of c-fos, c-myc, and JE by PDGF. Having thus demonstrated above or in previous reports that two inhibitors of PKR activation block PDGF induction of the IE genes c-fos, c-myc, and JE, but not egr-1, and that the direct activator of PKR, poly(I)•poly(C), induces c-fos, c-myc, and JE, it remained to be seen if poly(I)•poly(C) could induce egr-1. Total cellular RNA from BALB cells treated with 50 μg/ml poly(I)•poly(C) was therefore analyzed by RNA analysis with an egr-1 probe. Consistent with egr-1 being induced by PDGF via a PKR-independent pathway, dsRNA failed to induce egr-1 or induced it very weakly with respect to induction by PDGF or PMA (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Although the reciprocal correlations between apparent activation of PKR and PDGF induction of some IE genes, as revealed by poly(I)•poly(C) and two different PKR inhibitors, presented a convincing circumstantial case for PKR involvement in PDGF signal transduction, the strength of any such argument is dependent entirely on the specificity of the inhibitors used. Activated c-ras or v-ras did not block all PDGF signal transduction pathways since they did not interfere with induction of egr-1 by PDGF. Activated p21ras, however, is not likely to be a specific inhibitor of PKR as it has documented pleiotropic effects (as discussed below) on PDGF signal transduction (Rake et al., 1991; Quinones et al., 1991). Indirect evidence exists to suggest that the specificity of 2-AP for inhibition of PKR activation, however, is quite good (Giantini and Shatkin 1989; Kaufman and Murtha, 1987; Kalvakolanu et al., 1991; Mahadevan et al., 1990; Zinn et al., 1988; Wathelet et al., 1989; Tiwari et al., 1988). But, given that no work has been done to rigorously assess the effect of 2-AP on the various serine/threonine kinases, including the protein kinase C isoenzymes known to be involved in PDGF signal transduction, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the 2-AP-inhibited event in the PDGF-activated signaling cascade inducing IE gene expression is PKR activation. A more specific inhibitor of PKR was therefore sought. When the murine PKR gene was cloned and sequenced (Feng et al., 1992), it became possible to attempt to directly deplete PKR protein levels by antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of translation. Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides designed to be complementary to the 5′-end of the PKR message (see “Materials and Methods”) were synthesized and added to the medium of BALB cells to a concentration of 5 μM. “Missense” oligonucleotides of identical base composition were added to some control cultures. The depletion of PKR protein levels by antisense inhibition of translation was monitored by Western blotting with antisera specific for murine PKR. Incubation of confluent BALB cells for 48 h in medium containing antisense oligonucleotide, but not in medium containing missense or no added oligonucleotide, significantly down-regulated PKR protein levels (Fig. 4). Such PKR-depleted cells were treated with PDGF for 1 h and harvested for RNA, and the RNA was analyzed by hybridization for IE gene induction. In experiments in which down-regulation of PKR protein by antisense treatment was verified, PDGF induction of c-myc and JE was found to be inhibited, while egr-1 induction was unaffected, consistent with the results obtained when other inhibitors of PKR (2-AP and v-ras) were used (Fig. 5). The pattern of gene induction by PDGF was not altered by pretreatment of the cells with missense oligonucleotides (data not shown).Figure 5:Antisense-mediated depletion of PKR protein inhibits PDGF induction of IE genes myc and JE, but not egr-1. Total cellular RNA was extracted from confluent BALB monolayers after incubation in the presence or absence of an antisense oligonucleotide (5 μM) complementary to the 5′-end of the PKR transcript for 48 h. Immediately prior to RNA harvest, some cultures were treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for 60 min. The RNA (20 μg/lane) was size-separated by electrophoresis on a 0.9% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized sequentially with 32P-labeled probes specific for c-myc (second exon), JE, actin, and egr-1 transcripts. Shown is an autoradiogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PKR kinase assay shown in Fig. 2A, and all assays in previous reports demonstrating PKR autophosphorylation, have measured the ability of PKR to phosphorylate itself in a cell lysate in response to exogenously added dsRNA or other polyanions. If PKR is a signal-transducing molecule for PDGF induction of IE genes, PDGF treatment of cells might be expected to have a measurable effect on PKR activation and therefore on its autophosphorylation state. Assaying for activation of PKR in response to PDGF could not be performed in vitro by the addition of PDGF to a cell lysate in place of dsRNA, however, as many PDGF-induced second messenger events do not function in such an in vitro system. Instead, a protocol modified from a method for monitoring receptor autophosphorylation in intact cells was developed. In this strategy, the cell membrane was sufficiently permeabilized with the detergent digitonin to allow [ γ-32P]ATP to enter the cell while leaving signal transduction pathways intact for at least a short period. Confluent, serum-deprived BALB cells were loaded with [ γ-32P]ATP by such permeabilization and simultaneously stimulated with PDGF-BB or poly(I)•poly(C) for 15 or 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then rinsed and lysed, and affinity precipitation with poly(I)•poly(C)-agarose was carried out. The 68-kDa kinase PKR was found to be phosphorylated in response to PDGF within 15 min of PDGF addition and returned essentially to base-line levels by 30 min (Fig. 6). Digitonin eventually caused separation of the cell monolayers from the tissue culture plate surface, such that it was not possible to assay time points beyond 30 min. The magnitude of the induction of PKR phosphorylation by PDGF was comparable to the increases seen after stimulation with poly(I)•poly(C) (Fig. 6, lane 6). In repetitions of this experiment, the time courses of PKR activation for these two activators were similar. A 5-min time point was included in some experiments (not shown here), and no detectable increase in PKR autophosphorylation over background was observed at that time after stimulation by PDGF or dsRNA. Therefore, PKR appears to become activated, as determined by autophosphorylation, in response to stimulation with PDGF-BB in intact cells. Since time points beyond 30 min were not possible in the presence of digitonin, an indirect assay that did not require permeabilization of cells was employed to verify the time course of PKR phosphorylation in response to PDGF. If intracellular PKR was phosphorylated to a significant extent in response to PDGF, the amount of additional radioactive phosphate incorporated in an in vitro stimulation assay (with poly(I)•poly(C)) would therefore be predicted to be decreased. To test this prediction, lysates from PDGF-stimulated cells were subjected to a standard in vitro PKR kinase assay in the presence and absence of exogenous dsRNA. In three independent experiments, reduction in new dsRNA-inducible PKR phosphorylation was found in lysates from cells treated with PDGF at 20 min, but not in lysates from cells treated with PDGF at 40 min (Fig. 7). This finding suggested pre-existing phosphorylation of PKR 20 min after PDGF exposure, which was lost by 40 min, consistent with the result found in the digitonin permeabilization assay. Levels of phosphorylation of a number of proteins that were precipitated by the poly(I)•poly(C)-agarose from the 20-min lysate were reduced, a finding that may reflect a block to new phosphorylation of cellular proteins in general due to pre-existing phosphorylation induced by PDGF. Having found direct evidence that PKR functions as a signal transducer in a PDGF-stimulated pathway for induction of some IE genes, we sought to locate the PKR activation event in the PDGF signaling cascade with respect to known second messengers for IE gene induction. Protein kinase C is a PDGF second messenger for which both specific inhibitors and direct activators exist, and these effectors can be used in intact cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a membrane-permeable, direct activator of protein kinase C. All four IE genes examined in this investigation were induced strongly by PMA. However, previous studies utilizing protein kinase C inhibitors suggested that induction of egr-1, c-fos, and c-myc by PDGF does not require protein kinase C (Hall and Stiles, 1987; Wright et al., 1989) ( 3L. J. Mundschau, unpublished data. )(or alternatively utilizes isoforms not sensitive to the inhibitors (Kikkawa et al., 1989)), whereas PDGF induction of the JE gene appears to be completely dependent upon protein kinase C activation (Hall and Stiles, 1987).3 PDGF induction of the JE gene could thus be used to locate the relative positions of PKR and protein kinase C in this PDGF signal transduction pathway. Northern blot analysis was performed on total cellular RNA from KBALB cells stimulated with PDGF or PMA in the presence or absence of 2-AP. Analysis of both c-fos and JE gene expression demonstrated that JE could not be induced by PDGF or PMA in the presence of v-ras or v-ras and 2-AP (Fig. 8) or 2-AP alone (data not shown), thus localizing PKR activation downstream of protein kinase C activation or indicating that protein kinase C requires activated PKR to induce JE. In contrast, induction of the c-fos gene differed for PDGF and PMA. PDGF induction of c-fos was blocked by both v-ras and 2-AP as expected, while induction of c-fos by PMA was unaffected by either inhibitor. This result verified that PDGF induction of c-fos is not mediated through protein kinase C and also served as a control to show that 2-AP does not inhibit protein kinase C activation itself. However, since PDGF induction of all three genes (c-fos, c-myc, and JE) appears to require PKR activation even though their induction pathways seem to diverge upstream of protein kinase C, protein kinase C would therefore appear not to be the direct upstream activator of PKR in this PDGF IE gene induction pathway. Previous reports utilizing activators and inhibitors of PKR implicated this serine/threonine kinase in growth factor signal transduction for the induction of some IE genes. This study confirms those earlier results and further shows that they could not be attributed to indiscriminate activation or inhibition of gene induction pathways since at least one PDGF-inducible gene (egr-1) was unaffected by these factors. Furthermore, specific depletion of PKR protein by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated translational inhibition blocked PDGF induction of the same genes, as did the chemical inhibitors or protein inhibitors of PKR. Finally, PKR activation by PDGF in intact cells, as measured by autophosphorylation of the enzyme, was demonstrated to have a time course and magnitude similar to those induced by dsRNA and was consistent with the time course of PDGF induction of the relevant IE genes. How might a growth factor induce activators of PKR? Activation of PKR by dsRNA is coincident with and dependent upon autophosphorylation of the kinase on serine. Although PKR is capable of autophosphorylation, a possible mechanism by which a growth factor might activate PKR is by activating a kinase that has PKR as its substrate. Indeed, our results show that a 2-AP- and v-ras-inhibitable event appears to lie downstream of protein kinase C activation, although PMA-activated protein kinase C does not appear to directly phosphorylate PKR in the signal transduction pathway examined in this study. Double-stranded RNA has been shown to be a highly effective activator of PKR both in vitro (Kostura and Matthews, 1989) and in vivo, as in cases of viral infection (see Samuel(1991) for review) and others involving dsRNAs of cellular origin (Li and Petryshyn, 1991; Judware and Petryshyn, 1991). PDGF stimulation may generate a nonprotein molecule capable of activating PKR. Such a nonprotein signaling factor need not be a dsRNA molecule. In addition to viral dsRNA and poly(I)•poly(C), other polyanions have also been shown to have the capacity to induce PKR to autophosphorylate in vitro. A third possible mechanism for PKR activation by PDGF involves a pattern already demonstrated for several gene induction pathways, which is the phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of a chaperone protein that retains the factor in a particular cellular compartment as long as the chaperone is bound to it, e.g. NF-κB and glucocorticoid receptors (Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988; Pratt et al., 1988; Denis et al., 1988). Both PKR and its heme-regulated homolog PKH (Chen et al., 1991) have been shown to coprecipitate with another protein species, an unidentified 90-kDa protein in the case of PKR (Matts and Hurst, 1989; Rice et al., 1989). This 90-kDa protein is not found to be associated with the autophosphorylated form of PKR, and although there is no evidence that PKR translocates to the nucleus upon dissociation of its chaperone, as is the usual case for other proteins under this type of control, PKR has been localized to the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (Clemens et al., 1994). A role for PKR in growth factor signal transduction may help to explain the long-standing paradox with respect to PKR activation. Given its ability to inhibit protein synthesis by phosphorylating the rate-limiting translation initiation factor eIF-2α, PKR activation would be expected to be growth inhibitory, at least in the short term. However, attempts to inhibit PKR activity in normal cells by stable expression of virally encoded or induced PKR inhibitors have repeatedly failed due to lack of viability of the transfectants.( 4A. Shatkin, A., personal communication. )( 5R. Kaufman, personal communication. )( 6L. J. Mundschau and D. V. Faller, unpublished results. )Similarly, prolonged exposure to the PKR inhibitor 2-AP arrests the growth of murine fibroblasts. Only two PKR inhibitors have successfully been expressed in cells over a long period: the endogenous cellular protein induced by activated p21ras (Mundschau and Faller, 1992, 1994) and the 58-kDa cellular inhibitor of PKR activated by influenza virus (Lee et al., 1990). However, it is worthy of note that ras-transformed cells have long been known to be growth factor-independent, and all cellular transfectants stably expressing the 58-kDa cellular inhibitor of PKR were also found to be growth factor-independent and transformed (Barber et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1990). In conclusion, we have presented direct evidence that activation of the interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated eIF-2α serine/threonine kinase PKR is an essential component of the PDGF signal transduction pathway for the induction of some IE genes. The role of PKR in interferon-induced antiviral and antiproliferative cellular responses is well established. Thus, PKR is a signaling mediator common to both growth-promoting and growth inhibitory factors and may provide a mechanism for cross-talk between these two pathways. The mechanism of PDGF activation of PKR is unknown, but appears to lie downstream of protein kinase C activation. Downstream targets of the activated kinase are yet to be discovered. The only known PKR substrate, eIF-2α, is unlikely to be involved since serine to alanine mutations of the residues normally phosphorylated on eIF-2α by active PKR have been shown to have no effect on normal cell growth (Murtha-Riel et al., 1993). Finally, the requirement for another kinase in the PDGF-activated cascade, one that is integral to the pathway leading to the induction of certain genes by PDGF but not others, may result in a better understanding of the ways in which signaling pathways originating from a single, synchronized stimulus diverge to produce a complex pattern of gene regulation.

It has been demonstrated that Crk, via its SH2 domain, interacts with both phosphorylated paxillin and p130casin vivo(15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

The ability of Crk to simultaneously interact with the transformation-related proteins (paxillin and p130cas) via its SH2 domain and with guanine nucleotide exchange factors via its SH3 domains suggests that Crk may play a role in regulating the status of Ras activation. This postulation is supported by the finding that expression of Crk proteins carrying a point mutation in their SH3 domain (which do not interact with C3G and mSOS) resulted in diminished Ras activation following nerve growth factor stimulation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells(17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Crk in PC12 cells leads to more rapid cellular differentiation upon nerve growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor stimulation(20Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B.

Either CD4 or CD8 co-receptor cross-linking to TCR augmented the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p116 resulting in its enhanced interaction with Crk. We observed that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Crk fusion proteins can associate with C3G in T cell lysates. Furthermore, in vivo, Crk-L and perhaps Crk II form a complex with C3G. Thus, Crk, through its interaction with other proteins via its SH2 and SH3 domains, may function as an adapter protein in TCR signaling and Ras activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsBYDP, a L3T4- Lyt2/3- murine T cell hybridoma expressing comparable amount of retrovirus transduced human CD4 and human CD8α genes(21Ravichandran K.S.

Eighteen h prior to activation, BYDP was placed in serum-free medium (same as complete RPMI 1640 medium, except that 10% serum was replaced by 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Human peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated from the whole blood by Ficoll separation, followed by monocyte/macrophage depletion via plastic adherence. The remaining cells were enriched for T cells by passage through a nylon wool column. Using the anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3), a sample of enriched T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to ensure that they comprised at least 80% T cells. Human peripheral T cells were also cultured in serum-free medium for 18 h before activation. The v-Src-transformed fibroblast cell line IV5 was a gift from Dr. S. J. Parsons(22Luttrell D.K.

After 10 min on ice with the stimulating antibodies, 7.5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse antibody was added for cross-linking, and incubated for an additional 10 min on ice. The cells were then warmed to 37°C for the indicated times. For human peripheral blood T cell stimulation, 3 × 107 cells/sample were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) as described above.Immunoprecipitations and ImmunoblottingCells were lysed in a buffer containing either 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Brij-96 and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

T cells were activated by antibody-mediated cross-linking of the TCR alone or by cross-linking the TCR with either the CD4 or CD8 co-receptors. Crk proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Crk I mAb and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Although in some transformed cells, Crk and Crk-L are tyrosine-phosphorylated (24Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Ren R.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), upon T cell activation Crk did not appear to be tyrosine-phosphorylated; however, a 116-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-precipitated with Crk only upon activation (Fig. 1A, lane4). p116 did not associate with other SH2/SH3-containing adapter proteins, Nck (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) or Shc (data not shown and (27Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Addition of the Crk immunizing peptide during Crk immunoprecipitation resulted in the loss of p116 association (data not shown). Subsequent stripping and reprobing of the nitrocellulose membrane with the anti-Crk antibody indicated that the same level of Crk was precipitated in all lanes (Fig. 1B). The anti-Crk mAb used in this study, although raised against Crk I, cross-reacts with all three isoforms of Crk (Fig. 1B and data not shown). When Crk II or Crk-L specific antibodies were used to precipitate individual Crk isoforms, it was revealed that the p116 protein associates with all three isoforms of Crk upon TCR-mediated activation (data not shown).It has been reported that cross-linking CD4 or CD8 with the TCR leads to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Consistent with this observation, cross-linking of CD4 or CD8 co-receptors with the TCR resulted in enhanced association of Crk with p116, due to enhanced phosphorylation of p116 (Fig. 1A, lanes10 and 14). Since both CD4 and CD8 associate with a Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck), Lck may be involved in p116 phosphorylation. It has been shown that phosphorylated p116 also interacts with the SH2 domain of another Src family tyrosine kinase, p59fyn (Fyn)(28Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C. Burkhardt A.L.

T cells were activated by TCR cross-linking for different times, and Crk proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk mAb and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated p116. Phosphorylated p116 associated with Crk as early as 15 s after activation (Fig. 2, lane3). The level of p116 in Crk immunoprecipitates was maximal by 3 min after activation, began to decline by 10 min, and diminished to near-basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 2, lanes 5-7).Figure 2:Kinetics of Crk-p116 association. BYDP T cells were activated by TCR cross-linking for the indicated times and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk mAb (lanes3-14) and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Anti-Ptyr) antibody (RC20H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if Crk-p116 association also occurs in non-transformed T cells, lysates from human peripheral blood T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk mAb and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As with the T cell hybridoma, phosphorylated p116 associated with Crk only upon TCR-mediated activation (Fig. 3, lane 4). There were trace amounts of p116 associated with Crk in lysates of non-stimulated T cells (Fig. 3, lane 3). This minimal phosphorylation of p116 in resting T cells may reflect heterogeneity in human peripheral T cells or minimal activation that could occur from the purification procedure.Figure 3:Association between Crk and p116 in activated human peripheral blood T cells. Purified human T cells were stimulated by TCR cross-linking with OKT3 for 1 min at 37°C.

Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting revealed that both GST-Crk I and GST-Crk II precipitated p116 from activated lysates but not from non-activated lysates (Fig. 4, lanes 3-6). Moreover, GST-Crk SH2 alone precipitated equivalent amounts of p116 compared to GST-Crk I and GST-Crk II, indicating that the SH2 domain of Crk is responsible for its association with p116 (Fig. 4, lane 8). No p116 was precipitated from activated lysates by either GST alone or GST-Shc SH2 fusion protein (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10).Figure 4:Crk SH2 domain interacts with p116 from activated T cell lysates. GST-Crk I (lanes 3 and 4), GST-Crk II (lanes5 and 6), GST-Crk SH2 (lanes7 and 8), and GST-Shc SH2 (lanes9 and 10) bound to glutathione-agarose beads were added to lysates from non-activated or BYDP T cells activated by TCR cross-linking for 1 min at 37°C.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). To determine whether the p116 co-precipitated with Crk from activated T cells might represent the T cell isoform of p130cas, Crk immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with 4F4, a mAb that recognizes both p130cas and p116. The 4F4 mAb immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated p116 from activated T cell lysates and phosphorylated p130cas from Src-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 5, left panel). p116 was detected by 4F4 immunoblotting in Crk immunoprecipitates from activated T cell lysates (Fig. 5, right panel) but not in control Ig or Nck immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These data suggest that p116 may also contain YDXP motifs similar to p130cas and that tyrosine phosphorylation of this motif following T cell activation leads to its interaction with the Crk SH2 domain. It should be noted, however, that it has been recently shown that a significant portion of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the 116-kDa region of T cell lysates can be immunoprecipitated by an antibody to c-Cbl(33Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl structure contains a YDXP Crk binding motif(34Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be a component of the p116 complex that binds to Crk.Figure 5:Crk-associated p116 may be related to p130cas. Leftpanel, lysates from BYDP T cells activated by TCR cross-linking for 1 min at 37°C or Src-transformed fibroblasts (IV5) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p130cas mAb (4F4) and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Anti-Ptyr) antibody. Right panel, Crk was immunoprecipitated with the Crk mAb from BYDP cells activated for 1 min by TCR cross-linking. Precipitates were immunoblotted with 4F4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported that Crk, via its SH3 domain, is constitutively associated with a novel Ras GTP/GDP exchange factor, C3G in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells(17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether Crk can interact with C3G in T cells, two approaches were taken. First, GST-Crk fusion proteins were incubated with activated and non-activated T cell lysates and immunoblotted with anti-C3G antibody. C3G was precipitated by full-length GST-Crk I and GST-Crk II from both activated and non-activated lysates (Fig. 6, lanes2, 3, 6, and 7). Irrespective of the activation status, GST-Crk SH2 did not associate with C3G (Fig. 6, lanes4 and 8). Second, Crk immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for C3G (Fig. 7). C3G was detected when Crk-L immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for C3G. However, only small amounts of C3G were found in Crk II immunoprecipitates and none were found in Crk I immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7). These data would suggest that there is an association of Crk-L with C3G in vivo. Because Crk I antibody interfered with Crk-L binding to C3G, we cannot rule out an interaction of Crk I and Crk II with C3G (data not shown).Figure 6:C3G associates with GST-Crk fusion proteins. BYDP T cells were activated by TCR and CD4 cross-linking for 1 min at 37°C and lysed with 1% Brij-96 lysis buffer. GST-Crk I and GST-Crk II fusion proteins were incubated with non-activated and activated BYDP lysates. Precipitates were analyzed by anti-C3G immunoblotting. As a control, C3G was immunoprecipitated from non-activated T cell lysates with anti-C3G antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-C3G antibody.

Since phosphorylated p130cas in fibroblasts has been localized to the plasma membrane (15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and T cell p116 has been shown to interact with TCR-associated Fyn(28Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C.

Med. 1992; 178: 2107-2113Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the Crk-p116 inter-action may serve to shuttle C3G to the membrane. This, in turn, may contribute to TCR-mediated, tyrosine kinase-dependent Ras activation. In T cells, three other proteins: Shc and p36 (via their interaction with Grb2 and mSOS)(27Ravichandran K.S.

Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), are also implicated in Ras activation. Since the Crk SH3 domain can also interact with mSOS(17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y.

Whether these are distinct pathways of Ras activation or whether they represent pathways employed under different stimulation conditions remains to be determined. While the precise role of Crk in TCR-mediated signaling remains to be established, our data strongly suggest an important role for Crk in T cell activation.

While the identity of the 110-kDa species remains unknown, the 70- and 130-kDa protein have been identified as the cytoskeletal protein paxillin (14Birge R.B. Fajardo E.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E.

It has been demonstrated that Crk, via its SH2 domain, interacts with both phosphorylated paxillin and p130casin vivo(15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

In addition, Crk, via its SH3 domain, interacts with two Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, C3G (17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol.

The ability of Crk to simultaneously interact with the transformation-related proteins (paxillin and p130cas) via its SH2 domain and with guanine nucleotide exchange factors via its SH3 domains suggests that Crk may play a role in regulating the status of Ras activation. This postulation is supported by the finding that expression of Crk proteins carrying a point mutation in their SH3 domain (which do not interact with C3G and mSOS) resulted in diminished Ras activation following nerve growth factor stimulation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells(17Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Crk in PC12 cells leads to more rapid cellular differentiation upon nerve growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor stimulation(20Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Glassman R. Mahadeo D. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).We have examined the role of Crk in T cell activation and report here that, upon T cell activation, Crk specifically associates via its SH2 domain with a 116-kDa phosphorylated protein. Either CD4 or CD8 co-receptor cross-linking to TCR augmented the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p116 resulting in its enhanced interaction with Crk. We observed that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Crk fusion proteins can associate with C3G in T cell lysates. Furthermore, in vivo, Crk-L and perhaps Crk II form a complex with C3G. Thus, Crk, through its interaction with other proteins via its SH2 and SH3 domains, may function as an adapter protein in TCR signaling and Ras activation."

https://openalex.org/W2063614425,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a member of the CXC branch of the chemokine superfamily and activates neutrophils but not monocytes. The related CC chemokine branch, which includes monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and RANTES are potent chemoattractants for monocytes but not neutrophils. Examination of the sequences of the CXC chemokines reveals that the highly conserved leucine, corresponding to Leu25 in IL-8, is always replaced by tyrosine in CC chemokines. There is also a high degree of conservation among the CXC chemokines of the adjacent Val27 residue, which points out from the same side of the β-sheet as Leu25. In RANTES, Val27 is also replaced by a tyrosine. In order to investigate the role of these residues in controlling cell specificity, we have made the single mutants Leu25→ Tyr, Val27→ Tyr and the double mutant Leu25→ Tyr,Val27→ Tyr of IL-8. These proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity from inclusion body material. All three mutants have lower potency and efficacy in chemotaxis and calcium mobilization assays using neutrophils. The mutants also show lowered affinity to both IL-8 receptors A and B expressed recombinantly in HL-60 cells and to neutrophils in [125I]IL-8 competition assays. Additionally, the Leu25→ Tyr mutation introduces a novel monocyte chemoattractant activity into IL-8. We therefore studied the displacement of [125I]MIP-1α by IL-8 Leu25→ Tyr from the CC-CKR-1 receptor. The mutant displaces MIP-1α ligand with an affinity only 12-fold less than MIP-1α itself.

We therefore studied the displacement of [125I]MIP-1α by IL-8 Leu25→ Tyr from the CC-CKR-1 receptor. The mutant displaces MIP-1α ligand with an affinity only 12-fold less than MIP-1α itself. This suggests that mutations in this region of IL-8 are involved in receptor binding and activation and in the control of specificity between CC and CXC chemokines. INTRODUCTIONChemokines (or chemotactic cytokines) are small molecular weight proteins of 8-10 kDa involved in cell recruitment and activation during inflammation. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) ( 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin-8MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1RANTESregulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted; MIP-1 α and β, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α and βMHCmajor histocompatability complexPMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyte. )is a CXC chemokine that is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils but not monocytes in acute inflammation(1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I.

This contrasts with members of the CC chemokines, such as MCP-1 and RANTES, which are chemoattractants for monocytes and are involved in chronic inflammation (4Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 5Alam R. Stafford S. Forsythe P. Harrison R. Faubion D. Lett-Brown M.A. Grant J.A. J.

Med. 1992; 176: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The receptors for these groups of chemokines are different. IL-8 binds to two distinct seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors on neutrophils, IL-8R-A (7Holmes M.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and IL-8R-B(8Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). IL-8R-A is specific and only binds IL-8 with nanomolar potency, whereas the IL-8R-B binds most of the CXC chemokines. RANTES, MCP-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) bind to a CC chemokine receptor(9Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 199: 1421-1427Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Apart from the spacing of the cysteine residues at the amino terminus, the molecular basis of the specificity of interaction between CXC and CC chemokines and their receptors is not known. A region in the amino terminus of IL-8 (29Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consisting of the amino acid sequence Glu-Leu-Arg has been shown to be important in binding and activation of the IL-8 receptors. We are therefore searching for other determinants of molecular specificity.The three-dimensional structure of IL-8 has been solved by NMR and x-ray crystallography(11Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 12Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J.-C. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K.

The quaternary structure is a dimer made up of two antiparallel α-helices lying on top of a six-stranded β-sheet(13Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 239-263Google Scholar). In the central β-sheet of IL-8 2 residues, Leu25 and Val27, point upward. These residues are conserved as small hydrophobic amino acids in CXC chemokines, and the Leu25 equivalent is always a tyrosine in CC chemokines (Fig. 1). The equivalent residues in RANTES are both tyrosines, Tyr28 and Tyr30, and these residues have been suggested to be important in the selectivity of MCP-1(14Beall C.J. Mahajan S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3455-3459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have mutated residues 25 and 27 of IL-8 to tyrosines (Fig. 2), and we show that the mutant proteins are less potent in neutrophil chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, and IL-8 receptor binding assays. The mutation Leu25→ Tyr in IL-8 introduces a monocyte chemotaxis activity. In addition, the mutant is able to displace radiolabeled MIP-1α from the shared MIP-1α/RANTES receptor. These data confirm the importance of this region of the protein in determining cell type selectivity.Figure 2Sequence alignment of human IL-8 and RANTES. Sequences are for the monocyte derived form (72-amino acid form) of IL-8 (15Schröder J.-M. Mrowietz U. Morita E. Christophers E. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar) and the platelet derived form of RANTES(16Schall T.J. Jongstra J. Dyer B.J. Jorgensen J. Clayberger C. Davis M.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar). These show 21.5% identity and 41.5% sequence similarity.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar) were aligned using the program BESTFIT (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) and show 21.5% identity and 41.5% sequence similarity. This level of similarity suggested that the two proteins may have a similar tertiary structure. Two separate homology models of RANTES were built using HOMOLOGY (BIOSYM Technologies Sarl, Paris, France) based on the NMR and x-ray co-ordinates of IL-8. The models are based on the 72-amino acid form of IL-8 and begin at Lys3 which corresponds to Asp7 in RANTES. The energy of the models was minimized using QUANTA/CHARMM at 298 K. Initial calculations were carried out assuming that the RANTES dimer has similar quaternary structure to IL-8. Recently, the NMR structure of MIP-1β, a CC chemokine, was published(17Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), so we repeated the modeling based on this structure. Similar results were obtained for the conformation of the monomer.Examination of the final RANTES models showed that two tyrosines, 28 and 30, point out from the β-sheet (Fig. 3). An alignment of CXC and CC chemokines showed that the equivalent residues in IL-8 (Leu25 and Val27), are always small hydrophobic residues, whereas in CC chemokines they are changed mainly to tyrosines or charged amino acids (Fig. 1). Residues 25 and 27 of IL-8 were changed to tyrosines in this study.Figure 3Homology models of RANTES based on the NMR data of IL-8 (C) and MIP-1β (D) showing the positions of Tyr28 and Tyr30. The monomers of IL-8 (A) and MIP-1β (B) are also shown. All of the structures are oriented in the same direction, showing their similarity. The Leu25 and Val27 residues for IL-8 and the Tyr29 and Glu31 residues for MIP-1β along with the two tyrosines in RANTES point out from the β-sheet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Construction and Expression of IL-8 MutantsHuman IL-8 was cloned from a human peripheral blood monocyte λGT11 cDNA library by PCR(18VanDamme J. Proost P. Lenaerts J.P. Opdenakker G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). ( 2S. Alouani, H. F. Gaertner, J.-J. Mermod, C. A. Power, K. B. Bacon, T. N. C. Wells, and A. E. I. Proudfoot(1995) Eur. J. Biochem., in press. )The wild type IL-8 was expressed in E. coli B cells under the trp promoter control. The protein was expressed at high levels, with 40% of the total protein as IL-8, and present in inclusion bodies. In order to make the mutant proteins, a cassette of DNA between the NdeI and SacI sites coding for amino acids 1-50 was resynthesized. Three pairs of overlapping oligonucleotides were made spanning this region, such that the mutants could be made by changing the central pair. The double mutant Leu25→ Tyr,Val27→ Tyr was constructed using the following oligonucleotides (codons corresponding to amino acids 25 and 27 are underlined). 5′ CCTTTCCACCCCAAATTTATCAAAGAATACAGATACATTGAGAGT 35′ TGGTCCACTCTCAATGTATCTGTATTCTTTGATAAATTTGGGGTG 3The oligonucleotides were kinased and allowed to self-anneal by slowly reducing the temperature from 95°C to 40°C. They were ligated to form the NdeI-SacI fragment, which was inserted into the trp-IL-8 plasmid, and the vector was introduced into E. coli B cells by transformation. The sequences of the mutant constructions were verified by the dideoxy chain termination method. Cells were grown overnight at 37°C in Terrific Broth (Promega) to allow auto-induction of IL-8. The three IL-8 mutants were also highly expressed in this system.Purification of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant IL-8 ProteinAll of the purification steps were carried out at 4°C. The E. coli B cells (50-100 g, wet weight) were thawed in 3 times their volume of cell breakage buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM benzamidine-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and broken using a French Press (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 h, the IL-8 proteins were present mainly in inclusion bodies. These were dissolved in 6 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin equilibrated in the same urea buffer was added batchwise in three aliquots of 200 ml at 30-min intervals to adsorb nucleic acids. The urea solution was filtered and then dialyzed overnight against 1% acetic acid and lyophilized. The lyophilizate was dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EDTA and gel filtered on a Superdex-200 (16/60) column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and the monomer fraction was collected. A final concentration of 100 μg/ml protein and 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride was renatured by dropwise addition to 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM oxidized glutathione and 0.1 mM reduced glutathione. The renatured proteins were loaded onto a Mono-S (16/10) ion exchange column and equilibrated in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5. IL-8 was eluted by a 30-min linear gradient of 0-100% 2 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. Active fractions were dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. Purified proteins gave homogeneous bands using 4-20% acrylamide minigels (Novex) stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Fig. 4). The molecular mass of the proteins was verified using electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy.2Figure 4Purification of recombinant human IL-8 and the three IL-8 mutants from E. coli lysate. All four proteins have been purified to homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods.” A 4-20% acrylamide gel was run under reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 after electrophoresis. Samples are IL-8 (lane 1), Leu25→ Tyr (lane 2), Val27→ Tyr (lane 3), Leu25→ Tyr,Leu25→ Tyr (lane 4), and molecular weight standards (lane 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Monocyte and Neutrophil Chemotaxis AssaysThe migration of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes was measured using a modification of the methods of Fincham et al.(19Fincham N.J. Camp R.D.R. Gearing A.J.H. Bird C.R. Cunningham F.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4294-4299PubMed Google Scholar). 50 ml of fresh blood was collected into a 15-ml solution containing 0.1 M EDTA, 3% Dextran, and 3% glucose to prevent aggregation. This mixture was allowed to sediment for 1 h at 37°C. The PMNs and lymphocytes were separated by layering 14 ml of plasma onto 7 ml of Ficoll and centrifuging for 20 min at 296 × g and 15°C with the brake off. The lymphocytes were located at the interface of the Ficoll and the plasma, whereas the PMNs formed the pellet. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed from the PMNs (mainly neutrophils) by hypotonic lysis, and residual leukocytes were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 106 leukocytes/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. 40-50 × 106 monocytes/ml were purified from the lymphocyte fraction by adding 106 sheep red blood cells/ml and rosetting for 60 min at 4°C, followed by a further Ficoll gradient centrifugation. The monocytes were washed in PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and resuspended at 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium.For the chemotaxis assay, a 48-well micro-Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) was used. Serial dilutions of the chemoattractants (RANTES, IL-8, and mutant IL-8 proteins) were made in medium (RPMI 1640 with 2 mML-glutamine, 25 mM Hepes, and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum). 25 μl of chemoattractant was added to the lower chamber of the assay wells and covered with a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane with pore size of 3 μm for neutrophils and 5 μm for monocytes(20Harvath L. Falk W. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 37: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A 50-μl solution containing 106 cells/ml was then added to the top wells. The assay plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 min for neutrophils and 30 min for monocytes. The upper surface of the membranes was then washed with PBS buffer, and the cells on the underside of the membrane were fixed in methanol. The membranes were stained with a mixture of Field's A and B stains (Bender and Hobein) and air-dried. The cells on the under surface of the membranes were then counted using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and the VIDAS image analyzer software (KONTRON Electronics, Zurich, Switzerland).Recombinant Receptor ExpressionpBluescript II SK-vectors containing the full-length cDNA coding sequences for IL-8 receptors A and B (IL-8RA and IL-8RB) ( 3C. A. Power, unpublished data. )were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and then treated with E. coli polymerase I (Klenow fragment) according to the manufacturer's conditions (New England Biolabs) to render the digested DNA blunt-ended. cDNA inserts were gel-purified and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSFFVneo(21Fuhlbrigge R.C. Fine S.M. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5649-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which had been EcoRI-digested and blunt-ended as above. Plasmid DNA from the resultant colonies was digested with BamHI to identify constructs that were in the correct orientation. CsCl gradient-purified plasmid DNA (30 μg) of pSFFVneo-IL-8RA and pSFFVneo-IL-8RB was transfected into HL-60 cells by electroporation using the Bio-Rad gene pulser (260 V, 960 μF) and selected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine.The CC chemokine receptor-1 (CC-CKR-1) was isolated by PCR using primers based on the published sequence (9Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDNAI vector (Invitrogen)3. CsCl gradient-purified plasmid DNA (30 μg) of CC-CKR-1-pcDNAI constructs was transfected into Cos7 cells using the same method as for HL-60 cells. Cells were selected in Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and resistant cells were analyzed by measuring the binding of [125I]MIP-1α.IL-8 receptor Binding AssayMultiscreen filter plates (96-well, Millipore, MADV N6550) were pretreated with a PBS binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% NaN3 at 25°C for 2 h. A final volume of 150 μl, containing 3 × 105 neutrophils or HL-60 cells, 0.23 nM [125I]IL-8 (DuPont NEN, NEX 277) and varying concentrations of chemokine made up in PBS binding buffer, was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 90 min at 4°C. Cells were washed 4 times with 200 μl of ice-cold PBS, which was removed by aspiration. The filters were air-dried, 3.5 ml of scintillation fluid was added (Ultima Gold, Packard), and filters were counted on a Beckman LS5000 counter. The data obtained was fitted using Grafit (22Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit version 3.01. Erithicus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1993Google Scholar) into the equation, B = Bmax [L]/Kd+ [L].MIP-1α/RANTES Receptor Binding AssayThe binding assay used was a modification of the protocol used for neutrophils and HL-60 cells(23Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MIP-1α was radiolabeled using IODO-GEN iodination reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's conditions to a specific activity of 71.6 μCi/μg. Binding of 0.3 nM of [125I]MIP-1α to Cos7 cells was competed by the addition of varying concentrations of cold chemokine in binding buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2. Activity retained on the filters after washing with binding buffer with 0.5 M NaCl was counted as before.Calcium Mobilization StudiesMobilization of neutrophil intracellular calcium was measured with wild type and mutant IL-8 proteins over a concentration range of 10-6 - 10-12M. Cells were incubated in Krebs Ringer buffer (1.36 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 0.21 mM EGTA, 5.5 mMD-glucose, 20 mM Hepes) for 30 min at 37°C with 2 μM Fura-2 dye(24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The dye was excited at 340 nm, and fluorescence emission was monitored at 500 nm using a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorimeter. Intracellular Ca2+ was calculated using the equation, [Ca2+] = Kd (F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is the dissociation constant for Ca2+ binding to the dye and F is in arbitrary fluorescent units(25Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). An excess of 10 mM EGTA was added to chelate the Ca2+ and calculate Fmin. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 by adding 20 mM Tris base and the cells were lysed with 50 μM digitonin. Fmax was calculated from the fluorescence value on exposing the lysed cells to an excess of 1 mM Ca2+.RESULTSMolecular ModellingModels of the three-dimensional structure of RANTES based on the IL-8 coordinates (13Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 239-263Google Scholar) show the protein monomer as being similar to that of IL-8, a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet overlaid by a C-terminal α helix (Fig. 3). During minimization, no region of the model caused severe energetic penalties. In the dimer structure, the tyrosine residues 28 and 30 in RANTES and the corresponding IL-8 residues Leu25 and Val27 point outward from the β-sheet in both cases(27Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar). From the sequence alignments (Fig. 1) the Leu25 residue in IL-8 is always replaced by tyrosine in CC chemokines. More recently, a NMR structure for the CC chemokine MIP-1β has become available(17Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although the dimer interface for this molecule is completely different from the CXC chemokines, the monomer structure is remarkably similar to IL-8. The monomer of RANTES based on MIP-1β coordinates is shown in Fig. 3 and shows great similarity with that based on IL-8.Mutagenesis and ExpressionRecombinant human IL-8 was expressed in E. coli as inclusion body material using a trp expression system.2 Constructs for mutant proteins were assembled using an oligonucleotide cassette method. Purification and renaturation steps were identical for all four proteins and produced milligram quantities, which were purified to a homogeneity estimated at greater than 98% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 4).Activity of IL-8 MutantsSince we were investigating the differences between the CXC and CC chemokines, we tested the mutants in a variety of in vitro assays using both neutrophils and monocytes. In neutrophil chemotaxis, IL-8 shows a saturating dose-response curve, with a midpoint at around 1 nM and a maximum efficacy of 12 (Fig. 5). The three mutants show slightly reduced efficacy but lower potency: Val27→ Tyr shows a midpoint at 2 nM; the Leu25→ Tyr mutant is 100-fold less potent, with a midpoint at 50 nM; and the Leu25→ Tyr, Val27→ Tyr double mutant is 10-fold less potent, with a midpoint at 5 nM. In these assays, RANTES showed no ability to cause neutrophil chemotaxis.Figure 5Chemotactic activity of IL-8 and mutants on human neutrophils. The chemotaxis index (stimulated migration/control random migration) was determined at varying concentrations of chemoattractants. The data are shown for IL-8 (○), Val27→ Tyr (□), Leu25→ Tyr (▄), and Leu25→ Tyr,Val27→ Tyr (•). Each point represents three measurements. Similar results were obtained with three different donors. RANTES was inactive in this assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then studied the effect of these mutants on the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in neutrophils. IL-8 shows a dose-response curve with a midpoint at 10 nM and a maximal calcium mobilization of 250 nM (Fig. 6). The Val27→ Tyr mutant shows similar behavior to IL-8. The Leu25→ Tyr and the double mutants, however, were less efficacious and show lowered potency, with a midpoint at around 300 nM.Figure 6Mobilization of intracellular calcium by IL-8 and the mutant proteins using human neutrophils. The assay was carried out for IL-8 (○), Val27→ Tyr (□), Leu25→ Tyr (▄), and Leu25→ Tyr,Val27→ Tyr (•). Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments with different donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Receptor binding was assayed by displacement of [125I]IL-8 from its receptors on neutrophils. Complete displacement of the radioligand by cold IL-8 is observed, and the protein has a dissociation constant of 1.1 ± 0.2 nM. (Fig. 7). In the Val27→ Tyr mutant, the binding is lowered to 3.2 ± 0.3 nM, and the Leu25→ Tyr mutant is 100-fold less potent, with a dissociation constant of 104 ± 25 nM. The ability of the double mutant Leu25→ Tyr,Val27→ Tyr to displace IL-8 from its receptor was lowered still further, showing a dissociation constant of 225 ± 60 nM. These values can be converted into free energy values for the perturbation of the receptor ligand complex, using the equation, ΔG = -RTln(Ks(mut)/Ks(wt)) (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where mut and wt correspond to the mutant and wild type protein respectively. The ligand binding is lowered by 0.6 kcal•mol-1 for the Val27→ Tyr mutation, 2.5 kcal•mol-1 for the Leu25→ Tyr mutation, and 2.9 kcal•mol-1 for the double mutation. Neutrophils contain both IL-8 receptors A and B(7Holmes M.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 8Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). We have therefore measured the displacement of [125I]IL-8 from HL-60 cells transfected with either the A or the B receptor. IL-8 shows equal affinity for both receptors, 1.4 ± 0.1 nM for the IL-8R-A and 1.9 ± 0.3 nM for the IL-8R-B (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). The Leu25→ Tyr mutant shows a decrease in affinity for both receptors, giving values of 170 ± 10 nM for the IL-8R-A and 41 ± 2 nM for the IL-8R-B. When the second tyrosine is introduced, there is a further decrease of affinity for the IL-8R-B, with a binding constant of 100 ± 10 nM. On the A receptor, there is a small improvement in affinity, giving an IC50 of 130 ± 12 nM.Figure 7Equilibrium binding cold displacement of [125I]IL-8 by IL-8 and mutant proteins binding to IL-8 receptors on human neutrophils.

However, little is known about the mechanisms of clot retraction mediated by nucleated cells. In this report, we demonstrate that another member of the β3 integrin family, αvβ3, is involved in clot retraction mediated by nucleated cells. Retraction of fibrin clots was observed using a human melanoma cell line, C32TG, which contains no αIIbβ3 complex. This retraction was inhibited by RGD-containing peptide, monoclonal anti-β3, and anti-αvβ3 antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed a direct interaction between β3 integrin and fibrin fibers at an early stage of clot retraction. We found that another human embryonal cell line, 293, which is known to express αvβ1, but no αvβ3, lacks fibrin gel retractile activity. Upon transfection of β3 DNA into 293 cells, the β3 subunit formed a complex with an endogenous αv subunit. The β3-bearing transfectants were found to retract fibrin gels, which was specifically inhibited by anti-β3 antibody. In addition, a point mutation at Asp119 in the β3 ligand binding domain abolished the clot retractile activity of 293 transfectants, indicating the requirement of αvβ3 ligand-binding activity. Our findings suggest that αvβ3 is involved in mediating the interaction between the three-dimensional fibrin network and nucleated cells and in promoting “post-receptor occupancy” events.

Polyclonal antibodies have been raised against the 38-kDa component of this purified protein. This channel has a linear current-voltage relationship and is not activated by protein kinase A (PKA) plus ATP. Using the same antibody and a modified purification protocol (eliminating the ion exchange chromatography steps), we isolated and reconstituted two other anion channels from tracheal membrane vesicles. In vitro phosphorylation of these isolated proteins by PKA and ATP revealed four bands migrating at 52, 85, 120, and 174 kDa. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-CFTR antibodies indicate that the 174-kDa phosphoprotein was CFTR. Upon incorporation of these isolated proteins into planar bilayers, an anion channel that exhibited a marked outward rectification in symmetrical Cl- solutions with a slope conductance of 82 pS at depolarizing voltages was observed. PKA and ATP increased channel activity but only from one side of the bilayer. However, channel activity was unaffected by addition of ATP alone from either side of the membrane. DIDS (100 μM) applied to the opposite side of the bilayer to which PKA and ATP act, blocked channel activity. A linear anion-selective channel with a conductance of 16 pS could be also resolved after inhibition of the outwardly rectified anion channel by DIDS in the presence of PKA and ATP. This small conductance channel was inhibited by 300 μM diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid. Immunodepletion of the 174-kDa phosphoprotein from the preparation prevented activation of the 82-pS outwardly rectified anion channel by PKA and ATP. However, the PKA-dependent in vitro phosphorylation of the 52-, 85-, and 120-kDa phosphoproteins was unaffected by the absence of CFTR.

Approximately 2300 base pairs of the TN gene 5′-flanking region have been cloned and sequenced. This genomic region contains several potential binding sites for transcription factors. By primer extension and S1 nuclease analysis we have localized the transcription start site. The first exon of the TN gene (179 base pairs long) is present in the two major TN transcripts, showing that the expression of these two mRNAs is regulated by a single promoter. The 220 bases upstream to the transcription start site are equally active in directing the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in TN producer and nonproducer cells. Using deletion fragments of the human 5′-flanking region we have shown the presence of putative “silencer” elements in the −220 to −2300 region active in both TN producer and nonproducer cell lines. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the selective transcription in TN producing cells requires the presence of a 1.3-kilobase portion of the TN gene intron 1 in the CAT expression vectors. These findings indicate that complex mechanisms control the transcriptional regulation of TN gene.

https://openalex.org/W1968092964,"The epitopes recognized by eight independently isolated monoclonal antibodies to the α chain of human and murine leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), all able to inhibit receptor function, were identified. Initial localization of epitopes was accomplished using chimeric proteins constructed by splicing fragments of cDNAs encoding the α subunit of LFA-1 (CD11a) and the α subunit of the closely related leukocyte integrin, Mac-1 (CD11b). Antibody binding to CD11a/CD11b chimeras, expressed in the 293 human kidney cell line, demonstrated that the epitopes recognized by six monoclonal antibodies to human CD11a were located in a ∼200-amino acid sequence found in all β2-integrin α subunits, termed the inserted (I) domain.

INTRODUCTIONIntegrins are a large family of homologous, heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell to cell and cell to substratum adhesion(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). All integrins possess α1,β1 subunit structure where the α chains and the β chains associate through noncovalent interactions. Integrin families are classified on the basis of their β subunits (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3082) Google Scholar), which typically form heterodimers with any of several different α subunits. In the immune system, integrins serve as accessory molecules that facilitate intercellular interactions required for antigen recognition, cellular activation, and leukocyte trafficking, as well as effector functions such as cytotoxic killing, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity(4Kishimoto K.T.

The β2 family of leukocyte integrins consists of three homologous receptors, LFA-1 1The abbreviations used are: LFA-1leukocyte function-associated antigen 1I domaininserted domainICAMintercellular adhesion moleculemAbmonoclonal antibodyCTLcytotoxic T lymphocytePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisH/M mutanthuman to mouse mutantIdeAI domain epitope AIdeBI domain epitope BIdeCI domain epitope C. (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), and p150,95 (CD11c/CD18), each consisting of a unique α chain (CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c, respectively) binding to a common β chain (CD18). The distribution of the β2-integrins is tissue-specific, with LFA-1 present on all leukocytes and Mac-1 and p150,95 occurring primarily on macrophages, neutrophils, and other myeloid cells. Like other integrins, the members of the β2 family are promiscuous and interact with several different ligands or contrareceptors. LFA-1 is known to bind to the three structurally related immunoglobulin superfamily members termed intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)(7Rothlein R. Dustin M.L. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. J.

The functional activity of β2-integrins has been investigated through the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95 (21Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J.

Additional insight into the function of β2-integrins has come through the analysis of a rare genetic disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, which results from the inability to synthesize functional CD18(26Anderson D.C. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Individuals with this disease are unable to express LFA-1, Mac-1, or p150,95 and, as a consequence, are severely immunocompromised and exhibit multiple defects in lymphocyte and granulocyte function (27Arnaout M.A. Spits H.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The ligands for β2-integrins are unique in that none are known to possess the tripeptide receptor recognition sequence, RGD, that is common in many of the ligands for other integrin families (e.g. β1 and β3 family)(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 3Hynes R.O.

Pierschbacher M.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 517-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Besides the difference in ligand specificity, the β2 family of integrins is unusual in that the α subunits are larger (molecular size, 150-170 kDa) than most other integrins by virtue of a unique insertion of approximately 200 amino acids, termed the inserted domain (I domain). The I domain contains sequences homologous with the type A domains of von Willebrand factor, the repeats of cartilage matrix-binding protein, and complement factor B and is located approximately 150 amino acids from the NH2 terminus(29Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Larson R.S. Corbi A.L. Berman L. Springer T. J.

However, the regions within the I domain responsible for ligand binding have not yet been described.In the present study, we have localized the epitopes recognized by eight mAbs to human and mouse CD11a that are all known to inhibit LFA-1 function. Mutagenesis to replace I domain sequences of human CD11a with those of murine CD11a permitted the identification of three discrete sequences in the I domain of CD11a that are recognized by antibodies able to block the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodiesA panel of mAbs to CD11a that are known to block LFA-1 function was obtained from various sources.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar) using the method of Sanger et al.(47Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). Full-length CD11a cDNA was contained on a 4.1-kilobase pair fragment beginning at the first EcoO109I site in the 5′-untranslated region and extending to a unique XbaI site in the 3′-untranslated region of the CD11a gene and encoded a protein of 1145 amino acids. Chimeric CD11a/CD11b cDNAs were constructed using standard techniques.Expression and Immunoprecipitation of CD11a and CD11b Variants in 293 CellsChimeric transcription units for the expression of cDNAs encoding CD11a and CD11b were created by cloning the integrin genes into the RK 5 and RK 7 expression plasmids (48Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C.

Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transfected into the 293 human kidney adenocarcinoma cell line (49Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar) using a CaPO4-precipitated plasmid DNA(50Graham F.L. Smiley J. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). 2-3 days after transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4-5 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2) per 10-cm dish. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatant was used for subsequent immunoprecipitations. Antibodies (1-2 μg/immunoprecipitation) were incubated with 100 μl of labeled lysate and 2 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Inc., West Chester, PA) for 2 h at room temperature. To reduce nonspecific binding, the protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were preincubated with unlabeled lysate of 293 cells for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation. The antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated using 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) per reaction for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. After adsorption, the beads were washed two times in wash buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2) and resuspended in 30 μl of 2 × concentrated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer(51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), boiled for 3 min, and centrifuged briefly. The clarified sample was then resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gels (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSLocalization of mAb Binding Sites Using CD11a/CD11b ChimerasA panel of six mAbs to human CD11a known to inhibit LFA-1 function (TS-1/22, MHM.24, 25.3, CLB-LFA-1/2, 32E6, and 50G1) and one mAb known to bind LFA-1 without blocking function (3D6) were assembled. The ability of these antibodies to immunoprecipitate full-length recombinant CD11a from detergent lysates of transiently transfected 293 cells was evaluated. It was found (Fig. 1, A and B, CD11a) that all of the mAbs were able to immunoprecipitate a 160-165-kDa protein corresponding to the intracellular (i.e. high mannose) form of recombinant CD11a in the absence of the β subunit of LFA-1, CD18. In control studies (data not shown), no differences were seen in mAb binding to the high mannose form of intracellular CD11a and the sialic acid containing the extracellular form of CD11a produced by co-transfection of CD11a with CD18. The specificity of these antibodies for CD11a was investigated in control experiments (Fig. 1, A and B, CD11b and Mock) in which the CD11a mAbs failed to specifically immunoprecipitate proteins from mock transfected 293 cells or cells transfected with full-length recombinant CD11b as described previously(43Berman P.W. Nakamura G.R. Riddle L. Chiu H. Fisher K. Champe M. Gray A.M. Ward P. Fong S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the epitopes recognized by the mAbs to LFA-1 did not depend on CD18 and were not present on the closely related integrin, CD11b. Although several of the mouse antibodies to human CD11a (25.3, MHM.24, and 32E6) reacted with CD11a on Western blots (data not shown), we cannot be sure that they recognized conformation-independent epitopes. Based on the lack of cross-reactivity between CD11a and CD11b, we reasoned that a series of intermolecular chimeras produced by splicing complementary fragments of CD11a and CD11b cDNAs might encode unique molecules in which the secondary and tertiary structures of CD11a and CD11b portions would be preserved and the epitopes recognized by the CD11a and CD11b mAbs could be localized.The sequences of CD11a and CD11b were examined, and regions of high homology were selected as locations for chimerization. A schematic diagram of the four chimeras that were constructed is shown in Fig. 2. The chimeric genes, mutagenized to remove the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic tails, were all cloned into the pRK expression vector and transiently expressed in 293 cells as described previously(43Berman P.W. Nakamura G.R. Riddle L. Chiu H. Fisher K. Champe M. Gray A.M. Ward P. Fong S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was found that all of the chimeric proteins, but not CD11a, could be immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells with polyclonal rabbit sera to recombinant soluble Mac-1 (Fig. 1A). When the binding of the CD11a mAbs to the panel of CD11a/CD11b chimeras was evaluated, it was found that none of the antibodies known to block LFA-1 function bound to the ML9 construction containing residues 1-340 of CD11b fused to amino acids 332-1063 of CD11a (Fig. 2). However, the 3D6 mAb, known to bind to CD11a without blocking function, was able to immunoprecipitate this protein (Fig. 1, A and B, ML9). These results suggested that the epitopes recognized by the LFA-1-blocking mAbs were located within the first 340 residues of CD11a. The mAbs were then tested for binding to the LM3 protein that contained the first 25 amino acids of CD11a fused to residues 62-1092 of CD11b (Fig. 2). In contrast to the ML9 protein, neither 3D6 nor any of the LFA-1-blocking mAbs were able to immunoprecipitate this protein (Fig. 1, A and B, LM3). Thus the amino-terminal sequence of CD11a did not appear to contain epitopes recognized by any of the mAbs. When mAb binding to the LM2 protein was examined, all six of the CD11a-blocking antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate the protein (Fig. 1, A and B, LM2) that consisted of amino acids 1-331 of CD11a fused to amino acids 341-1092 of CD11b (Fig. 2). Similarly, all six of the CD11a-blocking mAbs bound to the LMN protein (Fig. 1, A and B, LMN) that consisted of residues 1-278 of CD11a fused to residues 289-1092 of CD11b (Fig. 2). These studies localized the epitopes recognized by the six LFA-1-blocking mAbs to an amino-terminal fragment of CD11a spanning residues 26-278 that contains the I domain but excludes the divalent cation-binding sites (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Diagram of CD11a/CD11b chimeric proteins. Intermolecular chimeras between CD11a and CD11b were produced by ligation of complementary sequences of cDNAs encoding CD11a and CD11b. Regions selected for chimerization exhibited a high degree of sequence homology. For all but one of the chimeras, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce common restriction sites at the chimeric junctions without changing the predicted amino acid sequence. To construct the LM2 and ML9 plasmids, SacII sites were introduced to join the fragments of CD11a and CD11b. In the LMN plasmid, NheI sites were introduced into CD11a and CD11b to join the complementary fragments. To construct the LM3 plasmid, naturally occurring Sse8387I sites were used to splice the complementary CD11a and CD11b fragments. Sequences from CD11a are shown as open bars; sequences from CD11b are shown as dark bars. The locations of the I domain, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular domain are also indicated. Amino acid numbering for CD11a and CD11b and the resulting chimeras is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of I Domain Sequences Essential for the Binding of mAbs to Human CD11aBecause pilot studies demonstrated that none of the mAbs to human CD11a cross-reacted with murine CD11a, we reasoned that sequences in the I domain that are important for mAb binding might be localized by replacing sequences from human CD11a with those from murine CD11a. Comparison of the sequences of human CD11a with murine CD11a (Fig. 3) revealed a high degree of homology in the I domain, with a limited number of sequence differences between the two proteins. A series of full-length CD11a replacement mutants was constructed (H/M 48-54) that incorporated the most radical amino acid differences between human and murine CD11a (Fig. 3). In control experiments (Fig. 4A), it was found that the nonblocking CD11a mAb 3D6 immunoprecipitated all of the proteins with I domain mutations. When mAbs known to block CD11a function were examined (Fig. 4), all were able to immunoprecipitate the H/M 48 protein (mutated at residues 182 and 184), the H/M 49 protein (mutated at residues 189 and 191), the H/M 50 protein (mutated at residue 210), and the H/M 51 protein (mutated at residues 216, 217, and 218). Together, these results demonstrated that multiple mutations at various locations in the I domain could be induced without disrupting the overall conformation of the molecule (Fig. 4, A and B, H/M 48-51). In contrast, mAbs TS-1/22 and 25.3 were unable to bind to the H/M 53 protein, whereas this protein was readily immunprecipitated by the MHM.24, CLB-LFA-1/2, 32E6, or 50G1 mAbs (Fig. 4). Thus, replacement of human CD11a residues Ile126 and Asn129 with residues from murine CD11a (the Met and Lys, respectively) specifically inhibited the binding of two of the six CD11a-blocking antibodies (Fig. 4B, H/M 53). Replacement of human CD11a residues Gln143, Pro144, Asp145, and Gln148 with murine CD11a residues Asp, Arg, Lys, and Glu, respectively (H/M 52), preserved the 25.3, TS1/22, and MHM.24 mAbs but abolished the binding of the CLB-LFA-1/2, 32E6, and 50G1 mAbs (Fig. 4, A and B, H/M 54). Finally, replacement of human CD11a residues Lys197, His198, Lys200, His201, and Leu203 with the murine CD11a residues Gly, Ser, Gln, Pro, and Phe, respectively (H/M 54), preserved the binding of the 25.3 and TS-1/22 mAbs but prevented the binding of mAbs MHM.24, CLB-LFA-1/2, 32E6, and 50G1 (Fig. 4, A and B, H/M 54). Thus, this study suggested that the I domain contains three distinct epitopes recognized by mAbs that block CD11a function. Based on these results we have termed the epitope recognized by the 25.3 and TS-1/22 mAbs (involving residues Ile126 and Asn129) as I domain epitope A (IdeA), the epitope recognized by mAbs 32E6, CLB-LFA-1/2, and 50G1 (involving residues 143, 144, 145, and 148) as I domain epitope B (IdeB), and the epitope recognized by MHM.24 as well as 32E6, CLB-LFA-1/2, and 50G1 (involving residues 197, 198, 200, 201, and 203) as I domain epitope C (IdeC).Figure 3:Alignment of I domain sequences from human and murine CD11a and description of human to mouse mutants.

The floor plate, a neuroepithelial structure, guides developing commissural axons in the spinal cord by release of chemoattractants. Floor plate cells express neurokinin-1 receptors, and a transiently appearing subpopulation of commissural axons contains substance P, the neuropeptide ligand for this receptor. Substance P increases the amount of axon outgrowth from dorsal horn explants cocultured with floor plate explants.

https://openalex.org/W1976605212,"The nitric oxide synthase-catalyzed conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and nitric oxide is known to be the sum of two partial reactions: oxygenation of arginine to N-hydroxyarginine, followed by oxygenation of N-hydroxyarginine to citrulline and nitric oxide. Whereas the conversion of N-hydroxyarginine to citrulline and nitric oxide has been the subject of a number of studies, the oxygenation of arginine to N-hydroxyarginine has received little attention. Here we show that substrate amounts of rat cerebellar nitric oxide synthase, in the absence of added NADPH, catalyze the conversion of arginine to N-hydroxyarginine as the dominant product. The product appears not to be tightly bound to the enzyme. A maximum of 0.16 mol of N-hydroxyarginine/mol of nitric oxide synthase subunit was formed. The reaction requires oxygen and the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin and is stimulated 3-fold by tetrahydrobiopterin. Upon addition of NADPH, citrulline is formed exclusively. Conversion of N-hydroxyarginine to citrulline, like the first partial reaction, requires Ca2+/calmodulin and is stimulated by tetrahydrobiopterin but differs from the first partial reaction in being completely dependent upon addition of NADPH. These results indicate that brain nitric oxide synthase contains an endogenous reductant that can support oxygenation of arginine but not of N-hydroxyarginine. The reductant is not NADPH, since the amount of nitric oxide synthase-bound NADPH is appreciably less than the amount required for N-hydroxyarginine synthesis.

The enzyme is of great interest because nitric oxide participates in a variety of physiological processes including vasodilation, macrophage toxicity, and neurotransmission(1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). There is now convincing evidence that the overall reaction catalyzed by NOS proceeds via two partial reactions, Arginine → L- NG -Hydroxyarginine L- NG -Hydroxyarginine → citrulline + nitric oxide nitric oxide synthase high performance liquid chromatography NG-hydroxyarginine. The intermediary role of L-NG-hydroxyarginine (NHA) was first suggested by Marletta et al. (2Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8706-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar) and detected as a minor product during the conversion of arginine to citrulline by mammalian cells induced for NO synthesis as well as by crude extracts of these cells (3Chenais B.

In the last study, [3H]NHA formation from [3H[arginine was detected only under special conditions, namely in the presence of a high concentration of a pool of unlabeled NHA, indicating that this intermediate may not normally be released from the enzyme. The amount of [3H]NHA accumulating was only 20% of the amount of [3H]citrulline formed(4Chenais B. Yapo A. Lepoivre M. Tenu J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1558-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiesman J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the formation of trace amounts of [3H]NHA from [3H]arginine catalyzed by purified porcine brain NOS. Here again, the amounts of NHA accumulating were small relative to the amounts of citrulline formed. Under normal reaction conditions, NHA accounted for a maximum of 2% of citrulline formed; in the presence of the redox-active inhibitors of citrulline formation, nitroblue tetrazolium or methylene blue, this value increased up to 20%. The small amounts of NHA relative to citrulline formed under these conditions have hampered attempts to elucidate the characteristics of the first partial reaction. Here we show that stoichiometric amounts of purified rat brain NOS convert arginine predominantly to NHA in the absence of added electron donor. This experimental system permits examination, for the first time, of the characteristics of the first partial oxygenation reaction. Our findings indicate that the rat brain enzyme contains an endogenous reductant that can support a single cycle oxygenation of arginine to NHA but not of NHA to citrulline. Possible candidates for this role are discussed in relation to the proposed mechanisms of action of nitric oxide synthase. L-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine monohydrochloride (Amersham Corp.) was purified by cation exchange HPLC. The natural (6R) isomer of BH4 was obtained from B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Catalase and the enzymes used for NADPH determination (glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) were from Boehringer Mannheim; calmodulin and glucose oxidase (Aspergillus niger) were from Calbiochem. NHA was a gift from Dr. Paul L. Feldman, Glaxo Research Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC). [3H]NHA was prepared by enzymic synthesis. Briefly, [3H]arginine (1.4 μM, 1.1 × 107 dpm) was incubated with 16 μg of NOS and the same concentration of components specified in the standard reaction mixture described under “Methods.” The volume of the reaction mixture was 85 μl. The reaction was terminated after 30 min with perchloric acid, followed by addition of 104 pmol of NHA. [3H]NHA was isolated by HPLC as described under “Methods.” The preparation (specific activity 3500 dpm/pmol) was stored at −80°C and used within 3 months, during which time it remained radiopure. After 5 months of storage, radiopurity had decreased to 80%. NOS was purified from frozen rat brain cerebella (8Giovanelli J. Campos K. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or from transfected human kidney 293 cells stably transfected with rat brain cDNA NOS(1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

NADPH present in the 2,5-ADP-sepharose eluate was decreased to a negligible concentration during the final gel filtration step. For the rat cerebella enzyme, NADPH was decreased by repeated concentration and dilution with 10 mM Tris•HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, with the use of a Centricon-30 (Amicon) ultrafilter(8Giovanelli J. Campos K. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ferricyanide-treated enzyme was prepared by incubation of cloned enzyme (410 μl, 722 μg) with 5 mM potassium ferricyanide in a final volume of 512 μl at 4°C for 2 min. Ferricyanide was separated from the treated enzyme on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris•HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. For studies of the synthesis of [3H]NHA, NADPH was omitted from the reaction mixture normally used for assay of the overall reaction of NOS(8Giovanelli J. Campos K. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (14 μl) contained 189 nM [3H]arginine (2.6 pmol, 2.4 × 105 dpm), 250 mM sodium Hepes (pH 6.4), 0.20 μg of calmodulin, 0.83 mM CaCl2, 60 μM BH4, 0.6 mM sodium EDTA, 14 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1.5 μg of catalase, and approximately 2 μg of NOS. Changes are noted in the text. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for the times specified and were routinely conducted under ambient laboratory lighting conditions; in one study, incubations were conducted in the dark by wrapping reaction tubes in aluminum foil. Reactions were terminated by addition of perchloric acid and 150-200 nmol each of authentic NHA and citrulline. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant solution was titrated with KOH to a pH of approximately 2 (thymol blue indicator) when using the HPLC protocol of Chenais et al. (3Chenais B. Yapo A. Lepoivre A.M. Tenu J.-P. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 539: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or to a pH of approximately 6 (bromcresol purple indicator) for the HPLC protocol described by Klatt et al.(7Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitate of potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was finally adjusted either to pH 2.2 by addition of sodium citrate to a final concentration of 20 mM (Chenais protocol) or to pH 6.5 by addition of sodium acetate to a final concentration of 50 mM (Klatt protocol). Approximately 100 μl of this solution was injected onto a Zorbax 300-SCX column for HPLC. Fractions of 1 ml were assayed for radioactivity; the retention times of NHA and citrulline were determined by amino acid determination of the marker amino acids with fluorescamine(10Lai C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The complete reaction mixture (85 μl) contained 2.4 nM [3H]NHA (730 dpm), 250 mM sodium Hepes (pH 6.4), 670 μM NADPH, 1.2 μg of calmodulin, 0.83 mM CaCl2, 60 μM BH4, 0.6 mM sodium EDTA, 85 μg of bovine serum albumin, 9 μg of catalase, and 0.7 μg of rat cerebellar NOS. The reaction was terminated after 15 min of incubation at 25°C by addition of perchloric acid and authentic NHA (100 nmol) and citrulline (200 nmol). The procedure described above for analysis of 3H in citrulline and NHA was then followed. HPLC-HPLC was performed by cation exchange chromatography on a Zorbax 300-SCX column (DuPont) (dimensions, 4.6 mm internal diameter × 25 cm) using the solvent system described by Chenais et al.

Reverse phase ion pair chromatography was performed on a Waters μ Bondapak C18 column (3.9 mm internal diameter × 30 cm) with the use of a gradient of 0-75% 1-propanol with a stationary phase of 17 mM sodium citrate, pH 2.7, containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate(11Kraak J.C. Jonker K.M. Huber J.F.K. J. Chrom. 1977; 142: 671-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Columns were operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples for characterization of [3H]NHA were mixed with authentic unlabeled NHA, arginine, citrulline, and ornithine and subjected to chromatography on Eastman Kodak chromagram cellulose plates developed with n-butanol/acetone/diethylamine/water (70/70/14/35, v/v) or on Whatman silica gel plates (PE SG) developed with acetonitrile/acetic acid/water (4/1/1, v/v). After development, the plates were dipped in a solution of 0.2% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone to localize the authentic amino acids and then immediately cut into 0.5 cm strips for localization of radioactivity. The reaction mixture (100 μl) for measurement of NHA synthesis under argon contained the components at the concentrations shown for the standard reaction mixture, with the exceptions that arginine was present at 2.5 μM and NOS was omitted. Glucose (4.7 mM) and glucose oxidase (0.7 units) were added as an oxygen scavenger. The reaction mixture, contained in a glass tube, was placed in a Waters vacuum vial and successively evacuated and flushed with argon a total of eight times. The vial was then briefly opened to admit rat cerebella NOS (15 μg) to the mixture, and 0.5 ml of a freshly prepared solution of 0.1 M sodium dithionite in 0.25 M Tris•HCl, pH 9.0, was added to the vial. The reaction mixture was again flushed with argon as described and then incubated for 30 min. Measurement of the overall reaction (citrulline synthesis) under argon was similarly determined in a reaction mixture identical to that described except for addition of 667 μM NADPH, 0.15 μM arginine, and 31 ng NOS; [3H]citrulline was measured by chromatography on Dowex 50 H+(8Giovanelli J. Campos K. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similar procedures were followed for measurements in air except for omission of glucose from reaction mixtures and sodium dithionite from reaction vials. For determination of the amount of NHA synthesized under carbon monoxide, reaction mixtures were the same as described for the standard reaction mixture, except that the arginine concentration was 11.2 μM. Reaction mixtures (NOS and calmodulin omitted) were pipetted into a Pierce Reactivial (0.3 ml), which was then sealed with a Teflon/silicone disc and flushed for 5 min at room temperature with a mixture of carbon monoxide/oxygen (4/1, v/v). The gas mixture entered the Reactivials through a hypodermic needle and was allowed to impinge on the surface of the reaction mixture, which was shaken frequently to facilitate equilibration. After the initial equilibration, cloned NOS (1.6 μg) was injected with a Hamilton syringe, and equilibration with the gas phase continued for another 5 min. Reactions were started by injection of calmodulin with a Hamilton syringe to a final reaction volume of 14 μl. The final reaction mixture was incubated for 5 or 15 min. For determination of the overall reaction (citrulline synthesis), the above procedure was modified to include 667 μM NADPH and NOS (2.3 ng) in a final volume of 42 μl. Procedures for measurements under air were identical except for substitution of air for the carbon monoxide mixture. Tris buffer, which interferes with the Pico-Tag procedure, was removed from cloned NOS (255 μg) by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 50 mM potassium Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mMp-aminobenzenesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. Aliquots of this preparation were removed for determination of protein and NHA synthesis. The remaining preparation was mixed with marker [U-14C]arginine (5300 dpm, 7.2 pmol) and trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 4.5% (w/v). Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was extracted with 3.5 volumes of fresh ether; extractions were repeated three times. This material was then subjected to Pico-Tag analysis with the use of the protocol described for the 30-cm Pico-Tag free amino acid analysis column (Waters Manual WM02, revision 1). Fractions from the column were collected and assayed for radioactivity. Ninety percent of the recovered radioactivity comigrated with a retention time (approximately 17 min) characteristic of the phenylthiocarbamyl derivative of authentic arginine. The negligible ultraviolet peak derived from the NOS preparation and corresponding with this radioactive derivative was quantitated by comparison with separate runs of authentic arginine (containing [14C]arginine) and was corrected for small differences in recovery of [14C]arginine. NADPH content of NOS preparations was determined by the cycling method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. Schulz D.W. Rock M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2746-2755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Matschinsky(13Matschinsky F.M. J. Neurochem. 1968; 15: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Specificity for NADPH is conferred by preincubation of the sample for 10 min at 60°C in 0.02 M NaOH, 1.5 mM cysteine to destroy any oxidized pyridine nucleotides followed by cycling in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADPH-specific glutamate dehydrogenase. A standard curve for NADPH was determined by carrying authentic NADPH through the procedure. Final NADPH content of NOS was corrected for the relatively small fluorescence values measured in the absence of NADPH and in NOS preparations carried through the cycling procedure in the absence of cycling enzymes. NADPH contents of NOS were also corrected for recovery of authentic NADPH (70%) added to the preparation. Cloned NOS (12.8 μg) was incubated with 11 μM [3H]arginine and the remaining components of the standard reaction mixture for assay of the first partial reaction (final volume, 46 μl). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 25°C and then stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 100 mM EDTA and cooled to 4°C. One sample of 14 μl was mixed with perchloric acid. Another sample was immediately applied to a 200-μl bed of Sephadex G-25 medium (Pharmacia) equilibrated at 4°C with 50 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. Based on a calibration determined with blue dextran 2000 (Pharmacia), the column was eluted with the same buffer to yield protein and non-protein fractions. Each of the samples was then assayed for [3H]NHA as described above. Protein was determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce manual 23225X) with the use of a bovine serum albumin standard. Fig. 1 illustrates the radioactive products formed during the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of [3H]arginine. In the absence of added NADPH (Fig. 1, panel A), the major radioactive product (93% of the total) comigrates with authentic NHA marker. The other enzyme-dependent radioactive product comigrates with the authentic citrulline marker. Upon addition of NADPH (Fig. 1, panel B), radioactivity appears exclusively in citrulline. Fig. 1, panel C, in which NOS was omitted, demonstrates the enzyme dependence of the reactions. The dominant radioactive product formed under the conditions used in Fig. 1, panel A, was characterized as [3H]NHA by its comigration with authentic NHA during HPLC on cation exchange and reverse phase ion pair columns and thin layer chromatography on cellulose and silica gel. A summary of the chromatographic properties of the radioactive product compared with those of related amino acids is given in Table 1. Further evidence for the identity of the radioactive product with NHA is provided by its conversion predominantly to [3H]citrulline when incubated with rat cerebellar NOS (see below).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Table 2 summarizes the effects of components of the reaction mixture on the synthesis of radioactive products from [3H]arginine. Omission of Ca2+/calmodulin or BH4 resulted in marked decreases in [3H]NHA synthesis. Omission of catalase increased the proportion of radioactivity in citrulline without affecting the total radioactivity in NHA plus citrulline. In the presence of added NADPH, total 3H incorporated into product was increased 15-fold, and radioactivity was detected only in citrulline (see also Fig. 1, panel B).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 illustrates the time course of formation of [3H]NHA and [3H]citrulline from [3H]arginine in the absence or presence of BH4. At all times studied, [3H]NHA comprised at least 83% of the total radioactive products in the presence of BH4 and at least 91% in the absence of BH4. The presence of BH4 resulted in approximately 3-fold increases in [3H]NHA formation and even greater increases in [3H]citrulline formation. Under the conditions of this experiment, the conversion of [3H]arginine to products was essentially complete after 30 min. Cessation of [3H]NHA formation was not caused by inactivation of the enzyme; assays of aliquots of the BH4-supplemented reaction mixture removed at 30 and 60 min showed NOS activities (measured in the presence of NADPH) of 65% that of an aliquot removed at zero time. In a separate experiment, we examined whether the yield of [3H]NHA was increased by the addition of a 45-fold excess of unlabeled NHA (8.5 μM) over [3H]arginine during a 60-min incubation. Under these conditions 98% inhibition of 3H incorporation into NHA was observed. Fig. 3, panel A, illustrates the conversion of [3H]NHA to [3H]citrulline in the presence of added NADPH. No conversion took place when NADPH was omitted (Fig. 3, panel B) or when NOS was omitted (Fig. 3, panel C). No detectable activity (≤10% of the complete reaction) was observed when calmodulin was omitted (data not shown). Omission of BH4 decreased activity to 44% of the control, whereas omission of catalase had little or no effect (data not shown). The amount of [3H]NHA formed increased with the amount of NOS present (Fig. 4, panel A). NHA formation also increased with argininine concentration to a value of 0.13 NHA/NOS subunit at 20 μM arginine (Fig. 4, panel B). These results indicate that even higher ratios of NHA/NOS might have been obtained at concentrations of arginine greater than 20 uM. The effects of higher concentrations of arginine were not examined because they reduced the sensitivity of the assay to an unacceptable level. It should be noted that the values of NHA synthesis were measured over a 30-min incubation period, during which time the reaction had gone to completion (Fig. 2). This was confirmed in separate experiments that showed that the same relationships depicted in Fig. 4 were observed for incubation periods of 60 and 120 min. Each of the values for NHA synthesis shown in Fig. 4, therefore, represent maximum amounts of product formed rather than initial rates of synthesis. The products of the first partial reaction were subjected to fractionation by a gentle procedure (gel filtration at 4°C) designed to permit the detection of any [3H]NHA bound to the enzyme. [3H]NHA was recovered in the combined non-protein and protein fractions in 98% yield. Of the recovered [3H]NHA, 97% was recovered in the non-protein fraction, suggesting that, under the conditions used for assay of the first partial reaction, [3H]NHA does not remain bound to the enzyme. The effect of anaerobiosis was determined in experiments in which air was replaced by argon, and the effect of carbon monoxide was determined by replacing air with a mixture of carbon monoxide/oxygen (4/1, v/v). Replacement of air by argon caused a potent inhibition of both NHA (94%) and citrulline (91%) synthesis. The carbon monoxide/oxygen mixture caused 66% inhibition of citrulline synthesis (measured over 15 min). The effect of the carbon monoxide/oxygen mixture on NHA synthesis was determined over two time periods: at 15 min, a time at which the reaction had gone to completion (see Fig. 2) and at 5 min, which gives a value better approximating a true rate. Compared with a 66% inhibition of citrulline synthesis, relatively modest inhibitions of NHA synthesis of 19 and 28%, respectively, were observed. The possible role of photoreduction of enzyme-bound heme (see “Discussion”) in the conversion of arginine to NHA was examined by comparing [3H]NHA synthesis in reactions incubated either under routine assay conditions (ambient light) or in the dark. [3H]NHA formation was determined after 5, 25, and 60 min of incubation. Identical amounts of [3H]NHA were formed under the two conditions (data not shown), indicating that neither the rate (approximated by the 5-min value) or the final amount (approximated by the 25- and 60-min values) of NHA synthesis is light-dependent. Ferricyanide oxidizes tetrahydropterins (14Archer N.C. Vonderschmitt D.J. Scrimgeour K.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and has been used to oxidize the flavin semiquinone of NOS(15Stuehr D. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of pretreatment of NOS with ferricyanide was examined in order to assess the possible role of the flavin semiquinone and BH4 in NHA synthesis. In these experiments, rates of the overall reaction (NADPH included in the assay) and of the first partial reaction (NADPH omitted from the assay) were determined for the native and ferricyanide-treated enzyme in the absence and presence of BH4. Table 3 shows that, compared with the native enzyme, pretreatment with ferricyanide decreased the overall reaction to 38 and 36% when assayed in the absence or presence of BH4, respectively. The first partial reaction was more sensitive to ferricyanide treatment of the enzyme. Indeed, ferricyanide treatment actually increases the amount of citrulline formed in the combined absence of NADPH and BH4. Radioactive accumulation in NHA was decreased to 6-7%, whereas total accumulation in NHA plus citrulline was decreased to 18 and 8%, measured in the absence and presence of BH4, respectively. For both the overall reaction and the first partial reaction, addition of BH4 did not restore activity of the ferricyanide-treated enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab When assayed in the absence of NADPH, the relative amount of radioactivity accumulating in citrulline relative to that in NHA was much higher for ferricyanide-treated enzyme. When assayed in the presence of NADPH, no significant accumulation of NHA was detected with the ferricyanide-treated enzyme. These observations are consistent with ferricyanide treatment inhibiting the first partial reaction to a greater extent than the second partial reaction. Spectral evidence of McMillan and Masters (16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) indicated that a major portion of NOS as normally isolated from transfected human kidney cells contains tightly bound arginine. As explained below, it was relevant to our studies to determine whether NOS isolated from the same source in our hands also contained bound arginine. Direct determination of arginine in cloned NOS (Table 4) showed an upper limit of 0.06 mol of bound arginine/subunit of NOS. The enzyme preparation, which had been subjected to gel filtration before assay of arginine, synthesized 0.10 mol of NOHA/mol of NOS subunit.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Table 5 compares the NADPH content of two preparations of cloned NOS with the amount of NHA synthesis. NOS contained small amounts of NADPH/subunit, which for each preparation is far less than the amount of NHA formed per subunit.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The system described here permits a determination of the characteristics of the first step in nitric oxide synthesis, i.e. the oxygenation of arginine to NHA. One of the most interesting findings is that NHA synthesis proceeds in the absence of added NADPH. This is in sharp contrast to the stringent requirement for added NADPH for further conversion of NHA to citrulline. Synthesis of NHA was stimulated approximately 6-fold by Ca2+/calmodulin and approximately 3-fold by BH4 It is well established that BH4 participates in the second partial reaction"

https://openalex.org/W2025458032,"β-Glucan receptors are present on mammalian leukocytes and initiate phagocytosis of particulate yeast β-glucans, such as zymosan particles. Human monocytes and U937 cells express two membrane proteins of 180 and 160 kDa, each of which binds particulate yeast glucan through a 20-kDa polypeptide constituent. In this report, the structural composition of the two β-glucan receptors and the biochemical properties of their polypeptide constituents were examined. The 180-kDa receptor was composed of three disulfide-linked polypeptides of 95, 60, and 20 kDa, whereas the 160-kDa receptor was a multimer of two polypeptides of 27 and 20 kDa. Unlike other receptor constituents, the 20-kDa polypeptide was nonglycosylated and focused at two distinct isoelectric points. Immunoblots of the focused polypeptides showed the two 20-kDa variants and the 95-kDa subunit to be constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, a feature not previously reported for receptors on human mononuclear phagocytes. Dephosphorylation of the receptor proteins resulted in the loss of antigenic phosphotyrosine without affecting the antigenicity of either 20-kDa variant for the anti-idiotypic antibody to β-glucan receptors. Separate analysis of the 160-kDa receptor showed it contained both variants of the 20-kDa polypeptide. Thus, the 20-kDa subunit constituent of the two β-glucan receptors is a functionally and chemically unique polypeptide with apparent microheterogeneity in its primary structure."

In this study, FAD was removed by dialyzing the holoprotein against 2 M KBr, and synthetic analogs of FAD were substituted in the flavin binding site as structural probes. Spectral analysis indicates that the benzoquinoid forms of 8-mercapto-FAD and 6-mercapto-FAD are stabilized on binding to the enzyme.

This receptor has been purified(4Kodama T. Reddy P. Kishimoto C. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have now been cloned and sequenced. In all species the scavenger receptor sequences were predicted to encode a transmembrane protein with multiple extracellular domains, including an α-helical coiled-coil domain and a collagenous domain. There are two subtypes of scavenger receptor (type I and type II) mRNAs which are the products of alternative splicing of the single gene(11Emi M. Asaoka H. Matsumoto A. Itakura H. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Kanamori H. Yazaki Y. Takahashi E. Lepert M. Lalouel J.M. Kodama T. Mukai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2120-2125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors differ only by the presence in the type I receptor of an extracellular cysteine-rich C-terminal domain and have similar ligand specificity. Using these probes, scavenger receptors have been shown to be expressed on macrophage cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages and Kupffer cells. A hallmark of the scavenger receptor is its unusually broad ligand specificity(12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, AcLDL, OxLDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL(13Fogelman A.M. Shechter I. Seager J. Hokom M. Child J.S. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is becoming evident that more than one type of receptor that can recognize chemically modified LDL may exist in mammalian cells. The receptors that recognize chemically modified LDL but are distinct from types I and II scavenger receptors have been identified in mouse peritoneal macrophages using expression cloning. These receptors include FcγRII-b2 (16Stanton L.W. White R.T. Bryant C.M. Protter A.A. Endemann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22446-22451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CD36(17Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 40-kDa FcγRII-b2 was found to be a mouse homologue of human class II Fcγ receptor, which binds IgG only in complexed or polymeric form. CD36 is an 88-kDa glycoprotein expressed on the surface of monocytes, platelets(18Talle M.A. Rao P.E. Westberg E. Allegar N. Makowski M. Mittler R.S. Goldstein G. Cell. Immunol. 1983; 78: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells(19Swerlick R.A. Lee K.H. Wick T.M. Lawley T.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting feature of these receptors is that both recognize OxLDL but not AcLDL. Endothelial cells have also been shown to possess scavenger receptor activity by many researchers (20Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 620: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel Th. J.C. J. Biol.

The receptors responsible for AcLDL binding on the endothelial cells, however, are distinct from type I or type II scavenger receptors, since endothelial cells show no immunoreactivity to anti-scavenger receptor antibody(24Naito M. Kodama T. Matsumoto A. Doi T. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1411-1423PubMed Google Scholar), and mRNAs for both types of receptor are not detectable on them(10Bickel P.E. Freeman M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although macrophages constitutively express scavenger receptors, it is also known that scavenger (or AcLDL) receptor activity can be induced in other types of cell by various stimuli. For example, platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol ester induce type I or type II scavenger receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells(25Inaba T. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Harada K. Kozaki K. Watanabe Y. Hoh E. Motoyoshi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13107-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while human chorionic gonadotropin stimulates scavenger receptor activity in rat luteal cells(26Chen Z. Menon K.M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1150: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the current study, we isolated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which actively endocytose AcLDL, by culturing in the presence of exogenous AcLDL as the sole cholesterol source. Evidence that the receptor on these isolated CHO cells is distinct from other reported scavenger receptors with respect to ligand specificity and competitor sensitivity is presented. Human AcLDL labeled with the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-AcLDL) was obtained from Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA. Sodium [125I]iodine and 1,2-di[1-14C]palmitoylglycerophosphocholine (100-120 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. BSA, fucoidan, poly(I), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and mevalonic acid were purchased from Sigma. Maleyl-BSA was prepared as described elsewhere (15Haberland M.E. Fogelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Dextran sulfate was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, was a gift from Eisai Co. Ltd., Japan. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Birmingham, AL. Mammalian expression vector, pRc/CMV, was purchased from Invitrogen. CHO cells (CHO-K1), a gift from Dr. M. Nishijima (National Institute of Health, Japan), were used as parental cells to isolate cells expressing a novel type of scavenger receptor. These CHO cells are termed control CHO cells in the following experiments. CHO cells expressing type I human scavenger receptors were established by the following procedure. An expression vector containing full-length human type I scavenger receptor and the neomycin-resistance gene, pRc/CMV SR, was constructed and transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Colonies resistant to G418 were screened with DiI-AcLDL to identify the scavenger receptor-positive colonies as previously described(27Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One of these, named CHO-SR7, was used in the following experiments. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (medium A) unless otherwise noted. Control CHO cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 150-mm dish in 15 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (medium B) in the presence of 5 μg/ml AcLDL. After 2 days, the medium was exchanged for medium B containing 250 μM mevalonic acid, 5 μM simvastatin, and 5 μg/ml AcLDL. The cells were further treated with gradually increasing concentrations of simvastatin (increases every 2 weeks) until the concentration finally reached 100 μM. Under culture, about half of the cells died at 25 μM simvastatin, and eventually about 95% died and were excluded. The surviving CHO cells were cloned by limiting dilution method. After sufficient growth (5 × 104 cells/cm2), the cloned cells were stored in liquid nitrogen until use in the experiment. LDL (d = 1.019-1.050 g/ml) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) (d = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) from fresh human plasma were isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation(28Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Iodination and acetylation of LDL were performed as described elsewhere (28Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 29Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The concentration of lipoprotein is given in terms of its protein content. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.21 g/ml) was prepared as previously described(30Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liposomes used were composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/dicetylphosphate/free cholesterol (molar ratio 50:50:10:75) (PS-liposome) or phosphatidylcholine/dicetylphosphate/free cholesterol (molar ratio 100:10:75) (PC-liposome). PS-liposomes labeled with [14C]phosphatidylcholine were composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/dicetylphosphate/free cholesterol/1,2-di[1-14C] palmitoylglycerophosphocholine (100-120 mCi/mmol) (molar ratio 50:50:10:75:0.5). These liposomes were prepared as described elsewhere(31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes containing FITC-dextran were prepared with a slight modification. Four micromoles of dried lipids were dispersed in 0.2 ml of 0.3 M glucose containing FITC-dextran (10 mg/ml) to obtain multilamellar vesicles. Unencapsulated FITC-dextran was removed by chromatography on a Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with 0.3 M glucose. The fractions containing liposomes were collected and used for the following experiments. Evaluation of the accumulation of fluorescent DiI-AcLDL was performed by the following procedure as described by Kingsley and Krieger(32Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of medium A containing 5 μg/ml DiI-AcLDL for 1 h at 37°C. The monolayers were then washed and fixed by soaking in 3% formalin. Accumulation of DiI-AcLDL by the cells was observed using fluorescence microscopy. The accumulation of liposomes containing fluorescent FITC-dextran by the cells was performed by the same procedure except that they were not fixed. Control and the isolated CHO cells were seeded on day 0 at 5 × 104 cells/well in medium B. On day 2, the medium was exchanged for 2 ml of medium B containing 250 μM mevalonic acid and various amounts of simvastatin in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml AcLDL. On day 4, the monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove cell debris. Adherent cells were then trypsinized and the cell number was counted. Assay was performed as previously described (1Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 76: 333-337Crossref Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 29Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. CHO cells were incubated in 1 ml of a solution of Ham's F-12 medium, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (medium C) and 125I-AcLDL in the absence or presence of 20-fold excess amounts of AcLDL for 2 h at 4°C. After incubation the cells were washed three times with 1 ml buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA (buffer A), then twice with 1 ml of buffer A without BSA. The cells were removed from the dish by dissolution in 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Aliquots were removed from the dish for counting in a γ counter and for measurement of protein concentration(33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of specifically bound 125I-AcLDL was determined by subtracting the radioactivity bound in the presence of a 20-fold excess amount of AcLDL from the radioactivity bound in the absence of AcLDL. The binding values are expressed as ng of 125I-AcLDL protein bound per mg total cell protein. Each dish contained about 100 μg total cell protein. CHO cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of medium B containing 125I-AcLDL in the absence or presence of 20-fold excess amounts of AcLDL at 37°C. After washing the cells the amount of 125I-labeled acid-soluble material in the medium (degradation) and the amount of 125I-AcLDL in the cells (association) were determined by subtracting the radioactivity occurring in the presence of the 20-fold excess amount of AcLDL from the radioactivity occurring in the absence of AcLDL. Association of liposome with the cells was examined by the same procedure as the 125I-AcLDL association assay except that 100 μg/ml 14C-labeled liposome was used as a ligand instead of 125I-AcLDL. We isolated the CHO cells surviving in medium containing 5 μg/ml AcLDL as the sole source of exogenous lipoproteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). The appearance and doubling time of the isolated CHO cells were almost the same as those of the parental CHO cells. Parental control cells and one typical clone of these isolated CHO cells (denoted CHO-AL1) were used in the following experiments. When CHO-AL1 cells were cultured in media containing different concentrations of simvastatin for 48 h, all the cells died at a concentration of 25 μM simvastatin. In contrast, in a medium containing 5 μg/ml exogenous AcLDL CHO-AL1 cells were resistant to 50 μM simvastatin and growing cells were observed even at 100 μM (Fig. 1). Control CHO cells, however, were sensitive to the same concentration of simvastatin irrespective of the presence or absence of AcLDL (data not shown). These results indicate that CHO-AL1 cells can utilize exogenous AcLDL as a cholesterol source. Both control and CHO-AL1 cells were incubated with DiI-AcLDL and examined using fluorescence microscopy. Typical fluorescence micrographs are shown in Fig. 2. Control CHO cells exhibited no efficient fluorescence, whereas CHO-AL1 cells accumulated a massive amount of fluorescence, appearing as small punctate foci, suggesting that CHO-AL1 cells actively take up AcLDL. First, the surface binding of 125I-AcLDL at 4°C was examined. When CHO-AL1 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-AcLDL at 4°C, their specific surface binding increased in a saturable fashion (Fig. 3A). The corresponding Scatchard plot was indicated in Fig. 3B. Goodness of the fit was assessed by means of the Akaike's information criterion value(34Kato Y. Liu K.-X. Nakamura T. Sugiyama Y. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the data were fitted best to the model with two kinds of saturable binding sites, high and low affinity. The dissociation constants for high and low affinity binding were 3.8 and 4211 μg/ml, respectively. In contrast, control CHO cells exhibited virtually no efficient specific binding of 125I-AcLDL (Fig. 3A). Next, association and degradation of 125I-AcLDL by CHO-AL1 cells were examined at 37°C (Fig. 4). In CHO-AL1 cells incubated with 125I-AcLDL at 37°C for varying lengths of time, the cellular association of radioactivity reached a maximum within 2 h and was maintained at steady-state thereafter. Acid-soluble radioactivity continued to appear in the medium at a linear rate, reflecting the continuing uptake and degradation of 125I-AcLDL. After 24 h, approximately 5 times as much 125I-AcLDL had been degraded as was contained within the cells at steady-state. In the presence of 75 μM of the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine(35de Duve C. de Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 36Wibo M. Poole B. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), degradation was completely abolished, whereas the cellular association of 125I-AcLDL increased for 4 h and reached a steady-state plateau (data not shown). These results indicate that CHO-AL1 cells express the receptor that recognizes AcLDL, and metabolize AcLDL through these receptors. As described above, it was found that CHO-AL1 cells express a specific receptor that recognizes AcLDL. To compare this receptor with the macrophage scavenger receptor, we prepared CHO cells (CHO-SR7) that constitutively express human type I scavenger receptor by transfecting its cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, the specificity of the receptor on CHO-AL1 cells was examined by competition with various lipoproteins. A 50-fold excess of HDL or LDL had little effect on association and degradation of 125I-AcLDL, whereas a 20-fold excess of unlabeled AcLDL reduced them by 90% (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with CHO-SR7 cells (data not shown), consistent with previous data from cells expressing macrophage scavenger receptors(27Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Next, the effects of known competitors for the macrophage scavenger receptor on the association of 125I-AcLDL to CHO-SR7 and CHO-AL1 cells were examined. As previously reported(27Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), dextran sulfate, poly(I), maleyl-BSA and fucoidan effectively competed for the association of 125I-AcLDL by CHO-SR7 cells (Fig. 5B). Unexpectedly, however, inhibition of AcLDL binding was not observed with dextran sulfate, poly(I) and fucoidan in CHO-AL1 cells (Fig. 5A). Heparin was not an effective competitor for either type of receptor. Among the competitors tested, only maleyl-BSA inhibited 125I-AcLDL association by CHO-AL1 cells. Similar results were obtained when degradation by these cells was examined (data not shown). Previously, we have demonstrated that negatively charged liposomes containing acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid are effectively taken up by cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages and that this uptake is in part inhibited by AcLDL or OxLDL(31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined whether CHO-AL1 cells can take up these liposomes. As shown in Fig. 6D, upon incubation with phosphatidylserine-containing liposome (PS-liposome) encapsulated FITC-dextran, CHO-AL1 cells accumulated a massive amount of intracellular fluorescence. This fluorescence was lost in the presence of a 20-fold excess of the unlabeled liposome (data not shown). In fact, CHO-AL1 cells actively metabolized these liposomes and accumulated neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester in their cytoplasm (unpublished data). On the other hand, control CHO cells (data not shown) and CHO-SR7 cells (Fig. 6B) exhibited no appreciable fluorescence. These results indicate that the receptor on CHO-AL1 cells may recognize PS-liposomes, but the type I scavenger receptor expressed on control CHO cells does not. Liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine (PC-liposome) were recognized by neither of the receptors under these conditions (Fig. 6, A and C). A cross-competition study between AcLDL and PS-liposome was also performed. First, as shown in Fig. 7A, the effect of the liposome on 125I-AcLDL degradation was examined. Unlabeled PS-liposome (100 μg/ml) inhibited 125I-AcLDL degradation by CHO-AL1 cells, but not by CHO-SR7 cells. Next, the effect of AcLDL on [14C]PS-liposome association was examined in CHO-AL1 cells (Fig. 7B). Unlabeled AcLDL (1 mg/ml) completely inhibited [14C]PS-liposome association by CHO-AL1 cells. Dextran sulfate, poly(I), fucoidan, heparin and maleyl-BSA did not suppress [14C]PS-liposome association by CHO-AL1 cells, as in the case of 125I-AcLDL (data not shown). These results indicate that AcLDL and PS-liposome are recognized by the same receptor on CHO-AL1 cells, and that this receptor is distinct from macrophage type I scavenger receptor based on their competitor sensitivity and ligand specificity. The effect of phospholipid composition on the association of liposomes was further examined. The association of liposomes with CHO-AL1 cells was found to be dependent on liposomal composition (Fig. 8). Efficient association was observed for liposomes containing acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine in CHO-AL1 cells. PC-liposome which contained small amount of dicetylphosphate (see “Experimental Procedures”) also showed a low but significant level of association with CHO-AL1 cells. In a separate experiment, liposomes composed of exclusively phosphatidylcholine, which tend to aggregate, did not show appreciable binding to either control or CHO-AL1 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that negatively charged liposomes are taken up by the receptor for AcLDL expressed on the CHO-AL1 cells. Even in control CHO cells, less efficient but significant association was observed for liposomes containing acidic phospholipids. In the current study, we isolated CHO cells expressing a receptor that recognizes both AcLDL and negatively charged liposomes by culturing the cells in the presence of exogenous AcLDL as the sole cholesterol supplement. The receptor expressed on the isolated CHO cells (CHO-AL1) appears likely to be distinct from the macrophage type I or type II scavenger receptor (Table 1) because: (i) dextran sulfate, poly(I), and fucoidan, all of which are known to be effective competitors for the scavenger receptor, do not compete for the binding of 125I-AcLDL (Fig. 5). (ii) Both AcLDL and negatively charged liposomes containing acidic phospholipids are recognized by the same receptor on the CHO cells, whereas CHO-SR7 cells transfected with cDNA for the human type I scavenger receptor do not endocytose negatively charged liposomes (Fig. 5)(6Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 37Lee K.-D. Pitas R.E. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (iii) CHO-AL1 cells expressed no detectable scavenger receptor mRNA by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To identify the receptor molecule, we also performed ligand blot analysis for CHO-AL1 cells with 125I-AcLDL or 125I-maleyl-BSA using the methods of Daniel et al.(38Daniel T.O. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4606-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kodama et al.(4Kodama T. Reddy P. Kishimoto C. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, where the band corresponding to the scavenger receptor could be detected in CHO-SR7 cells, the specific band for the receptor that binds to 125I-AcLDL or 125I-maleyl-BSA was not observed for CHO-AL1 cells. This may indicate that the AcLDL receptor on CHO-AL1 cells became irreversibly inactivated during the ligand blot experiment, or that it has properties different from those of type I or type II scavenger receptors.

Endothelial cells also express AcLDL receptors(20Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 620: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel Th.

Acta. 1991; 1091: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but these receptors appear to be different from types I or II scavenger receptors. Although the receptors on endothelial cells have not yet been clearly identified(39Krieger M. Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fact that polyanionic macromolecules such as poly(I) compete for the binding of 125I-AcLDL by endothelial cells suggests (40Van Berkel T.J.C. de Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41De Vries H.E. Kuiper J. De Boer A.G. Van Berkel T.J. Breimer D.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the receptor on CHO-AL1 cells is also distinct from those on endothelial cells (Table 1). All of these data support the idea that the receptor on the isolated CHO-AL1 cells seems to be a new class of scavenger receptor with respect to ligand specificity and competitor sensitivity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Previously, we have demonstrated that negatively charged liposomes containing acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid are effectively taken up by cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages and that this uptake is in part inhibited by AcLDL or OxLDL(31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence against the involvement of types I or II scavenger receptors in the uptake of negatively charged liposomes has been documented. For example, expression of the cDNA for the bovine types I or II scavenger receptor by CHO cells induced an increase in the uptake of AcLDL, but not the uptake of negatively charged liposomes (37Lee K.-D. Pitas R.E. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (this study). Moreover, in cultured rabbit smooth muscle cells treated with phorbol ester, the uptake of AcLDL was enhanced dramatically, but there was no effect on the uptake of these liposomes(37Lee K.-D. Pitas R.E. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results indicated that types I or II scavenger receptor cannot account for the uptake of negatively charged liposomes by cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages, and that other receptor(s) (denoted X in Table 1) responsible for the uptake of negatively charged liposomes may exist on these cells. It is possible that CD36 or FcγRII-b2 may be involved in the uptake of negatively charged liposomes, but the fact that their uptake was inhibited significantly by AcLDL (31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cannot be explained by the involvement of these receptors. The binding of negatively charged liposomes to the receptors on mouse peritoneal macrophages was effectively suppressed by polyanionic sugars(31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the binding of liposomes to macrophages, binding of AcLDL and negatively charged liposomes to the receptor on the CHO-AL1 cells was not inhibited by polyanionic sugars (data not shown). A further difference in the nature of the receptors between CHO-AL1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages is the extent of the uptake of phosphatidylethanolamine-containing liposomes (Fig. 8). Mouse peritoneal macrophages did not take up significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine-containing liposomes(31Nishikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CHO-AL1 cells take up these liposomes as effectively as liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylinositol under the present conditions. Since phosphatidylethanolamine exhibits a weakly acidic nature in the neutral pH range, the receptor on CHO-AL1 cells may be able to recognize these liposomes as well. Although our data demonstrate the presence of a receptor that recognizes both AcLDL and negatively charged liposomes in CHO cells, this receptor may not be identical to the receptor detected on macrophages that recognizes the liposomes. CHO cells expressing high AcLDL receptor activity were obtained by culturing in a medium containing exogenous AcLDL as the sole cholesterol supplement. The Scatchard plot analysis of the isolated cells exhibited non linear binding with two classes of 125I-AcLDL binding sites (high and low affinity). However, this does not necessarily represent the expression of two distinct receptor proteins, since the CHO cells that received transfection of the murine scavenger receptor cDNA (types I or II) also showed high and low affinity binding of 125I-AcLDL(9Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which receptor expression occurs is at present totally unknown. The expression of the receptor is likely to be reversible in CHO cells, since incubation of CHO-AL1 cells in medium without simvastatin caused the gradual reduction of receptor activity. 2M. Fukasawa, K. Hirota, H. Adachi, K. Mimura, K. Murakami-Murofushi, M. Tsujimoto, H. Arai, and K. Inoue, unpublished data. The parental control CHO cells might have had a low level of receptor activity for the uptake of negatively charged liposomes, since a very low but significant level of association of these liposomes was observed even for the control cells (Fig. 8). Liver parenchymal cells also exhibit very low level AcLDL uptake activity and that this uptake is not inhibited by poly(I)(40Van Berkel T.J.C. de Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that AcLDL receptor may be expressed on many types of cell at a low level. Certain signals may induce increase of the expression of the receptor for AcLDL and negatively charged liposomes under some conditions. An interesting hypothesis is that a physiologic stimulus that induces the increased expression of this type of receptor may exist in animals. The next challenge will be to determine the structure and mechanism of induction of this new type of scavenger receptor. We thank Drs. Y. Sato and Y. Kato (University of Tokyo) for helpful suggestions. Note Added in Proof-Acton et al. (42Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol.

One epitope resided in a region on the exterior of the cell, at the surface of the FepA protein, while other epitopes appeared to be localized to the periplasm or within the outer membrane. The outer membrane of a Gram-negative bacterium is a permeability barrier controlling passage of solutes to the periplasmic space surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane. Many substances traverse the outer membrane through nonspecific porin channels. Other porins such as LamB of Escherichia coli form substrate-specific outer membrane channels(1Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Vitamin B12 and iron-sequestering microbial siderophores are presumed too large or sterically unsuitable for passage through E. coli porins, thus necessitating expression of ligand-specific outer and inner membrane transport proteins which act in conjunction with accessory proteins TonB and ExbB (2Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 218-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pierce J.R. Earhart C.F. J.

The E. coli outer membrane protein FepA is the high affinity receptor for the siderophore ferric enterobactin and the antibacterial colicins B and D(2Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 218-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the best characterized outer membrane transporters function as porin diffusion channels, the specific mode of FepA function is unknown. Nutrients pass through porins by simple or facilitated diffusion, yet FepA has the capacity to concentrate ferric enterobactin in the periplasm against a gradient(6Pugsley A.P. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the outer membrane supplies no membrane potential as an energy source for such transport, it is postulated that TonB, with ExbB, transduces energy by an unknown mechanism from the cytoplasmic membrane(7Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2027-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2019-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In support of this concept, one region of FepA and other TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors, the “TonB box”, has been implicated through genetic studies as a contact point for TonB(9Heller K. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schoffler H. Braun V. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Sauer M. Hantke K. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chemical cross-linking experiments provided evidence for physical interaction of TonB and FepA(12Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FepA has been proposed to function as a ligand-specific gated porin channel(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The model invokes the existence of ligand-specific external domains that occlude the FepA channel; upon binding of the ligand to FepA, TonB is stimulated to allow ligand passage through the channel and to the periplasm. As the topology of FepA in the outer membrane is key to understanding its function, efforts are directed toward resolving its native structure. Because outer membrane proteins generally lack the characteristic α-helical regions predicted to span a lipid bilayer (14Nikaido H. Saier Jr., M.H. Science. 1992; 258: 936-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the topology of these proteins must be deduced from a variety of experimental approaches. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered saline. )to FepA linear epitopes have been used to map seven cell surface-exposed regions of the receptor, two of which appeared to be involved in ligand binding(15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A linker insertion mutational study defined regions of FepA required for activity of all three ligands, as well as two domains required for colicin function but not ferric enterobactin uptake(16Armstrong S.K.

To develop the model of FepA as an integral component of a prototypic TonB-dependent nutrient uptake system, we have constructed FepA-epitope fusions to determine the subcellular location of specific domains and to identify epitope insertion sites that affect FepA receptor activity. E. coli strain RWB18-60 (F−, thi proC leuB trpE entA fepA ΔrecA) (16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the host for fepA plasmids. Bacteria were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium (LB) (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) or on LB agar, unless otherwise indicated. Ampicillin was used for plasmid selection at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Isolation of plasmid DNA and other standard molecular genetic techniques have been described(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers for sequencing and fusion construction were provided by the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility. Nucleotide sequencing was performed as detailed previously (19Armstrong S.K. Pettis G.S. Forrester L.J. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); the published fepA sequence (20Lundrigan M.D. Kadner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10797-10801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for comparison. The parent plasmid, pITS549, contains a 2.5-kilobase pair SspI-StuI fragment encoding the E. coli K-12 fepA gene(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the upstream Fur-binding sequences are absent, iron deprivation is not required for expression of fepA. The fepA plasmid targets for insertion of oligonucleotides specifying the epitope used in this study have been described(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the plasmids is a derivative of pITS549 and has a unique XhoI linker at one of six locations in the fepA coding region. Epitope fusions were created by digestion with XhoI and ligation with a double-stranded 30-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 1), which specifies an epitope termed M2 (also referred to as Flag(TM)), designed by the Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA; now licensed to International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT) (21Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar), flanked by XhoI half-sites for insertion at preexisting XhoI linker sites(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants carrying the M2 insertions were identified by colony hybridization(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The location, sequence junctions, and orientation of each insertion were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Preparation of colicins B and D has been described(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Colicin sensitivity was determined by spotting dilutions of colicin onto lawns of test bacteria on LB agar. The reciprocal of the last dilution resulting in inhibition of growth was the titer defining colicin sensitivity. Values are reported as the percent of the titers of cells carrying wild-type fepA on pITS549. Ferric enterobactin uptake was evaluated by monitoring 55Fe accumulation using the method (16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified from Langman et al.(22Langman L. Young I.G. Frost G.E. Rosenberg H. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of uptake was determined by linear regression analysis using the least squares method. The reported values are representative of at least three experiments. E. coli RWB18-60 containing either the vector pGEM3Z or pITS549 served as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Cellular proteins (∼1 × 106 organisms) were denatured in SDS and treated at 100°C for 7 min prior to fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5-20% acrylamide gradient gels and immunoblotting as described (16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb recognizing the M2 epitope (21Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) was from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA) and was supplied at 1.9 mg/ml and used at a 1:1000 dilution. The FepA-specific polyclonal mouse antiserum has been described(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Logarithmic phase cells cultured in LB plus ampicillin were harvested, washed with 10 mM NaCl, and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.3. Dilutions of cells were applied to nitrocellulose and air-dried. The nitrocellulose was rewetted in 0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), blocked with 3% BSA (in the same buffer) for 1 h at 37°C, and reacted with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-M2 mAb. After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, the nitrocellulose was washed in the Tris-saline buffer before incubation with a secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate and development by conventional techniques(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Logarithmic phase bacteria grown in LB plus ampicillin were washed in 0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4) and resuspended in the same buffer prior to lysis using a French pressure cell. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g and the supernatant retained. The insoluble fraction containing both inner and outer membranes was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g and resuspension in 0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4). Equivalent quantities of protein samples were diluted and applied to nitrocellulose. In some experiments, membrane samples were either pretreated at 100°C for 5 min, then cooled on ice or diluted in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA before testing. The nitrocellulose was air-dried, blocked with BSA, reacted with anti-M2 mAb, and treated as the intact cell immunodots described above. A modification of the technique of Murphy et al.(15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to monitor cell surface-exposure of the M2 epitope. Mid-logarithmic phase bacteria were washed in PBS (pH 7.4), and 1 × 107 cells incubated at room temperature for 45 min with the anti-M2 mAb (a 1:250 dilution in 1% BSA in PBS (PBS-BSA)). The cells were washed in PBS-BSA and incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to murine IgG for 45 min. After a final wash in PBS-BSA, the bacteria were resuspended in the same buffered solution. The cells were analyzed by the East Carolina University Research Flow Cytometry Core Facility on a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For each sample, from 6,500 to 10,000 events were measured and the reported results are the averages of three separate experiments. Sequences were analyzed using programs included in the program package MacPROT (EMBNet Bioinformation Resources Network, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). The program PLOT.A/GGR was used to predict protein secondary structure and is based on the algorithm of Gibrat et al. (23Gibrat J. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) Formation of transmembrane helices was predicted by the PLOT.A/TMH program(24Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). A previous study localized FepA functional domains by linker insertion mutagenesis(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each linker mutation consisted of a 6-base pair XhoI site inserted at a specific position in fepA, resulting in the addition of amino acids Leu-Glu to the FepA polypeptide. The linker-bearing fepA plasmids HX1, HX2, VX1, RX3, VX2, and HX4 were used in the present study to create epitope fusions at each unique XhoI site (Fig. 1). An oligonucleotide of 30 base pairs encoding the M2 epitope (21Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) with XhoI-compatible ends allowed ligation of the epitope cassette to the sites supplied by the original linker mutations, resulting in the addition of 10 novel amino acids to the site containing Leu-Glu contributed previously by the linker insertion. The M2 residues Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-X-Asp comprise the epitope recognized by the mAb used in this protein tracking system. Nucleotide sequencing of each of the fusion plasmids confirmed the in-frame insertion of a single epitope cassette at the appropriate site. To determine if the foreign insertion prevented FepA expression, immunoblot analysis was performed on bacteria carrying the wild-type fepA in multicopy and mutated M2 epitope fusion derivatives. With a FepA-specific antiserum, the receptor protein was detected in all M2 mutants (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, the insertion of twelve foreign residues decreased the electrophoretic mobilities of all FepA-epitope hybrids. Cells carrying the HX4F allele appeared to produce less total immunoreactive FepA than the other mutants when analyzed with various FepA-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antisera (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Insertion of the epitope near the amino terminus appeared to destabilize FepA, as HX1F, HX2F, and to some extent, VX1F exhibited faster migrating immunoreactive bands, possibly representing degradation products. Immunoblot analysis using the M2-specific mAb demonstrated the expression of the FepA-borne epitope in all of the mutants (Fig. 2B). The pattern of anti-epitope reactivity of the mutant proteins was virtually identical to that obtained with the FepA-specific antibody. Neither the original Leu-Glu insertion mutants (data not shown), wild-type FepA, nor any other E. coli protein reacted with the M2 epitope-specific antibody. It was possible that some FepA-M2 hybrids were altered in structure such that they were no longer biologically active as receptors for ferric enterobactin and colicins B and D. Functional characterization experiments indicated that the hybrid FepA molecules of all six fusion types were localized to the outer membrane and retained a conformation that permitted interaction with the ligands to allow their uptake. The original XhoI linker insertion mutants were characterized previously with respect to FepA receptor function (16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). Depending on the location of the Leu-Glu linker insertion, sensitivity to colicins B and D was either dramatically reduced (mutants HX1, HX2, VX1, and RX3) or remained at wild-type or near wild-type levels (mutants VX2 and HX4). Introduction of the DNA encoding the M2 epitope into each of the linker mutation sites caused a decrease in colicin sensitivity in some cases (HX1F, VX1F, VX2F, and HX4F), yet exerted no additional effect on the colicin receptor function of others (HX2F and RX3F) (Table 1). Although the colicin D sensitivity of HX1F was very weak, this mutant was nevertheless sensitive when undiluted colicin D preparations were tested. fepA null mutants were insensitive when exposed to the same concentrations of colicins B and D. VX2F and HX4F, whose linker mutant parents retained 38-100% of colicin function, lost some susceptibility to the colicins but remained the most sensitive of the epitope fusion mutants.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Introduction of Leu-Glu into FepA after residues 55 (HX1), 142 (HX2), or 324 (RX3) significantly diminished the ability of E. coli to transport ferric enterobactin(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of the M2 epitope into those linker sites exerted little additional effect on enterobactin-mediated iron uptake of HX1F, whereas the insertion in HX2F critically disrupted iron transport and appeared to cause a modest increase in transport for RX3F. The M2 insertion in mutant VX1F reduced the ferric enterobactin transport activity of the original VX1 mutant to 46% of the wild-type value, a decrease from the previously observed 81% level. VX2F and HX4F demonstrated moderate decreases in ferric enterobactin receptor function. To exploit the M2 epitope as a probe for native FepA protein structure, experiments were performed to localize the epitope with respect to the cell compartments. Exposure of the M2 epitope on the cell surface was determined by subjecting viable intact mid-logarithmic growth phase bacteria to immune recognition by the M2-specific mAb. In one series of experiments, intact cells were exposed to the epitope-specific antibody in dot immunoblots (Fig. 3). Bacteria expressing fusion RX3F consistently exhibited the strongest in situ reactivity with the antibody, indicating the epitope was located on the cell surface and at the surface of the FepA molecule. This surface exposed RX3F M2 epitope was positioned at FepA residue 324, yet at nearby residues 339 (VX2F) and 359 (HX4F), the same epitope was virtually undetected at the cell surface. Hybrids HX1F, HX2F, and VX1F displayed low but variable levels of cell surface reactivity with the mAb, which suggested a poorly accessible epitope or background levels of cell lysis. To obtain quantitative data, flow cytometry was performed on intact mid-logarithmic growth phase bacteria exposed to the epitope-specific antibody (Table 1, Fig. 4). Again, cells expressing RX3F displayed the strongest surface reactivity, and fusions HX1F, HX2F, VX1F, and VX2F showed very low levels of reactivity with the intact bacteria. Cells carrying the HX4F fusion consistently demonstrated virtually no reactivity, a result that may relate to the poor expression noted previously. Intact cells carrying wild-type fepA did not react with the M2-specific antibody in any experiments.Figure 4Flow cytometry profiles of intact RWB18-60 cells expressing FepA-epitope fusions.

RWB18-60 carrying pITS549 (549), lacking the epitope insertion, was the negative control. Three typical epitope fusion profiles are shown; cells carrying HX2F, VX1F, and HX4F fusions demonstrated cytometric profiles similar to those of HX1F and VX2F. Quantitative results of these experiments are shown in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lack of surface recognition by anti-M2 for epitope fusions other than RX3F suggested that the epitopes in the other fusion locations were: 1) on the cell surface but antibody-inaccessible, possibly by virtue of masking FepA domains or other outer membrane molecules, 2) located in the periplasm, or 3) embedded in the outer membrane. Incubation of isolated native outer and inner membranes with the anti-M2 antibody in dot immunoblots demonstrated strong reactivity for HX1F as well as RX3F (Fig. 5A). Comparatively less reactivity was observed for HX2F, VX1F, and VX2F, while minimal signal was detected for HX4F. Since membranes of HX1F reacted strongly, relative to those of RX3F, and intact cells reacted weakly compared with RX3F cells, the epitope may be displayed at the surface of the FepA protein but exposed to the periplasm. Likewise, the increase in immunoreactivity for isolated membranes over whole cells implies that the HX2F, VX1F, and VX2F epitopes also may be located on FepA periplasmic domains. Densitometric comparisons of several intact cell dot blots with membrane dot blots (data not shown) using the reactivity of the RX3F samples as a reference point confirmed the increased antibody reactivities of membranes bearing the HX1F, HX2F, VX1F, and VX2F hybrids. Denaturing treatment of the same isolated membranes at 100°C either slightly decreased reactivity with the mAb or elicited no change (Fig. 5B). One exception, the epitope of HX4F, appeared to be unmasked by heat treatment, resulting in a small but visible increase in antibody reactivity. These results suggest that for all fusions except HX4F, the epitope location is sensitive to heat denaturation, while such treatment unmasks or enhances antibody access to the epitope positioned at amino acid 359. The M2 epitope itself is heat-stable, as boiled and denatured samples were readily detectable in Western blots (Fig. 2B). Incubation of the membranes in buffer containing 1 mM EDTA enhanced antibody reactivity with all of the FepA fusions except HX4F (Fig. 5C). As EDTA would chelate divalent cations stabilizing lipopolysaccharide and possibly other membrane proteins or FepA itself, such treatment may reveal the M2 epitope by altering the conformational states of such membrane components. Reporter enzyme fusions to study outer membrane protein topology and function may not yield accurate information relating to the native molecule, as the hybrid protein might not exist in a conformation for proper function or translocation to the outer membrane(25Charbit A. Ronco J. Michel V. Werts C. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 262-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To circumvent these difficulties, small reporter epitopes have been employed to study the structure and function of a bacterial porin protein(25Charbit A. Ronco J. Michel V. Werts C. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 262-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LamB was found to tolerate variously located epitope fusions without significant loss of function, defining permissive sites of insertion. Our analysis of FepA used similar reporter epitope technology for domain localization and identification of permissive insertion sites. A previous linker mutation study examined the effect of Leu-Glu insertions on FepA function(16Armstrong S.K. Francis C.L. McIntosh M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14536-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertions after amino acids 55 (mutant HX1), 142 (HX2), and 324 (RX3) dramatically decreased receptor activity for colicins B and D and ferric enterobactin, whereas the same Leu-Glu insertions after residues 339 (VX2) and 359 (HX4) had little or no effect. Linker mutation VX1 (after residue 204) was unique in that it decreased colicin B and D function but had minimal impact on enterobactin-mediated iron uptake, providing the first evidence that the receptor functions were separable. In this report, insertion of the M2 epitope cassette into these linker mutation sites generally caused modest or no obvious additional inactivation of receptor function. The decrease in FepA function for cells carrying the HX4F fusion may simply result from the observed diminished receptor levels. Although it might be expected that the charged amino acids contributed by the M2 epitope might promote the formation of a surface-seeking domain, they did not further alter FepA conformation so as to significantly impair function beyond the effect of the original linker insertion. A current FepA topological model (13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is schematically depicted in Fig. 6A, while a revamped model based on results from the present study is shown in Fig. 6B. Computer analysis of protein secondary structure (24Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 25Charbit A. Ronco J. Michel V. Werts C. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 262-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Charbit A. Sobczak E. Michel M. Molla A. Tiollais P. Hofnung M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1658-1664PubMed Google Scholar) of wild-type and mutant FepA protein sequences predicted that a surface-seeking region encompassing residue 55 is extended in the M2 fusion HX1F. The existing FepA topological model positions this region at the external cell surface(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the HX1F epitope was strongly reactive in isolated membranes but not intact cells, it is likely that this region is on the surface of the FepA protein but exposed to the periplasm. It is possible, however, that the membrane isolation procedure, although designed to be minimally disruptive, caused the HX1F epitope hidden at the cell surface to become unmasked and reactive with the M2-specific antibody. Although it is clear that the HX2F epitope (after residue 142) is not exposed at the surface of FepA on the cell exterior, the M2 localization experiments provided suggestive evidence for periplasmic location. The original FepA model predicted this region to be within the outer membrane bilayer. Computer analysis suggested that insertion of the epitope at this position causes loss of a surface-seeking domain and reduces the size of a transmembrane segment. The domain encompassing amino acid 204 containing the epitope VX1F is postulated to reside in a cell surface-exposed region of FepA, which is not involved in ligand binding(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mAb that recognizes this domain reacted only with intact bacteria of a rough lipopolysaccharide chemotype(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because the M2 epitope was undetected at the surface of cells carrying the VX1F allele and the membrane dot immunoblots were inconclusive, this region of FepA may indeed be at the cell surface but masked by lipopolysaccharide O side chains. Computer predictions suggested no changes in local FepA globular conformation as a result of M2 insertion at VX1F residue 204. Analysis of RX3F (after residue 324) and VX2F (after residue 339) predicts no significant FepA structural changes, as the regions remain in the wild-type globular conformation. Probing bacteria expressing the fusion proteins with the M2-specific antibody demonstrated cell surface-exposure of the RX3F epitope on the exterior face of the FepA molecule. This result agrees with the existing FepA topological model, which shows the region at residue 324 in a cell surface-exposed loop predicted to be involved in ligand binding(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope insertion of VX2F, which is only 15 amino acids from that of RX3F, was not antibody-accessible at the cell surface to any significant degree. Because it was also not strongly reactive in isolated membranes where the antibody could interact with FepA regions on both sides of the outer membrane, it is likely that the VX2F epitope is masked. The previous FepA model places amino acid 339 within the outer membrane bilayer(13Rutz J.M. Liu J. Lyons J.A. Goranson J. Armstrong S.K. McIntosh M.A. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of the M2 epitope after residue 359 (HX4F) is predicted to create a new transmembrane helical domain in a globular region previously positioned within the wild-type outer membrane. Consistent with both predictions, the M2 localization experiments indicated the epitope was embedded in the outer membrane or masked by domains that appeared to be denatured by high temperatures. The protein region containing the epitope of fusion RX3F is in a cell surface conformation freely accessible to the M2-specific antibody. The hybrid receptor was expressed at wild-type levels, retained some receptor function, and was well tolerated by the cells. These characteristics make the XhoI linker site of RX3 an ideal candidate for heterologous epitope display. Epitope display systems using the E. coli LamB (26Charbit A. Sobczak E. Michel M. Molla A. Tiollais P. Hofnung M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1658-1664PubMed Google Scholar) and PhoE (27Agterberg M. Adriaanse H. Lankhof H. Meloen R. Tommassen J. Vaccine. 1990; 8: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) outer membrane proteins and P fimbriae (28van Die I. van Oosterhout J. van Megen I. Bergmans H. Hoekstra W. Enger-Valk B. Barteling S. Mooi F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as host molecules have proven effective at inducing epitope-specific immune responses. Such technology would be useful for oral/mucosal immunization with live attenuated bacteria. The FepA protein is immunogenic and is expressed by several species of enteric bacteria(29Rutz J.M. Abdullah T. Singh S.P. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5964-5974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An especially appealing trait of FepA is its strong expression under low iron growth conditions. As the receptor is pivotal to iron uptake, the natural iron stress of the in vivo environment would ensure expression of an epitope-bearing hybrid FepA. We thank Robert Kadner and Phillip Klebba for sharing ideas. We are grateful to Timothy Brickman for bringing the M2 epitope to our attention, for discussions, and computer expertise.
