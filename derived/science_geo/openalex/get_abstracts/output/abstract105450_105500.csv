https://openalex.org/W2102589238,"The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a paired domain and a homeodomain. It is homologous to the mouse Small eye (Pax-6) gene and to the Aniridia gene in humans. These genes share extensive sequence identity, the position of three intron splice sites is conserved, and these genes are expressed similarly in the developing nervous system and in the eye during morphogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in both the insect and in the mammalian genes have been shown to lead to a reduction or absence of eye structures, which suggests that ey functions in eye morphogenesis. By targeted expression of the ey complementary DNA in various imaginal disc primordia of Drosophila, ectopic eye structures were induced on the wings, the legs, and on the antennae. The ectopic eyes appeared morphologically normal and consisted of groups of fully differentiated ommatidia with a complete set of photoreceptor cells. These results support the proposition that ey is the master control gene for eye morphogenesis. Because homologous genes are present in vertebrates, ascidians, insects, cephalopods, and nemerteans, ey may function as a master control gene throughout the metazoa."

Linkage for some families has been established to chromosome 9q33–q34. In the present study, endoglin, a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) binding protein, was analysed as a candidate gene for the disorder based on chromosomal location, expression pattern and function. We have identified mutations in three affected individuals: a C to G substitution converting a tyrosine to a termination codon, a 39 base pair deletion and a 2 base pair deletion which creates a premature termination codon. We have identified endoglin as the HHT gene mapping to 9q3 and have established HHT as the first human disease defined by a mutation in a member of the TGF-β receptor complex."

Targeted mutagenesis of connexin43 (Cx43), one of the most prevalent connexin proteins, showed that its absence was compatible with survival of mouse embryos to term, even though mutant cell lines showed reduced dye coupling in vitro. However, mutant embryos died at birth, as a result of a failure in pulmonary gas exchange caused by a swelling and blockage of the right ventricular outflow tract from the heart. This finding suggests that Cx43 plays an essential role in heart development but that there is functional compensation among connexins in other parts of the developing fetus."

In three unrelated individuals with this disorder, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which enhances the mitochondrial conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone, was mutated and nonfunctional, providing genetic evidence that this protein is indispensable for normal adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis."

Inorganic calcium and phosphate sources are combined to form a paste that is surgically implanted by injection. Under physiological conditions, the material hardens in minutes concurrent with the formation of dahllite. After 12 hours, dahllite formation was nearly complete, and an ultimate compressive strength of 55 megapascals was achieved. The composition and crystal morphology of the dahllite formed are similar to those of bone. Animal studies provide evidence that the material is remodeled in vivo. A novel approach to skeletal repair is being tested in human trials for various applications; in one of the trials the new biomaterial is being percutaneously placed into acute fractures. After hardening, it serves as internal fixation to maintain proper alignment while healing occurs."

The time course of this error was measured in a series of experiments where subjects repeatedly attempted to replicate given target intervals. Sequences of the errors in both spatial and temporal replications were found to fluctuate as 1/f noises. 1/f noise is encountered in a wide variety of physical systems and is theorized to be a characteristic signature of complexity."

This finding led to the proposal to use nef-deleted viruses as live, attenuated vaccines to prevent human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In contrast, neonatal macaques developed persistently high levels of viremia after oral exposure to and SIV nef, vpr, and negative regulatory element (NRE) deletion mutant. Severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and CD4+ T cell depletion were observed, indicating that neither nef nor vpr determine pathogenicity in neonates. Because such constructs have retained their pathogenic potential, they should not be used as candidate live, attenuated virus vaccines against human AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2045921037,"It is now feasible to map disease genes by screening the genome for linkage disequilibrium between the disease and marker alleles. This report presents the first application of this approach for a previously unmapped locus. A gene for benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) was mapped to chromosome 18 by searching for chromosome segments shared by only three distantly related patients. The screening results were confirmed by identifying an extended haplotype conserved between the patients. Probability calculations indicate that such segment sharing is unlikely to arise by chance. Searching the genome for segments shared by patients is a powerful empirical method for mapping disease genes. Computer simulations suggest that, in appropriate populations, the approach may be used to localize genes for common diseases."

Inhibition of protein isoprenylation by lovastatin (LOV) induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells, a process of active cell death characterized by the internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. In this article we show that LOV-induced apoptosis is associated with intracellular acidification and that activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter induces a raise in pHi which is sufficient to prevent or arrest DNA digestion. First, LOV induced a decrease in pHi which was dose-dependent and correlated with the extent of DNA degradation. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that this acidification was due to the appearance of a subpopulation of cells whose pHi was 0.9 pH units below control values. Cell sorting experiments demonstrated that DNA degradation had occurred only in those cells which had suffered intracellular acidification. LOV-induced apoptosis could be suppressed by mevalonate supplementation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and protein kinase C activation by phorbol myristate acetate. In all three cases, intracellular acidification was abolished. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter by 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride induced DNA degradation in HL-60 cells per se and suppressed the protective effect of phorbol myristate acetate. LOVinduced intracellular acidification was not due to a complete inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter. In fact, LOV-treated cells were able to respond to phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter with a marked increase in pHi. This effect was accompanied by a rapid arrest of DNA digestion. These observations illustrate the strong pH dependence of LOV-induced DNA degradation, thus providing a connection between the activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter and the suppression of apoptosis.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an active form of cell death which occurs physiologically during embryonic development as well as in tissue turnover in the adult (for review, see (1Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 2Collins M.K.L. López Rivas A. Trends Biochem.

Cell death by apoptosis can be initiated by a number of positive signals. During T cell development in the thymus, triggering of the T-cell antigen receptor induces apoptosis in those thymocytes which recognize self antigens(2Collins M.K.L. López Rivas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 307-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Also, binding of tumor necrosis factor to its receptor triggers apoptosis in several cell types(4Laster S.M. Wood J.G. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2629-2634PubMed Google Scholar, 5Greenblatt M.S. Elias L. Blood. 1992; 80: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, this form of cell death can occur following the removal of positive signals, like growth factors, cytokines, or hormones, needed for the survival of a particular cell type(2Collins M.K.L. López Rivas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 307-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, programmed cell death can be induced by a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, many of them used in cancer therapy(6Williams G.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 1097-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Apoptosis plays a key role in the control of cell populations in the organism. Failure of the cells to die via apoptosis results in abnormally increased cell numbers and oncogenesis(6Williams G.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 1097-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this form of cell death is critical for the understanding of many physiological processes, as well as of the sequence of events leading to oncogenic transformation. Cells which die via apoptosis usually suffer similar morphological changes, including nuclear condensation and internucleosomal DNA digestion by endogenous endonucleases(1Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Until recently, the activation of a Ca2+-dependent endonuclease, DNase I(7Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Stephan H. Crompton T. MacDonald H.R. Mannherz H.G. Tschopp J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), was thought to be a key event in the apoptotic process. However, the implication of a pH-dependent endonuclease, DNase II, in certain forms of cell death has been recently suggested(8Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Protein isoprenylation is a post-translational modification essential for the membrane localization and biological activity of a number of proteins (see (9Casey P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for review). The precursor of isoprenoid lipids involved in protein modification, as well as of cellular sterols, is mevalonic acid (MVA)( 1The abbreviations used are: MVAmevalonic acidG proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinLOVlovastatinCHXcycloheximidePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePKCprotein kinase CEIPA5-N-ethyl-N-isopropylamilorideBCECF2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5carboxyfluoresceinH71-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazinebpbase pair(s). )(10Goldstein J.L.

Isoprenylated proteins, among which are all the GTP-binding proteins, play crucial roles in the signal transduction pathways from growth factor, cytokine and hormone receptors(11Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19448-19454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein isoprenylation is then essential for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. We have recently reported that inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis by LOV, a competitive inhibitor of the synthesis of MVA, induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells(15Pérez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). LOV-induced DNA degradation was specifically prevented by MVA, while other products of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, like cholesterol, dolichol, ubiquinone, and isopentenyl adenosine, failed to protect cells against LOV-induced apoptosis. These findings led us to postulate that LOV-induced apoptosis was due to inhibition of protein isoprenylation. In the present study we have addressed the mechanism of LOV action in more detail. For this purpose we have studied the effects of LOV on the total cell population as well as in individual cells by using flow cytometry. In addition we have explored the effect on LOV-induced apoptosis of PMA, CHX, and MVA. The results herein presented establish a correlation between LOV-induced apoptosis and intracellular pH under all the conditions studied. Our results suggest the involvement of DNase II in LOV-induced DNA digestion and provide evidence for the implication of the Na+/H+ antiporter in the suppression of apoptosis. Lovastatin was a gift from Merck, Sharp & Dohme. Mevalonic acid lactone, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, PMA, staurosporine, and nigericin were from Sigma. EIPA was from RBI (Natick, MA). BCECF was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The 123-bp DNA ladder was from Bethesda Research Laboratories (Bethesda, MD). Human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemic cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and gentamycin (24 μg/ml). Lovastatin, was added to the cultures as the sodium salt, obtained from the lactone as described previously(16Kita T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Approximately 106 cells per experimental condition were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 250 μl of the same buffer. To this cell suspension, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, final concentrations, were sequentially added and the content of DNA per cell was estimated by flow cytometry. To assess DNA fragmentation, soluble (fragmented) DNA was obtained as described (15Pérez-Sala D. Mollinedo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and analyzed on agarose gels. Intracellular pH measurements were performed both fluorimetrically and using flow cytometry. For fluorimetric determination, HL-60 cells (107 cells/ml) were loaded with 1 μM BCECF for 30 min at 37°C with gentle shaking, either in sodium Hepes buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose), or in Hepes bicarbonate buffer (15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mM NaCl, 20 mM CO3HNa, 5 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose), as indicated(17Alvarez J. García-Sancho J. Mollinedo F. Sánchez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BCECF-loaded cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 7 min, resuspended in the same buffer at 106 cells/ml, and introduced in a thermostatted cuvette at 37°C with constant stirring for the continuous recording of the pH-sensitive fluorescence on a Perkin Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Intracellular pH was estimated from the ratio of the 530-nm fluorescence signals obtained at 500 nm (pH-sensitive) and 450 nm (isosbestic) excitation wavelengths (18Rajotte D. Haddad P. Haman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9980-9987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal was calibrated in high potassium Hepes buffer (25 mM Hepes, 145 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose) containing the H+/K+ ionophore nigericin (10 μg/ml) at pH 6.64, 7.4, and 7.57(19Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). For cytofluorimetric determination of intracellular pH, HL-60 cells were loaded with BCECF as above and analyzed on an EPICS-C cytofluorimeter (Coulter Científica, Móstoles, Spain), essentially as described(20Musgrove E. Rugg C. Hedley D. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Ladoux A. Miglierina R. Krawice I. Cragoe E.J. Abita J.P. Frelin C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Excitation of the probe was performed at 488 nm with a 500 milliwatt ionic argon laser. Emission fluorescence was filtered through a 525 band pass (green fluorescence) and a 610 long pass (red fluorescence) filter. Intracellular pH was estimated from the ratio of the emission fluorescence signals obtained at 525 and 610 nm. Calibration of the signal was achieved by incubating BCECF loaded HL-60 cells for 10 min at 37°C in the presence of nigericin in high potassium buffer at pH 6.44, 6.83, 7.23, and 7.63. This gave a linear relationship between pH values and 525/610 nm ratios (r > 0.995). BCECF loaded HL-60 cells were sorted by their 525/610 nm ratio, collected into phosphate-buffered saline, and kept on ice until they were processed for DNA fragmentation. Continuous cytofluorimetric measurements of pHi variations in HL-60 cells were performed on an EPICS-XL cytofluorimeter (Coulter Científica, Móstoles, Spain). In order to assess the extent of LOV-induced apoptosis and to observe whether this process was selective to any phase of the cell cycle, we studied the cell cycle distribution of HL-60 cells treated with LOV (Fig. 1). The appearance of cells with a DNA content less than G1, characteristic of early apoptotic cells (sub-G1 peak, Fig. 1A), could be observed between 8 and 12 h after the addition of 10 μM LOV. The cells which did not undergo apoptosis showed an increase in the proportion of cells arrested in G1, together with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in the S phase, while the percentage of cells in G2 plus M was not significantly affected (Fig. 1B). At later stages during LOV treatment there was an almost linear increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, which amounted to approximately 20% of the total cell population after 24 h. The effect of LOV was dose-dependent. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 50 μM LOV for 24 h induced apoptosis in 40-50% of the cells (Fig. 1A). In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms underlying LOV-induced cell death, we investigated whether the synthesis of macromolecules was necessary for its effect. Fig. 2 shows the effect of CHX and actinomycin D on LOV-induced DNA fragmentation. CHX (100 ng/ml) was able to completely prevent DNA degradation induced by 10 μM LOV, while actimomycin D (15 ng/ml) had a partially protective effect. CHX was also able to prevent all the above described effects of LOV on the cell cycle distribution of HL-60 cells, as well as the morphological changes associated with apoptosis (results not shown). However, both CHX and actinomycin D were potent inducers of apoptosis in HL-60 cells when used above 250 and 20 ng/ml, respectively (results not shown). Inhibition of protein isoprenylation by LOV has been shown to impair many G protein-mediated cellular functions(22Bokoch G.M. Prossnitz V. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Cutts J.L. Scallen T.J. Watson J. Bankurst A.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Deanin G.G. Cutts J.L. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. J. Immnol. 1991; 146: 3528-3535PubMed Google Scholar). In several cases these functions could be rescued by direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters(24Deanin G.G. Cutts J.L. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. J. Immnol. 1991; 146: 3528-3535PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li G. Regazzi R. Roche E. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated next whether phorbol esters could provide a protective effect against LOV-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3, PMA completely prevented LOV-induced DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells. This protective effect was partially reversed by co-incubation with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 3A). PMA is known to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into cells with a macrophage-like phenotype(26Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Since the sustained activation of PKC is essential for this process(27Aihara H. Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11062-11066Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the ability of several inhibitors of PKC to block PMA-induced differentiation was taken as an index of their effectiveness in our system. The minimum concentration of staurosporine required to inhibit PMA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, as assessed by morphological criteria, without affecting cell viability or DNA integrity, was 25 nM. This concentration was found to prevent the protective effect of PMA on LOV-induced apoptosis. However, the use of other inhibitors of PKC was limited by their high cytotoxicity in these cells. Thus, the minimum concentration of H7 required to block differentiation by PMA was found to induce DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells per se. The suppression of apoptosis by PMA was dose-dependent (Fig. 3B). A concentration of PMA of 1 ng/ml was sufficient to prevent DNA degradation by 10 μM LOV. Suppression of apoptosis by phorbol esters has been related to their ability to induce cellular alkalinization(18Rajotte D. Haddad P. Haman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9980-9987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is thought to be mediated by PKC through the phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain of the Na+/H+ antiporter(28Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation would lead to the activation of the antiporter by increasing its affinity for the intracellular H+, thus inducing cytoplasmic alkalinization(29Fliegel L. Fröhlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To assess whether the activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter was responsible for PMA suppression of LOV-induced apoptosis we studied the effect of the specific inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiporter, EIPA(30Vigne P. Frelin C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We found that EIPA induced DNA degradation in HL-60 cells per se (Fig. 4A). This effect was dose-dependent, being 20 μM the lowest concentration tested which induced significant DNA laddering over the course of a 24-h treatment. At 60 μM, EIPA was also able to overcome the protective effect of PMA on LOV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B). We then studied the correlation between the ability of EIPA to inhibit the Na+/H+ antiporter in HL-60 cells and to block PMA prevention of cell death (Fig. 5). A concentration of 10 μM EIPA was sufficient to completely inhibit the Na+/H+ antiporter when assayed in sodium Hepes buffer (results not shown). However, concentrations above 60 μM were required to achieve more than 90% inhibition when the buffer was supplemented with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to mimic the conditions prevailing during cell culture (Fig. 5A). In addition, we explored the effect of EIPA on pHi in the presence and absence of PMA in the conditions under which we had studied the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5B). We observed that treatment of HL-60 cells with EIPA for 24 h induced a dose-dependent decrease in pHi which correlated with the ability of EIPA to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange in bovine serum albumin containing medium. Treatment of HL-60 cells with PMA for 24 h did not result in a significant variation of pHi. However, PMA effectively protected HL-60 cells against EIPA-induced acidification (Fig. 5B). Concentrations of EIPA above 60 μM were necessary to suppress this protective effect. Thus, there is a coincidence between the concentration of EIPA required to block Na+/H+ exchange activity, as shown in Fig. 5A, and that required to suppress the protective effects of PMA (Fig. 4B and 5B). These results suggest that PMA can compensate the effects of a partial inhibition of the antiporter and that near complete inhibition is needed to effectively prevent PMA activation of Na+/H+ exchange.Figure 5Effect of EIPA on Na+/H+ exchange activity and on pHi in HL-60 cells. A, HL-60 cells were loaded with BCECF in sodium Hepes buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures,” resuspended in the same buffer containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and their pHi was continuously monitored fluorimetrically. Na+/H+ exchange activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of EIPA, was estimated from the rate of pHi recovery after intracellular acidification was achieved by addition of 20 mM potassium acetate to the incubation buffer. Results are expressed as percentage of the rate of pHi recovery in the absence of EIPA and are mean ± S.D. values of three experiments. B, HL-60 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of EIPA for 24 h in the absence (•, control), or presence (○, PMA) of 10 ng/ml PMA. During the final hour of incubation, cells were loaded with BCECF in Hepes bicarbonate buffer and pHi was determined. Results are mean ± S.D. values of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data suggested that PMA suppression of LOV-induced apoptosis could be mediated by activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter and subsequent intracellular alkalinization. Moreover, several lines of evidence have indicated the involvement of isoprenylated proteins, presumably G proteins, in the regulation of pHi(31Arellano R. Grinstein S.

On the other hand, it has been reported recently that HL-60 cells contain an endonuclease, DNase II, which can be activated in response to intracellular acidification(34Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, LOV-induced inhibition of G proteins isoprenylation could lead to impairment of the regulation of pHi and to intracellular acidification, which would then activate the pH-dependent endonuclease. In order to test this hypothesis we measured the pHi of HL-60 cells under the conditions in which we had studied the induction of apoptosis. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 1. Under our experimental conditions, control cells maintained an average pHi of 7.54. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 μM LOV for 24 h induced a decrease in pHi of 0.29 pH units. LOV-induced acidification was completely prevented by the compounds previously found to prevent LOV-induced apoptosis, namely, MVA, PMA, and cycloheximide. LOV-induced intracellular acidification was dose-dependent. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 50 μM LOV for 24 h caused pHi to drop 0.52 pH units below control values. These results establish a correlation between pHi and apoptosis under all the conditions studied.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In experiments performed in isolated nuclei it has been observed that DNase II has an optimum pH of 5, but it is capable of catalyzing significant internucleosomal DNA degradation at pH 6.5(8Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We then asked the question of whether the intracellular acidification induced by LOV treatment was sufficient to activate this endonuclease. At the concentrations used, 10 and 50 μM, LOV induced apoptosis in 20 and 50% of the cells, respectively, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). The possibility remained that only those cells undergoing apoptosis had suffered intracellular acidification, as it has been observed in other systems(34Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). If this were the case, fluorimetric pH determinations shown in Table 1 would underestimate the drop in intracellular pH of the apoptotic cells, since they represent the average pHi values of the total cell population. To test this possibility we analyzed the distribution of LOV-treated HL-60 cells according to their pHi using flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). We found that treatment of HL-60 cells with LOV led to the appearance of a subpopulation of cells with a more acidic pHi than untreated cells. This subpopulation had a lower 525/610 nm ratio and appeared to the left of the main population. Calibration of these signals indicated that the cells in the acidic population maintained an average pHi of 6.64, which is 0.9 pH units below control values, and it is in the range of the pH reported to activate DNase II(8Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the pHi of the cells in the main population did not change significantly with respect to control values. The proportion of HL-60 cells in the acidic population was dose-dependent and it increased from 20% of the cells after treatment with 10 μM LOV for 24 h, to 40-50% of the total cell population with 50 μM LOV (Fig. 6A). It is interesting to note that the proportion of cells with acidic pHi coincided with the proportion of apoptotic cells under all conditions studied (Fig. 1A and 6A). Therefore, it was important to determine whether there was a relationship between intracellular acidification and apoptosis. If this were true, cells that maintained a normal pHi should maintain also their DNA integrity, while the DNA of cells with acidic pHi should have suffered internucleosomal degradation. To test this hypothesis, HL-60 cells treated with 50 μM LOV for 24 h were sorted on the flow cytometer by their pHi, and processed to analyze DNA fragmentation. Aliquots of the two populations obtained were reanalyzed by flow cytometry to assess their purity. The therefore considered “normal pHi” population contained routinely more than 95% cells with pHi above 7.05, while the “acidic” population contained more than 80% cells with pHi below 7.05. The DNA analysis of the total population is shown in Fig. 6B in comparison with the two populations obtained by cell sorting. As it can be appreciated, HL-60 cells treated with 50 μM LOV for 24 h showed significant DNA degradation. When these cells were sorted by their pHi and reanalyzed, the cells that maintained a normal pHi showed no detectable DNA degradation, while the cells which had suffered intracellular acidification showed intense DNA digestion, thus proving the correlation between LOV-induced intracellular acidification and DNA degradation. Inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase have been reported to induce intracellular acidification and to diminish the response of the Na+/H+ antiporter to certain stimuli(31Arellano R. Grinstein S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Ng L.L. Davies J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C780-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in studying the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter in LOV-treated cells. Fig. 7 shows representative recordings of the pHi changes of control and LOV-treated cells in response to intracellular acidification and to PMA stimulation. These experiments were carried out in HCO3−-free media, which renders the Na+/H+ antiport the main mechanism for regulation of pHi(36L'Allemain G. Paris S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5809-5815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+/H+ exchange activity was estimated from the rate of recovery of pHi of HL-60 cells after instantaneous acidification by addition of 3 mM propionate to the incubation medium. After treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 μM LOV for 24 h, a condition under which 20% of the cells had a decreased pHi, the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter was not diminished with respect to control cells (Fig. 7, upper panels). The rates of alkalinization after propionate loading averaged 0.09 ± 0.02 pH units/min and 0.15 ± 0.01 pH units/min in control and LOV-treated cells, respectively. LOV-treated cells were also able to respond to PMA stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport with a marked increase in pHi (Fig. 7, lower panels). The extent of intracellular alkalinization in response to PMA was 0.12 ± 0.01 pH units in LOV-treated cells and 0.05 ± 0.01 pH units in control cells. When these experiments were performed with cells treated with 50 μM LOV for 24 h, 40-50% of which had a decreased pHi, the responses t"

Biol. Chem. 268, 7863-7867). Here we report that application of high but not low frequency stimulation to two groups of afferents in the CA1 region of 32P-labeled slices resulted in the phosphorylation of two major substrates of this enzyme, synapsin I and microtubule-associated protein 2, as well as in the autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II. Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis revealed that long term potentiation induction was associated with an increase in the amount of CaM kinase II in the same region. All these changes were prevented when high frequency stimulation was applied in the presence of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate. These results indicate that activation of CaM kinase II is involved in the induction of synaptic potentiation in both the postsynaptic and presynaptic regions. Induction of long term potentiation in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices is associated with increased activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) (Fukunaga, K., Stoppini, L., Miyamoto, E., and Muller, D.(1993) J.

INTRODUCTIONActivities of several protein kinases, CaM kinase II ( 1The abbreviations used are: CaM kinase IICa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IID-AP5D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoateLTPlong term potentiationMAP2microtubule-associated protein 2MAPsmicrotubule-associated proteinsNMDAN-methyl-D-aspartatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. )(Fukunaga et al., 1993), protein kinase C (Lovinger et al., 1987; Klann et al., 1991), and casein kinase II (Charriaut et al., 1991), have been reported to increase during induction of LTP in the hippocampus. Among these enzymes, CaM kinase II and protein kinase C are of particular interest for contributing to LTP, because these two enzymes are present in high concentrations in the hippocampus (Ouimet et al., 1984; Erondu and Kennedy, 1985; Kitano et al., 1987; Fukunaga et al., 1988) and distributed in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic elements. Biochemical experiments have provided evidence for increased activity of protein kinase C for up to 60 min after induction of LTP (Klann et al., 1991, 1992). To account for these observations, it has been proposed that protein kinase C might be converted into a permanently active, Ca2+-independent kinase through cleavage by Ca2+-dependent proteases (Sacktor et al., 1993) and thus contribute to both the induction and the maintenance of LTP (Malinow et al., 1989).CaM kinase II can also be converted into a Ca2+-independent enzyme by autophosphorylation (Miller et al., 1988; Schworer et al., 1988; Thiel et al., 1988). The kinase could thus function as a kind of molecular switch responsible for keeping biochemical modifications in the phosphorylation of various presynaptic and postsynaptic substrates. An interesting feature of this regulation is that the Ca2+-independent activity can be reversed by protein phosphatases.In recent experiments, we have provided evidence that a transient increase in the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II could be observed in cultured cerebellar granule cells (Fukunaga and Soderling, 1990) and hippocampal neurons (Fukunaga et al., 1992) following stimulation of NMDA receptors. More recently, in experiments in which we have assessed the enzyme activity following LTP induction, we have observed an increase in the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II up to 1 h after tetanic stimulation (Fukunaga et al., 1993). These results therefore support the interpretation that modulation of the degree of enzyme autophosphorylation may contribute to synaptic plasticity. Physiological studies also support the idea that CaM kinase II may play a key role in the mechanisms of LTP, because specific inhibitory peptides for the enzyme have been shown to abolish LTP (Malenka et al., 1989; Malinow et al., 1989) and because slices prepared from mutant mice deficient in the α subunit of CaM kinase II exhibited impaired synaptic potentiation (Silva et al., 1993).To confirm the possibility that activity-dependent modulation of the level of autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, we have measured in the present study the in situ phosphorylation of the enzyme following induction of LTP in 32P-labeled slices. In addition, we have also analyzed the in situ phosphorylation of two major substrates for CaM kinase II, synapsin I and MAP2. The results add support to the concept that phosphorylation mechanisms contribute to LTP and provide evidence for another modulation involving the β subunit of the kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following chemicals and reagent were obtained from the indicated source: [γ-32P]ATP and 125I-protein A, DuPont NEN; [32P]orthophosphate, ICN Biomedical Inc.; D-AP5, Cambridge Research Biochemicals; calmidazolium and anti-microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) antibody (M7273), Sigma. The polyclonal antibodies against brain CaM kinase II (Fukunaga et al., 1988) and synapsin I (Fukunaga et al., 1992) were prepared as described previously.Preparation of Hippocampal Slices and Electrophysiological RecordingsFollowing decapitation, brains of male Sprague-Dawley rats (5-8 weeks old) were removed, the hippocampi were dissected, and hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were prepared using a MacIlwain chopper. The slices were maintained under continuous perfusion in an interface type of a chamber with a medium that contained (in mM): NaCl, 124; KCl, 3; CaCl2, 2.5; MgCl2, 1.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; glucose, 10; ascorbic acid, 2; pH 7.4 and was exposed to a 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 34°C.After a 1-2-h recovery period, synaptic activity was monitored using two stimulation electrodes made of twisted Nichrome wire and placed on both sides of a glass recording pipette in the CA1 region. In all slices, LTP was induced by θ burst-patterned stimulation (10 bursts at 5 Hz, each composed of 4 pulses at 100 Hz) repeated 3 times consecutively at 10-20-s intervals and applied simultaneously to the two inputs. The stimulation polarity on the two electrodes was then reversed, and the same procedure was applied a second time. Control slices were stimulated by low frequency trains consisting of 100 pulses at 10 Hz to the two inputs. These trains did not induce synaptic potentiation. One hour after stimulation, slices were transferred on a glass slide at ice temperature, and the CA1 areas were dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen.For immunoprecipitation experiments and analysis of the in situ phosphorylation of CaM kinase II and its substrates, slices were incubated in a phosphate-free medium containing carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.5-0.7 mCi/ml) after the recovery period. After a 30-min incubation, slices were stimulated by θ burst or low frequency stimulation protocols and maintained for 1 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. They were frozen as non-labeled slices.Immunoprecipitation and Quantitation of 32P-labeled CaM Kinase II, 32P-labeled MAP2, and 32P-labeled Synapsin IImmunoprecipitation with 32P-labeled slices was carried out as described previously (Fukunaga et al., 1992). Briefly, the two slices of the CA1 areas were combined and homogenized with a hand homogenizer in 0.8 ml of a solubilization solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 75 μM pepstatin A, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin. After sonication with a Branson sonifier 250, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatant were used to determine protein content (Bradford, 1976) and 32P incorporation into total proteins by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. To determine the 32P incorporation, Whatman 3MM filter papers, on which the aliquots (20 μl) were spotted, were washed with trichloroacetic acid, acetone, and ethanol. After drying, the radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity of the 32P incorporation into the total proteins was not different between the control and the potentiated slices (data not shown). The supernatant fraction containing the same amount of protein was incubated at 4°C for 4 h with the antibodies against CaM kinase II and synapsin I (5 μg of each IgG protein) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B suspension (50% v/v). The immunocomplex immobilized on protein A was washed three times with the solubilization solution. After immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled CaM kinase II and 32P-labeled synapsin I, the cell supernatant fractions were further subjected to immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled MAP2 using the anti-MAPs antibody. All these immunoprecipitates were eluted from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B by treatment with the SDS sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) and boiled for 4 min. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) followed by autoradiography. A Bio-Image analyzer (BA100, Fuji Film) was used to quantify the amount of 32P incorporation into CaM kinase II subunits, synapsin I and MAP2. The phosphorylation site of synapsin I was determined by limited proteolysis of 32P-labeled synapsin I in gel pieces with Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 (5 μg/well) and one-dimensional SDS-PAGE as described (Huttner and Greengard, 1979). The radioactivity in both site I and site II in synapsin I was measured by a Bio-Image analyzer.Immunoblotting and Quantitation of CaM Kinase II Subunits, MAP2 and Synapsin IIn experiments with non-labeled slices, the CA1 areas of the hippocampal slices were frozen 1 h after the stimulation. The slices were homogenized in 0.2 ml of the solubilization solution. Sonication and centrifugation were performed as described above. Immunoblotting of the supernatants (20 or 25 μg of protein) was performed with anti-CaM kinase II (5 μg of IgG/ml), anti-synapsin I (2 μg of IgG/ml), or anti-MAPs antibodies (200-fold dilution), which were detected using 125I-protein A as described previously (Yano et al., 1994). A Bio-Image analyzer was used to quantify the activity of 125I-protein A bound to the immunocomplex.Other MethodsProtein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(1976) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.RESULTSIn Situ Phosphorylation of CaM Kinase II Subunits and Synapsin IIn recent work (Fukunaga et al., 1993), we have provided evidence that LTP induction in the CA1 area of the hippocampus was associated with an increase in the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II. To further assess that this increased Ca2+-independent activity was due to autophosphorylation of the enzyme, we measured here the in situ incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the subunits of the enzyme. To achieve this, hippocampal slices were incubated and stimulated in the presence of [32P]phosphate to label the ATP pool. A group of the slices then received θ burst patterned stimulation to induce LTP, whereas others received low frequency trains that did not produce any long lasting modification of synaptic efficacy. As an additional control, the same experiments were also carried out in the presence of 50 μMD-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist that prevents induction of synaptic potentiation.In a first set of experiments, 32P-labeled CaM kinase II and one of its major presynaptic substrates, synapsin I, were immunoprecipitated using the extracts of control and potentiated CA1 areas and the antibodies against brain CaM kinase II and synapsin I. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1). The total amount of radioactivity incorporated into both the α and β subunits of CaM kinase II was determined using a Bio-Image analyzer. As shown in Fig. 1, high frequency stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the incorporation of 32P into the α and β subunits of the kinase, thereby indicating autophosphorylation of the enzyme. When compared with control conditions, the levels of autophosphorylation of the α and β subunits were found to increase by 29 ± 5 and 35 ± 5%, respectively.In the same experiments we also investigated the possibility that LTP induction resulted in modifications in the phosphorylation of synapsin I, a major presynaptic substrate of CaM kinase II. Following immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography, synapsin I appeared as a doublet of bands of Ia and Ib with 80 and 78 kDa, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 1A and quantified in Fig. 2B, the synapsin I phosphorylation increased by 37 ± 7% following high frequency stimulation. The change was thus comparable with that of the CaM kinase II autophosphorylation.Figure 2Increased phosphorylation of MAP2 and synapsin I following induction of LTP. A, 32P-labeled hippocampal slices were stimulated in the presence or absence of D-AP5 (50 μM) as in Fig. 1A. After dissection of the CA1 areas of control and potentiated (HFS) slices, the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-MAPs polyclonal antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. B, incorporation of 32P into synapsin I (Fig. 1) and MAP2 was analyzed using a Bio-Image analyzer. For synapsin I, results were obtained from 23 control and 23 potentiated slices without D-AP5 and 6 slices in each condition with D-AP5. For MAP2, results were obtained from 13 control and 13 potentiated slices without D-AP5 and 6 slices in each condition with D-AP5. Values represent means ± S.E. and are expressed as percentage of control. ∗, statistically significant difference between potentiated and control slices (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then tested whether these changes in phosphorylation were dependent upon NMDA receptor activation as in LTP. Slices were thus incubated in the presence of 50 μMD-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, during the application of the stimulation protocols. This treatment completely prevented the induction of synaptic potentiation (data not shown) and abolished the increases in phosphorylation of both CaM kinase II subunits and synapsin I (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).CaM kinase II is a major component of postsynaptic densities, but it is also present in presynaptic terminals. Because synapsin I is exclusively a presynaptic protein, the implication of these results was that LTP induction resulted in a possible activation and autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II in presynaptic terminals. To further examine this possibility, we used phosphopeptide mapping of 32P-labeled synapsin I to determine the site of phosphorylation of the protein. Peptide mapping was done by limited digestion of synapsin I with V8 protease followed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. In intact neurons, the major site of phosphorylation of synapsin I was site II (more than 60%), a site that is phosphorylated by CaM kinase II (Czernik et al., 1987). Following high frequency stimulation, the phosphorylation of site II increased by 26 ± 10% (p < 0.05, n = 8) (Fig. 3). In addition, after LTP induction, there was a small but significant increase in the phosphorylation of site I, a site phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or CaM kinase I (12 ± 5% increase; p < 0.05, n = 8).Figure 3Phosphorylation sites of synapsin I following induction of LTP. Following immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as in Fig. 1A, the 78-kDa synapsin I phosphorylated in the CA1 areas of control (control, lanes3 and 4) and potentiated (HFS, lanes5 and 6) slices were cut out from the gel, and the phosphorylation sites of synapsin Ib were determined as described (Huttner and Greengard, 1979) after limited proteolysis with S. aureus V8 protease (3 μg/well). The 32P-labeled peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide, followed by autoradiography. As a control, purified brain synapsin I phosphorylated with the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (lane1) or CaM kinase II (lane2) was subjected to treatment with the protease and analyzed on the same gel. B, incorporation of 32P into sites I and II of synapsin I was analyzed using a Bio-Image analyzer. Results were obtained from 8 control and 8 potentiated slices. Values are means ± S.E. and are expressed as percentage of site II of control. ∗, statistically significant difference between potentiated and control slices (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Situ Phosphorylation of MAP2We investigated the effect of high frequency stimulation on the phosphorylation of MAP2, a protein essentially present in postsynaptic spines and dendrites. Following immunoprecipitation of MAP2 with the specific polyclonal antibody, we observed a 27 ± 5% (p < 0.05, n = 13) increase in the phosphorylation of MAP2 following LTP induction (Fig. 2, A and B). This increase in phosphorylation was completely prevented by pretreatment with 50 μMD-AP5, as was also observed in the autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II subunits and the phosphorylation of synapsin I.Effect of Calmidazolium on the Increased Phosphorylation of CaM Kinase II, Synapsin I, and MAP2 during LTPTo further evaluate involvement of CaM kinase II in the increased phosphorylation of synapsin I and MAP2 during LTP, we tested the effects of a calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, on the increased phosphorylation as well as on LTP induction. As reported by Reymann et al.(1988), inclusion of calmidazolium (50 μM) in the perfusion medium prevented the induction of LTP without modifications of basal synaptic transmission (Fig. 4B). Under the same conditions, the increases in autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II and phosphorylation of MAP2 associated with LTP induction were totally abolished (Fig. 4C). It is also interesting to note that the increased phosphorylation of synapsin I, although greatly inhibited in the presence of calmidazolium, was not completely prevented (compare Fig. 2 to Fig. 4C) (p < 0.05, n = 10).Figure 4Effects of calmidazolium on LTP induction and the increased phosphorylation of CaM kinase II, synapsin I, and MAP2. A, summary of the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope measured in four control experiments following application of θ burst stimulation (TBS) to a group of afferents in the CA1 regions of hippocampal slices. B, addition of calmidazolium (50 μM, blackbar) to the perfusion medium prevented induction of LTP without modifications of basal synaptic transmission. Data are means ± S.E. of the changes in excitatory postsynaptic potential slope measured in four experiments following application of θ burst stimulation (TBS). C, under the same conditions as in B, we determined the incorporation of 32P into the α and β subunits of CaM kinase II, synapsin I, or MAP2. Results were obtained from 6 control and 10 θ burst-stimulated slices in the presence of 50 μM calmidazolium. The treatment of slices with calmidazolium totally abolished the increases in autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II and phosphorylation of MAP2, whereas a small but significant increase in the phosphorylation of synapsin I was still observed. Values are means ± S.E. and are expressed as percentage of control. ∗, statistically significant difference between potentiated and control slices (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increase in the Amount of the β Subunit of CaM Kinase II with LTPIn previous experiments, we observed not only an increase in the Ca2+-independent activity of CaM kinase II but also a small but significant increase in the total activity of CaM kinase II 30-60 min after LTP induction. Among possible explanations for this observation, there was the possibility of translocation of the enzyme, unmasking of cryptic kinase activity, changes in phosphatase activities, or expression of newly synthesized enzyme. Comparisons of the total kinase activity in Triton X-100 insoluble and soluble fractions revealed no detectable decrease in activity in the insoluble fraction that could have explained the increase observed in the soluble one (data not shown). We therefore analyzed whether any regulation of CaM kinase II activity could occur through post-translational modifications, such as proteolysis by calpain. To address this issue, immunoblot analysis was carried out using the anti-CaM kinase II antibody. The results showed a small but significant increase in the amount of the β subunit of CaM kinase II following LTP induction. No changes in the α subunit were detected. There was no evidence for the presence of any proteolytic fragments by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). To evaluate the specificity of the increase in the β subunit of the kinase, immunoblotting experiments using the anti-synapsin I and MAPs antibodies were also carried out with the same samples. As shown in Fig. 5B, where each lane corresponds to the same sample as in Fig. 5A, no significant changes in the amount of synapsin I were detected following high frequency stimulation. In the experiments with the anti-MAPs antibody, a small but not statistically significant decrease was observed in the potentiated slices. All these results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 5C. Fig. 5C also shows that, when immunoblotting experiments were carried out with slices preincubated in the presence of D-AP5, the increase in the β subunit of CaM kinase II was no longer detected.Figure 5Immunoblot analysis of CaM kinase II and synapsin I following induction of LTP. Immunoblot analysis with the anti-CaM kinase II and anti-synapsin I antibodies was carried out in the CA1 areas of potentiated (HFS) and control slices. The Triton X-100-soluble fractions (24 μg) of the CA1 areas were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a Durapore membrane (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with 5 μg of IgG of the anti-CaM kinase II antibody per ml (A) or 2 μg of IgG of the anti-synapsin I antibody per ml (B). Bound antibodies were detected with 125I-protein A. A and B, autoradiograms showing an increased detection of the β subunit of CaM kinase II but not of the α subunit or of synapsin I.

Results were obtained from 15 potentiated and 13 controlled slices in the experiment without D-AP5. In the experiment with 50 μM D-AP5, results were obtained from 6 slices in each condition. Inclusion of D-AP5 in the medium prevented the increase in the amount of the β subunit of CaM kinase II.

The stimulation-induced increases in the phosphorylation were found to require NMDA receptor activation and were not detected in slices stimulated with low frequency trains that did not affect synaptic efficacy. It seems reasonable therefore to conclude that the changes reported here are related to the induction of LTP and not to non-selective effects of the stimulation. The changes in phosphorylation were measured in 32P-labeled slices 1 h after stimulation, thereby indicating that a stable increase in the phosphorylation had been induced by high frequency stimulation. In addition, experiments carried out in the presence of calmidazolium further support the idea that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases are involved in the increased phosphorylation of synapsin I and MAP2 associated with LTP induction. Taken together with the results of the previous study (Fukunaga et al., 1993), these data provide strong support to the idea that LTP induction is associated with a stable and long lasting increase in the degree of autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II. This would account for the changes in the Ca2+-independent activity reported previously and for the increased phosphorylation of substrates for CaM kinase II reported here.As the increase in autophosphorylation of the kinase was NMDA receptor-dependent and associated with an increase in in situ phosphorylation of MAP2, a protein exclusively present in postsynaptic spines and dendrites, the changes in CaM kinase II activity reported here must at least in part take place in the postsynaptic compartment. This is consistent with several results indicating a possible contribution of postsynaptic activation of kinases in LTP. For example, intracellular injection of inhibitors of CaM kinase II prevented the induction of synaptic potentiation (Malenka et al., 1989; Malinow et al., 1989). Evidence has been provided for a CaM kinase II-dependent phosphorylation of postsynaptic (s)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors (McGlade-McCulloh et al., 1993). This phosphorylation would result in the enhancement of postsynaptic sensitivity, and the idea has been proposed that this mechanism may represent one possible postsynaptic contribution to LTP (Figurov et al., 1993). Because MAP2 is a component of microtubule-associated proteins and a cytoskeletal protein in postsynaptic densities, the in situ phosphorylation of MAP2 reported here may also be important for the structural reorganization of synapses that has been proposed to accompany LTP induction (Geinisman et al., 1992). An increased and sustained postsynaptic autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II may thus contribute in several ways to the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area.An interesting result obtained in the present study is the observation that LTP induction was also associated with an increased phosphorylation of synapsin I, a presynaptic substrate of CaM kinase II. Although it is difficult at present to attribute this increased phosphorylation of synapsin I to an increased activity of CaM kinase II in presynaptic terminals, the results of a phosphopeptide mapping experiment suggest that the protein was indeed phosphorylated on the CaM kinase II-dependent site. However, the only partial inhibition produced by calmidazolium treatment of the synapsin I phosphorylation suggests a possible activation of other presynaptic protein kinases that may not be directly related to the induction of LTP. Also of interest is the observation that the phosphorylation of synapsin I was prevented by an antagonist of postsynaptic NMDA receptor. This could be interpreted as supporting the hypothesis of a retrograde messenger released following LTP induction to modify presynaptic parameters (Williams et al., 1989; Schuman and Madison, 1991; O'Dell et al., 1991). In this respect, it must be noted that phosphorylation of synapsin I in the squid giant presynaptic terminal has been proposed to participate in the modulation of neurotransmitter release and vesicle exocytosis (Lin et al., 1990). A sustained increase in the degree of autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II in presynaptic terminals associated with an increased phosphorylation of synapsin I may thus be relevant for contributing to LTP maintenance (Malgaroli and Tsien, 1992).The results of the present study demonstrated not only an increased activity of CaM kinase II via autophosphorylation but also an increased amount of the enzyme in the solubilized extract of the CA1 area following LTP induction. One hour after application of high frequency stimulation, we could detect an increased amount in CaM kinase II β subunit in immunoblotting experiments but no changes in the α subunit and in synapsin I. This may contribute to the increase in the total activity reported in the"

To investigate whether there was an interaction among sphingolipids, cholesterol, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in biological membranes, we introduced human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) in SPB-1 and in wild type cells by stable transfection and examined the effects of sphingolipid and/or cholesterol deprivation on the solubility of PLAP in Triton X-100. Although the PLAP solubility of the membranes isolated from the control cells in Triton X-100 was only 10%, deprivation of sphingolipid and cholesterol further enhanced the solubility, which reached 50% when both sphingolipids and cholesterol were deprived. The enhanced solubility was suppressed to the control level by metabolic complementation with exogenous sphingosine and cholesterol. The sphingolipid and cholesterol content of the isolated membranes changed independently, eliminating the possibility that sphingolipid deprivation induced a reduction in cellular cholesterol and enhanced PLAP solubility and vice versa. It was also unlikely that the enhanced solubility was due to structural changes in PLAP molecules since, regardless of sphingolipid and cholesterol deprivations, almost all PLAP had the GPI-anchor moiety and there were no differences in the apparent molecular weight of the protein in supernatant and precipitate fractions of the detergent-treated membranes. In addition, the expression level of caveolin in the isolated membranes was not significantly affected by sphingolipids and/or cholesterol depletion. These results indicated that both sphingolipids and cholesterol were involved in the PLAP insolubility and suggested that these lipids coordinately played a role in formation of Triton X-100resistant complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2068732182,"Voltage-gated potassium channel β subunits are cytoplasmic proteins that co-purify with the pore-forming α subunits. One of these subunits, Kvβ1 from rat brain, was previously demonstrated to increase the rate of inactivation of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We have cloned and characterized a novel voltage-gated K+ channel β subunit. The cDNA, designated Kvβ3, has a 408-amino acid open reading frame. It possesses a unique 79-amino acid N-terminal leader, but is identical with rat Kvβ1 over the 329 C-terminal amino acids. The Kvβ3 transcript was found in many tissues, but was most abundant in aorta and left ventricle of the heart. Co-expression of Kvβ3 with K+ channel α subunits shows that this β subunit can increase the rate of inactivation from 4- to 7-fold in a Kv1.4 or Shaker B channel. Kvβ3 had no effect on Kv1.1, unlike Kvβ1 which can increase rate of inactivation of this α subunit more than 100-fold. Other kinetic parameters were unaffected. This study shows that voltage-gated K+ channel β subunits are present outside the central nervous system, and that at least one member of this family selectively modulates inactivation of K+ channel α subunits.

Voltage-gated potassium channels are present in all excitable and most nonexcitable eukaryotic cell types. They are involved in a diverse array of functions, including electrogenesis, secretion, and cell motility. In mammals, a diverse group of more than 50 members of an extended gene family homologous to the Shaker gene of Drosophila have been identified that are responsible for generating many voltage-gated K+ currents(1Pongs O.

Shaker-type K+ channel proteins, expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines, form tetramers of α subunits that selectively conduct K+ ions and reproduce many properties of native channels. However, there are inconsistencies between native and cloned K+ channel currents, suggesting a failure to reconstitute the native channels fully in heterologous expression systems. These inconsistencies have several possible explanations. Some native K+ channels are heteromultimeric associations of more than one type of α subunit. These associations can modify the current phenotypes, making them distinct from currents produced by either α subunit alone(6Po S. Roberds S. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 365: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8Wang H. Kunkel D.D.

It has also been suggested that differences between cloned and native channels are due to differences in post-translational processing or intracellular environment between heterologous expression systems and the channel's native environment(9Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Marom S. Goldstein S.A.N. Kupper J. Levitan I.B.

This suggests that complete reconstitution of K+ channels in heterologous expression systems requires the presence of appropriate β subunits. Partial amino acid sequencing of the bovine K+ channel β subunit led to the cloning of one bovine brain (14Scott V.E.S. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Dolly J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20094-20097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two rat brain (16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) β subunit cDNAs. They were divided into two classes based on differences in sequence: Kvβ1, found in rat, and Kvβ2, found in both rat and bovine. These β subunits consisted of 401 and 367 amino acids, respectively, and had 85% identity in their 329 C-terminal amino acids. The respective N termini of 72 and 38 amino acids exhibit no conservation. Co-expression of rat Kvβ1 with a delayed rectifier type K+ channel (RCK1; Kv1.1) increased the rate of inactivation more than 100-fold. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the increase in inactivation rate was mediated through the N-terminal region of the β subunit. The Kvβ2 subunit did not affect the properties of RCK1 or of a fast-inactivating Kv1.4 channel, RCK4(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Kvβ1 mRNA was detected exclusively in brain(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). To determine if novel K+ channel β subunits might be found in other tissues, we attempted to clone these proteins from heart. The large array of K+ currents in heart (17Pennefather P. Cohen I.S. Zipes D.P. Jalife J. Cardiac Electrophysiology: From Cell to Bedside. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1990: 17-28Google Scholar, 18Kass R.S. Freeman L.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) made it a logical source of unknown β subunits. A cDNA was isolated from a ferret ventricular cDNA library. It contained a single open reading frame highly conserved with previously described voltage-gated K+ channel β subunits(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

The Kvβ3 transcript was most abundant in aorta and left ventricle, although it was also found in other locations in the heart as well as brain, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Kvβ3 is conserved in humans and rats. Kvβ3 was co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with K+ channel α subunits from ferret (Kv1.4(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J.

Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). However, unlike Kvβ1, which increased the inactivation rate of Kv1.1 ≈100-fold, Kvβ3 had no effect on this α subunit. As Kvβ3 was also capable of modulating inactivation of Shaker B, the failure of Kvβ3 to alter inactivation of Kv1.1 was not due to strict specificity for Kv1.4 α subunits. Unless otherwise specified, standard molecular biological methods were used(23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar); 5 μg were reverse-transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT) primers as described by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides were designed based on the amino acid sequences NIIKKKGW and NQGMAMYW from amino acids 101-108 and 178-185, respectively, of the Kvβ2 subunit from bovine brain ((19); Fig. 1). The oligonucleotide sequences were: 5′-TCGAATTCAAYCAGGGMATGGCIATGTAYTGG-3′ and 5′-GACCTCGAGCCYTCGTTICKIARRCACCA-3′ (R = A/G; M = A/C; I = inosine; K = G/T; Y = C/T). PCR ( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). )was performed as described(26Peterson M.G. Tjian R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), with 1/20 of the cDNA from the reverse transcription reaction.

A probe was made by random-priming the PCR product with digoxigenin-11-dUTP to allow chemiluminescent detection (Boehringer Mannheim). The random-primed PCR product was used to probe a ferret ventricle cDNA library (20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J.

The positive plaque, λFHBK1, was rescued by in vivo excision; the resulting plasmid, pFHBK1, contained the full length of the β subunit open reading frame and about 1.5 kilobase pairs of 3′-untranslated region, including the poly(A)+ tail. Single-stranded phagemid DNA (28Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) was utilized for sequencing with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemicals) using custom oligonucleotides. Each nucleotide on both strands was unambiguously identified at least once. Sequence similarity searches were performed through the NCBI BLAST server(29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Human heart whole cell RNA was purchased from Clontech. The primers used were FKβ3/58 (5′-GTATAAACCTGCCTGTGC-3′; covering amino acids 4-9 in ferret Kvβ3) and FKβ3/37 (5′-AGCCTTTCCAGCAGCATAGACTTC-3′; covering amino acids 129-135; Fig. 1). PCR was performed as described(30Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar). After a 5-min 94°C denaturation step, the reactions were cycled 35 times at 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The procedure was completed with a 5-min incubation at 72°C. The PCR products were cloned into pBS-SK+, and two independent clones of each were sequenced. Partial cDNA sequences of the rat and human Kvβ3 have been deposited in GenBankTM under the accession numbers U17967 and U17968, respectively. Whole cell RNA was prepared from ferret heart, brain, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle(25MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), aorta, and aortic endothelial cells(31Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J.

Competitive PCR was performed essentially as described(32Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). One-twentieth of each reverse transcriptase reaction (along with a sham cDNA control lacking reverse transcriptase) was amplified by PCR. Each reaction contained 2 μM primer FKβ3/37, 2 μM primer FKβ3/56 (5′-TCTCAGAGCTAAAGACTGTGAAATGAGC-3′; identical with nucleotides 4-31 upstream of the translational start site), and 0.2 fmol internal standard. The cycling parameters were the same as for isolation of rat and human Kvβ3, except the annealing temperature was 58°C. The reaction products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 1 × TBE gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light. The 272-bp internal standard was synthesized as described (33Celi F.S. Zenilman M. Shuldiner A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) using primers FKβ3/56 and FKβ3/37 (5′-AGCCTTTCCAGCAGCATAGACTTCATTCCTGTAAGCCATG-3′; the first 24 nucleotides are identical with FKβ3/37, the last 16 nucleotides are complementary to nucleotides 286-301; see Fig. 2A). Xenopus laevis oocytes (stage V-VI) were defolliculated by gently shaking for 3 h in Ca2+-free OR2 solution (in mM: 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.40) with 1-2 mg/ml collagenase(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution containing up to 50 ng of RNA with and without β subunit at ratios varying from 1:1 (α:β) to 1:16, as described previously (20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage-clamp experiments were conducted on oocytes within 3-6 days of injection using a two electrode “bath clamp” amplifier (OC-725A, Warner Instruments) as described previously. Briefly, bath potential was sensed using an agar bridge electrode, and bath potential was maintained using a separate current passing agar bridge electrode. The amplifier was used with the “DC gain feature” which reduced errors due to finite open loop gain. Average peak current size at +50 mV for all analyzed currents was 7.4 ± 0.9 μA (n = 118). No correlation between current size and inactivation rate was detected for the range of currents measured in this study. Extracellular solution was ND-96 (in mM: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). Electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl (resistances 0.6-1.5 megaohms) and shielded to reduce capacitive coupling. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. Data were not leakage- or capacitance-subtracted, unless otherwise specified. Activation was measured using the cut-open oocyte technique(34Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), as described previously(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar). Data from two-electrode voltage clamp were filtered at 2 kHz or 5 kHz for cut-open oocyte and analyzed using an Axon Instruments TL-1 interface and pClamp software. Confidence levels were calculated using an unpaired t test. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of ferret Kvβ3 to K+ channel β subunits from rat (Kvβ1 and Kvβ2) and bovine (Kvβ2). Strikingly, Kvβ3 and rat Kvβ1 are identical over the last 329 amino acids, a region where Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 share 85% identity. However, there is no similarity among the first 79 amino acids of the ferret β subunit and the first 72 or 38 amino acids of Kvβ1 and Kvβ2, respectively. Similarity searches of both the entire β subunit and the N-terminal 79 amino acids revealed no significant similarity between ferret Kvβ3 and any other protein except the previously described β subunits. No similarity was found between the N terminus of ferret Kvβ3 and any other protein sequence. Despite their apparent lack of similarity, the N termini of Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 share one potentially important structural feature: a cysteine residue near the N terminus. Oxidation of this amino acid, also found near the N termini of other fast inactivating channels, can dramatically decrease inactivation rates (11Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

Hydropathy and secondary structural analyses of the Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 N termini fail to show any apparent similarity in predicted secondary structure(35Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparison of the deduced Kvβ3 amino acid sequence with protein motif data bases (41Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 42Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) showed the presence of 33 consensus phosphorylation sites. To determine the tissue localization of Kvβ3, competitive PCR (32Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar) was performed on cDNA made from several tissues. Oligonucleotides were chosen at the 5′ end of the clone to ensure specific amplification of Kvβ3 (Fig. 2A). Ferret Kvβ3 transcript was most abundant in aorta followed by left ventricle (Fig. 2B). Transcripts were also detected in right ventricle, atrium, brain, skeletal muscle, and kidney. None were detectable in liver or cultured aortic endothelial cells. Aorta is rich in smooth muscle, fibrous tissue, and endothelium; as the transcript was not present in endothelial cells, it is likely that this transcript is present in smooth muscle or fibroblasts, although its presence in other cell types cannot be ruled out. Kvβ3 is not unique to ferret. Cross-species PCR using oligonucleotides FKβ3/37 and FKβ3/58 (which is complementary to the unique portion of the ferret cDNA) was performed on rat and human heart cDNA. The reactions yielded the expected 400-nucleotide DNA species, which was cloned and sequenced. There was extensive similarity in the nucleotide sequence among ferret, human, and rat, showing that Kvβ3 is present in all three species. The amino acid sequence conservation in the N-terminal region was 88% between ferret and human and 80% between ferret and rat (data not shown). Kvβ1 can increase the rate of inactivation of both a delayed rectifier and a fast-inactivating (A-type) K+ channel α subunit(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Conservation between Kvβ3 and Kvβ1 suggested that Kvβ3 might have a similar influence. To test the effect of Kvβ3 on inactivation and other channel properties, it was co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with FK1, a ferret Kv1.4 channel(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar), and RCK1 (rat Kv1.1(21Tempel B.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 332: 837-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)). Co-injection of Kvβ3 mRNA with FK1 mRNA caused subtle changes in inactivation kinetics (Fig. 3A). Inactivation of FK1 channels has been previously shown to be biexponential, with two closely spaced time constants at +50 mV(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar). The time constant of the fast component of inactivation decreased from 42 ± 3 (n = 20) for FK1 alone to 6.2 ± 0.2 ms (n = 28); the slow component decreased from 313 ± 94 to 101 ± 2 ms. The decrease of the fast component of inactivation was comparable to the overall decrease induced by Kvβ1 expressed with rat Kv1.4. Co-expression of Kvβ3 with FK1 also changed the relative contribution of each component of inactivation; the ratio of the amplitude of fast to slow time constants decreased from 5.0 ± 1.7 to 0.67 ± 0.03. Because of the greater participation of the slow component, the net result was a minor alteration in the overall rate of inactivation. In contrast to the results obtained with FK1, co-injection of RCK1 (Kv1.1) with Kvβ3 failed to show any effect on channel inactivation (Fig. 3B). This was true despite a 16:1 (by weight) co-injection of Kvβ3:RCK1 mRNA; parallel experiments using FK1 and FK1Δ2-146 (see below) showed that the Kvβ3 subunit was active (data not shown). These results are strikingly different from those obtained by Rettig et al.(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) with Kvβ1. They showed an approximately 100-fold increase in the rate of inactivation of RCK1. Since Kvβ3 was co-injected with the identical RCK1 α subunit, and conservation of RCK4 and FK1 is 97%(20Comer M.B. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Lamson D.R. Morales M.J. Zhang Y. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1383-H1395PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the difference in inactivation is due to the different N termini of Kvβ3 and Kvβ1. It is possible that the change in rate of inactivation caused by Kvβ3 may be dependent on the ratio of expressed α subunit to β subunit. If the β subunits failed to saturate all available binding sites on the α subunits, the overall rate and degree of β subunit-mediated inactivation would likely be decreased. A second explanation is that the maximal association of β subunits to α subunits was achieved, but that Kvβ3 simply induced slower inactivation, or perhaps caused inactivation by a different mechanism. To discriminate between these possibilities, a mutant form of FK1, FK1Δ2-146, in which the first 146 N-terminal amino acids have been deleted to remove fast N-type inactivation ((20); referred to as FK1ΔNco), was co-expressed with Kvβ3. As shown in Fig. 3C, co-expression with Kvβ3 greatly increased the rate at which FK1Δ2-146 inactivated. The time constant of inactivation for FK1Δ2-146 was 1795 ± 81 ms (at +50 mV), decreasing to 409 ± 27 ms with co-injection of Kvβ3 mRNA. The effects of co-expression of Kvβ3 mRNA on the inactivation rate of FK1Δ2-146 were dependent upon the ratio of injected Kvβ3 to FK1Δ2-146 mRNA for ratios less than 2 to 1 but were insensitive to ratios higher than 2 to 1 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the β subunits were saturating at the mRNA concentrations used in these experiments. These data showed that ferret Kvβ3 can associate with ferret Kv1.4 (FK1), but did not rule out the possibility that this β subunit's effects might be specific for only a limited class of α subunits. Therefore, we co-injected Kvβ3 with the distantly related channel, Shaker B from Drosophila. Since this channel is only 50% conserved with FK1, it appeared to be an unlikely candidate to associate with a mammalian β subunit. We used Shaker BΔ6-46(22Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), a mutant lacking fast N-type inactivation, to be able to clearly detect the effects of β subunit association. Co-expression of Shaker BΔ6-46 with Kvβ3 resulted in an increase in the degree and rate of inactivation similar to that observed for FK1Δ2-146 (Fig. 3D). Association with Shaker B suggested that Kvβ3 is probably binding to the much more highly conserved RCK1, but for some reason is unable to induce inactivation. Other gating characteristics of FK1 and FK1Δ2-146 were not strongly altered by co-expression of Kvβ3. Fig. 5 shows data obtained using the cut-open oocyte clamp (34Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for FK1Δ2-146 in the presence and absence of β subunit. FK1Δ2-146 was used to minimize the overlap of fast inactivation with activation. There was no obvious difference in the sigmoid onset of the current during the first 2 ms at +50 mV; however, the late rising phase of current was terminated prematurely by what appears to be the onset of an inactivation-like process. Although the time to peak current appears to have decreased with co-expression of Kvβ3, this is most likely due to the increased inactivation rate. Similarly, β subunit expression had only modest effects on recovery from inactivation when co-expressed either with full-length FK1 (t1/2 = 4.88 ± 0.13 s (n = 4) with β subunit; t1/2 = 2.95 ± 0.18 s (n = 4) without β subunit) or FK1Δ2-146 (t1/2 = 2.94 ± 0.12 s (n = 5) with β subunit; t1/2 = 2.20 ± 0.11 s (n = 4) without β subunit). We have cloned, sequenced, and characterized a novel K+ channel β subunit, Kvβ3. The deduced protein sequence is identical with Kvβ1 in its 329 C-terminal amino acids, but has a 79-amino acid N terminus with no sequence identity with Kvβ1 or Kvβ2. Conservation of C termini between Kvβ1 and Kvβ3, and their sharp transition to a nonconserved region, suggested that one mechanism for generating different β subunits might be alternative splicing of precursor transcripts. The general structural similarity between Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 implied that Kvβ3 might induce inactivation in K+ channel α subunits. This was true for mutant channels that have had N-type inactivation disrupted (FK1Δ2-146 and Shaker BΔ6-46) and in wild-type Kv1.4. However, unlike Kvβ1, it did not cause inactivation of a Kv1.1 α subunit. The failure of Kvβ3 to modify RCK1 inactivation kinetics may reflect a failure of this α and β subunit to associate, although association with Shaker argues against this. Alternatively, Kvβ3 and RCK1 may associate, but specific domains required for inactivation cannot interact. Acceleration of inactivation by Kvβ1 is mediated by a “tethered ball”(16Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). If Kvβ3 operates through a similar mechanism, the implication is that the inactivation domain of Kvβ3 is specific for certain α subunits. This seems unlikely, given the recent demonstration that a variety of inactivation domains can induce inactivation in fast inactivating and non-inactivating α subunits (43Ruppersberg J.P. Frank R. Pongs O. Stocker M. Nature. 1991; 353: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 44Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Kvβ3 alters inactivation through another mechanism. In either case, it seems clear that the nonconserved N-terminal region in β subunits confer some degree of specificity of interaction. Kvβ3 is the third member of a family of ancillary subunits that associate with voltage-gated K+ channels. Co-expression of Kvβ3 causes alterations in K+ channel function that are distinct from the effects Kvβ1 or Kvβ2. This suggests that the diversity of in vivo K+ channel function may result from expression of different K+ channel β subunits, as well as diversity of expression and assembly of α subunits. This mechanism is similar to that of Na+ and Ca2+ channels, which are known to generate diversity through assembly of different subunits(45Isom L.L. Dejongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Given the wide variety of associated subunits for these other channels, it seems likely that Kvβ1, Kvβ2, and Kvβ3 are the first members of a large group of ancillary K+ channel subunits that differ in their N termini. The novel differences in specificity of channel interaction and electrophysiological properties of Kvβ3 from Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 provide an additional basis for understanding K+ channel function and diversity.

https://openalex.org/W1992677182,"Two lines of transgenic mdx mice have been generated that express a 71 kD non-muscle isoform of dystrophin (Dp71) in skeletal muscle. This isoform contains the cysteine-rich and Oterminal domains of dystrophin, but lacks the N-terminal actin-binding and central spectrin-like repeat domains. Dp71 was associated with the sarcolemma membrane, where it restored normal expression and localization of all members of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. However, the skeletal muscle pathology of the transgenic mdx mice remained severe. These results indicate that the dystrophin C terminus cannot function independently to prevent dystrophic symptoms and confirms predictions based on patient data that both the N and C-terminal domains are required for normal dystrophin function."

Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis.

Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its β subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII•SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis.

INTRODUCTIONThe activins and inhibins are dimeric cytokines with important roles in development and physiology(1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors And their Receptors II. Springer, Berlin1990: 211-248Google Scholar). Although first discovered as gonadal peptides that regulate spermatogenesis and oogenesis, both cytokines are widely expressed and cause diverse responses in cell types from both intragonadal and extragonadal tissues(1Sporn M.B.

Dependent on cell, tissue, and biological activity, activin or inhibin can act as a positive or negative effector, but both are generally antagonists of the other(1Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of baculoviral transfer plasmid pVL-1392 (Invitrogen). A human SKR2 cDNA was amplified from the cloned SKR2 cDNA template (13Xu J. Matsuzaki K. McKeehan K. Wang F. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resultant cDNA spanned the sequence from 7 base pairs upstream of the translational initiation site through coding sequence for 62 residues of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain. To facilitate immunochemical analysis, a portion of human fibroblast growth factor receptor cDNA coding for the M1C4 monoclonal antibody epitope (23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated in-frame with the SKR2 cDNA at its 3′-end at a BamHI site. The tagged SKR2 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI sites of pVL-1392. Recombinant baculoviruses bearing ActRII and SKR2 cDNAs were prepared as described elsewhere(23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E.

Except where indicated, the infected Sf9 cells were harvested within 65 h. The epitope-tagged chimeric protein containing SKR2 extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular juxtamembrane domains from cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation methods by using monoclonal antibody M1C4 as described previously(23Xu J.

Unless otherwise indicated, baculoviral infected Sf9 cells (7.5 × 105) were suspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 128 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and mixed with 0.5 pmol of 125I-labeled activin (2.38 × 106 cpm/pmol) or inhibin (3.84 × 106 cpm/pmol) for 90 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of an excess amount of unlabeled ligand. The bound ligand was covalently cross-linked to receptor sites with 0.5 mM disuccinimidyl suberate in binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. The cells were extracted with ice-cold cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The affinity-labeled complexes from 7.5 × 105 cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography(23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of HepG2 cells were affinity-labeled with 125I-labeled activin or inhibin by using the same procedure.ImmunoprecipitationLysates of Sf9 cells (3 × 106) from binding assays were absorbed with normal rabbit IgG immobilized to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) before reaction with the M1C4 monoclonal antibody immobilized to protein A-Sepharose as previously described(23Xu J.

Lysates (0.25 ml) of HepG2 cells (2 × 106) prepared as described above were adjusted to 0.3% SDS, boiled for 4 min, diluted 2-fold, and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then mixed with 35 μl of protein A beads and 10 μl of anti-SKR2 serum N19S or serum from the same rabbit obtained prior to immunization. Antiserum was prepared against a synthetic polypeptide sequence N19S (NRIDLRVPSGHLKEPEHPS) in the extracellular juxtamembrane of SKR2 (13Xu J. Matsuzaki K. McKeehan K. Wang F. Kan M. McKeehan W.L.

After incubation for 3 h at 4°C, the beads were extracted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography(23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

Bicknell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3909-3912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conditioned medium of hybridoma mAb149/1 was a generous gift from Dr. R. Bicknell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Oxford, UK). For immunoprecipitations, 0.30 ml of cell lysate was mixed with 0.15 ml of the mAb149/1-conditioned medium and 35 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (Sigma).DNA SynthesisAcid-insoluble [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in 1.5 × 104 HepG2 cells in 24-well plates containing 1 ml of minimum Eagle's medium and 1% fetal bovine serum after 3 days of exposure to activin, inhibin, or both at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 h with 0.5 μCi added to each well in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. After a wash with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, cells were soaked in 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C for 30 min, then solubilized in 0.25 ml of 0.5 N NaOH, and the solution was counted by liquid scintillation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Activin A Homodimer Binds to Recombinant ActRII and the Ectodomain of SKR2To study the binding of activin and inhibin to ActRII and SKR2, full-length recombinant ActRII protein and an epitope-tagged SKR2 chimeric protein exhibiting the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular juxtamembrane domains of SKR2 and a specific monoclonal antibody epitope M1C4 at its COOH terminus (23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were expressed in baculoviral infected Sf9 insect cells. Western blot analyses with ActRII-specific monoclonal antibody mAb149/1 (24McCarthy S.A. Bicknell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3909-3912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SKR2 chimeric protein-specific monoclonal antibody M1C4 (23Xu J. Nakahara M. Crabb J.W. Shi E. Matuo Y. Fraser M. Kan M. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17792-17803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the apparent molecular masses of the insect cell-expressed recombinant ActRII and the tagged SKR2 ectodomain on SDS-PAGE were 72 and 43 kDa, respectively. Table 1 lists the possible complexes that can arise and their relative abundance observed experimentally from interaction of activin A, inhibin A, ActRII, and SKR2 after incubation and subsequent exposure to a covalent affinity cross-linking reagent followed by analysis of stable complexes by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. When expressed alone, the recombinant ectodomain of SKR2 failed to bind 125I-labeled activin A (Fig. 1A). Immunoassay with the M1C4 antibody confirmed the presence of the 43-kDa antigen in the infected cell lysates (results not shown). Cells expressing the 72-kDa ActRII product exhibited 125I-labeled bands of 98 and 85 kDa which correlated with the size of the ActRII product cross-linked to a 28-kDa β:β homodimer and a single 14-kDa β chain of activin, respectively (Fig. 1A). The results suggest that β:β activin binds to ActRII through one of its subunits. The significant band at 28 kDa above the dye front containing the 14-kDa β chain monomer of activin indicated that the two disulfide-linked β chains of the homodimer can be cross-linked when bound to ActRII or in free nonspecifically bound form (Fig. 1A). Significant amounts of higher molecular mass ligand-labeled material were apparent at the top of the gels; however, these analyses could neither confirm the presence of the RII•β:β•RII species (Table 1) nor shed light on the stoichiometry of the binding of ActRII to each β chain within the activin homodimer. Cells which were co-infected with both viruses bearing epitope-tagged chimeric SKR2 and ActRII cDNAs exhibited an additional band at 57 kDa which is the size predicted for the 43-kDa epitope-tagged SKR2 product linked to one 14-kDa β chain (Fig. 1A). A 70-kDa band indicative of SKR2 linked to a 28-kDa β:β activin homodimer was notably absent. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody M1C4 confirmed that the 57-kDa band contained the SKR2 product (Fig. 1B). In addition, the 85-kDa complex of an 125I-labeled activin β chain and ActRII coprecipitated with the anti-SKR2 M1C4 antibody (Fig. 1B). In contrast to cell lysates, the 98-kDa band of ActRII bearing the activin β:β dimer was barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates. In contrast to the lysates, the relative intensity of the 57- and 85-kDa bands in the immunoprecipitates was near 1:1 at all three ratios of co-infection. The results confirmed that the binding of β:β activin to ActRII facilitates binding of SKR2 to the ActRII-activin complex in stoichiometric amounts. Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that an ActRII and SKR2 complex is bound to each β chain of the activin β:β dimer, the absence of a significant band at 128-kDa indicative of a ActRII•β•SKR2 complex (Fig. 1B and results not shown) suggests an ActRII•β:β•SKR2 complex in which ActRII and SKR2 are bound respectively to each chain of the β:β dimer. The absence of the SKR2•β:β species in both lysates and immunoprecipitates and the ActRII•β:β species in the immunoprecipitates may indicate a spatial relationship between the two β chains of activin when bound to both ActRII and SKR2 that reduces the efficiency of interchain cross-linking.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 1Binding of 125I-labeled activin to recombinant ActRII and ectodomain of SKR2 in baculoviral-infected Sf9 insect cells.

The major 105-kDa band was the predicted size of 72-kDa ActRII bearing the 32-kDa α:β inhibin heterodimer while the 85-kDa band correlated with that of ActRII cross-linked to the 14-kDa β subunit of inhibin (Table 1). No distinct 90-kDa band indicative of ActRII linked to the unique monomeric 18-kDa α chain of inhibin could be detected. In addition, high molecular material at the top of the gels indicative of oligomers of ActRII and the labeled α:β inhibin ligand was much less than the same analyses employing activin as ligand (Fig. 1A). The intense band at 32 kDa as well as the high yield of the ActRII•β:α complex (105 kDa) indicated that, similar to activin, disuccinimidyl suberate efficiently cross-linked the α and β subunits of inhibin to each other when bound both to ActRII or nonspecifically as the free ligand (Fig. 2A, Table 1). The high intensity of the ActRII•β:α species relative to the ActRII•β complex probably indicates a higher specific activity of the 125I-labeled α chain relative to the β chain. Neither cells infected with single virus bearing the SKR2 cDNA nor those co-infected with viruses bearing SKR2 and ActRII cDNAs yielded SKR2 bands labeled with inhibin in the total cell lysates (Fig. 2A) or in immunoprecipitates with the M1C4 antibody (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that inhibin binds to ActRII through its β subunit which is shared with activin, but inhibin cannot promote formation of the ActRII•SKR2 heterodimer because of inability of SKR2 to bind to the inhibin α chain. Although steric interference by presence of the unique α chain cannot be eliminated, these results further suggest that it is unlikely that ActRII and SKR2 assemble on a single β chain of the activin β:β homodimer.Figure 2Binding of 125I-labeled inhibin to recombinant ActRII and ectodomain of SKR2. A, radiolabeled bands from cell lysates. B, radiolabeled bands precipitated with M1C4 antibody.

As an alternative, the ability of unlabeled activin and inhibin to reduce the amount of labeled activin that was covalently cross-linked to ActRII was performed. Both activin-labeled ActRII bands at 98 and 85 kDa in baculoviral infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3, lane 2) were reduced by an excess of unlabeled activin (Fig. 3, lanes 3-6) and inhibin (Fig. 3, lanes 7-10). In experiments not shown here, the same results were achieved when Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses bearing ActRII and SKR2 cDNAs. Activin-labeled ActRII and SKR2 bands were proportionally reduced by unlabeled activin or inhibin. Quantitative analysis of the results by scanning densitometry revealed that on a molar basis 2-4 times more inhibin than activin was required to reduce the activin-labeled ActRII complexes to the same level (Fig. 3). Currently, it is unclear whether this reflects an intrinsically lower affinity of the inhibin β chain for ActRII due to influence of the α chain or that the molar ratio of binding of ActRII to the β:β activin homodimer is greater than one.Figure 3Competition of inhibin and activin for binding of activin to recombinant ActRII. Sf9 cells (5 × 105) were infected with baculoviruses bearing antisense (lane 1) or ActRII (lanes 2-10) cDNAs and incubated for 90 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 0.30 pmol of 125I-labeled human recombinant activin and the indicated amounts in picomoles of unlabeled activin (lanes 3-6) or inhibin (lanes 7-10) in a total volume of 0.25 ml. After addition of DSS, the 125I-activin-labeled complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The relative intensities of the radiolabeled 98- and 85-kDa ActRII bands (bottom) was determined by scanning densitometry across the area of the film containing the two ActRII bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activin and Inhibin Receptors in HepG2 CellsTo test whether native activin and inhibin receptors in liver cells exhibited properties similar to recombinant ActRII and SKR2, analyses were carried out in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) which express ActRII and from where SKR2 was originally cloned(12Matsuzaki K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7957-7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both labeled activin and inhibin yielded a labeled 89-kDa band, activin labeled specific bands at 72 and 165 kDa, and inhibin labeled a specific band at 110 kDa. All four bands were eliminated by addition of unlabeled activin or inhibin to the binding reaction (Fig. 4A). The common 89-kDa band labeled by both ligands had the predicted molecular mass of a 75-kDa mammalian ActRII linked to the common 14-kDa β subunit of activin and inhibin. The 72-kDa band that was specifically labeled with 125I-labeled activin was characteristic of a 59-kDa type I activin receptor linked to a single 14-kDa β chain. Since the 165-kDa weak band that was uniquely labeled with activin is sensitive to unlabeled inhibin and near the sum of the 89- and 72-kDa bands, it is likely the heterodimer of type II and type I activin receptors bearing the homodimeric β:β activin ligand."

We demonstrate that these cells express the retinoid receptors RARα, RARγ, and RXRβ. To identify which of these receptors are involved in regulating these processes, we analyzed the effects of several receptor-selective agonists, an antagonist, and a dominant-negative RARα. We show that the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 strongly increased TGase II expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas the RXR-selective retinoid SR11217 had little effect. The RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 was also able to induce TGase II, whereas the RARγ-selective retinoid CD437 was inactive. The induction of TGase II by the RAR-selective retinoid was completely inhibited by the RARα-antagonist Ro41-5253. Overexpression of a truncated RARα gene with dominant-negative activity also inhibited the induction of TGase II expression. The increase in TGase II is associated with an induction of apoptosis as revealed by DNA fragmentation and the generation of apoptotic cells. We demonstrate that apoptosis is affected by retinoids in a manner similar to TGase II. Our results suggest that the induction of TGase II expression and apoptosis in SPOC-1 cells are mediated through an RARα-dependent signaling pathway.

In macrophages, the regulation of TGase II expression by RA occurs at the transcriptional level(4Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J. Stein J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that many of the effects of RA on gene expression are mediated by the activation of nuclear retinoid receptors, RARs and/or RXR's (24Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The RAR and RXR gene family each comprises three subtypes named α, β, and γ(24Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). These subtypes are expressed in a developmental stage- and cell type-specific manner(24Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar), and each may regulate the expression of different genes.In this study, we examined the retinoid signaling pathways that are involved in the induction of TGase II and apoptosis in rat tracheobronchial epithelial SPOC-1 cells utilizing several novel retinoid receptor-selective agonists and an antagonist. We have also addressed this question through the expression of a truncated RARα that acts as a dominant-negative receptor(25Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).

SPOC-1 cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes until confluent, and the medium was then changed to 3 ml of serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (Clonetics). The cells were then transfected with 2.5 μg of βRARE-tk-LUC or co-transfected with 1.5 μg of RXRE-tk-CAT and 1.5 μg of a pSG5 expression vector containing the coding region of RXRα (36Leid M.

Fifteen or five h after transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh growth medium and treated with retinoids for 48 h. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system from Promega. CAT activity was assayed as described by Gorman et al.(41Gorman C.M. Moffat L.M. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

All experiments were repeated at least twice and performed in triplicate.Infection of SPOC-1 Cells with Retroviral VectorsThe retroviral vector LRARα403SN in which a truncated RARα gene is inserted into the retroviral vector LXSN has been described previously (25Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SPOC-1 cells were seeded at the density of 300,000 cells/75 cm2 flask. The next day, cells were infected with the LXSN or LRARα403SN retroviral vector in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene as described previously(25Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After a 5-h incubation, the medium was changed and cells were grown for 24-36 h before G418 (2 mg/ml) was added and the G418-resistant cells were isolated.DNA Fragmentation AnalysisDNA was isolated as described previously(42Preston G.A. Lang J. Maronpot R.R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 1 × TBE buffer (0.05 M Tris base, 0.05 M boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Electron Microscopic AnalysisCells were collected, fixed, and embedded in Epon as described(42Preston G.A. Lang J. Maronpot R.R. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections (60-90 nm) were stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 2.7% lead citrate and examined in a Phillips “400” transmission electron microscope.RESULTSDifferential Regulation of TGase I and II by RARat tracheal epithelial SPOC-1 cells undergo squamous cell differentiation after reaching confluence and start to express several squamous cell-specific genes including TGase I and cornifin(43Jetten A.M. Fujimoto W. Zhang L.-X. Marvin K.W. Austin S. Mills K.J. Bernacki S.H. Saunders N.A. Livrea M.A. Vidali G. Retinoids: From Basic Science to Clinical Applications. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1994: 243-252Google Scholar). Treatment of these cultures with RA strongly suppressed the induction of TGase I as revealed by immunoblot analysis using the TGase I-specific antiserum B.C1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, addition of RA caused an increase in the levels of TGase II protein (Fig. 1A). Suppression of TGase I expression could be observed at concentrations as low as 10−9M, whereas TGase II was increased at RA concentrations greater than 10−8M. The level of TGase II was about 20-fold higher in SPOC-1 cells treated with 10−6M RA as compared to untreated control cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, an increase in TGase II occurred after a lag time of more than 20 h and reached a plateau after 48 h of treatment with 10−6M RA. The induction of TGase II by RA occurred in logarithmic and confluent cultures (data not shown).Expression of RARs and RXRs in SPOC-1 CellsThe induction of TGase II by RA may be directly or indirectly mediated by nuclear retinoid receptors. To examine which retinoid receptors could be involved in this regulation, the expression of RAR and RXR receptors in SPOC-1 cells was investigated. Poly(A)+ RNAs from RA-, SRI-6751-84-, and dimethyl sulfoxide (control)-treated SPOC-1 cells were subjected to Northern blot analysis. Untreated SPOC-1 cells expressed RARα, RARγ, and RXRβ mRNAs (Fig. 2), whereas RARβ and RXRα and -γ mRNAs were undetectable (data not shown). Treatment of SPOC-1 cells for 4 days with 10−8M RA or the retinoid SRI-6751-84 increased the level of RARγ and RXRβ mRNAs by about 8- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). SRI-6751-84 (10−8M) also induced RXRα expression (Fig. 2). RA at 10−8M did not induce RXRα mRNA; however, as shown for TGase II (Fig. 1), 10−7-10−6M RA was able to induce RXRα (data not shown). In contrast to previous reports on human and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells(44Nervi C. Vollberg T.M. George M.D. Zelent A. Chambon P. Jetten A.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), RA did not induce RARβ mRNA in SPOC-1 cells (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of RARs and RXRs in SPOC-1 cells. Confluent cultures were treated for 4 days with 10−8M RA, the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 (RAR-Sel.) or vehicle (Control). Poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) was fractionated, transferred to a Hybond membrane, and hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA probes for mouse RARα, -β, and -γ, human RXRα, -β, and -γ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transactivation of βRARE-tk-LUC and RXRE-tk-CAT by Receptor-selective RetinoidsTo obtain greater insight into which RAR and/or RXR receptor(s) mediate the induction of TGase II, we studied the activity of several retinoids that selectively bind to and activate specific RARs or RXRs. To confirm the activities of these retinoids in SPOC-1 cells, cells were transfected with DNA constructs containing a reporter gene, luciferase (LUC) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), under the control of either an βRARE or (CRBPII)-RXRE, respectively. The transactivation of the reporter gene was determined after treatment with different retinoid agonists. The RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84, which can bind to and activate all three RAR receptors(27Lehmann J.M. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Husmann M. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4804-4809PubMed Google Scholar), was able to induce βRARE-dependent transactivation of LUC about 27-fold at concentrations 10−9M through 10−7M (Fig. 3A). The RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 and the RARγ-selective retinoid CD437 caused a 19-fold increase in the transactivation of βRARE-tk-LUC. The RXR-selective retinoid SR11217 (10−7M), which binds to all three RXR receptors and induces the formation of RXR homodimers(28Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Ping L. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), only caused a 6-fold increase in reporter gene activity at 10−7M. This slight activation of βRARE-tk-LUC by SR11217 is consistent with the relatively low affinity of RXR homodimers for this response element(45Zhang X.-K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In contrast, this RXR-selective retinoid (10−7M) strongly increased RXRE-dependent CAT activity by about 19-fold, whereas only a 3-fold induction was observed after treatment with RA and SRI-6751-84 at the same concentration (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Transactivation of βRARE-tk-LUC and RXRE-tk-CAT by RA and RAR- and RXR-selective retinoids, SRI-6751-84 (RAR Sel.) and SRI-11217 (RXR Sel.). SPOC-1 cells transfected with βRARE-tk-LUC (A) and RXRE-tk-CAT (B) were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or different retinoids at the concentrations indicated. After 48 h of treatment, LUC or CAT activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”β-Actin-CAT or β-actin-LUC was included in all transfections to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency.

Confluent cultures of SPOC-1 cells were treated for 4 days with these retinoids at different concentrations, and TGase II was examined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the RAR-selective retinoid stimulated TGase II at concentrations greater than 10−9M. SRI-6751-84 was about 100 times more potent than RA (compare row 1 in Fig. 4 with row 2 in Fig. 1A). In contrast, the RXR-selective retinoid did not cause any increase in the levels of TGase II protein (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that activation of RXRs is not sufficient for the induction of TGase II. The RARα-selective retinoid Ro40-6055 was just as effective in stimulating TGase II expression as RA, whereas the RARγ-selective retinoid was unable to induce TGase II (Fig. 4). These results suggest an important role for RARα but not RARγ in the regulation of TGase II expression.Figure 4Induction of TGase II protein by retinoid receptor-selective ligands in SPOC-1 cells. Confluent cultures were treated with SRI-6751-84 (RAR sel.), Ro40-6055 (RAR-α sel.), CD437 (RAR-γ sel.), or SRI-11217 (RXR sel.) at the indicated concentrations for 4 days, cells were then collected and analyzed for the presence of TGase II protein by immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The increase in TGase II protein levels by retinoids was related to increased levels of the corresponding mRNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that treatment with the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 increased the level of TGase II mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The EC50 for this stimulation was about 1-2 × 10−9M, which is similar to that for the effect of SRI-6751-84 on TGase II protein levels (compare row 1 in Fig. 4 with Fig. 5). However, treatment of SPOC-1 cells with the RXR-selective retinoid SR11217 failed to enhance TGase II mRNA (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the observations obtained from the immunoblot analysis (compare row 4 in Fig. 4 with Fig. 5).Figure 5Dose-dependent induction of TGase II mRNA expression by receptor-selective retinoids in SPOC-1 cells. Confluent cells were treated with the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 and the RXR-selective retinoid SRI-11217 at the concentrations indicated. After 4 days of treatment, total RNA was isolated, fractionated on 1.0% agarose gel (30 μg/lane), and then transferred to a Hybond membrane. The membrane was successively probed with cDNAs for TGase II and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the RXR-selective retinoid influences the induction of TGase II by the RAR-selective retinoid, confluent cultures were treated with a suboptimal concentration of SRI-6751-84 (10−9M) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the RXR-selective retinoid SR11217 for 4 days and then analyzed for TGase II protein. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the RXR-selective retinoid had no effect on the induction of TGase II expression by the RAR-selective retinoid (data not shown).Effect of an RARα Antagonist on Retinoid-induced TGase II ExpressionTo analyze further the signaling pathway involved in the induction of TGase II by retinoids, the action of the RARα antagonist Ro41-5253 was examined. We first determined the effect of Ro41-5253 on the transactivation of βRARE-tk-LUC. As shown in Fig. 6A, the antagonist was able to inhibit the RARE-dependent transactivation by the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 in SPOC-1 cells. We next examined the action of the antagonist on the induction of TGase II. Confluent cultures were treated simultaneously with a suboptimal concentration (10−9M) of SRI-6751-84 and increasing concentrations of the RARα antagonist. After 4 days of treatment, the cells were collected and analyzed for TGase II expression. As shown in Fig. 6B, increasing concentrations of Ro41-5253 inhibited the induction of TGase II by SRI-6751-84. At 10−6M, Ro41-5253 was able to completely block the induction of TGase II by SRI-6751-84. Ro41-5253 has about a 30-fold lower binding affinity for RARα than SRI-6751-84, which may be responsible for the 1000-fold higher concentration required to inhibit TGase II induction. Treatment of SPOC-1 cells with the antagonist alone had no effect on the level of TGase II.Figure 6Effect of the RARα-selective antagonist Ro41-5253 on the transactivation of βRARE-tk-LUC and the regulation of TGase II. A, SPOC-1 cells transfected with βRARE-tk-LUC were treated with a 10−9M concentration of the RAR-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 (RAR Sel.) and 2 × 10−6M Ro41-5253 (Antag.) in the combinations indicated. After 48 h of treatment, cells were collected and the relative LUC activity was determined. B, confluent cells were treated with the RAR-selective ligand (RAR Sel.) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ro41-5253 (RAR-α antag.). After 4 days of treatment, total cellular protein was isolated and examined for TGase II expression by immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Dominant-negative RARα403 on TGase II InductionThe observations with the RAR-selective retinoids and the RARα-antagonist suggested that a specific RA signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of TGase II gene expression in SPOC-1 cells. To further test this hypothesis, the effect of the truncated RARα gene, RARα403, on the action of retinoids in SPOC-1 cells was examined. In the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, the LRARα403SN exhibits dominant-negative activity and inhibits RA-induced differentiation(25Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To determine whether this construct has dominant-negative activity in SPOC-1 cells, we infected these cells with the amphotropic retroviral vector LXSN (control vector) carrying the neomycin resistance gene and with LRARα403SN, which contains the truncated RARα cDNA RARα403. Subsequently, neomycin-resistant cells were isolated and examined for expression of RARα403. Northern blot analysis using poly(A)+ RNA showed that the LRARα403SN-infected SPOC-1 cells expressed high levels of the 4.7-kilobase retroviral transcript containing the RARα403 mRNA"

https://openalex.org/W2076860175,"The well documented association between high plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and cardiovascular disease might be mediated by the lysine binding of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), the plasminogen-like, multikringle glycoprotein in Lp(a). We employed a mutational analysis to localize the lysine-binding domains within human apo(a). Recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) with 17 plasminogen kringle IV-like domains, one plasminogen kringle V-like domain, and a protease domain or mutants thereof were expressed in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. The lysine binding of plasma Lp(a) and r-apo(a) in the culture supernatants of transfected HepG2 cells was analyzed by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Wild type recombinant Lp(a) (r-Lp(a)) revealed lysine binding in the range observed for human plasma Lp(a). A single accessible lysine binding site in Lp(a) is indicated by a complete loss of lysine binding observed for r-Lp(a) species that contain either a truncated r-apo(a) lacking kringle IV-37, kringle V, and the protease or a point-mutated r-apo(a) with a Trp-4174 → Arg substitution in the putative lysine-binding pocket of kringle IV-37. Evidence is also presented for additional lysine-binding sites within kringles 32-36 of apo(a) that are masked in Lp(a) as indicated by an increased lysine binding for the point mutant (Cys-4057 → Ser), which is unable to assemble into particles. An important role of these lysine-binding site(s) for Lp(a) assembly is suggested by a decreased assembly efficiency for deletion mutants lacking either kringle 32 or kringles 32-35. The well documented association between high plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and cardiovascular disease might be mediated by the lysine binding of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), the plasminogen-like, multikringle glycoprotein in Lp(a).

Recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) with 17 plasminogen kringle IV-like domains, one plasminogen kringle V-like domain, and a protease domain or mutants thereof were expressed in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2. The lysine binding of plasma Lp(a) and r-apo(a) in the culture supernatants of transfected HepG2 cells was analyzed by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Wild type recombinant Lp(a) (r-Lp(a)) revealed lysine binding in the range observed for human plasma Lp(a). A single accessible lysine binding site in Lp(a) is indicated by a complete loss of lysine binding observed for r-Lp(a) species that contain either a truncated r-apo(a) lacking kringle IV-37, kringle V, and the protease or a point-mutated r-apo(a) with a Trp-4174 → Arg substitution in the putative lysine-binding pocket of kringle IV-37. Evidence is also presented for additional lysine-binding sites within kringles 32-36 of apo(a) that are masked in Lp(a) as indicated by an increased lysine binding for the point mutant (Cys-4057 → Ser), which is unable to assemble into particles. An important role of these lysine-binding site(s) for Lp(a) assembly is suggested by a decreased assembly efficiency for deletion mutants lacking either kringle 32 or kringles 32-35.

There is increasing evidence, however, that Lp(a) may be involved in atherogenesis. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between high Lp(a) plasma concentrations and cardiovascular disease(5Armstrong V.W. Cremer P. Eberle E. Manke A. Schulze F. Wieland H.

The discovery of a striking homology between apo(a) and plasminogen (Pg) (16Kratzin H. Armstrong V.W. Niehaus M. Hilschmann N. Seidel D. Biol. Chem.

Nature. 1987; 330: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The fibrinolytic proenzyme Pg consists of a preactivation peptide, five so-called “kringle” domains, numbered I-V, and a protease domain (reviewed in (19Castellino F.J. Urano T. deSerrano V.S. Beals J.M. Scanu A.M. Lipoprotein(a). Academic Press, San Diego1990: 87-101Google Scholar)). Several functions of Pg appear to be enhanced by its kringle structures. Lysine-binding sites (LBSs) within Pg kringles mediate the binding of Pg to fibrin(ogen)(20Thorsen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 393: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Lucas M.A. Fretto L.J. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4249-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fleury V.

Kringles I and IV contain binding sites with moderate to high affinity for L-lysine and related ω-amino acid analogs(23Lerch P. Rickli P. Lergier W. Gillessen D. Eur. J.

The three-dimensional structure of Pg kringle IV and its complex with the lysine analog ε-amino-caproic acid (EACA) has been determined by high resolution x-ray crystallography (27Mulichak A.M.

Kringle IV of Pg has been shown to bind fibrinogen(29Rejante M. Elliott B.W. Llinás M. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 87-92Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Apo(a) contains 10 distinct kringle repeats arranged in tandem all with high homology (61-75%) to kringle IV of Pg followed by single Pg-like kringle V and protease domains(17McLean J.W.

As a result of an extensive size polymorphism in the apo(a) gene(1Utermann G. Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 30Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol.

Knowledge of the structural basis for the lysine- and fibrin(ogen)-binding of Lp(a) is paramount to our understanding of the role of this lipoprotein in fibrinolysis. A sequence comparison between human and rhesus monkey Lp(a), which differ in their lysine binding abilities led Scanu et al.(44Scanu A.M. Miles L.A. Fless G.M. Pfaffinger D. Eisenbart J. Jackson E.

Based on sequence comparisons and molecular modeling (45Guevara Jr., J. Knapp R.D. Honda S. Northup S.R. Morrisett J.D. Proteins. 1992; 12: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 46Guevara Jr., J. Jan A.Y. Knapp R. Tulinsky A. Morrisett J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 758-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it has been predicted that not only kringle 37, containing the most highly conserved lysine-binding pocket relative to Pg kringle IV, but also kringles 32-35 comprise potential lysine-binding domains. Single apo(a) domains expressed in bacteria (47Li Z. Gambino R. Fless G.M. Copeland R.A. Halfpenny A.J. Scanu A.M.

Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed lysine binding activity in kringle 37 but not in kringles 1 and 2. Direct experimental evidence for the localization of LBSs in apo(a) and Lp(a) is still lacking. We now describe a mutational analysis aimed at the identification of lysine-binding domains in recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)). Lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography was employed to compare the lysine binding activity of wild type and mutant r-apo(a)/r-Lp(a) in the medium of transfected HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. In addition, we performed immunoblotting experiments with wild type and mutant r-apo(a) samples to assess a possible function of lysine-binding kringles in apo(a) for the assembly of apo(a)•apoB complexes. The construction of plasmids pCMV-A18 (Fig. 1a), pCMV-A18 Δ32-P (Fig. 1e), and pCMV-A18_4057Ser (Fig. 1g) has been previously described(2Brunner C. Kraft H.-G. Utermann G. Müller H.-J. Proc. Natl.

Phagemid papoa3-7 contains an apo(a) cDNA fragment from nucleotide 12410 to 13062 (17McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 300: 132-137Crossref Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) encoding kringle domains 37 and V. Based on the method of Kunkel(50Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), single-stranded template DNA from papoa3-7, oligonucleotide 1, and the U-DNA mutagenesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim) were employed to change codon 4174 in kringle 37 from TGG(Trp) to AGG(Arg) and to introduce by silent mutations a BsmI restriction site in order to facilitate the identification of mutant plasmids. Following sequence verification of the apo(a) cDNA insert in the mutated phagemid papoa3-7_4174Arg, a 448-base pair Cfr10I/EcoRV fragment in the apo(a) expression plasmid pCMV-A18 (2Brunner C.

The resulting plasmid was designated pCMV-A18_4174Arg (Fig. 1f). Standard cloning techniques (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were employed to introduce deletions at the 3′ end of the apo(a) cDNA in pCMV-A18 by replacement of restriction fragments with synthetic linkers. A 700-base pair AvrII/SalI fragment of pCMV-A18 was replaced with the annealed oligonucleotides 2 and 3 to obtain plasmid pCMV-A18 ΔV-P encoding an apo(a) glycoprotein lacking kringle V and the protease domain (Fig. 1b). Substitution of a BsmAI/SalI fragment in pCMV-A18 by the annealed oligonucleotides 4 and 5 gave rise to the mutant plasmid pCMV-A18 Δ37-P with a deletion of 3′ apo(a) sequences encoding kringle 37, kringle V, and the protease (Fig. 1c). A deletion of 3′ sequences encoding kringle 36, kringle 37, kringle V, and the protease in pCMV-A18 Δ36-P (Fig. 1d) was achieved by cloning of the annealed oligonucleotides 6/7 into NciI/SalI-restricted pCMV-A18. SmaI restriction of pCMV-A18 and subsequent religation of the large vector fragment resulted in the deletion mutant pCMV-A18 Δ32 (Fig. 1h) lacking kringle 32 sequences as compared with the wild type plasmid. Another deletion mutant characterized by the absence of kringle repeats 32-35 was obtained by PCR mutagenesis. Plasmids containing nucleotides 10050-10900 and nucleotides 11330-13062 of the apo(a) cDNA (17McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M.

Following ligation of the two purified fragments by a second PCR with primers 8/11 a 1.25-kilobase fragment obtained by ClaI/AvrII restriction of the PCR ligation was cloned into pCMV-A18. The resulting mutant plasmid pCMV-A18 Δ32-35 was identified by a new EarI restriction site in kringle 36 (Fig. 1i). Synthetic linker sequences and PCR-derived sequences were verified by sequencing. DNA sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (52Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sixty to sixty-five h after transfection, cell culture supernatants were harvested, adjusted to 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged for 10 min each at 300 and 4000 × g to remove cells and cell debris, respectively. Sheep anti-human Lp(a) antiserum (Immuno AG, Heidelberg, FRG), monoclonal antibody 1A2 (55Kraft H.G. Dieplinger H. Hoye E. Utermann G.

Plates were washed three times each with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.05% Tween-20 (Merck) between the different incubation steps. MaxiSorb microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, FRG) were coated with sheep anti-human Lp(a) diluted 1:2000 in PBS, 0.02% sodium azide (200 μl/well) overnight at 4°C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS, 0.1% casein (300 μl/well) for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of samples and standards (200 μl/well) for 2 h at 37°C. Standard dilutions in PBS, 0.1% casein ranged from 15 to 1000 ng/ml. Immunodetection of bound apo(a)•Lp(a) was obtained by successive incubations with 200 μl/well of 1) antibody 1A2, diluted to 5 μg/ml in PBS, 0.1% casein (2 h at 37°C); 2) anti-mouse Ig (Fab′)-peroxidase conjugate, diluted 1:350 in 50 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5 (1 h at 37°C); and 3) 2,2′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid] substrate solution (Boehringer Mannheim). After 30 min of color development absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The data are expressed in ng/ml Lp(a) as deduced from a standard curve obtained with Lp(a) reference standard (Immuno AG, Heidelberg, FRG). Fractionation of cell culture supernatants by reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent immunoblotting was performed as described previously (2Brunner C. Kraft H.-G. Utermann G. Müller H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) employing apo(a)-specific antibody 1A2 (55Kraft H.G. Dieplinger H. Hoye E. Utermann G. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 212-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the enhanced chemiluminiscence Western blot detection kit (Amersham Buchler GmbH, Braunschweig, FRG). The relative intensities of the bands corresponding to apo(a) glycoprotein and apo(a)•apoB complex were determined by densitometry using a UVP E.A.S.Y. plus system (Herolab, Wiesloch, FRG). Venous blood samples from healthy donors were collected in heparinized tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g to remove cells. Following ELISA determination of Lp(a) plasma levels and prior to lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography, the integrity of plasma apo(a)s was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 2 ml of hydrated lysine-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG) was filled into a conical 0.8 × 4 cm polypropylene column (Poly-Prep, Bio-Rad). Chromatography was performed at a constant flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Following equilibration of the matrix with 30 ml of washing buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) 1-ml fractions were collected during all subsequent steps. Lp(a)/apo(a)containing samples (1 ml) were loaded onto the column either directly (culture supernatants of transfected HepG2 cells) or after a 10-fold dilution in HepG2 conditioned culture medium (human plasma samples). Unbound material was eluted from the column with 15 ml of washing buffer. Elution of lysine-bound material was achieved by subsequent application of 10 ml of washing buffer containing 50 mM of the lysine analog ε-amino caproic acid (EACA, Sigma). Lysine-binding chromatography was performed in the presence and in the absence of the nonionic detergent Tween-20. In the latter case, 1% (v/v) Tween-20 (Merck AG, Darmstadt, FRG) was added to the samples and to both washing and elution buffer. The amount of r-Lp(a)/r-apo(a) in each fraction was determined by ELISA. Lp(a)/apo(a) values were plotted against fraction numbers. For each sample, the percentage of lysine-binding Lp(a)/apo(a) was calculated as the amount of Lp(a)/apo(a) measured in fractions 16-25 (× 100) divided by the total amount of Lp(a)/apo(a) in fractions 1-25. Each wild type and mutant r-apo(a) plasmid was transfected at least three times. As measured by ELISA, the expression levels varied in the range between 300 ng/ml and 6.6 μg/ml. Following each series of transient transfections into HepG2 cells, r-apo(a)s were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting to determine the amounts of apoB-complexed and free apo(a) glycoprotein in the medium of the transfected cells. Wild type r-apo(a) (A18), as well as the mutants ΔV-P, Δ37-P, and Arg-4174 were present primarily in the form of the apo(a)•apoB complex (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5). Mutants Δ32-P and Δ36-P both lacking kringle 36, which mediates the covalent binding of apo(a) to apoB(2Brunner C. Kraft H.-G. Utermann G. Müller H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Characterization of the deletion mutants Δ32-P, Δ37-P, and ΔV-P by reducing SDS-PAGE revealed the expected decrease in their apparent molecular weights (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 3, and 4) as compared with the 18-kringle wild type and point mutants (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 5, and 6). In a first series of experiments, we compared the lysine binding of r-Lp(a)-like particles produced by HepG2 cells upon transfection with the wild type apo(a) plasmid pCMV-A18 (Fig. 1a) to the lysine binding of plasma-derived Lp(a). Based on a previous finding ( 2M. Helmhold and V. W. Armstrong, unpublished observations. )of an increased binding of plasma Lp(a) to lysine-Sepharose upon addition of the nonionic detergent Tween-20, lysine binding activities were determined both in the absence and in the presence of 1% Tween-20. HepG2-derived wild type r-Lp(a) obtained after three independent transfections revealed lysine binding of 30.6 and 92.2%, respectively, when analyzed in the absence and in the presence of Tween (Fig. 3, panels A and G, Table 1). Binding of r-Lp(a) to the lysine-Sepharose matrix could be completely blocked by the addition of 50 mML-lysine to sample and washing buffer, an effect that was not seen by using L-glycine at the same concentration (data not shown). Additional evidence for the specificity of the employed lysine-Sepharose method came from the estimation of HepG2-derived albumin and apolipoprotein A-I in the chromatography fractions. In contrast to r-Lp(a), both proteins were detected exclusively in the fall-through but not in the EACA-eluted fractions (data not shown). SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and densitometric scanning of the r-apo(a) bands were emplo"

In the stomach, gastrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-α all mediate gastric mucosal homeostasis by promoting cell renewal. We have previously shown that EGF and phorbol esters stimulate the human gastrin promoter through a novel GC-rich DNA element 5′-−68GGGGCGGGGTGGGGGG−53 called gERE (gastrin EGF response element). In this report, we show that three factors bind to this element, the transcription factor Sp1 and two fast migrating complexes designated gastrin EGF response proteins (gERP 1 and 2). To understand how these factors bind and confer EGF responsiveness, mutations of gERE were tested in vitro for protein binding and in vivo for promoter activation. Both gel shift assays and UV cross-linking studies revealed that the factors bind to overlapping domains, Sp1 to the 5′ half-site and gERP 1 and 2 to the 3′ half-site. Placing either the 5′ or 3′ mutations upstream of a minimal gastrin promoter abolished EGF induction. Therefore both the 5′ and 3′ domains were required to confer EGF induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that complex interactions between Sp1 and other factors binding to overlapping gERE half-sites confer EGF responsiveness to the gastrin promoter."

Recent studies have suggested that expression of K+ channel genes may be regulated by stimuli that affect electrical activity. Elevating the concentration of extracellular KCl causes membrane depolarization and, thus, is widely used for studying electrical activity-dependent changes in neurons, muscle, and endocrine cells. Here we show that elevated KCl decreases Kv1.5 K+ channel mRNA expression in clonal pituitary cells without affecting Kv1.4 and Kv2.1 mRNA levels. K+ channel blockers, which cause depolarization, also produce down-regulation of Kv1.5 mRNA, while NaCl addition had no effect. Thus, the effect of KCl is mediated by K+-induced membrane depolarization. Unlike many known effects of K+, down-regulation of Kv1.5 mRNA does not require Ca2+ or Na+ influx, or Na+-H+ exchange. Furthermore, the decrease in Kv1.5 mRNA expression is due to inhibition of channel gene transcription and persists after inhibition of protein synthesis, excluding a role for induction of intermediary regulatory proteins. Finally, immunoblots with antibody specific for the Kv1.5 polypeptide show that depolarization for 8 h reduces the expression of Kv1.5 channel protein.

To examine whether a strict relationship between the structure of Nod factors secreted by bacteria and their host plant range exists for all symbiotic associations, we examined the Nod factors from two different bacterial species that nodulate the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). One species is Rhizobium tropici, from which the Nod factor structure has been described earlier(20Poupot R. Martinez-Romero E. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The species that will be dealt with in the present paper is Rhizobium etli. R. etli(21Segovia L. Young J.P.W. Martinez-Romero E. Int. J. Syst.

However, the geographical origin and breadth of the host range of these two species are different. The former, isolated from Mexican soils, seems to have a narrow host range (21Segovia L. Young J.P.W. Martinez-Romero E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The latter, which originated in South America, has a broad specificity as it nodulates several tropical legumes and some trees (e.g.Leucaena)(22Martinez-Romero E. Segovia L. Mercante F.M. Franco A.A.

In this paper we show that Nod factors from R. etli do not share identical structures with those described for R. tropici and represent a new type of Nod factor.

The aqueous solution was collected after 8 h and replaced by 50 ml of sterile water. This operation was repeated 5 times. The pooled aqueous exudates were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol. 50 μl, 200 μl, or 1 ml of this solution were tested for its ability to induce Nod factors synthesis in 50 ml of R. etli radiolabeled cultures. The experimental protocols for labeling Nod factors using [35S]sulfate or [14C]acetate were identical to those already described for R. tropici(20Poupot R. Martinez-Romero E. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 4 liters of culture medium were extracted twice, first with 1 liter and then with 500 ml of butanol. The butanol extract was vacuum evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water and purified by HPLC on a semi-preparative C18 reversed-phase column (250 × 7.5 mm, Spherisorb ODS2, 5 μm, ColoChrom), using a water/acetonitrile gradient. Detection was done by UV absorbance at 220 nm.

The matrix was a mixture of m-nitrobenzyl alcohol/glycerol (1:1, v/v) spiked either with 1% trichloroacetic acid in water or with a solution of sodium iodide (1 mg/ml). The location of double bond of fatty acid was determined by remote charge fragmentation of the carboxylate anions as described (25Promé J.-C. Aurelle H. Couderc F. Savagnac A. Rapid Commun.

Carbohydrate determination was carried out after complete hydrolysis using 3 N HCl (3 h at 80°C) followed by extraction with diethyl ether to remove the fatty acids. Sugars from the aqueous phase were derivatized as alditol acetates and analyzed by capillary GC-MS. Alternatively, 2butyl glycosides of individual sugars were prepared using 3 N HCl in (±)-2-butanol or (-)-2-butanol (3 h at 60°C). These glycosides were further acetylated (acetic anhydride/pyridine mixture (1:1, v/v), 3 h at 40°C) and analyzed by capillary GC.

After acidification with acetic acid, the evaporated residue was dissolved in 1 ml of water and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. After washing with water, deacetylated NodRe factors were eluted with methanol. Fatty acids extracted from the acid hydrolysis were either methylated by diazomethane and analyzed by GC or derivatized as pentafluorobenzyl esters for negative ion GC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Fatty acids (100 μg) were dissolved into 60 μl of a mixture of dry methanol and acetonitrile (1:5, v/v) followed by the addition of 2 μl of pentafluorobenzyl bromide and 2 μl of diisopropylethylamine. After 1 h at room temperature, reagents were removed by evaporation. The pentafluorobenzyl esters were dissolved in cyclohexane for GC-MS analysis (see “Analytical Methods”) (25Promé J.-C. Aurelle H. Couderc F. Savagnac A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1987; 1: 50-52Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). R. etli (CFN 42) and the same strain cured of the symbiotic plasmid (CFN 2001) were grown in the presence or absence of naringenin with the addition of sodium [14C]acetate or sodium [35S]sulfate to the medium. Lipophilic compounds were extracted on C18 reversed-phase material, eluted with methanol, and analyzed by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography. Autoradiography showed that a spot at RF = 0.53 was detected only in the lane corresponding to an induced culture of CFN 42 after sodium [14C]acetate labeling. When treated with chitinase, this compound disappeared and a new spot was observed at RF = 0.42, thus suggesting that the compound has a chitooligomeric backbone. Thus, the compound with a RF of 0.53 possesses the characteristics of Nod factors: a chitooligomeric structure whose biosynthesis is dependent on the presence of nod genes and flavonoid induction. 4 liters of sterile medium from naringenin-induced culture were extracted with butanol. The butanol extract was fractionated by HPLC using two consecutive purifications, first on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC semi-preparative column and then on an analytical column; Nod factors gave a double HPLC peak (Fig. 1). About 1.0 mg of NodRe factors was purified from a 4-liter culture. Exudates of bean seeds in ethanol were used to induce a 50-ml culture of R. etli after 14C and 35S radiolabeling. Reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography analysis showed the same result as with induction with naringenin: a compound with a Rf of 0.53, labeled only by growing the bacteria in the presence of sodium [14C]acetate. Using a 4-liter culture induced with bean seed exudates, the same molecules in the same proportions were isolated as for the naringenin-induced culture. After complete acid hydrolysis with 3 N HCl for 3 h at 80°C, N-acetylglucosamine, N-methylglucosamine, and fucose were detected as water-soluble compounds. GC analysis of the peracetylated(-)-2-butyl glycosides (27Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 1-7Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar) assigned N-acetylglucosamine and N-methylglucosamine to the D series, whereas fucose was assigned to the L series. A single fatty acid was liberated by acid hydrolysis that was identified as cis-vaccenic acid both by studying the decomposition of its carboxylate anion by tandem mass spectrometry (25Promé J.-C. Aurelle H. Couderc F. Savagnac A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1987; 1: 50-52Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and by comparison of the GC retention time of its methyl ester with an authentic standard. In the positive ion mode, the Nod factor-containing fraction exhibited two (M+H)+ ions at m/z 1458 and 1501. Cationization with the sodium ion resulted in two (M+Na)+ ions at m/z 1480 and 1523, respectively (Fig. 2A). Metastable ion spectrum from the (M+H)+ ion at m/z 1458 (Fig. 2B) showed the clear fragmentation of the N-acetylglucosamine backbone giving a series of peaks separated by 203 mass units. The highest peak of this series at m/z 1049 was 409 mass units below the (M+H)+ ion. The decomposition of m/z 1501 showed a corresponding series of fragment ions shifted up 43 mass units. When NodRe factors were treated with 0.5 N sodium methanolate prior to analysis, the fast atom bombardment-mass spectrum in the positive ion mode showed (M+H)+ ions at m/z 1416 and 1459. However, all fragmentations remained unchanged. Thus an acetate group was present near the reducing end. The mass difference between the first fragment ions (m/z 1049 or 1092) and the (M+H)+ ions corresponded to the loss of both L-fucose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The fragmentation series ended at m/z 440 (or m/z 483), which was attributed to oxenium ions from the first sugar residue at the non-reducing end. m/z 440 was attributed to a N-methyl-N-vaccenoyl-D-glucosamine (20Poupot R. Martinez-Romero E. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). m/z 483, which was 43 mass units higher, indicated the presence of an additional carbamoyl substitution. Thus, NodRe factors are a mixture of carbamoylated and non-carbamoylated molecules, the former representing one-quarter to one-third of the total molecules. All NodRe factors bore a L-fucose residue linked to the terminal reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine together with an additional O-acetyl group. Permethylation studies of NodRe factors were performed in order to confirm the oligochitin core and to precisely locate the L-fucose residue. NaBD4 reduction followed by permethylation produced a single compound with a molecular mass of 1684 Da as determined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). This result indicated that the acetyl and carbamoyl (28Isono K. Suzuki S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1968; 9: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) groups had been lost during the chemical process and that all the hydroxyl and amide groups had been methylated. The partially methylated monosaccharides were reduced with NaBH4 and peracetylated. The partially methylated alditol acetates were then analyzed by GC-MS. Four compounds were identified: 1,5-di-O-acetyl-3,4,6-tri-O-methyl-N-acetyl-N-methylglucosaminitol derived from the glucosamine residue at the non-reducing end of the molecules; 1,4,5-tri-O-acetyl-3,6-di-O-methyl-N-acetyl-N-methylglucosaminitol arising from the three internal residues; 4,6-di-O-acetyl-1,3,5-tri-O-methyl-N-acetyl-N-methylglucosaminitol produced from the reducing glucosaminyl residue; and 1,5-di-O-acetyl 2,3,4-tri-O-methylfucositol provided by the L-fucose residue. Therefore, this study confirmed the (1→4) glycosidic linkages between the five N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues of the NodRe factors and indicated a (1→6) glycosidic linkage between the L-fucose residue and the reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The two-dimensional proton homonuclear spectrum of NodRe factors was used both to locate the acetyl group and to indicate the anomeric configuration of the sugar linkages. The anomeric proton of the L-fucose residue showed a doublet at 5.05 ppm with a coupling constant of 3.7 Hz with the H-2 proton of the cycle. These data were consistent with an α-linked L-fucose(12Carlson R.W. Sanjuan J. Bhat U.R. Glushka J. Spaink H.P. Wijfjes A.H.M. van Brussel A.A.N. Stokkermans T.J.W. Peters N.K. Stacey G. J. Biol.

From this anomeric proton, a complete assignment of the L-fucosyl protons was obtained on the two-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 4). The cross-peak observed from H-1 enabled the location of the H-2 signal at 3.80 ppm. This proton showed a scalar connection with H-3 at 3.58 ppm (JH-2–H-3 = 9 Hz). Connectivity was also observed through H-3 and H-4 protons (JH-3–H-4 = 3.9 Hz), thereby locating the resonance of H-4 at 4.75 ppm. This downfield signal (more than 1 ppm over the expected value for a non-substituted fucose residue) (12Carlson R.W. Sanjuan J. Bhat U.R. Glushka J. Spaink H.P. Wijfjes A.H.M. van Brussel A.A.N. Stokkermans T.J.W. Peters N.K. Stacey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18372-18381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enabled the acetate group to be located on the O-4 of the α-L-fucose residue. Because of the low coupling constants JH-4–H-5 in the L-fucose residue (0.8-0.9 Hz)(29Altona C. Haasnoot C.A.G. Org. Magn. Reson. 1980; 13: 417-429Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the resulting low amplitude connectivity peak could not be seen on the spectrum(12Carlson R.W. Sanjuan J. Bhat U.R. Glushka J. Spaink H.P. Wijfjes A.H.M. van Brussel A.A.N. Stokkermans T.J.W. Peters N.K. Stacey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18372-18381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yu R.K. Koerner T.A.W. Scarsdale J.N. Prestegard J.H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1986; 42: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The three 6-deoxymethyl protons (δH-6 = 0.95 ppm) correlated with the H-5 at 4.05 ppm. For the D-glucosamine residues, α (JH-1–H-2 = 3.5 Hz at the reducing end) and β (JH-1–H-2 = 9 Hz) anomeric configurations were characterized. Other signals, classically described for the NMR spectra of nodulation factors, were also identified (upfield signals not shown). The wild type strain (CFN 42) of R. etli produced enough Nod factors to enable structural studies without the need of amplifying the Nod factors production by genetic engineering. The structural characteristics of the R. etli nodulation factors are as follows: (i) they have a chitopentameric core; (ii) a 4-O-acetyl-α-L-fucose residue is linked to carbon 6 of the reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl unit; (iii) the glucosaminyl residue at the non-reducing end of the molecules is N-methyl-N-vaccenoyl substituted; and (iv) one-quarter to one-third of these symbiotic signals is O-carbamoylated at their non-reducing end. According to the nomenclature proposed by Roche and co-workers(31Roche P. Debellé F. Maillet F. Lerouge P. Faucher C. Truchet G. Dénarié J. Promé J.-C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1131-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we name these factors NodRe-V (Me, Ac-Fuc) and NodRe-V (Carb, Me, Ac-Fuc), respectively (Fig. 5A). The structure of NodRe factors represents a new variation on the Nod factors structure. L-Fucose, as a substituent of chitooligomers, has been previously found as a minor component of Nod factors from Rhizobium fredii(8Bec-Ferté M.-P. Krishnan H.B. Promé D. Savagnac A. Pueppke S.G. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11782-11788Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Bradyrhizobium elkanii(16Stokkermans T.J.W. Peters N.K. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, none of these structures bears an additional acetyl group on L-fucose. An L-fucose ring with an acetyl group on O-4 has been found in Rhizobium NGR234, but an O-methyl group was also present on fucosyl O-2(19Price N.P.J. Relic B. Talmont F. Lewin A. Promé D. Pueppke S.G. Maillet F. Dénarié J. Promé J.-C. Broughton W.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3575-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Carbamoyl and N-methyl groups on the non-reducing end are more common because they have been found in Rhizobium NGR234(19Price N.P.J. Relic B. Talmont F. Lewin A. Promé D. Pueppke S.G. Maillet F.

Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The precise location of the carbamoyl group needs a sufficient amount of material to perform heteronuclear 1H-13C bidimensional NMR. When we tried to cultivate R. etli on a larger scale (20 liters) to purify enough NodRe factors for this analysis, we found that the proportion of carbamoylated molecules was lower than in the first experiments, and thus the position of the carbamoyl group could not be reliably assigned. Common bean is also nodulated by R. tropici, a bacterium with a broader host range than R. etli. When comparing Nod factors from both bacteria, no common substituents can be found as NodRt factors are non-fucosylated, non-carbamoylated molecules (20Poupot R. Martinez-Romero E. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Instead, part of them possesses a sulfate group on O-6 of the reducing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It has been found that these sulfated molecules are able to elicit root nodule organogenesis on bean at 10−5 to 10−8M(14Martinez E. Poupot R. Prom é J.-C. Pardo M.A. Segovia L. Truchet G. Dénari é J. Palacios R. Mora J. Newton W.E. New Horizons in Nitrogen Fixation. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1993: 171-175Google Scholar). Purified Nod factors from R. etli were also found to elicit root nodules on bean in the same concentration range as sulfate-containing NodRt factors. ( 2E. Martinez-Romero, personal communication. )When cultivating R. etli using bean extracts as nod gene inducers, no change in the NodRe factors pattern was found. In particular, no NodRe factors with a sulfate group could be detected by sodium [35S]sulfate labeling. It thus appears that bean is able to be nodulated by two rhizobial species that seem to produce Nod factors with structurally different substitutions. However, purified fractions of Nod factors from either R. tropici or R. etli seemed to be active on bean at concentrations higher than those used to induce nodules on alfalfa by NodRm factors, for example. It remains possible that some sulfated components, being under the detection level, still contaminate the fucosylated fractions from NodRe factors, that fucosylated molecules are present in R. tropici, or that very low proportions of another common component are present in all tested fractions. With reversed-phase HPLC, sulfated factors of R. tropici and acetylfucosylated factors of R. etli have very different retention volumes. Thus cross-contaminations with an identical component seemed unlikely. However, because reversed-phase HPLC separations are very sensitive to the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the analytes, it cannot be excluded that a minor structural variation having a weak effect on the activity (such as the acyl chain length) may induce a dramatic effect on the HPLC retention volumes and thus permit the elution of analogs of cross-contaminants in the different fractions. We are currently reinvestigating both strains to search for impurities that could be a common signal for bean nodulation. We thank M. A. Rogel for technical assistance and M. Bon and M. Vedrenne for recording NMR spectra. We are grateful to J. Cullimore for helpful reviewing of the manuscript."

The activity of GnT-V was increased 24 h after the addition of TGFβ and remained at high levels up to 72 h. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA levels of GnT-V were consistent with the increased activity. To further investigate the nature of the induction, mRNA stability and transcriptional activity were assayed. The enhancement of the GnT-V mRNA expression resulted from prolonged mRNA stability, not from increased transcription. Consequently, elevated mRNA levels were observed even 72 h after the addition of TGFβ.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 subtype stimulated the guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding to GL1, GL2, and Gq in the presence of similar concentrations of carbamylcholine. When m1 receptor, G protein, and phospholipase C-β were reconstituted in lipid vesicles, each subtype of Gq family G proteins mediated the activation of phospholipase C-β by carbamylcholine in the presence of either 1 μM GTPγS or 1 mM GTP. Phospholipase C-β stimulated the GTPase activity of GL1, GL2, and Gq in the presence of m1 receptor and carbamylcholine but did not stimulate the GTPase activity of Go. Protein kinase C phosphorylated m1 receptor and phospholipase C-β, but the phosphorylation did not significantly affect the ability of the m1 receptor to stimulate phospholipase C-β in the reconstitution system of purified proteins. The α subunits of Gq family G proteins, GL1α(G14α), GL2α(G11α), and Gqα were expressed with G protein β1 and γ2 subunits in insect cells using a baculovirus system. The trimeric forms of G proteins, GL1 (GL1αβγ), GL2 (GL2αβγ), and Gq (Gqαβγ), were solubilized by 1% sodium cholate and purified by sequential chromatography on three kinds of columns. GL1, GL2, and Gq activated phospholipase C-β purified from bovine brain in the presence of aluminum fluoride to the same extent. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 subtype stimulated the guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding to GL1, GL2, and Gq in the presence of similar concentrations of carbamylcholine.

Protein kinase C phosphorylated m1 receptor and phospholipase C-β, but the phosphorylation did not significantly affect the ability of the m1 receptor to stimulate phospholipase C-β in the reconstitution system of purified proteins. The Gq( 1Gq, Gqαβγ; GL1, GL1αβγ; GL2, GL2αβγ; Go, Goα(1)βγ.

The cDNA clones of Gqα and G11α were isolated from mouse brain library by Strathmann and Simon(2Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have identified bovine cDNA clones encoding Gq family α subunits designated GL1α and GL2α (3Nakamura F. Ogata K. Shiozaki K.

Human G83α and its mouse version G15α expressed in hematopoietic tissues have also been identified as members of the Gq family(4Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc.

Gq family α subunits are thought to activate phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. A mixture of Gq and G11 (Gq/G11) purified from bovine liver or a mixture of Gqα and G11α from bovine brain was reported to activate PLC-β in the presence of GTPγS (6Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) or aluminum fluoride(7Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In contrast to G11α and Gqα, the function of GL1α is as yet unknown. Whereas the G14α (GL1α) transiently expressed in COS-7 cells was reported to activate purified PLC-β1(8Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GL1α coexpressed with metabotropic glutamate receptors in Xenopus oocytes was found to inhibit the PLC activity in oocytes(9Nakamura K. Nukada T. Haga T. Sugiyama H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 35-41Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined whether purified GL1α stimulates or inhibits the activity of purified PLC-β. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) consist of five subtypes that are coupled to their effectors via G proteins. Among the five subtypes of mAChRs, m1, m3, and m5 subtypes activate PLC in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner, whereas m2 and m4 subtypes inhibit adenylate cyclase via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins(10Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; : 16-22PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bonner T.I. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 148-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Gq family G proteins are thought to mediate the former pathway. The mixture of Gq and G11 reconstituted in lipid vesicles with m1 mAChR was reported to bind GTPγS and subsequently activate PLC-β in an agonist-dependent manner(12Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that PLC-β stimulates the GTPase activity of Gq/G11 in the presence of m1 mAChR and carbamylcholine(13Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It has not been determined, however, if there are any quantitative differences between Gq and G11 regarding their interactions with m1 mAChR and PLC-β. Furthermore, it is not known if GL1α can also be activated by m1 mAChR or activate PLC-β1 or whether its GTPase is activated by PLC-β. It is difficult to isolate and characterize individual members of Gq family G proteins because of their limited expression in native tissues. Recently, the recombinant forms of Gqα, G11α, and G83α have been purified from Sf9 insect cells that coexpressed β2γ2 subunits (14Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9176-9180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have independently found that the coexpression of βγ subunits with Gq family α subunits in Sf9 insect cells facilitated the solubilization of the α-subunits and enabled us to purify the trimeric G proteins. Activation of PLC leads to the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the generation of the intracellular messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol(16Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol activates certain isotypes of protein kinase C(17Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar, 18Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar). Experiments in vivo have shown that the activation of protein kinase C leads to the inhibition of mAChR-mediated PLC activation(19El-Fakahany E.E. Alger B.E. Lai W.S. Pitler T.A. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Vicentini L.M. Di Virgilio F. Ambrosini A. Pozzan T. Meldolesi J. Biochem Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20356-20362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would provide the most straightforward explanation if protein kinase C phosphorylates the components in the pathway of PLC activation and attenuates its signal transduction. In fact, protein kinase C is reported to phosphorylate m1 mAChR (23Haga K. Haga T. Ichiyama A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and PLC-β1(24Ryu S.H.

The effect of phosphorylation by protein kinase C on m1 mAChR-mediated stimulation of PLC-β can now be examined in a reconstitution system using purified proteins. In the present studies, we have expressed and purified each subtype of the Gq family G proteins, GL1α, GL2α, and Gqα, and reconstituted them in lipid vesicles with m1 mAChR, PLC-β, or both. Each of the Gq family G proteins was found to be activated by m1 mAChR and to activate PLC-β with essentially the same efficiency. Protein kinase C phosphorylated m1 mAChR and PLC-β, but the activation of PLC-β by carbamylcholine was not affected by the phosphorylation. [35S]GTPγS and [3H]QNB were purchased from DuPont NEN, [3H]PIP2 was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., [32P]ATP was from Amersham International plc, and [32P]GTP was from the Hungarian Academy of Science. The cDNA encoding mouse Gqα subunit was kindly donated by Dr. M. I. Simon from the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena; Sf9 cells and recombinant baculoviruses containing cDNA encoding the human m1 and m2 mAChR were donated by Dr. E. M. Ross at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The baculovirus transfer vectors containing sequences for G protein α subunits (pVLGL1α, pVLGL2α, pVLGq, and pVLGo) were constructed as follows. The NcoI-SmaI fragment containing the entire GL1α coding region was excised from pGL1(3Nakamura F. Ogata K. Shiozaki K. Kameyama K. Ohara K. Haga T. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12676-12681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the NcoI site was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase to yield a blunt end and attached by an EcoRI linker prior to SmaI digestion. The fragment was inserted between the EcoRI and SmaI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392. The NaeI-EcoRI fragment, including the GL2α coding sequence, was excised from pGL7 (3Nakamura F. Ogata K. Shiozaki K. Kameyama K. Ohara K. Haga T. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12676-12681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated to the SmaI-EcoRI sites of pVL1393. The NotI-SspI fragment (1.2 kilobase pairs) was excised from the P3 plasmids containing the Gqα cDNA (2Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and was inserted between the NotI and SmaI sites of pVL1392. The NcoI-HincII fragment containing the entire coding sequence of bovine Goα1 that was excised from the clone pGoα3 was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, attached to an EcoRI linker, and inserted into the EcoRI site of pVL1392. We have constructed a transfer vector in which both coding regions of β and γ subunits were placed downstream of the polyhedrin promoters. A polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding sequence of bovine γ2 subunit (9Nakamura K. Nukada T. Haga T. Sugiyama H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 35-41Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Gautam N. Baetscher M. Aebersold R. Simon M.I. Science. 1989; 244: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was ligated to the SmaI-EcoRI sites of pVL1393 (pVL1393γ2). The 1.9 kilobase pair NaeI-VspI fragment containing a polyhedrin promoter, a coding sequence of the γ2 subunit, and a poly(A) signal sequence was excised from pVL1393γ2. The fragment was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to the EcoRV site of pVL1393. Among obtained vectors, the vector in which two promoters were arranged back-to back, named pVL3Rγ2, was selected for further construction. The coding sequence of bovine β1 subunit excised from pGβ4 (26Sugimoto K. Nukada T. Tanabe T. Takahashi H. Noda M. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Inayama S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was inserted between the SmaI and XbaI sites of pVL3Rγ2. Recombinant viruses were generated and isolated according to the standard procedures(27Summers, M. D., Smith, G.

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks containing 12 ml of IPL-41 medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum at 28°C. Cells were grown in 150 ml of the same medium supplemented with 0.1% pluronic F-68 with constant stirring at 60 rpm. Cells were usually seeded at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/ml in 150 ml of medium and allowed to multiply for 3-4 days up to 2.5-3 × 106 cells/ml. Grown cells were spun down and suspended in 5-7 ml of the same medium. To this cell suspension, 12-14 ml of α subunit recombinant virus (6 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) and 3-4 ml of β1γ2 recombinant virus (6 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) were added. After incubation for 1 h, the cell suspension was transferred into a spinner flask with 130 ml of the medium and cultured in an atmosphere of 50% O2/50% N2 for 65-72 h. Harvested cells were stored at −80°C until use. All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. The cells (2-3 × 109) from the six spinner flasks were resuspended in 280 ml of ice cold homogenization buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.002 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM benzamidine). Cells were homogenized with 10-15 strokes in a Potter-type homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were washed once in 280 ml of the homogenization buffer, resuspended in 200 ml of the homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% sodium cholate, and gently stirred for 2 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant fraction (210 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (50 ml) pre-equilibrated with the homogenization buffer containing 1% sodium cholate (Buffer A). The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a gradient consisting of 100 ml each of Buffer A and Buffer A supplemented by 500 mM NaCl. The α subunits, together with βγ subunits, were eluted between 120 and 200 mM NaCl. Aliquots of each column fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunostaining. The G protein-rich fractions (30 ml) were diluted 5-fold with Buffer B (20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors) and then applied to a heptylamine column (20 ml) that had been washed with 40 ml of buffer B supplemented with 0.2% sodium cholate. The column was eluted with a gradient consisting of 70 ml each of Buffer B supplemented with 0.2% sodium cholate and 200 mM NaCl and Buffer B containing 1.75% sodium cholate and 50 mM NaCl. The G protein trimers were eluted between 0.7 and 1.0% sodium cholate. The G protein-rich fractions were supplemented with 5 mM potassium phosphate and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (5 ml), which had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer C (20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.8% sodium cholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors and 5 mM potassium phosphate. The column was washed with Buffer C containing 5 mM potassium phosphate and eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer C and the Buffer C containing 150 mM potassium phosphate. βγ subunits were eluted at 5-25 mM potassium phosphate, and then the αβγ trimers were eluted between 50 and 75 mM potassium phosphate. Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) was purified from bovine brain by a method modified from those of Ryu et al.(29Ryu S.H. Cho K.S. Lee K.Y. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PLC assay was performed according to Smrcka et al.(7Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrate was provided as vesicles containing 2 μg of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), 20 μg of phosphatidylethanolamine, and 10 nCi of [3H]PIP2 in a Hepes buffer solution (43 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 5 μM GDP, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.06% sodium cholate in 50 μl, final volume). CaCl2 was supplemented to yield approximately 1 μM free Ca2+. Where necessary, 20 μM AlCl3 and 6 mM NaF were added as activators of G protein. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10-20 fmol of PLC-β and proceeded for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 600 μl of methanol/CHCl3 mixture (2:1, v/v), 200 μl of CHCl3, and 200 μl of 0.1 M HCl, followed by separation of the aqueous and lipid phases as described(7Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). [3H]IP3 in the aqueous phase was quantitated by a liquid scintillation counter. Recombinant mAChRs, m1 and m2 subtypes, were purified by a single-step affinity chromatography from Sf9 cells expressing human m1 or m2 subtypes(31Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of mAChRs and G proteins was performed as described previously(32Haga K. Uchiyama H. Haga T. Ichiyama A. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 286-294PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shiozaki K. Haga T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10634-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For PLC assay, m1 mAChR and G proteins (20-80 pmol) were reconstituted in a modified HEN buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, and 160 mM NaCl). Reconstituted vesicles (10-20 μl) were mixed with phospholipid vesicles (10 μl) and an assay buffer (final concentrations: 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 30 mM NaCl, 1 μM GDP, and 10 μM free Ca2+ in 20 μl, final volume). As mAChR ligands, carbamylcholine and atropine were also supplemented to be 1 mM or 10 μM, respectively. The assay was initiated by the addition of a mixture of GTPγS and PLC-β (final concentrations: 100 nM and 10 fmol/tube, respectively, in 10 μl, final volume). The reaction was performed for 0-15 min at 30°C. For [3H]QNB binding, the reconstituted vesicle containing mAChRs and G proteins (10 μl) was incubated with 1 nM QNB ([3H]QNB, 50-60 cpm/fmol) in the presence or absence of 10 μM atropine for 60 min at 30°C in HEN buffer (20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mM EGTA, and 160 mM NaCl in 500 μl, final volume). For the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, the same reconstituted vesicle (10-20 μl) was mixed with HEN buffer (80-90 μl) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, 20 mM MgCl2, and 50 nM GTPγS ([35S]GTPγS, 30-40 cpm/fmol), and either 1 mM carbamylcholine or 10 μM atropine. The mixtures were incubated for 0-15 min at 30°C and then diluted with chilled solution (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM MgCl2 in 0.5 ml, final volume) containing 0.1 mM GTP. Bound forms of [3H]QNB and [35S]GTPγS were assayed as described previously(32Haga K. Uchiyama H. Haga T. Ichiyama A. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 286-294PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shiozaki K. Haga T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10634-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specific activities of purified m1 and m2 receptors were estimated to be approximately 2 nmol/mg protein. Recoveries of m1 and m2 receptors in the reconstitution experiments were 5-16 and 10-20%, respectively. The specific activities of G proteins reconstituted with m1 receptors were estimated to be 1-2 nmol/mg protein, as assessed by [35S]GTPγS binding activity. The GTPase assay was performed according to Berstein et al.(13Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, reconstituted vesicles (10 μl) containing mAChR and G proteins were mixed with an assay mixture (final concentrations: 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM GDP, 1 μM [γ-32P]GTP (30-50 cpm/fmol), and either 1 mM carbamylcholine or 100 μM atropine in 30 μl, final volume). The reaction was initiated by addition of PLC-β (final concentration: 0-10 nM in 10 μl, final volume) and was proceeded at 30°C for 15 min. GTP hydrolysis was measured by charcoal precipitation(34Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was performed as described previously(23Haga K. Haga T. Ichiyama A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, reconstituted vesicles (180 μl) containing m1 mAChRs were supplemented with GL2 (20.8 pmol), PLC-β (1.5 pmol), and protein kinase C (a mixture of α, β, and γ subtypes in 2.6 pmol, final volume). Protein kinase C was purified as described previously(35Kitano T. Go M. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The vesicles were incubated with or without 100 μM ATP for 1 h at 30°C in Buffer D (20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM GTP, 1 μM GDP, 1 mM carbamylcholine, and 10 μM free Ca2+). The reaction mixture was passed through a small column of Sephadex G-50 (2 ml) to remove ATP. The PLC assay was initiated by addition of the void volume fraction from the Sephadex column (20 μl) to the mixture of substrate and ligands (final concentrations: 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM GDP, 1 mM GTP, 1 μM free Ca2+, and either 1 mM carbamylcholine or 10 μM atropine in 30 μl, final volume). The reaction was performed for 0-20 min at 30°C. To confirm incorporation of [32P]phosphates, the reconstituted vesicles were incubated with 12.5 μM [32P]ATP in Buffer D for 1 h at 30°C. An aliquot (20 μl) was directly subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and then Cerenkov counting of the receptor band. Phosphorylation of PLC-β and G protein α subunit was estimated from the density of the autoradiography. To detect the γ subunits of G proteins, Tricine-buffered SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed(36Schaegger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). G protein concentrations were determined by the protein-dye binding method(37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar). The amount of active G proteins may be less than that estimated by protein assay, because the maximum binding of [35S]GTPγS in the presence of carbamylcholine and m1 mAChR was only 10-20% of the amount of G proteins estimated from protein assay. Antiserum against the carboxyl terminus of GL2α was prepared as described previously(3Nakamura F. Ogata K. Shiozaki K. Kameyama K. Ohara K. Haga T. Nukada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12676-12681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Konica Immunostaining Kit or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was used as a substrate for peroxidase. Free Ca2+ concentration was estimated by a chelation calculation program(38van Heeswijk M.P.E. Geertsen J.A.M. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have expressed GL2α in Sf9 cells alone or simultaneously with the G protein β and γ subunits and have solubilized these proteins with 1% sodium cholate. Immunoblot analysis showed that the yield of solubilized GL2α was approximately 10 times higher when βγ subunits were coexpressed as compared with when α subunits were expressed alone (compare lanes1 and 2 in Fig. 1). The coexpression of βγ subunits also facilitated the solubilization of GL1α and Gqα (not shown). Endogenous proteins that react with anti-GL2 antibody, probably intrinsic Gqα or related proteins, were also found to be solubilized by the same procedure (lane 3 in Fig. 1). Some degradation of recombinant GL2α, particularly in the preparation expressed without βγ subunits, was detected. We have purified the trimeric form of G proteins from cells expressing GL1α, GL2α, or Gqα simultaneously with the βγ subunits. For comparison, recombinant Goα was also expressed in Sf9 cells and purified with βγ subunits using the same procedure. Fig. 2 shows Coomassie staining patterns following SDS-PAGE of the fractions in each purification step of recombinant GL2. The GL2α and β1 subunits were observed in the particulate fractions as bands of 42 and 36 kDa, respectively. Both GL2α and βγ subunits could be partially solubilized with a buffer solution containing 1% sodium cholate. The yield of solubilization was higher for βγ subunits compared with α subunits. The recombinant proteins were partially purified from the cholate extract using DEAE-Sephacel and heptylamine-Sepharose column chromatography. A hydroxylapatite column was used to separate free βγ subunits and αβγ trimers, which were eluted with 5-25 and 50-75 mM potassium phosphate buffer, respectively (not shown). Table 1 summarizes the results of purification of a recombinant GL2. Similar results were obtained for purification of GL1 and Gq. Starting with 900 ml of cell culture suspension, final yields of trimeric G proteins ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 mg.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows the SDS-PAGE patterns of purified GL1, GL2, Gq, and Go. Molecular masses of α subunits were estimated to be 43, 42, 42, and 39 kDa for GL1, GL2, Gq, and Go, respectively. Molecular masses of β1 and γ2 subunit were estimated to be 36 and 8 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The intensity of the stained band for each of the subunits GL1α, GL2α, Gqα, and Goα was essentially the same as that of the stained band for each of the copurified β subunits. These results indicate that each of these α subunits is capable of forming a stoichiometric complex with β1γ2 subunit and was purified as an αβγ trimer. Two forms of Gqα, a major (42 kDa) and a minor (44 kDa) form, were observed. The minor form may represent a polypeptide translated from the polyhedrin initiator derived from the pVL1392 vector. To determine whether each subtype of Gq family G proteins activates PLC-β or not, each of the subunits GL1, GL2, and Gq was reconstituted with PLC-β in lipid vesicles. In the presence of aluminum fluoride, GL1, GL2, or Gq activated PLC-β 13-19-fold (Fig. 4, A-C). In the absence of aluminum fluoride, these G proteins only slightly enhanced (1.5-3-fold) the activity of PLC-β in a dose-dependent manner. Under the assay conditions employed, the concentrations of GL1, GL2, and Gq giving a half-maximal effect were estimated to be 7.37 ± 4.87, 9.47 ± 6.89, and 11.5 ± 6.3 nM, respectively. The PLC activity in the presence of excess G proteins was also not different among GL1, GL2, and Gq. These results indicate that the AlF4−-bound forms of GL1, GL2 and Gq have essentially the same affinity for PLC-β and the same ability to activate PLC-β. In contrast, Go only slightly activated PLC-β (1.5-3-fold), and its activation was not enhanced by the addition of aluminum fluoride (Fig. 4D). We have reconstituted m1 or m2 mAChRs with each subtype of Gq family G proteins in lipid vesicles in order to test the specificity of coupling between receptors and G proteins. The m1 mAChRs markedly stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to the Gq family G proteins in the presence of 1 mM carbamylcholine, but they only slightly stimulated the [35S]GTPγS binding in the presence of 10 μM atropine (Fig. 5). In contrast with m1 mAChRs, m2 mAChRs did not stimulate the [35S]GTPγS b"

After solubilization of rough microsomes with detergent, fragments comprised of the approximately 70 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of translocating nascent chains initiated and targeted in vivo were protected from digestion by added proteases. About 40 amino acids of nascent chains were protected from proteolysis by the ribosome; thus, membrane-derived components protect an additional 30 amino acids. Under conditions in which those 30 additional amino acids are protected, only a small set of integral membrane proteins remained associated with the ribosome. These proteins include the Sec61 complex previously identified as the core component of the membrane-bound protein translocation apparatus. These results support the concept of a translocation pore that makes intimate contact with the ribosome and thereby protects nascent chains from proteolytic digestion for an additional, constant length.

Examination of the amino acid sequence of Nae I uncovered similarity to the active site of human DNA ligase I, except for leucine 43 in Nae I instead of the lysine essential for ligase activity. Changing leucine 43 to lysine 43 (L43K) changed Nae I activity: Nae I-L43K relaxed supercoiled DNA to yield DNA topoisomers and recombined DNA to give dimeric molecules. Interruption of the reactions of Nae I and Nae I-L43K with DNA demonstrated transient protein-DNA covalent complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1514854037,"The substrate specificity of β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase has been analyzed using a fusion enzyme which consisted of the catalytic domain of the enzyme and the IgG binding domain of protein A, and also by extracts from cDNA transfectants. Both enzyme sources were capable of producing not only GM2 and GD2, but also asialo-GM2, GalNAc-sialylparagloboside, and GalNAc-GD1a from appropriate acceptors, although the efficiencies were at most 1-3% of those of GM2/GD2. The biological significance of these low specificities was studied with transient and stable transfectant cells. From the results of transient expression of the cDNA, asialo-GM2 expression appeared to inversely correlate with GM3 synthase levels in those lines. Consequently, GM2 seemed to be preferentially synthesized when both GM3 and lactosylceramide are available, and asialo-GM2 is synthesized in the absence of GM3 synthesis. However, the results of double immunostaining of CHO transfectants with anti-GM2 and anti-asialo-GM2 antibodies indicated that another factor may be involved in asialo-GM2 synthesis. From the in vitro assay using mixed acceptors, it was concluded that the presence of certain levels of GM2 might enhance the asialo-GM2 synthesis. These results suggest that even acceptors showing low efficiencies in vitro might be used in certain cells depending on the availability of precursors, expression levels of other gangliosides, as well as the kinetic properties of the enzyme, and the compartmentation of the glycosylation machineries in the cells.

Carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferases. Since specific glycosyltransferases are considered to be needed for the individual combination of sugar donors, acceptors, and modes of linkage, 100∼150 or more different glycosyltransferases are required for synthesis of carbohydrate structures present in mammalian cells(1Beyer T.A. Sadler J.E. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1981; 52: 23-175PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of these carbohydrate structures are regulated by the expression of each glycosyltransferase during differentiation, development, or malignant transformation. In order to further understand the regulatory mechanisms of carbohydrate expression, it is critical to establish the identity of each glycosyltransferase.

We successfully detected the GalNAc-T activity in the culture medium of cells transfected with a plasmid containing the catalytic domain of β1,4GalNAc-T cDNA fused to the IgG binding domain of the protein A gene. In this study, substrate specificity of the β1,4GalNAc-T was analyzed using this fusion enzyme (protA) as well as extracts from cDNA transfectants.

However, very low but definite incorporation of GalNAc was also detected on GD1a, lactosylceramide (LacCer), and sialylparagloboside (SPG).

GT1b, GM2, and GalCer were from Sigma; LacCer, GlcCer, and GM3 were from Snow Brand Milk Products Co. (Tokyo); GD3 was obtained from BioCarb Chemicals (Lund, Sweden); N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing GM3 was extracted and purified from horse red blood cells as described(4Furukawa K.

Human mAb KM966 was also used as an anti-GM2 mAb, which was a generous gift from Dr. N. Hanai at the Kyowa Hakko Research Institute. Asialo-GM2 expression was detected by mAb 2D4 ((7Young Jr., W.W.

One clone, named pM2T1-1/PROTA with correct orientation was obtained by confirming the DNA sequence across the vector and insert junction. B78 or COS7 cells were transfected with pM2T1-1/PROTA or pPROTA alone by the DEAE-dextran method(3Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

Regular culture medium was replaced by serum-free ITS (insulin, transferrin, and selenious acid) medium (Collaborative Research) on the next day, and the culture medium was daily collected at day 2∼5 after transfection. Collected medium was concentrated 100-fold using Molcut-L (Nihon Millipore Ltd., Yonezawa, Japan) and dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium cacodylate-HCl (pH 7.2). It was stored in a frozen tube at −80°C without significant loss of the activity. A nonrelevant mouse IgG (mAb 229 reactive with nm23, IgG2a subclass) was purified and conjugated to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and packed in a small column. The concentrated culture supernatant was applied twice to the column and unbound proteins were removed by washing rigorously with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound fusion protein was stored in 25% glycerol of cacodylate buffer at −80°C until used. The enzyme activity of β1,4GalNAc-T was measured basically according to the method previously described(9Ruan S. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5725-5731PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fractions of cells were prepared as described by Thampoe et al.(10Thampoe I.J. Furukawa K. Vellvé E. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6258-6264PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using a nitrogen cavitation apparatus. Nuclei were removed by low centrifugation and supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold cacodylate-HCl buffer. The reaction mixture contained in a volume of 50 μl: 100 mM sodium cacodylate-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM MnCl2, 0.3% Triton CF-54 (Sigma), 325 μM GM3 (for GM2 synthesis), 400 μM UDP-GalNAc (Sigma), UDP-[14C]GalNAc (3.5 × 105 dpm) (DuPont NEN), 10 mM CDP-choline (Kojin Co., Tokyo), and membranes containing 200 μg of protein. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The products were isolated by C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Millford, MA) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and fluorography as described(11Yamashiro S. Ruan S. Furukawa K. Tai T. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5395-5400PubMed Google Scholar). α2,3-Sialyltransferase activity was determined as described previously(9Ruan S. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5725-5731PubMed Google Scholar, 10Thampoe I.J. Furukawa K. Vellvé E. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6258-6264PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained in a volume of 50 μl: 50 mM sodium cacodylate-HCl (pH 6.0), 0.3% Triton CF-54, 5 mM MgCl2, 500 μM LacCer, 500 μM CMP-NeuAc (Sigma), CMP-[14C]NeuAc (3 × 105 dpm, 1200 dpm/nmol) (DuPont NEN), and membranes containing 200 μg of protein. The reaction products were applied to a Sep-Pak C18 column and analyzed as described for the β1,4GalNAc-T assay. Enzyme reaction products were dried in small tubes and dissolved in ∼50 μl of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 6.0). Neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Worthington) or neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Calbiochem Corp.) was added (final concentration, 0.5 unit/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and the organic phase was removed by partition, and used for TLC. For the transient expression, cells were transfected with pM2T1-1 using the DEAE-dextran method(3Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of GM2 and asialo-GM2 was examined by flow cytometry as described above. For investigation of optimal pH, sodium cacodylate buffers containing MnCl2 and Triton CF-54 were prepared by adjusting the pH to the indicated values. In order to determine the best cation for the enzyme assay, MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, and CuSO4 were dissolved in the cacodylate buffer with Triton CF-54, and adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH prior to using for the assay. Different detergents (Triton X-100, Tween 20, deoxycholate, and Triton CF-54) were tested at appropriate concentrations. The membrane fraction of a MeWo transfectant, C7, expressing a high level of β1,4GalNAc-T was used as an enzyme source. Glycolipids were extracted as described previously (12Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted by chloroform/methanol 2:1, 1:1, then 1:2 sequentially. Glycolipids were isolated by Florisil column after acetylation, then neutral and acidic fractions were separated by DEAE-Sephadex (A-50) column chromatography. TLC and TLC immunostaining were performed as described previously(12Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bands in TLC were analyzed by Nu200 CCD Camera System (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and IPLab Gel (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). MAb M2590 was used for detection of GM3(13Hirabayashi S. Hamaoka A. Matsumoto M. Matsubara T. Tagawa M. Wakabayashi S. Taniguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13328-13333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mAb 81-87 (donated by Dr. D. Scheinberg in Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) was used for LacCer(14Kalisiak A. Oosterwijk E. Minniti J.G. Old L.J. Scheinberg D.A. Glycoconj. J. 1991; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Km values of the β1,4GalNAc-T for GM3 and LacCer in the cDNA transfected cells or the protA were investigated under the standard assay conditions. In order to analyze the preferred use of GM3 or LacCer as the enzyme acceptors, and to investigate the effect of gangliosides on the synthesis of asialo-GM2, GM3, GM2, or GM1 were mixed with LacCer in various ratios and used as acceptors in the enzyme assay. In order to demonstrate that the product of the putative β1,4GalNAc-T cDNA we recently isolated (3Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) really catalyzes the synthesis of GM2 and/or GD2, the predicted catalytic domain, containing the carboxyl-terminal 505 amino acids, was fused to a secreted form of the IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A in the mammalian expression vector pPROTA (8Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.-C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). When B78 melanoma cells were transfected with pM2T1-1/PROTA, the conditioned media showed increasing activity of GM2 synthase as expected and reached plateau levels at 3 days after transfection (Fig. 1B), whereas transfectants with pPROTA or pM2T1-1/CDM8 demonstrated no or very low levels of the enzyme activity, respectively. In contrast to transfectants with pM2T1-1/CDM8, B78 transfected with pM2T1-1/PROTA showed no surface expression of GM2 (data not shown). COS7 cells transfected with pM2T1-1/PROTA also produced secreted enzyme (data not shown). In order to exclude the possible effects of contaminants in the culture medium, the concentrated medium was affinity-purified using an IgG-Sepharose column. For this purpose, culture medium from COS7 transfectants were used because they contained higher levels of enzyme activity than those from B78 transfectants. Using protA, the substrate specificity of soluble β1,4GalNAc-T was examined and compared with the enzyme activity of SK-MEL-31 (a highly expressing melanoma line, (11Yamashiro S. Ruan S. Furukawa K. Tai T. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5395-5400PubMed Google Scholar)) extracts and extracts from a stable MeWo transfectant. As shown in Table 1 A, these sources of enzyme demonstrated very similar substrate specificities, i.e. very high activity with NeuAc- and NeuGc-type GM3 and NeuAc-GD3 as substrates. In addition, they showed very low but definite activity using LacCer, GD1a, and SPG as substrates. The possibility that the asialo-GM2 was a product formed by an endogenous neuraminidase in the melanoma cells was examined by adding a melanoma extract to the enzyme assay; no effect was observed (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The ability of β1,4GalNAc-T to use SPGs was examined in more detail and the activity was compared to the β1,4GalNAc-T from stomach, since Dohi et al.(15Dohi T. Ohta S. Hanai N. Yamaguchi K. Ohshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7880-7885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of a similar enzyme for GalNAc-SPG synthesis in normal stomach. Both (NeuAc) SPG and (NeuGc)SPG were used as acceptors in assays with either C7 or protA (Fig. 2). When treated by neuraminidase without detergent, the products corresponding to GalNAc-SPG were stable, whereas GD2 bands, which were apparently generated from GD3 contaminating the substrates, were completely converted to GM2. When membrane extracts from normal stomach tissue were examined, GalNAc-SPGs with both type of sialic acids were produced (Fig. 2C). In the products from normal stomach extracts, no GD2 bands were seen, indicating that this β1,4GalNAc-T is distinct from GM2/GD2 synthase. As Pohlentz et al.(16Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) had reported that GM2/GD2 synthase and asialo-GM2 synthase were identical whereas we found that LacCer was used at only 1-2% the rate of GM3, we suspected that the conditions of enzyme assay used in our study might not be optimal for asialo-GM2 synthesis although they may be suitable for GM2/GD2 synthesis. Therefore, various kinds of pH, metal ions, and detergents were used for synthesis of asialo-GM2 using C7 cell extracts as an enzyme source. The optimal pH was ∼7.2, and Mn2+ was the most effective metal ion for asialo-GM2 synthesis (data not shown). Triton CF-54 was the best among detergents tried. These results were basically the same as for GM2 synthesis, indicating that our assay conditions were suitable for both enzyme activities(9Ruan S. Lloyd K.O. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5725-5731PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine the basis for difference in the activity of β1,4GalNAc-T with GM3 and LacCer, we analyzed the enzyme kinetics for the reaction using GM3 and LacCer as acceptors and cell extracts as the enzyme source. As shown in Table 1 B, GM3 showed very high acceptor activity for β1,4GalNAc-T in comparison to LacCer. Although Km with LacCer was smaller than that with GM3, the apparent Vmax with GM3 was much higher than that with LacCer by more than 2 orders of magnitude. We were unable to determine kinetic data for GM3 using the protA because of nonlinear data. The Vmax/Km ratio with GM3 was about 10 times higher than with LacCer, providing a reasonable explanation for the results of the substrate specificity analysis. The expression of glycolipids in cell lines transiently transfected with β1,4GalNAc-T cDNA was examined by flow cytometry. Five cell lines derived from mouse melanoma (B78), fibroblast (L cell), rat fibroblast (Rat-1), human melanoma (MeWo), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) were used because of the lack of β1,4GalNAc-T gene expression and high efficiency of transfection. Transfected B78, MeWo, and Rat-1 showed GM2 expression but no asialo-GM2 (Table 2). On the other hand, transfected L cells expressed only asialo-GM2 and transfected CHO cells expressed both GM2 and asialo-GM2, in a ratio of 16:1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The glycolipids in the cell lines were also extracted and analyzed by TLC and TLC immunostaining, with a special focus on the levels of precursors present. All cell lines, except for L cells, contained high levels of GM3 (Table 2). On the other hand, L cells showed no ganglioside bands as detected by resorcinol spraying. In the neutral fractions, all the cell lines showed doublet bands corresponding to LacCer; its identity was confirmed by TLC immunostaining with mAb 81-87 (data not shown) with various intensities. When the levels of GM3 synthase activity in these 5 cell lines were measured, B78, MeWo, and Rat-1 showed very high activity as expected, whereas CHO and L cell showed very low or no GM3 synthase activity (Table 2). Glycolipids were extracted from B78 and L cells and their stable transfectants and analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig. 3, the majority of LacCer was converted to asialo-GM2 in L cells. The B78 transfectant showed a very faint line corresponding to asialo-GM2 and the LacCer band was reduced. As for the ganglioside composition, the majority of GM3 in B78 was converted to GM2 in the transfectants. No ganglioside bands were seen either in the parent L cell or in its transfectant. In order to examine whether the GM2 positive CHO transfected cells were a population distinct from asialo-GM2 positive cells, double staining of bulk CHO transfectants with anti-GM2 and anti-asialo-GM2 mAbs was performed. Contrary to expectation, almost all asialo-GM2 positive cells belonged to the GM2 positive population as shown in Fig. 4. To investigate the preferential use of GM3 and LacCer by β1,4GalNAc-T, we performed the enzyme assay using variable mixtures of the two substrates. GM2 synthesis increased as the GM3/LacCer ratio increased (Fig. 5). Unexpectedly, asialo-GM2 synthesis also increased as the GM3/LacCer ratio increased, although there was a big difference in the amounts of synthesized GM2 and asialo-GM2. These results suggested that the presence of GM3 might enhance the asialo-GM2 synthesis, or that the LacCer preparation might contain neuraminidase activity which may convert GM2 to asialo-GM2. The latter possibility was excluded by an experiment in which LacCer was added to the labeled GM2 in the assay mixture (data not shown). The effect of GM1 or GM2 on asialo-GM2 synthesis was then examined. As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of GM2 markedly enhanced the synthesis of asialo-GM2, whereas GM1 had less effect. With higher amounts of GM2 or GM3, the efficiency of asialo-GM2 synthesis from LacCer was diminished. These results suggest that the presence of GM2 or GM3 at appropriate levels may enhance the asialo-GM2 synthesis by β1,4GalNAc-T.Figure 6Effects of gangliosides on asialo-GM2 synthesis. LacCer was mixed with GM3, GM2, or GM1 at the indicated molar ratios and used as acceptors. Inset demonstrates the asialo-GM2 bands (arrows) synthesized in the presence of GM2 (a) or GM1 (b). Molar ratios of ganglioside to LacCer of the individual points were 5:95 (lane 1), 20:80 (lane 2), 50:50 (lane 3), and 83:17 (lane 4) to make a total concentration 325 μM. These results were plotted for GM2 (▣), GM3 (⬠), and GM1 (◊) addition. Only the points at the right end were 5 times the amount (415/17 molar ratio) of GM2 or GM3 at the point of 83:17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented in this study support the identification of the cDNA previously reported (3Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as coding for the UDP-GalNAc:GM3/GD3β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene and show that the enzyme efficiently synthesizes GM2 and GD2 in the presence of appropriate acceptors. We also investigated whether the enzyme could synthesize related compounds, i.e. asialo-GM2, GalNAc-GD1a, and GalNAc-SPG. Although the purified enzyme could synthesize all three products, the efficiency of the reaction was only 1-3% of that for GM2/GD2 formation. Changing the assay conditions did not improve the efficiency. Hashimoto et al.(17Hashimoto Y. Sekine M. Iwasaki K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25857-25864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a GalNAc-T purified from mouse liver also preferentially used GM3 and GD3 as substrates. This enzyme preparation had only trace (<2%) levels of activity with LacCer, SPG, and GD1a. As Pohlentz et al.(16Pohlentz G. Klein D. Schwarzmann G. Schmitz D. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) had reported that GM2, GD2, and asialo-GM2 were produced by the same enzyme in extracts of rat liver, we examined the specificity of the enzyme in more detail and determined whether these minor reactions were biologically significant in cultured cells. The synthesis of GalNAc-SPG by melanoma GalNAc-T can be compared with the activity of the enzyme from normal stomach extracts previously studied by Dohi et al.(15Dohi T. Ohta S. Hanai N. Yamaguchi K. Ohshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7880-7885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These investigators showed that the stomach enzyme synthesizes the NGM-1 antigen, which may be related to the Sda blood group specificity. A cDNA coding for the latter structure has recently been cloned and is clearly different from β1,4GalNAc-T studied here(18Smith P.L. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15162-15171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we show (Fig. 2), that in contrast to our β1,4GalNAc-T, the stomach enzyme does not synthesize GD2 from GD3, again suggesting that it may be a separate enzyme. Whether a separate enzyme is also responsible for asialo-GM2 synthesis is not clear. It appears that even though the GM2/GD2 synthase use LacCer very inefficiently as a substrate in vitro, it is able to produce substantial amounts of asialo-GM2 in certain cells. Analysis of the glycolipid content of cells transiently and stably transfected with β1,4GalNAc-T cDNA showed that synthesis of GM2 or asialo-GM2 was highly influenced by the precursors available in the cells. Thus, asialo-GM2, and no GM2, was produced in transfected L cells. Since high expression of asialo-GM2 was observed even in transiently transfected cells, the high level should reflect the actual rate of synthesis and not be due to the slow accumulation of asialo-GM2 in the cells. L cells have no GM3; moreover, in all the transfected cell lines studied, levels of α2,3-sialyltransferase were inversely correlated with expression of asialo-GM2. These results show that the levels of appropriate precursors (GM3 or LacCer) influence the propensity of the cell to produce GM2 or asialo-GM2. Transfected CHO cells, in contrast to transfected L cells, produced both asialo-GM2 and GM2. This result may be explained by the synthesis of smaller amounts of GM3 in CHO cells than in the other cell lines studied (except L cells). The preference of β1,4GalNAc-T for GM3 over LacCer as substrate also influences the ratio of GM2/asialo-GM2 produced by a cell. This enzyme had a lower Km and lower Vmax for LacCer than it did for GM3 (Table 1 B). The low Vmax/Km value for LacCer in comparison to GM3 as substrate observed in vitro is consistent with the cell line ganglioside composition data. These data show that the ability of a cell to synthesize asialo-GM2 is determined by GM3 levels as well as the preferential use of GM3 over LacCer by β1,4GalNAc-T. GM3 levels, in turn, are controlled by α2,3-sialyltransferase levels and possibly by other factors(19Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I.B. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Another factor that can apparently influence the ability of GalNAc-T to utilize LacCer as substrate is the level of other gangliosides, particularly GM2, in the cell. This was demonstrated in CHO transfected cells in which asialo-GM2 was detected only in GM2-expressing cells. The presence of GM2 in certain concentrations, but not GM1, also enhanced asialo-GM2 synthesis in vitro. From these data, it is also suggested that GM2 stimulates its own synthesis as well as asialo-GM2. If this is true, it may explain the sigmoid reaction curve and nonlinear double reciprocal plots obtained in the kinetics of protA for GM3 (data not shown). This fact would also be consistent with the sigmoidal character of Fig. 5B, upper panel. The mechanism for the effect is at present not known. We suspect that the presence of GM2 has an effect in modifying the affinity of β1,4GalNAc-T, but this effect would have to be concentration-dependent. It is also possible, but unlikely, that GM2 is simply stabilizing the protA enzyme during the reaction. The glycolipid composition of cells may also be determined by the differential compartmentation of the various glycosyltransferases in the biosynthetic machinery of the cell. The possibility for differential compartmentation of these enzymes is suggested by organelle fractionation studies in which α2,3-sialyltransferase was recovered in different gradient regions containing cis-Golgi cisternae, from other sialyltransferase existing in trans-Golgi-containing fractions(20Trinchera M. Ghidoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15766-15769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the preferential use of GM3 may also be because α2,3-sialyltransferase is located in an earlier compartment than GalNAc-T and may utilize most of the LacCer before it can reach the GalNAc-T compartment. The use of brefeldin A also suggested that α2,3-sialyltransferase was located within the Golgi stacks (brefeldin A resistant) while GalNAc-T was located beyond the brefeldin A block (brefeldin A sensitive)(21van Echten G. Iber H. Stotz H. Takatsuki A. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar, 22Young Jr., W.W. Lutz M.S. Mills S.E. Lechler-Osborn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In brief, factors that determine ganglioside composition in cells are quite complex, but glycosyltransferase levels, substrate specificities of the enzymes, and the levels of precursors and other glycolipids in the cell clearly play important roles. Fig. 7 summarizes the ganglioside expression in the cell lines studied and the effect of transfection with the β1,4GalNAc-T gene on the ganglioside patterns. These studies suggest that even acceptors showing low efficiencies with the enzyme might be used in certain cells. The existence of other GalNAc-T species which would preferentially glycosylate LacCer or other gangliosides containing a similar terminal Gal residue cannot, however, be excluded. On-going studies to knock-out the β1,4GalNAc-T gene in either mice or cultured cells should clarify these issues. We are grateful to Drs. T. Maita and T. Hayashibara for valuable discussion.

WT1 is down-regulated in differentiated leukemia cells both in vivo and in vitro and is up-regulated in fetal spleen and immature leukemia cells. The modulation of WT1 expression was examined in many cell types, and a hematopoietic-specific enhancer element has been identified. Here we describe the transcriptional response of this enhancer to hematopoietic-specific transcription factors. We found co-expression of WT1 and GATA-1 mRNA in K562 cells and in mouse spleen, suggesting potential interactions between these two transcription factors. We find that the activity of the 3′ WT1 enhancer is positively correlated with the expression of GATA-1. Gel shift competition experiments and transactivation studies revealed that this functional activity is mediated via binding at a GATA-binding site in the WT1 enhancer.

INTRODUCTIONWilms' tumor or nephroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in children and accounts for about 6% of all childhood malignancies (Knudson and Strong, 1972; Young and Miller, 1975). Histologically, classic triphasic Wilms' tumor consists of three cell types quite similar to those in the developing kidney (Kidd, 1984): poorly differentiated blastemal cells that are considered stem cells for nephrogenesis, epithelial cells, and a stromal component. A Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, has been isolated (Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990) by positional cloning techniques and shown to be involved in the etiology of at least some Wilms' tumor cases (Huff et al., 1991; Haber et al., 1990).WT1 is expressed in normal fetal spleen, bone marrow, and immature leukemic cells (Call et al., 1990; Huang et al., 1990; Pritchard-Jones et al., 1994; Miwa et al., 1992; Miyagi et al., 1993), in addition to expression in fetal kidney cells (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990) and cells of the genitourinary system (Pelletier et al., 1991, Kreidberg et al., 1993). Thus, WT1 is considered to have pleiotropic effects that relate to mesenchymal cell differentiation, and its expression is down-regulated during differentiation of pluripotent leukemic cell lines. In HL60 promyelocytic cells induced to differentiate to granulocytes or monocytes by treatment with Me2SO or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, respectively, the WT1 mRNA levels decrease significantly (Sekiya et al., 1994). Similarly, in K562 cells, induction of erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation by sodium butyrate or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, respectively, resulted in a rapid drop in WT1 mRNA levels (Phelan et al., 1994). Thus, repression of WT1 may be required for differentiation of some hematopoietic lineages.We have previously identified a tissue-specific regulatory region involved in the expression of the WT1 gene (Fraizer et al., 1994) and have now focused on identifying the trans-acting factors responsible for tissue-specific WT1 expression. As the WT1 promoter functions in all cell lines tested (Fraizer et al., 1994; Hofmann et al., 1993), the tissue-specific expression of this gene must rely upon additional regulatory elements. Previously we identified an orientation-independent transcriptional enhancer located 3′ of the WT1 gene that is specific for K562 cells, a cell line derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis that expresses WT1 mRNA. Full enhancer activity is contained within a 250-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)ALLacute lymphocytic leukemiaPCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. )minimal enhancer region. In constructs containing the WT1 promoter, the 3′ enhancer functions in a cell type-specific manner, increasing transcription from the WT1 promoter in K562 cells. In this report we examine in detail the requirement of specific transcriptional regulatory factors for enhancer function. Our results indicate that GATA-1, a hematopoietic transcription factor, plays a major role in the regulation of WT1 expression in hematopoietic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureCell lines 293, derived from adenovirus 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, CRL1573, Rockville, MD); HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line (ATCC, CCL2); and Hep3B, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (ATCC, HB8064) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. K562 cells, a human cell line with erythroleukemia characteristics derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (ATCC, CCL243); HEL cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (ATCC, T1B180); and CEM cells, a human acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia (T-ALL) cell line (ATCC, CCL119), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Monolayers were seeded, and the suspension cultures were split 48-72 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected while in the log phase of growth, i.e. monolayers were <75% confluent, and the suspension cultures were at <5 × 105 cells/ml.Construction of WT1 Enhancer PlasmidsThe 1.85-kb AccI-PstI fragment derived from WT1 cosmid 2-1-c contains the 3′ end of exon 10 and the 3′-flanking region of the gene (Fig. 1). The enhancer fragment 3d2 was derived from the AccI-PstI fragment during deletion analysis (Fraizer et al., 1994). The deletion clone 3d2 was used as a template for PCR amplification of the 351-bp enhancer fragment (e351) as described elsewhere (Fraizer et al., 1994).The same cloning strategy was used to generate the minimal enhancer construct e258 except that the PCR template was a derivative of clone 3d2, which lacked the 5′-most 93 bp of the enhancer fragment. After digestion of 3d2 with SphI, the 949-bp enhancer fragment was gel-purified and cloned into the SphI site of the pCAT promoter construct. The 5′ PCR primer (5′-GCATTCTAGTTGTGGTTTGTC) was derived from the pCAT promoter vector and flanks the multiple cloning site. The 3′ primer was derived from the enhancer sequence (5′-CTAGATCTTGCCATGCTTGTCCTGAG) and includes a 6-bp mismatch that creates a BglII restriction site. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and BglII, and the gel-purified 258-bp BamHI-BglII fragment was cloned in both orientations into the BamHI site of the 652-bp fragment containing the WT1 promoter. Additionally, the 258-bp minimal enhancer fragment was cloned in both orientations into the BamHI site of the WT1 104-bp minimal promoter (Fraizer et al., 1994). After the SphI digestion of 3d2 and removal of the 258-bp fragment, the 93-bp enhancer fragment remaining was ligated with the SphI site in the vector and contains only the 5′ end of 3d2.Transfections and CAT AssaysK562, 293, HEL, and CEM cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (Fraizer et al., 1994) except that 2 × 107 CEM and HEL cells were electroporated at 230 V and then kept at room temperature for 10 min. HeLa cells were transfected as described previously except that cells were electroporated at 200 V in 200 μl of serum-free medium containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, cells were also co-transfected with 5 μg of the expression vector pSV2β-Gal (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cells were harvested, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described (Fraizer et al., 1994). Equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were assayed for CAT activity (Gorman et al., 1982). The protein content of cell extracts was also determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and extracts containing 25-50 μg of protein (for K562 cells) or 50-100 μg of protein (for other cells) were assayed for CAT activity (Gorman et al., 1982). After thin-layer chromatography, the acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity with a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). Relative activities are averaged from at least three different experiments.Co-transfections were performed in 293 and HeLa cells as described above except that increasing amounts of the mouse GATA-1 cDNA expression construct (Tsai et al., 1990) were added to each transfection of 5 μg of reporter and 5 μg of β-galactosidase control DNA. DNA concentrations were held constant by the addition of the expression vector DNA pXM (Tsai et al., 1990). The reporter construct (WT1 minpro.e258) contains no potential GATA-binding sites in the WT1 minimal promoter, but does contain a potential GATA-binding site in the WT1 minimal enhancer.Reverse Transcriptase PCRTotal cell RNA was extracted from HEL, Hep3B, HeLa, 293, CEM, K562, and HL60, derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (ATCC, CCL240), cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(1987) using STAT-60 (Tel Test, Friendswood, TX) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Total cell RNA was extracted from mouse spleen cells using guanidinium isothiocyanate (Chirgwin et al., 1979). The first strand cDNA synthesis was prepared using superscriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, except that 50 μM random hexamer primer and 20 units of an RNase inhibitor, RNasin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), were added, and the reaction was incubated for 2 h at 42°C. PCR amplification was carried out using the following primer pairs: 5′ GATA-1 (5′-ATTGTCAGTAAACGGGCAGG-3′) (exon 5) and 3′ GATA-1 (5′-CACCACCATAAAGCCACCAGC-3′) (exon 6), 5′β-actin (5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′) and 3′β-actin (5′-GTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′), and 5 ′ WT1 (exon 7) (5′-GGCATCTGAGACCAGTGAGAA-3′) and 3 ′ WT1 (exon 10) (5′-GAGAGTCAGACTTGAAAGCAGT-3′). Conditions of amplification were: 3 min denaturation at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 94°C denaturation for 1 min, 58°C annealing for 2 min, and 72°C extension for 2 min, followed by a final 5-min extension at 72°C. To compensate for the overabundance of actin mRNA, we used 1/10th the concentration of β-actin primers as WT1 and GATA-1 primers (0.2 μM). PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% SeaPlaque (FMC Corp., Bioproducts Division, Rockland, ME) agarose gel. The size marker used was the 123-bp DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The triplex PCR amplification resulted in three PCR products of expected size: 540-bp β-actin, 480-bp WT1, and 266-bp GATA-1.Nuclear Extract Preparations and Gel Mobility Shift AssaysCrude nuclear “mini-extracts” were prepared from exponentially growing K562, 293, HeLa, and HepG2 (ATCC MB8065) (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells according to the method of Dignam et al.(1983) as modified by Lee et al.(1988). Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described by Singh et al.(1986). The 258-bp minimal enhancer was gel-purified and end-labeled at the EcoRI site with Klenow fragment using [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Corp.). One nanogram of the 3′ end-labeled 258-bp fragment (10,000 cpm) was incubated with 0.5-5 μg of the crude nuclear protein extracts and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a buffer of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Nuclear extracts were replaced with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the control. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis at 300 volts on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (0.045 M Tris borate, 0.001 M EDTA), dried, and visualized by autoradiography using XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) film. For competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the reverse complement of the GATA-binding site (5′-TTTTATCTTT-3′) found within e250 were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with the extracts described above and then the end-labeled 258-bp fragment was added to the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 15 min and analyzed as described above.RESULTSInteraction of the 3′ Minimal Enhancer with the WT1 PromoterSince the WT1 promoter functions in all cell lines tested, the tissue-specific expression of this gene must rely upon additional regulatory elements. We initially identified an orientation-independent transcriptional enhancer located 3′ of the WT1 gene that was specific for K562 cells, a cell line derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient in blast crisis that has erythroleukemic characteristics and that expresses WT1 mRNA (Fraizer et al., 1994). The 3′ enhancer region, e351, was cloned in both orientations into the 3′ end of pCB-WT1pro, a CAT construct containing the 652-bp full-length WT1 promoter. This WT1 promoter/enhancer construct was tested for CAT activity in K562, 293, and Hela cells, and CAT activity is shown relative to pCB-WT1pro (Fig. 2A). The enhancer region e351, located 1768 bp 3′ of the stop codon of the WT1 gene (Gessler et al., 1992), increased transcription of WT1 promoter-CAT constructs in K562 cells 13-fold in either orientation. By further deleting the 5′-most 93 bp from e351, we created a 258-bp minimal enhancer element that contains the full enhancer activity, increasing transcription of the WT1 promoter-CAT constructs in K562 cells 13-fold in either orientation. This enhancer region located between +800 and +1050 bp 3′ of the WT1 gene increases transcription from the WT1 promoter in an orientation-independent manner as efficiently as the larger e351 and the 1-kb enhancer fragment 3d2 described previously (Fraizer et al., 1994). The 258-bp minimal enhancer also functions in HEL cells, an erythroleukemic cell line, activating the WT1 promoter-CAT constructs 3-fold (data not shown). Thus, the 258-bp minimal enhancer is active in two different erythroleukemic cell lines.Figure 2Activity of the WT1 enhancer with the WT1 promoter. This diagram illustrates the interaction of the hematopoietic enhancer with the WT1 promoter. A, the activity of the enhancer region e351 was compared with the activity of the minimal enhancer e258, and both enhancers were cloned into the 652-bp full-length WT1 promoter and tested in both orientations. The enhancer activity is expressed relative to the WT1 full-length promoter construct into which the WT1 enhancer fragments were cloned. B, the activity of the 104-bp minimal enhancer fragment e258 was tested in both orientations, and activity is expressed relative to the 104-bp WT1 minimal promoter construct into which the WT1 enhancer fragment was cloned. C, sequence analysis of the WT1 minimal enhancer shows potential transcription factor binding sites. Note that GATA and NF-E2 are hematopoietic-specific transcription factor-binding sites and the E-box (E2A-binding site) could potentially bind an additional hematopoietic-specific helix-loop-helix transcription factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The enhancer fragment e258 was cloned into the WT1 minimal promoter construct in both orientations. The enhancer activates the minimal promoter CAT constructs 12-13-fold in K562 cells (Fig. 2B). Although the minimal promoter has only 50% of the activity of the larger, full-length promoter (Fraizer et al., 1994), e258 is able to fully activate the minimal promoter, that is, the enhancer does not depend upon target sequences contained within the larger promoter region for maximal enhancer activity.The WT1 e258 enhancer confers tissue specificity to both the full-length and minimal WT1 promoter. In K562 and HEL cells the WT1 enhancer increases the WT1 promoter transcription levels even greater than the SV40 enhancer; however, in 293 cells the enhancer fragment has no activity, failing to increase the transcription levels of either WT1 promoter construct (Fig. 2, A and B). The larger e351 enhancer fragment also has no activity in 293 cells (Fig. 2A) and CEM cells (data not shown), although both cell lines express WT1 mRNA. This lack of enhancer activity in cell lines that express endogenous WT1 indicates the absence of transcription factors necessary for enhancer activity. The enhancer also failed to increase basal transcription in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) which fail to express WT1 mRNA (Fig. 3).Figure 3GATA-1 expression in K562 cells. Reverse transcriptase PCR of total cell RNA from HEL (EL), K562 (K), U937 (U), HeLa (He), 293 (2), Hep3B (HB), HL60 (HL), CEM (C), and murine spleen (S) was performed as described in the text. The negative control (N) was the PCR product of the first strand cDNA synthesis done in the absence of any RNA. The 123-bp DNA ladder (MW) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a size marker. The triplex PCR amplification resulted in three PCR products as labeled: 540-bp β-actin, 481-bp WT1, and 266-bp GATA-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the e258 enhancer element maintains the strict tissue specificity of the larger e351 enhancer fragment, we analyzed the sequence of the e258 fragment for potential transcription factor- binding sites (Fig. 2C). The enhancer region contains many binding sites for transcription factors that have been associated with enhancer activity, but the hematopoietic-specific GATA and NF-E2 binding sites are most likely to play roles in hematopoietic gene expression. The E-box may also serve as a binding site for the Tal-1 (stem cell leukemia) transcription factor percent in some hematopoietic cells (Begley et al., 1989). Although a second GATA motif is located within the 93-bp fragment 5′ of e258, inclusion of this region does not increase enhancer activity. When the 5′-most 93-bp fragment of the e351 enhancer was tested independently, no enhancer activity was found. Thus, we have identified the minimal enhancer and demonstrated that the enhancer functions in a cell type-specific manner, increasing transcription from the WT1 promoter in K562 and HEL cells but not in any other line tested.GATA-1 and WT1 Co-Expression in K562 CellsBoth WT1 and GATA-1 are expressed in K562, HEL, and mouse spleen cells (Fig. 3). Although WT1 is expressed in 293, CEM, and HL60 cells, no GATA-1 expression was detected in these cells. HeLa and Hep3B cells failed to express either WT1 or GATA-1, although β-actin expression was detected. Although WT1 is expressed in all the hematopoietic lines tested (Fig. 3), GATA-1 is only expressed in those cell lines in which the WT1 enhancer functions (e.g. K562 and HEL cells), and GATA-1 is not expressed in CEM cells, a leukemic line in which the WT1 enhancer fails to function. Thus, the 3′ enhancer functions in a limited set of hematopoietic cell lines, apparently only those that express GATA-1.Nuclear Protein Binding Analysis of the 3′ EnhancerThe role of the GATA site in the minimal 3′ enhancer was examined by both functional and protein-DNA binding assays. Evidence for a GATA-specific complex was obtained by gel retardation assays (Fig. 4). A unique complex (not observed with 293 extracts) is seen for the 258-bp fragment bound to K562 extracts (Fig. 4), and this complex is eliminated by competition with unlabeled GATA oligonucleotides. A higher molecular weight non-GATA-specific complex is observed with both the K562 and 293 extracts. This complex is not observed in the non-WT1-expressing cell lines: HeLa and HepG2. This higher molecular weight complex is not eliminated in competition experiments by unlabeled GATA or GAGA oligonucleotides.Figure 4Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the minimal enhancer. A, nuclear extracts from K562, 293, HeLa, and HepG2 cells were bound to radiolabeled e258 fragment. The hematopoietic-specific complex is marked by an arrow. B, nuclear extracts from K562 and not 293 cells form a hematopoietic-specific complex with the e258 fragment, and that complex is specifically eliminated by competition with 100 × molar excess of unlabeled GATA oligonucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GATA-1 Transactivation of the WT1 3′ EnhancerThe 3′ enhancer fails to activate transcription in the 293 kidney cell line (lacking endogenous GATA-1 protein), but addition of the GATA-1 protein by co-transfection confers enhancer activity. In co-transfection assays using 5 μg of the WT1 reporter construct containing the e258 WT1 enhancer (with one GATA site) and the minimal WT1 promoter (lacking GATA binding sites) adding increasing amounts of a mouse GATA-1 cDNA (Tsai et al., 1990), expression construct resulted in increasing enhancer activity (Fig. 5). Ten micrograms of the mGATA-1 expression construct gave a 13-fold increase in WT1 promoter activity. Similar results were obtained when the co-transfection was carried out in HeLa cells. Thus, 3′ enhancer activity correlates with increasing amounts of GATA-1 transcription factor. This positive correlation was also observed between endogenous GATA-1 expression in cultured cells and the ability of the 3′ enhancer to transcriptionally activate the WT1 promoter in these cells as depicted in Table 1. This correlation explains the inability of the 3′ enhancer to function in CEM cells, a T-ALL cell line that fails to express GATA-1. Interestingly, the 3′ enhancer is not active in all cells that express WT1 mRNA. This suggests that additional unknown cis-acting elements regulate WT1 expression in these cells and indicates a very complex regulation of WT1 tissue-specific expression.Figure 5GATA-1 transactivates the WT1 enhancer. This figure shows the dose-dependent activation of the WT1 enhancer by GATA-1 co-transfection. Five micrograms of the reporter construct (WT1 minpro.e258) containing the 104 bp WT1 minimal promoter and the 258-bp minimal enhancer (e258) was co-transfected as described in the text. ■, WT1 minpro.e258.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the isolation of an enhancer fragment that is capable of increasing basal transcription levels from both the SV40 and WT1 promoters in transient transfection assays in K562 cells. This enhancer fragment has been characterized with respect to its tissue specificity and potential transcription factor binding sites. Unlike the ubiquitously active promoter, the 3′ enhancer is hematopoietic-specific, functioning only in K562 and HEL cells. This is probably the result of the hematopoietic-specific GATA element located within the 258-bp enhancer. It is possible that GATA-binding proteins may facilitate transcription at the WT1 GC-rich promoter in some hematopoietic cells, explaining the unique tissue specificity of the WT1 gene.In addition to kidney and genitourinary expression, WT1 is expressed in normal fetal spleen, bone marrow, and immature leukemic cells (Call et al., 1990; Pritchard-Jones et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1990; Miwa et al., 1992; Miyagi et al., 1993). The hematopoietic-specific regulation of WT1 expression may require at least three cis-acting regulatory elements found within the promoters of many hematopoietic-specific genes: GATA (Evans et al., 1988), CACCC (Mantovani et al., 1988), and NF-E2 (Andrews et al., 1993); two of these three elements are also found within the WT1 enhancer region. Additionally, two potential TAL-1 (stem cell leukemia) (Begley et al., 1989) transcription factor-binding sites are found within the 258-bp enhancer region. As TAL-1 and GATA-1 are both expressed in acute myeloid leukemias particularly of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages (Orkin, 1992; Shimamoto et al., 1994), they may both interact with the WT1 enhancer. GATA-binding sites have been identified in both the GATA-1 and TAL-1 gene promoters (Tsai et al., 1991; Aplan et al., 1990), so activation of the WT1 enhancer may occur only after increased GATA-1 production has up-regulated its own expression and that of TAL-1.Because we observed expression of WT1 and GATA-1 RNA in K562 and HEL cells and in mouse spleen, we evaluated potential interactions between GATA-1 transcription factors and the WT1 enhancer. The GATA family of transcription factors originally was classified as erythroid-specific zinc finger transcription factors, but GATA family members have also been shown to play critical roles in other hematopoietic lineages (Orkin, 1992). GATA-1 expression decreases during myelo/monocytic differentiation (Sposi et al., 1992) and is generally absent in the M3, M4, and M5 classes of acute myelogenous leukemia (Shimamoto et al., 1994). This pattern of expression in leukemia cells resembles that of WT1 (Miwa et al., 1992; Miyagi et al., 1993). Additionally, both GATA-1 and WT1 are down regulated during differentiation of HL60 cells to neutrophils (Sekiya et al., 1994; Orkin, 1992). However, the GATA-1 expression pattern only partially overlaps WT1 expression. GATA-1 is not sufficient to maintain WT1 expression, as WT1 is down-regulated during the differentiation of K562 cells (Phelan, 1994), whereas GATA-1 expression increases during erythroid differentiation (Orkin, 1992). Both WT1 and GATA-1 are likely to be expressed in an early pluripotent stem cell.We have characterized the interactions of the hematopoietic- specific enhancer with the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation assays. We found that enhancer activity is correlated with the expression of GATA-1, implying that GATA-1 is necessary for the activation of the WT1 promoter by the 3′ enhancer. Because GATA-1 is essential for erythroid development (Pevny et al., 1991) and expressed in only a subset of mature hematopoietic cells, primarily megakaryocytic and mast cells, we predict that the WT1 enhancer will activate transcription above basal levels in only a subset of hematopoietic cells. To date we have examined enhancer function in two erythroleukemia cell lines, HEL and K562 cells, and we plan to examine additional GATA-expressing leukemic cell lines.In the present work we have identified both cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate expression of WT1 in the hematopoietic system. We have shown the dramatic effect GATA-1 has on the transcription of the Wilms' tumor gene WT1 and provided a framework for understanding the role of WT1 in hematopoiesis. As WT1 itself is a transcription factor expressed in at least two hematopoietic lineages, WT1 may be a hematopoietic target gene for the GATA-binding proteins and therefore part of the cascade of transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis. Elucidating the role of tumor suppressor genes such as WT1 in normal developmental processes will aid in understanding their roles in the development of cancer. INTRODUCTIONWilms' tumor or nephroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in children and accounts for about 6% of all childhood malignancies (Knudson and Strong, 1972; Young and Miller, 1975). Histologically, classic triphasic Wilms' tumor consists of three cell types quite similar to those in the developing kidney (Kidd, 1984): poorly differentiated blastemal cells that are considered stem cells for nephrogenesis, epithelial cells, and a stromal component. A Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, has been isolated (Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990) by positional cloning techniques and shown to be involved in the etiology of at least some Wilms' tumor cases (Huff et al., 1991; Haber et al., 1990).WT1 is expressed in normal fetal spleen, bone marrow, and immature leukemic cells (Call et al., 1990; Huang et al., 1990; Pritchard-Jones et al., 1994; Miwa et al., 1992; Miyagi et al., 1993), in addition to expression in fetal kidney cells (Pritchard-Jones et al., 1990) and cells of the genitourinary system (Pelletier et al., 1991, Kreidberg et al., 1993). Thus, WT1 is considered to have pleiotropic effects that relate to mesenchymal cell differentiation, and its expression is down-regulated during differentiation of pluripotent leukemic cell lines. In HL60 promyelocytic cells induced to differentiate to granulocytes or monocytes by treatment with Me2SO or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, respectively, the WT1 mRNA levels decrease significantly (Sekiya et al., 1994). Similarly, in K562 cells, induction of erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation by sodium butyrate or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, respectively, resulted in a rapid drop in WT1 mRNA levels (Phelan et al., 1994). Thus, repression of WT1 may be required for differentiation of some hematopoietic lineages.We have previously identified a tissue-specific regulatory region involved in the expression of the WT1 gene (Fraizer et al., 1994) and have now focused on identifying the trans-acting factors responsible for tissue-specific WT1 expression. As the WT1 promoter functions in all cell lines tested (Fraizer et al., 1994; Hofmann et al., 1993), the tissue-specific expression of this gene must rely upon additional regulatory elements. Previously we identified an orientation-independent transcriptional enhancer located 3′ of the WT1 gene that is specific for K562 cells, a cell line derived from a chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis that expresses WT1 mRNA. Full enhancer activity is contained within a 250-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)ALLacute lymphocytic leukemiaPCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. )minimal enhancer region. In constructs containing the WT1 promoter, the 3′ enhancer functions in a cell type-specific manner, increasing transcription from the WT1 promoter in K562 cells. In this report we examine in detail the requirement of specific transcriptional regulatory factors for enhancer function. Our results indicate that GATA-1, a hematopoietic transcription factor, plays a major role in the regulation of WT1 expression in hematopoietic cells."

To further implicate a protein phosphorylation mechanism in the regulation of NGF expression, astrocytes were treated with okadaic acid and calyculin A, inhibitors of phosphoprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Okadaic acid dramatically increased both NGF mRNA content (50-fold) and NGF secretion (100-fold) in astrocytes, while calyculin A, which has a spectrum of phosphatase inhibitory activity different from okadaic acid, failed to augment NGF expression. The increased mRNA accumulation was due mainly to an increase (4-fold) in the half-life of the NGF mRNA following 9 or 24 h of treatment. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that okadaic acid also activated NGF gene transcription, which was preceded by an induction of c-fos and c-jun gene transcription. The induction of NGF expression by okadaic acid appeared independent from protein kinase C activity because down-regulating protein kinase C activity failed to decrease the okadaic acid stimulation. In contrast, interleukin-1β acted synergistically with okadaic acid to stimulate NGF secretion. The results indicate that okadaic acid profoundly stimulates NGF expression in astrocytes mainly by enhancing NGF mRNA stability and suggest important roles for phosphoprotein phosphatases in regulating NGF production.

Neuroreport. 1990; 1: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) are very potent and efficacious activators of NGF gene expression and NGF secretion. In contrast, glucocorticoids inhibit basal and stimulated NGF production in astrocytes (15Lindholm D. Castrén E. Hengerer B. Zafra F. Berninger B. Thoenen H. Eur. J.

We have recently provided evidence excluding a role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the mediation of IL-1 effects on NGF gene expression in astrocytes, but our results did implicate a role for other protein phosphorylation systems(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to NGF, astroglial brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression is not increased by cytokines and growth factors that increase NGF, but brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA is markedly increased by forskolin, ionomycin, and norepinephrine(19Zafra F.

The presence of multiple and different promoters in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (20Timmusk T. Palm K. Metsis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H.

A. 1990; 87: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) may underlie the differential regulation of these neurotrophins. Okadaic acid (OA) is a polyether fatty acid isolated from marine sponges that has been shown to be a potent tumor promoter(23Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Instead of activating PKC like the phorbol ester tumor promoters, OA specifically inhibits phosphoprotein phosphatases 1 and 2A leading to an increase in the phosphorylation state of many cellular proteins (23Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OA treatment of fibroblasts mimicked the effects of IL-1 on protein phosphorylation(24Guy G.R. Cao X. Chua S.P. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1846-1852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that one cellular action of IL-1 might be to inhibit phosphoprotein phosphatase activity. OA has also been found to increase NGF mRNA content in mixed glial-neuronal hippocampal cell cultures similar to IL-1(25Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the mechanism responsible for the induction of NGF expression by OA in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes. Our results indicate that OA stimulates both NGF gene transcription and NGF mRNA stabilization. Moreover, the action of OA does not require basal or activated PKC activity and may be mediated by induction of IEGs. Primary cultures of cortical astroglial cells were prepared from newborn (postnatal day 2) Sprague-Dawley rats (Zivic-Miller Laboratories, Inc.) as described(6Carman-Krzan M. Vigé X. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After careful removal of meninges, the cortices were dissociated by passage through 75-μm sterile Nitex screens (Tetko) into 10 ml of culture medium. The medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunc) (16 × 106 cells/dish) or 24-well plates (Nunc) (0.4 × 106 cells/15 mm well). Cells were grown for 8-10 days (80-90% confluent) at 37°C in a water-saturated air environment containing 6% CO2. Culture medium was changed every 3 days of cultivation. Cells were treated under serum-free conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium plus antibiotics) with OA (Life Technologies, Inc.), IL-1 (Boehringer Mannheim), TPA, staurosporine, (Sigma), or the respective vehicle solutions (control cells). Concentrations and times of treatment are indicated in the text and figure legends. For NGF determinations, culture medium was collected and immediately frozen, and NGF was extracted from cells (in 100-mm dishes) as described earlier(6Carman-Krzan M. Vigé X. Wise B.C. J.

For RNA determination, cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated for 3 h in serum-free medium to equilibrate the cells and then treated with the various agents for the times indicated in the text and figure legends. For mRNA stability studies, cells were pretreated for different times with or without OA (20 nM) followed by the addition of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml). Cells were harvested for RNA isolation at various times after actinomycin D addition. The NGF enzyme-linked immunoassay (NGF-EIA) was performed as described previously (6Carman-Krzan M. Vigé X. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using purified monoclonal anti-NGF antibodies unconjugated and conjugated to β-galactosidase (Boehringer Mannheim). Chlorophenol red-β-galactopyranoside was used as the enzyme substrate, and standard curves were generated using mouse NGF. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate method as described previously (11Vigé X. Costa E. Wise B.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar). RNA (40 μg) was fractionated on a 1.1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and hybridized at 65°C for 24 h with an NGF 32P-labeled cRNA probe (specific activity of 8-9 × 108 cpm/μg)(11Vigé X. Costa E. Wise B.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The NGF cRNA probe was prepared by transcription with SP6 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) of a pGEM-3Z vector containing a 543-base pair cDNA encoding mouse β-NGF (9Dal Toso R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Costa E. Mocchetti I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 1190-1193PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vigé X. Costa E. Wise B.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar). Following hybridization, blots were washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Hybridization of RNA blots to 32P-labeled, randomly primed c-fos and c-jun cDNA probes was performed at 42°C for 24 h(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following exposure of blots to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Corp.) with intensifying screens for 1-2 days at −70°C, the radioactivity was removed by washing, and the blots rehybridized at 45°C with a 32P-labeled nick-translated p1B15 cDNA probe that hybridizes to mRNA encoding the structural protein cyclophilin. The amount of NGF mRNA was expressed in arbitrary units, defined as the ratio between the densitometric area of the NGF mRNA hybridization and that of the cyclophilin mRNA hybridization. Nuclei were prepared from 5 × 107 astroglial cells and incubated at 37°C for 40 min with 100 μCi each of [32P]CTP and [32P]GTP (Amersham Corp.) to label the in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts as described previously(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After two deoxyribonuclease (30 μg/ml) and proteinase K (0.15 mg/ml) digestions (each for 30 min at 37°C), nascent labeled RNA was extracted 3 times with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The labeled RNA transcripts were hybridized at 45°C for 4 days to plasmids containing the NGF, p1B15, c-fos, and c-jun cDNA inserts(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which had been linearized with EcoRI, denatured, and slot blotted (about 5 μg) onto nitrocellulose paper. Blots were also prepared with the parent pGEM-3Z plasmid without the cDNA inserts to control for nonspecific hybridization. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice (60 min each) at 45°C with buffer A (10 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA) containing 0.1% SDS, washed twice (1 min each) at 45°C with buffer A, and then incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. The blots were washed 2 times (60 min each time) at 45°C with buffer A plus 0.1% SDS followed by exposure to Hyperfilm-MP with intensifying screens for 3-6 days at −70°C. Transcriptional rates were expressed as the ratio between the density of the NGF and cyclophilin hybridizations after correction for nonspecific background hybridization. Protein determinations were performed with the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad using γ-globulin as a standard. One-way analysis of variance followed by the multiple comparison Neuman-Keuls test was used for statistical analysis of the data. OA was used to examine the role of protein dephosphorylation pathways in the regulation of NGF expression. Primary cultures of astrocytes were treated with OA (30 nM), and, at various times of treatment, total cellular RNA was isolated. Northern blot analysis showed that OA elicited a dramatic induction of NGF mRNA content, whereas it had only small effects on the levels of p1B15 mRNA, which was used as a reference for selective quantification of NGF mRNA content (Fig. 1). The results of several such experiments are summarized in Fig. 2, where it is evident that the increase in NGF mRNA peaked between 18 and 24 h of OA treatment and was maintained for up to 48 h before declining by about 60% at 72 h. Removal of OA after 24 h of treatment by washing the cells led to a decline of NGF mRNA over a period of 5 h (Fig. 2), indicating the reversibility of OA's effects. OA also increased cell content of NGF by about 12-fold following 48 h of incubation with 30 nM OA, while NGF accumulation in the medium was stimulated up to 100-fold over basal levels of secretion after 72 h of OA treatment (Fig. 2). NGF secreted into the medium was biologically active because conditioned medium from OA-treated astrocytes stimulated neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of NGF expression in astrocytes stimulated with OA. Astrocytes were treated with OA (30 nM) for the indicated times. After 24 h of treatment, some dishes were washed with fresh medium to remove OA and then incubated for the times indicated (dottedline). Total RNA was extracted, and NGF mRNA content was determined by Northern blot hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NGF content in the cells and culture medium was determined by the NGF-EIA. The data are expressed as percent of respective control (vehicle-treated) values measured at each time point and are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dose-dependent effect of OA on NGF secretion (during 24 h) is shown in Fig. 3. OA was effective over a narrow range of concentrations with maximal activation seen at 30 nM OA. Identical concentration-dependent effects of OA were seen on NGF mRNA accumulation. The efficacy of OA was limited by its toxicity, which became apparent at concentrations greater than 50 nM. OA, at these higher concentrations, induced morphological changes (observed by phase contrast microscopy), manifested as rounding and shrinking of cells, and detachment of cells from the culture dish. These changes were associated with DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomal fragments ( 2S. P. Pshenichkin and B. C. Wise, manuscript in preparation. )(assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis) characteristic of apoptosis. The potent induction of NGF expression by OA was not related to these cellular changes because staurosporine (see below) or dexamethasone2 inhibited the induction of NGF by OA but failed to block the morphological changes and DNA fragmentation induced by OA. Treatment of cells with different concentrations of calyculin A, an inhibitor with a different spectrum of phosphatase inhibitory activity compared to OA(23Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), failed to induce NGF secretion (Fig. 3), but induced similar cell morphological changes as did OA. Astrocytes were treated with 100 nM staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor that blocks PKC- and non-PKC-dependent secretion of NGF(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Staurosporine significantly blocked the increase in NGF mRNA, cellular NGF, and secreted NGF induced by OA (Fig. 4), suggesting that a basal level of protein phosphorylation is necessary for the action of OA. Because NGF expression in nonneuronal cells is enhanced by PKC activation(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26D'Mello S. Heinrich G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Neveu I. Jehan F.

Res. 1993; 34: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we examined the role of PKC in the induction of NGF by OA. Down-regulating PKC activity by prolonged treatment (24 h) with TPA failed to affect OA's action (Fig. 5). Under control conditions (i.e. minus TPA pretreatment), TPA and OA treatment increased NGF secretion (during 24 h) by 700 and 2100 pg/mg of protein, respectively, above control levels (Fig. 5, leftcolumns). Following pretreatment with TPA for 24 h, the addition of fresh TPA failed to further stimulate NGF secretion compared with pretreatment control, demonstrating a reduction of PKC activity (Fig. 5, rightcolumns). OA stimulated NGF accumulation by about 2200 pg/mg of protein under these conditions of PKC down-regulation (Fig. 5, rightcolumns). Similar results were seen when NGF mRNA content was estimated under identical conditions (data not shown). To further support the noninvolvement of PKC in OA's action, astrocytes were treated simultaneously with maximally active concentrations of TPA (100 nM) and OA (30 nM) for 24 h. NGF secretion during this time was 108 ± 6 pg/mg of protein (n = 4 determinations) in control cells, 945 ± 20 in TPA-treated cells, 3000 ± 280 in OA-treated cells, and 5200 ± 420 in TPA- and OA-treated cells. This additive action of the two agents and the results of the PKC down-regulation experiments demonstrate that OA affects protein phosphorylation pathways different from those regulated by PKC in enhancing NGF expression.Figure 5Effect of TPA pretreatment on OA- and TPA-stimulated NGF secretion. Astrocytes were pretreated with (rightcolumns) or without (leftcolumns) TPA (100 nM) for 24 h. The medium was then changed, fresh TPA (100 nM) or OA (20 nM) was added, and cells were incubated for 24 h. The amount of NGF secreted into the medium was measured, and the values are the means ± S.E. of four determinations each assayed in duplicate. Similar results were found in three additional experiments. ∗, p < 0.05 compared with respective controls; analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on our previous studies showing that IL-1 stimulates NGF expression in a PKC-independent manner(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a possible interaction between OA and IL-1 was investigated. Astrocytes were treated simultaneously with IL-1 (at the maximal concentration of 10 units/ml) and with 3 or 30 nM OA for 24 h. IL-1 by itself gave about a 5-fold increase in NGF secretion, while in the presence of an ineffective concentration of OA (3 nM, see Fig. 3) NGF secretion was increased by about 22-fold (Fig. 6). Treatment with IL-1 and a maximal concentration of OA (30 nM, see Fig. 3) failed to significantly increase NGF accumulation in the medium above that produced by OA alone (Fig. 6). These results indicate a synergism and nonadditivity in the action of OA and IL-1, suggesting that these two agents act via a common mechanism to induce NGF expression. The elevation of NGF mRNA content by OA may be a result of mRNA stabilization and/or gene transcription. To examine NGF mRNA stability, we estimated the half-life of the mRNA following inhibition of gene transcription with actinomycin D. Astrocytes were treated with OA for 9 or 26 h prior to the addition of actinomycin D. Total RNA was isolated from cells at different times and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with the NGF cRNA probe (Fig. 7). The half-life (t1/2) of the NGF mRNA under control conditions was 26 ± 3 min (n = 5 experiments), while OA treatment of astrocytes for 26 h increased the t1/2 to 110 ± 22 min (n = 5 experiments). OA treatment of cells for 9 h produced comparable increases in the NGF mRNA half-life as seen after 26 h of treatment (Fig. 7). To establish whether the induction of NGF mRNA by OA was due to an increased rate of gene transcription in addition to mRNA stabilization, nuclear run-on assays were performed with nuclei from control and OA-treated astrocytes. Radiolabeled nascent RNA transcripts were hybridized to NGF, cyclophilin (p1B15), and pGEM-3Z cDNAs immobilized on nitrocellulose paper (Fig. 8). Compared with the slight increase in p1B15 gene transcription after 9 and 26 h of OA treatment, in three separate experiments, OA stimulated by 1.5 ± 0.2-fold the NGF gene transcriptional rate after 26 h of treatment (Fig. 8). Since the NGF gene contains a functional AP-1 transcriptional regulatory element(21D'Mello S.R. Heinrich G. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), induction of the IEGs c-fos and c-jun by OA was examined to elucidate a possible involvement of these genes in increasing the NGF gene transcriptional rate. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that OA maximally stimulated c-fos and c-jun gene transcription after 3 h of treatment (Fig. 8). The relative increase in c-fos and c-jun transcription, compared with that of p1B15, was 1.6 ± 0.2-fold and 1.8 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3), respectively. Measurement of the mRNA content for these IEGs reflected the results of the transcription assays. OA treatment induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA content with maximal increases seen between 3 and 6 h of treatment (Fig. 9). It is significant to note that c-fos mRNA content remained elevated above control levels even after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 9), indicating a prolonged expression of this mRNA similar to that seen with NGF mRNA. Previous studies have implicated PKC and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation mechanisms in the regulation of NGF expression in primary cultures of astrocytes(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci.

Brain Res. 1992; 570: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Carman-Krzan M. Wise B.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), astroglioma cells(4Schwartz J.P. Chuang D.M. Costa E. Brain Res. 1977; 137: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Dal Toso R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Costa E. Mocchetti I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 1190-1193PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mocchetti I. De Bernardi M.A. Szekely A.M. Alho H. Brooker G. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3891-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts(26D'Mello S. Heinrich G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now show that OA, but not calyculin A, dramatically increased steady state NGF mRNA levels and NGF production in primary cultures of astrocytes. Because OA inhibits phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A with greater potency than protein phosphatase 1 and because calyculin A inhibits protein phosphatase 1 about 100-fold better than OA(23Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), the difference in action of these two inhibitors on NGF expression may be a result of protein phosphatase 2A inhibition by OA. However, there is insufficient evidence at present to conclusively state that protein phosphatase 2A inhibition is responsible for the stimulation of NGF expression in astrocytes. The action of OA did require a basal level of protein phosphorylation activity because staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, significantly blocked OA's stimulatory effects on NGF expression. Moreover, the effects of OA were observed under conditions of PKC down-regulation, indicating that PKC activity was not required in the mechanism of action of OA. Because IL-1 acted synergistically with OA, it is apparent that the signal transduction processes activated by IL-1 converge with the inhibition of phosphoprotein phosphatases by OA to augment NGF expression. As suggested by Guy et al.(24Guy G.R. Cao X. Chua S.P. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1846-1852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IL-1 may inactivate a protein phosphatase similar to the action of OA, or it may stimulate, through activation of protein kinases, the phosphorylation of proteins. By either mechanism, OA and IL-1 treatment would lead to a net increase in the phosphorylation state of proteins critical for the activation of NGF gene expression in astrocytes. One cellular mechanism, although not the major one, by which OA increases NGF expression in astrocytes is by activation of NGF gene transcription (Fig. 8). Indirect evidence indicates that the induction of NGF gene expression by activators of protein kinases is mediated by an induction of IEGs, such as c-fos and c-jun(10Mocchetti I. De Bernardi M.A. Szekely A.M. Alho H. Brooker G. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3891-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein products of IEGs form a functional transcription complex that binds to an AP-1 regulatory DNA element in the first intron of the NGF gene and thereby activates its transcription(21D'Mello S.R. Heinrich G. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). OA has been shown to stimulate c-fos gene transcription as well as c-fos mRNA stabilization in NIH3T3 cells(29Schonthal A. Tsukitani Y. Feramisco J.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that OA increased IEG transcription and IEG mRNA content (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) in astrocytes. It is significant to note that c-fos mRNA content induced by OA was prolonged such that by 24 h after treatment, c-fos mRNA was still about 5-fold higher than control levels (Fig. 9), an effect due probably to a stabilization of the c-fos mRNA by OA(29Schonthal A. Tsukitani Y. Feramisco J.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). This late elevation in c-fos mRNA content coincided with the induction of NGF gene transcription by OA. These results are consistent with the notion that IEG activation is involved in NGF gene transcription stimulated by OA, as well as by IL-1 and TPA as reported in other studies(16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, since there is a time delay between the maximal induction by OA of c-fos and c-jun compared with NGF, other cellular influences may be controlling NGF gene transcription. For example, the strong repressor element in the NGF promoter (21D'Mello S.R. Heinrich G. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) may overide the AP-1 stimulatory element and, therefore, may need to be inactivated prior to a stimulation of NGF gene transcription in astrocytes. The most prominent action of OA on astroglial NGF gene expression was to increase the half-life of the rather unstable NGF mRNA. In control astrocytes, NGF mRNA declined following actinomycin D inhibition of gene transcription with an apparent half-life of about 30 min as seen in other studies(11Vigé X. Costa E. Wise B.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 186-192PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pshenichkin S.P. Szekely A.M. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Lindholm D. Heumann R. Hengerer B. Thoenen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16348-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OA treatment for 9 or 26 h increased the NGF mRNA half-life by about 4-fold (Fig. 7), and, in preliminary studies, this stabilization of NGF mRNA was seen as early as 3 h of OA treatment. The short half-life of the NGF mRNA is similar to cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs, which are rapidly degraded and, hence, transiently expressed(30Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 31Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A common feature of the mRNAs coding for cytokines and proto-oncogenes is the presence of an AU-rich region including repetitive AUUUA sequences in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of their mRNAs, which have been implicated as determinants of the destabilization of these mRNA species(30Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 31Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Computer sequence analysis of the 3′-UTR of the NGF mRNA from different species (rat, mouse, guinea pig, and humans) indicates a high degree of sequence homology in an AU-rich region of the 3′-UTR and the presence of one to two AUUUA sequences within this region. This RNA domain may serve an important functional role in NGF mRNA regulation, perhaps acting as a determinant of its stability. The binding of proteins to nucleotide sequences in the 3′-UTR of various mRNA species has led to the hypothesis that trans-acting protein factors may serve to regulate the rate of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation(31Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 33Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Science. 1989; 246: 870-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have identified by Northwestern blotting procedures a protein that binds to an RNA probe encompassing the AU-rich region of the NGF mRNA 3′-UTR and which is induced in astrocytes by OA treatment under identical conditions that increase NGF mRNA half-life. ( 3B. Tang and B. C. Wise, manuscript in preparation. )This protein, by binding to the destabilizing AU-rich region of the NGF mRNA 3′-UTR, might slow the rate of degradation of the mRNA. The results in this report demonstrate a dual action of OA on NGF expression in astrocytes; an early and prolonged stabilization of the NGF mRNA followed by an activation of NGF gene transcription possibly mediated by an induction of IEGs. Both actions lead to dramatic increases in NGF mRNA content followed by NGF secretion in astrocytes. Glial cell production of NGF following neuronal injury or neurodegeneration might limit the extent of neuronal loss and promote regenerative processes to restore neuronal function(6Carman-Krzan M. Vigé X. Wise B.C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Lu B. Yokoyama M. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. J.

Of major future interest would be to see whether similar increases in NGF production by OA occurs in vivo, and if so, whether such increases would promote neuronal survival in animal models of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2070711095,"Aciculin is a recently identified 60-kDa cytoskeletal protein, highly homologous to the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucomutase type 1, (Belkin, A. M., Klimanskaya, I. V., Lukashev, M. E., Lilley, K., Critchley, D., and Koteliansky, V. E. (1994) J. Cell Sci. 107, 159-173). Aciculin expression in skeletal muscle is developmentally regulated, and this protein is particularly enriched at cell-matrix adherens junctions of muscle cells (Belkin, A. M., and Burridge, K.(1994) J. Cell Sci. 107, 1993-2003). The purpose of our study was to identify cytoskeletal protein(s) interacting with aciculin in various cell types. Using immunoprecipitation from cell lysates of metabolically labeled differentiating C2C12 muscle cells with anti-aciculin-specific antibodies, we detected a high molecular weight band (Mr∼ 400,000), consistently coprecipitating with aciculin. We showed that this 400 kDa band comigrated with dystrophin and immunoblotted with anti-dystrophin antibodies. The association between aciculin and dystrophin in C2C12 cells was shown to resist Triton X-100 extraction and the majority of the complex could be extracted only in the presence of ionic detergents. In the reverse immunoprecipitation experiments, aciculin was detected in the precipitates with different anti-dystrophin antibodies. Immunodepletion experiments with lysates of metabolically labeled C2C12 myotubes showed that aciculin is a major dystrophin-associated protein in cultured skeletal muscle cells. Double immunostaining of differentiating and mature C2C12 myotubes with antibodies against aciculin and dystrophin revealed precise colocalization of these two cytoskeletal proteins throughout the process of myodifferentiation in culture. In skeletal muscle tissue, both proteins are concentrated at the sarcolemma and at myotendinous junctions. In contrast, utrophin, an autosomal homologue of dystrophin, was not codistributed with aciculin in muscle cell cultures and in skeletal muscle tissues. Analytical gel filtration experiments with purified aciculin and dystrophin showed interaction of these proteins in vitro, indicating that their association in skeletal muscle is due to direct binding. Whereas dystrophin was shown to be a major aciculin-associated protein in skeletal muscle, immunoblotting of anti-aciculin immunoprecipitates with antibodies against utrophin showed that aciculin is associated with utrophin in cultured A7r5 smooth muscle cells and REF52 fibroblasts. Immunodepletion experiments performed with lysates of metabolically labeled A7r5 cells demonstrated that aciculin is a major utrophin-binding protein in this cell type. Taken together, our data show that aciculin is a novel dystrophin- and utrophin-binding protein. Association of aciculin with dystrophin (utrophin) in various cell types might provide an additional cytoskeletal-matrix transmembrane link at sites where actin filaments terminate at the plasma membrane. Aciculin is a recently identified 60-kDa cytoskeletal protein, highly homologous to the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucomutase type 1, (Belkin, A. M., Klimanskaya, I. V., Lukashev, M. E., Lilley, K., Critchley, D., and Koteliansky, V. E. (1994) J. Cell Sci. 107, 159-173). Aciculin expression in skeletal muscle is developmentally regulated, and this protein is particularly enriched at cell-matrix adherens junctions of muscle cells (Belkin, A. M., and Burridge, K.(1994) J. Cell Sci. 107, 1993-2003). The purpose of our study was to identify cytoskeletal protein(s) interacting with aciculin in various cell types. Using immunoprecipitation from cell lysates of metabolically labeled differentiating C2C12 muscle cells with anti-aciculin-specific antibodies, we detected a high molecular weight band (Mr∼ 400,000), consistently coprecipitating with aciculin. We showed that this 400 kDa band comigrated with dystrophin and immunoblotted with anti-dystrophin antibodies. The association between aciculin and dystrophin in C2C12 cells was shown to resist Triton X-100 extraction and the majority of the complex could be extracted only in the presence of ionic detergents. In the reverse immunoprecipitation experiments, aciculin was detected in the precipitates with different anti-dystrophin antibodies. Immunodepletion experiments with lysates of metabolically labeled C2C12 myotubes showed that aciculin is a major dystrophin-associated protein in cultured skeletal muscle cells. Double immunostaining of differentiating and mature C2C12 myotubes with antibodies against aciculin and dystrophin revealed precise colocalization of these two cytoskeletal proteins throughout the process of myodifferentiation in culture. In skeletal muscle tissue, both proteins are concentrated at the sarcolemma and at myotendinous junctions. In contrast, utrophin, an autosomal homologue of dystrophin, was not codistributed with aciculin in muscle cell cultures and in skeletal muscle tissues. Analytical gel filtration experiments with purified aciculin and dystrophin showed interaction of these proteins in vitro, indicating that their association in skeletal muscle is due to direct binding. Whereas dystrophin was shown to be a major aciculin-associated protein in skeletal muscle, immunoblotting of anti-aciculin immunoprecipitates with antibodies against utrophin showed that aciculin is associated with utrophin in cultured A7r5 smooth muscle cells and REF52 fibroblasts. Immunodepletion experiments performed with lysates of metabolically labeled A7r5 cells demonstrated that aciculin is a major utrophin-binding protein in this cell type. Taken together, our data show that aciculin is a novel dystrophin- and utrophin-binding protein. Association of aciculin with dystrophin (utrophin) in various cell types might provide an additional cytoskeletal-matrix transmembrane link at sites where actin filaments terminate at the plasma membrane."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, substitution of Arg and Ala for the amino acid residues immediately N-terminal to the active site tyrosine in the yeast and human DNA topoisomerase I mutants, top1 vac, results in camptothecin resistance. To examine the mechanism of drug resistance, we assessed the sensitivity of these enzymes to several classes of DNA topoisomerase poisons. Yeast cells expressing the camptothecin-resistant top1 vac mutants were resistant to all of the camptothecin derivatives cytotoxic to wild-type TOP1-expressing cells. This correlated with a significant reduction in drug-induced DNA cleavage in vitro. However, the yeast and human mutant enzymes differed in their responses to the minor groove binding ligand netropsin and to saintopin, a DNA intercalator that targets both DNA topoisomerase I and II. The yeast mutant enzyme demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to the action of saintopin but was resistant to the inhibitory effects of netropsin. In contrast, the human Top1 vac enzyme was resistant to saintopin and indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme in its response to the netropsin.

INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases catalyze changes in DNA topology through cycles of transient DNA strand breakage and religation (reviewed in (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

During this process, the active site tyrosine in eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I becomes covalently linked to the 3′-end of a single-stranded nick in the DNA duplex, while DNA topoisomerase II becomes linked to staggered 5′-ends of the cleaved DNA duplex. These enzymes play a critical role in DNA replication and transcription and have been shown to be the targets of an ever increasing number of anti-tumor agents(1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

We previously reported that substitutions in the conserved amino acid residues preceding the active site tyrosine (Tyr-727) in yeast DNA topoisomerase I affect the camptothecin sensitivity of these enzymes in vivo and in vitro(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the Sctop1 mutant, Sctop1N726L, exchanging Leu for Asn-726 resulted in a decrease in enzyme activity and drug sensitivity. Substitution of Arg for Ile-725 and Ala for Asn-726 in the mutant Sctop1 vac had no detectable effect on the specific activity of the enzyme, but dramatically reduced the camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme(30Knab A.M.

Saintopin is a DNA intercalator that interferes with the catalytic activity of both eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I and II(27Yamashita Y. Kawada S. Fujii N. Nakano H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5838-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hoechst 33258 and netropsin are members of a class of minor groove binding ligands that preferentially bind AT rich DNA(26Chen A.Y. Yu C. Gatto B. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8131-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, Hoechst 33258, like DNA intercalators, causes an unwinding of DNA at high concentrations, while netropsin increases the winding of the DNA helix(33Snounou G. Malcolm A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that in comparison to the yeast wild-type enzyme, the ScTop1 vac enzyme was resistant to all camptothecin analogs tested, yet exhibited enhanced DNA nicking in the presence of saintopin and decreased sensitivity to netropsin-mediated inhibition of DNA relaxation. In contrast, the camptothecin-resistant hTop1 vac enzyme was resistant to saintopin and indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme in its response to netropsin. These results demonstrate specific alterations in the function of the yeast mutant enzyme and suggest a model to explain our earlier observations that expression of Sctop1 vac, but not htop1 vac, produced sufficient DNA damage in yeast to cause rad52 cell death and hyper-recombination of the tandemly repeated rRNA genes (31Bjornsti M.-A.

Wall (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). These compounds were resuspended in Me2SO at a final concentration of 10 mM. Solutions of 20 mM Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) and 20 mM netropsin (Boehringer Mannheim) were prepared in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM Na2EDTA. Aliquots of all stock solutions were stored at −20°C and thawed just prior to use.S. cerevisiae strains JN2-134 (MATa, rad52::LEU2, trp1, ade2-1, his7, ura3-52, ise1, top1-1, leu2) and JCW1 (MATa, his4-539, lys2-801, ura3-52, top1::HIS4) have been described(15Bjornsti M.-A.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar), the multicopy yeast vectors YEpGAL1-TOP1 and YEpGAL1-hTOP1 harbor ScTOP1 and hTOP1 cDNA sequences, respectively, under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The plasmid YEpGAL1-top1 vac was constructed by replacing wild-type ScTOP1 sequences in plasmid YEpGAL1-TOP1 with a 2.9-kilobase pair BamHI-XhoI DNA fragment obtained from plasmid YCpGAL1-top1 vac(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated sequences in Sctop1 vac substitute Arg for Ile-725 and Ala for Asn-726. Similar substitutions were engineered N-terminal to the active site tyrosine (Tyr-723) in the human mutant htop1 vac(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant sequences were excised from plasmid YCpGAL1-htop1 vac in a SnaB1-BstXI DNA fragment and exchanged for the corresponding wild-type sequences in plasmid YEpGAL1-hTOP1, to yield plasmid YEpGAL1-htop1 vac.To clone a preferred DNA topoisomerase I cleavage site, identified in Tetrahymena rRNA gene sequences(34Anderson A.H.

Plasmid pBlueAK3-1 contained a single insert in the desired orientation. To facilitate the preparation of single 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments, the cleavage site in pBlueAK3-1 was cloned into plasmid pHC624(35Boros I. Posfai G. Venetianer P. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A BglII site was first introduced into the PvuII site of pHC624, using commercially available DNA linkers. Following the sequential addition of BamHI and BglII DNA linkers into the PvuII sites of plasmid pBlueAK3-1, a 480-base pair BamHI-BglII DNA fragment containing the strong DNA cleavage site was excised and inserted into the 1565-base pair BamHI-BglII backbone of plasmid pHC624 to yield pHCAK3-1.Drug Sensitivity of Yeast Cells Expressing DNA Topoisomerase I MutantsYeast strain JN2-134 was transformed with the multi-copy PGAL1-TOP1 constructs by treatment with lithium acetate (36Ito H.

To prepare replicate plates, approximately 107 cells were spread onto SC ura− glucose plates and replica plated onto SC ura− glucose plates supplemented with 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), and 0.25% Me2SO. Antibiotic assay filter discs (Schleicher & Schuell), 5 mm in diameter, were placed on the replicate plates and impregnated with 15 μl of stock solution of the indicated drugs or Me2SO alone; 5 μl of methanol was added to facilitate drug diffusion. Following incubation at 30°C, drug cytotoxicity was evidenced by a zone of clearing around the discs.Purification of ScTop1 and hTop1 ProteinsGalactose-induced expression and purification of ScTop1 and ScTop1 vac enzymes from 9-liter cultures of yeast strain JCW1 was essentially as described (30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. JCW1 cells transformed with plasmids YEpGAL1-TOP1, or YEpGAL1-top1 vac, were induced for 8 h with 2% galactose in SC ura− raffinose media. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml/g wet cells TEEG buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 0.2 M KCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The cells were subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle at −80°C, lysed by vortexing in a Bead Beater (Biospec), as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the extracts cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Following successive ammonium sulfate fractionations, the 35-75% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in TEEG buffer. The conductivity of the sample was adjusted to match that of TEEG + 0.2 M KCl, and the proteins applied to a 50-ml phosphocellulose column. The bound proteins were eluted with an increasing gradient of 0.2-0.8 M KCl in 500 ml of TEEG buffer and fractions containing DNA topoisomerase I protein, as determined by DNA relaxation assays, were pooled and adjusted to 0.9 M ammonium sulfate. This sample was applied to a 50-ml phenyl-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with TEEG + 0.9 M ammonium sulfate and eluted with a linear 0.9-0 M ammonium sulfate gradient in 500 ml of TEEG. This chromatographic step yielded homogeneous preparations of ScTop1 and ScTop1 vac proteins; however, the proteins were further concentrated by a final phosphocellulose chromatography step. The conductivity of the pooled phenyl-Sepharose column fractions was adjusted to match that of TEEG + 0.2 M KCl. The protein was applied to a 1.0-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated with TEEG + 0.2 M KCl, and eluted with 2 ml of TEEG + 0.6 M KCl. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and individual fractions were adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at −80°C.A partial purification of human DNA topoisomerase I proteins from 2 liters of galactose-induced cells was achieved by phosphocellulose column chromatography of the 35-75% ammonium sulfate pellet as described previously(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were adjusted to 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C.DNA topoisomerase I protein levels and integrity, in all column fractions, were assessed by immunostaining of the proteins fractions following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting onto nitrocellulose filters. The yeast and human proteins were visualized following incubation of the blots with specific sera obtained from rabbits or scleroderma patients, respectively, and immunostaining with the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody as described by Promega Corp. The purity of the ScTop1 and ScTop1 vac proteins was assessed by silver staining the proteins resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as per the manufacturer's directions (Bio-Rad).DNA Relaxation AssaysDNA topoisomerase I activity was assayed in in vitro DNA relaxation reactions(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bjornsti M.-A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8971-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Homogeneous or partially purified enzyme preparations were incubated in 20-μl reaction volumes containing 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (pHC624 or pBlueAK3-1), 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and KCl at a final 100 or 150 mM. Yeast enzyme activity was assayed at 30°C, while human enzymes were assayed at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS and the reaction products electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in 0.1 M Tris borate buffer at 5 V/cm. The DNA was subsequently visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and photographed over a UV transilluminator. Negatively supercoiled and relaxed plasmid DNA topoisomers were quantitated by densitometry of negative images of the photographed gels. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to completely relax 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid under standard reaction conditions.DNA Unwinding AssaysThe ability of various drugs to reduce or increase DNA winding was assayed in the presence of relaxed plasmid DNA and DNA topoisomerase I. DNA relaxation reactions containing 0.3 μg of pBlueAK3-1, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 150 mM KCl and purified ScTop1 or ScTop1vac enzyme, were incubated for 30 min at 30°C so that the plasmid DNA was completely relaxed. The drug was then added to a final concentration ranging from 0.1 to 150 μM. After 30 min of incubation at 30°C, the samples were phenol-extracted and electrophoresed at 2 V/cm in either a 1% agarose gel in 0.1 M Tris borate buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, with buffer recirculation, or in a 1% agarose gel in 0.1 M Tris borate buffer without ethidium bromide. Drug-induced plasmid DNA winding or unwinding was evidenced by a concentration-dependent increase or decrease, respectively, in plasmid DNA linking number relative to the no drug control.DNA Nicking AssaysIn these assays, DNA relaxation reactions were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of camptothecin, saintopin or netropsin. The 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, 0.3 μg of pBlueAK3-1 DNA, and the enzyme and drug concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The Me2SO concentration was adjusted to a final 5% in assays involving Cpt and saintopin. After 30 min at 30°C for ScTop1 or 37°C for hTop1 proteins, the reactions were stopped with 1% SDS, heated briefly at 65°C, and treated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K for 60 min at 37°C. The DNA was then electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide as described above, and the relative amounts of nicked and closed circular DNA were assessed by densitometry.DNA Cleavage AssaysDrug-induced DNA topoisomerase I cleavage of DNA was quantitated as described previously(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pHCAK3-1 was cleaved with BglII; end-labeled by repairing the 3′ overhang with [32P]dATP, dNTPs, and Sequenase; and restricted with BamHI. The singly end-labeled 480-base pair DNA fragment containing the high affinity site was purified in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. Purified ScTop1 (78 units), ScTop1 vac (76 units), or partially purified hTop1 enzymes were incubated with 0.5 ng of labeled DNA (6,500 cpm/reaction) in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and a final drug concentration of 50 μM. Each assay was incubated for 30 min at 30°C for the yeast enzyme or 37°C for the human enzyme. Cleavable complexes were trapped by the addition of 1% SDS, heated to 75°C for 10 min, and digested with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. The DNA samples were ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in formamide-containing sample buffer, denatured at 75°C, and electrophoresed in an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel in 0.1 M Tris borate buffer at 50 V/cm for 3.5 h. The labeled DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography. The sites of drug-stabilized DNA cleavage were mapped by comparison with Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders derived from the same DNA substrate and run in parallel with the cleavage products.RESULTSThe Cytotoxic Activity of Camptothecin Analogs in Yeast Cells Expressing DNA Topoisomerase I MutantsSubstitution of Ile-725 and Asn-726 with Arg and Ala, respectively, in yeast DNA topoisomerase I and similar changes in human DNA topoisomerase I, had little effect on enzyme catalytic activity, yet rendered the enzymes resistant to Cpt-induced DNA cleavage(30Knab A.M.

A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, Δtop1 yeast cells expressing these top1 vac mutants were completely resistant to the drug. However, differences in the in vivo activity of the yeast and human enzymes were evidenced by the fact that PGAL1 promoted expression of Sctop1 vac, but not htop1 vac, proved lethal to rad52 yeast strains (30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As rad52 mutants are deficient in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks(13Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), these results suggested that overexpression of the Sctop1 vac mutant enzyme produced DNA lesions leading to DNA fragmentation. This idea is further supported by the dramatic increase in rDNA recombination induced by Sctop1 vac expression in RAD52+ cells(30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2To examine the activity of the Cpt-resistant top1 vac mutants in more detail, we wanted to determine the effects of these amino acid substitutions on enzyme sensitivity to other DNA topoisomerase poisons including several camptothecin analogs, minor groove binding ligands such as netropsin (26Chen A.Y. Yu C. Gatto B. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8131-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and saintopin, a DNA intercalator that stabilizes both DNA topoisomerase I and II cleavable complexes(27Yamashita Y. Kawada S. Fujii N. Nakano H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5838-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Cpt derivatives used in these studies include analogs currently in clinical trials (Tpt, SN-38 (the metabolically active form of Cpt-11), and 9-A Cpt) and several other derivatives containing A ring modifications (10-A Cpt, 11-A Cpt, 12-A Cpt, 9-C Cpt, 9-C,10,11-M Cpt, and 9-A,10,11-M Cpt)(16Kingsbury W.D.

MC1 preferentially binds to a 207-base pair relaxed DNA minicircle as compared with the linear fragment. Random binding is observed at very low ionic strength, and a slight increase in salt concentration highly favors the formation of a complex that corresponds to the binding of two MC1 molecules per DNA ring. Measurements of dissociation rates show that this complex is remarkably stable, and electron microscopy reveals that it is characterized by two diametrically opposed kinks.

These results are discussed in regard to the mechanisms by which MC1 affects DNA structure. Numerous chromosomal proteins have been found associated with prokaryotic nucleoids. These abundant, small, and usually basic proteins are generally referred to as histone-like proteins. Histone-like proteins compact DNA in vitro and can play essential roles in different cellular processes, but unlike eukaryotic histones, these proteins have not been shown to wrap DNA into stable, regular, and globular structures(1Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gualerzi C. Losso M.A. Friedrich K. Pawlik R.T. Canonaco M.A. Gianfranchesi G.L. Pingoud A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.

Touzel J.P. Albagnac G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 119-123Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the Methanosarcina sp.CHTI 55 strain, MC1 is a 93-amino acid polypeptide, exhibiting a marked hydrophillic character provided by a large number of basic and acid residues (24 and 14, respectively) and no hydrophobic domain(6Chartier F. Laine B. Belaiche D. Sautière P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7006-7015Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). With respect to the characteristic of its primary and secondary structure, and particularly the distribution of basic residues and the low α helix content, MC1 differs from eukaryotic histones and from eubacterial and other archaebacterial histone-like proteins (for a review, see (7Laine B. Chartier F. Imbert M. Sautière P. Belaiche J.P. Bruschi M. Garcia J.L. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Strict Anaerobes Involved in Interspecies Hydrogen Transfer.

Imbert M. Sautière P. Marion C. Chromatine, Édition du CNRS. 1991: 37-46Google Scholar, 9Chartier F. Laine B. Sautière P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On linear DNA fragments, MC1 binds to DNA as a monomer. At a very high protein/DNA ratio, MC1 covers DNA fragments, with a site size of about 11 bp; ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)EMelectron microscopy. )this binding is non-cooperative(10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been shown by photochemical cross-linking that its carboxyl-terminal region contains the DNA binding sequence(11Katouzian-Safadi M. Laine B. Chartier F. Cremet J.Y. Belaiche D. Sautière P. Charlier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although MC1, like all histone-like proteins, is not expected to exhibit absolute specificity for one particular sequence, we have recently identified a preferential binding sequence in an open reading frame of unknown function(12Teyssier C. Laine B. Gervais A. Maurizot J.C. Culard F. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). base pair(s) electron microscopy. A quite large DNA conformational change induced by the binding of MC1 has been detected by cyclization experiments on short DNA fragments. Indeed, as for protein HU, MC1 is able to promote the cyclization by T4 DNA ligase of DNA fragments of about 100 bp(13Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14621-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Laine B. Culard F. Maurizot J.C. Sautière P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further analyze the modifications of conformation and/or topological constraints of DNA induced by MC1, we investigated its binding to a 207-bp DNA minicircle. Indeed, DNA minicircles are a simple system providing valuable information on the structure of protein-DNA complexes(15Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Révet B. Le Bret M. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Eismann E. Müller-Hill B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Sasmor H. Betz J.L.

We show that a slight increase in salt concentration highly favors the formation of a stable complex that corresponds to the binding of two MC1 molecules per DNA minicircle. Furthermore, using gel retardation, we show that MC1 protein is able to induce at least two levels of DNA compaction on this small DNA ring. These different levels of compaction correspond to different configurations of the minicircles, each bound protein inducing a sharp bend of the DNA, as observed by electron microscopy. The 207-bp DNA fragment containing the lac promoteroperator region was isolated from a plasmid derived from pBR322 by EcoRI restriction cleavage(19Fuller F. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was 5′-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.), followed by a chase with cold ATP. DNA concentrations were determined by absorption spectrophotometry using an extinction coefficient of 13,000 M−1 cm−1/bp at 260 nm. Methanosarcina sp. CHTI 55 (DSM2906) was grown as indicated in Chartier et al.(5Chartier F. Laine B. Sautière P. Touzel J.P. Albagnac G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 119-123Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein MC1 was prepared as previously described(14Laine B. Culard F. Maurizot J.C. Sautière P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and concentration was determined by absorption spectrophotometry using an extinction coefficient of 11,000 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. To obtain DNA minicircles, 207-bp-labeled DNA fragments were incubated at a DNA concentration of 0.11 μg/ml in ligase buffer (66 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM dithioerythritol) in the presence of 20 units/ml of T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 90 min at 25°C. After phenol-chloroform protein extraction and ethanol precipitation, samples were loaded on preparative polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide) at room temperature in the presence of 0.6 μg/ml ethidium bromide in the gel and in the buffer (TBE = 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8). DNA minicircle molecules were extracted from gel slices and purified by phenol-chloroform treatment and Prepac chromatography columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). The presence of the intercalating agent during electrophoresis led to the separation of nicked and relaxed DNA minicircles. Complexes were prepared by mixing MC1 protein and linear or circular DNA fragments at different ratios of protein per DNA fragment. With the circular DNA fragments, the binding buffer was 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (TE buffer) in the absence or presence of NaCl and/or MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations. With the linear DNA fragment, the binding conditions were those described in (10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl). After equilibration for 10 min at room temperature, samples were mixed with 1/5 (v/v) of loading buffer (0.01% Bromphenol Blue, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 50% glycerol in TE) and loaded on a polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide) in TBE buffer. Pre-runs and runs of the electrophoresis were performed at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and autoradiographed with CGR films. The relative amount of DNA in each band was quantified with a β scanner (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). The theoretical curves of the distribution of the DNA in the various complexes are calculated according to the distribution of Poisson with P(X)=⟨X⟩Xe−⟨X⟩X!(Eq. 1) where P(X) is the percentage of complex bearing X-bound protein, and <X> is the average number of bound protein(10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine the dissociation rate constants, the DNA minicircles and the protein MC1 were mixed together to a final concentration of 13 pM and 170 nM, respectively, and incubated for 10 min in 80 mM NaCl in TE. A 50,000-fold excess of unlabeled supercoiled pUC8 plasmid DNA was then added as competitor DNA. After the indicated time, dissociation was stopped by loading the incubation mixture onto a running gel. Dissociation rates were determined as described by Riggs et al.(20Riggs A. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). DNA minicircle or DNA-MC1 complexes were purified by gel filtration on Sepharose micro-column (Superose 6B, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with a SMART system (Pharmacia). EM observations were performed as previously described (21Le Cam E. Théveny B. Mignotte B. Révet B. Delain E. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MC1 and DNA, at a protein/DNA minicircle r = 7, were incubated 20 min at room temperature, and the interacting molecules were observed by EM without any chemical fixation. 5 μl of the solution, containing 0.5 μg/ml DNA, were deposited onto a 600-mesh copper grid covered with a very thin carbon film activated by a glow discharge in the presence of pentylamine according to Dubochet et al.(22Dubochet J. Ducommun M. Zollinger M. Kellenberger E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1971; 35: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Grids were washed with aqueous 2% uranyl acetate, dried, and observed in annular dark field in a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. Using this spreading procedure, DNA molecules are rapidly adsorbed onto the carbon film with no major loss in the tri-dimensional information of their free conformation in solution(23Joanicot M. Révet B. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Individual molecules were directly analyzed at a final magnification of 560,000 on a Kontron Image Analysis System connected to the microscope through a TV camera, as previously described(24Muzard G. Théveny B. Révet B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Théveny B. Coulaud D. Le Bret M. Révet B. Structure and Expression: DNA Bending and Curvature. 3. Adenine Press, New York1988: 35-55Google Scholar). Length measurements of the DNA minicircle were done by using the X and Y coordinates obtained by digitization of the DNA images. To detect and identify all complexes formed between MC1 and a 207-bp DNA minicircle, we first investigated the MC1 binding at low ionic strength where, due to the electrostatic nature of the interaction, the binding constants should be relatively high. Fig. 1A shows the titration of the 207-bp DNA minicircles with increasing protein concentrations in TE buffer. Most of the complexes migrate faster than the free DNA. Only complexes formed with the higher amount of MC1 are not accelerated, and they migrate almost with the free DNA (laneG). MC1 binding should only lead to DNA retardation by increasing the frictional coefficient and by partial charge neutralization. Moreover, this unusual pattern is different from that obtained with a linear fragment, where all complexes migrate less rapidly than free DNA (Fig. 1B and (10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). Therefore, the accelerated migration of the DNA minicircles in the gel must be due to a drastic DNA conformational change inducing a reduction of the hydrodynamic volume of the minicircles and therefore leading to a compaction of the DNA. We identified the various complexes by their order of appearance on the gel. The first complex (C1) and more explicitly the second one (C2) are distinctly accelerated with respect to the free DNA (Fig. 1A, lanesA-D). Complexes are then regularly retarded with respect to complex C2. The third complex (C3, laneE) thus migrates faster than the fourth one (C4, laneF). Up to 12 types of complexes are visible on the gel. A quantitative analysis of the titration data with the circular and linear fragments is shown in Fig. 2. We scanned the autoradiographies and plotted the relative amount of each complex C1-C4 (expressed in DNA %) against the average number of bound protein per circular or linear DNA fragment. We then compared these experimental values with those calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. In the part of the titration, the relative amount of each complex increases progressively from C1 to C4. The same distribution of the complexes occurs with linear and circular DNA fragments, and it fits that calculated for a random process. Different conclusions can be drawn. First, MC1 binding to the minicircles is a random process under these conditions. No given complex is favored; the binding is both sequence and conformation independent. Furthermore, no cooperativity is detectable: the binding of one MC1 molecule does not seem to enhance the binding of an additional one. Second, in a previous work, we have shown that MC1 is bound to linear DNA fragments as a monomer(10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The similarity between the appearance of the complexes formed with the linear and circular DNA fragments strongly suggests that, as with a linear fragment, C1 corresponds to the binding of one MC1 monomer, C2, to the binding of two MC1 monomers and so forth. We tested the effect of salts (25 mM NaCl and 8 mM MgCl2) on MC1 binding (Fig. 3). The mobilities of the various complexes did not vary, but their proportions were modified, independent of the protein to DNA ratio. At low ratios (lanes1 and 2) salt addition decreases the amount of complex C1 and increases the total amount of complex C2. This effect induces nearly a doubling of the amount of bound MC1. At higher ratios (lanes3-5), salt addition induces the disappearance of complexes C3, C4, C5, etc. to the benefit of the appearance of complex C2. Therefore, the complex C2 is always favored by the salt increase, and there is a change of MC1 binding mode to become a non-random process. The differential effects of NaCl and MgCl2 on the binding are shown in Fig. 4. Mg2+ is more effective than Na+ in shifting from a random binding to complex C2 promotion mode, since similar results are obtained with either 4 mM MgCl2 or 75 mM NaCl. To compare the relative affinities of MC1 for linear and circular DNA, competition experiments between linear and circular 207-bp DNA fragments were performed. The results are shown in Fig. 5. We observed that complex C2 is preferentially formed with DNA minicircles; in lane4, about 98% of the linear fragments remain free, whereas only 11% of the minicircles are free, 78% being in the form of complex C2. The binding constants of MC1 for minicircles are actually distinctly higher than those for linear fragments. The interaction of MC1 with minicircles was also analyzed by kinetic experiments. The rate of dissociation of preformed complexes was studied by adding unlabeled plasmid DNA. Due to the large excess of plasmid versus DNA minicircles, the majority of any released MC1 protein should bind to this DNA rather than rebind to the minicircles. The dissociation was stopped by loading the samples on the gel, and the DNA distribution was followed up to 5 h (Fig. 6A). The amount of complex C2 decreases, whereas the amount of free DNA increases. Since no increase in complex C1 formation arises from complex C2, it is likely that the two bound MC1 molecules from complex C2 dissociate in the same time. The gel was scanned to measure the amount of bound DNA. The result is given in Fig. 6B, and the deduced half-life is 130 min. When the same experiment was done with a lower MC1 to DNA ratio, that is in conditions where the complex C1 is visible, a half-life of only 48 min was obtained for this complex (not shown). Furthermore, we observed that higher order complexes (C3, C4…) and all the complexes formed with the linear fragment (C1, C2, C3…) are immediately dissociated, showing that their half-lives are shorter than 1 min (not shown). These results are consistent with the observations that, first, the complexes C3, C4 … are dissociated by a slight salt increase (Fig. 3) and, second, that MC1 preferentially binds to the DNA minicircles (Fig. 5). Clearly, the complex C1 and especially the complex C2 formed on DNA minicircles are remarkably more stable than the other MC1-minicircle complexes and that all the complexes formed with the linear fragment. EM was used to obtain more information about the conformation of the DNA responsible for the increased electrophoretic mobility of the DNA minicircles (Fig. 7 and 8). As expected from its size, MC1 bound to the DNA molecules could not be directly visualized. In TE buffer, control minicircles show a smooth profile (Fig. 7a), whereas the MC1-DNA complexes present clear kinks, in various numbers, which could be assimilated to complexes C1, C2, C3…, even if a strict attribution to these different types cannot be done unambiguously for each molecule. The various combinations of kinks visualized are consistent with the results obtained with gel retardation experiments, which revealed the existence of a mixture of different types of complexes. In 80 mM NaCl, conditions favoring complex C2, the difference between controls (Fig. 8a) and MC1-DNA complexes (Fig. 8, b-h) is far more evident than in TE; most minicircles complexed with MC1 are spindle shaped with two diametrically opposed kinks, thus leading the tapered shape that makes the molecule more compact. No loop induced by protein-protein interactions could be found. The different types of configuration of the minicircles observed reveal different aspects of the kinks. Some indicate a single (Fig. 8c) or two sharp bends (Fig. 8f), the DNA minicircle appearing to be in plane. Others show sharp bends associated with a torsional stress inducing a local twisting of the DNA (Fig. 8, d, e, and h). This torsional stress is always localized around the kink, and only a few figure 8 shapes can be observed (<0.1%). Measurement of the DNA molecules' contour length indicates no significant difference between free and MC1complexed minicircles. This invalidates the hypothesis of a DNA wrapping of more than one turn around MC1. The most typical selected molecules of Fig. 8, c-h, show that a strict discrimination on individual minicircles between C1 and C2 types is not possible, owing to the flexibility of the DNA molecules that present non-discrete shapes so that no strict classification can be made. In archaebacteria as in eubacteria, the organization of the DNA is due to two classes of proteins: topoisomerases, which induce DNA torsional stress, and histone-like proteins whose role in DNA compaction is less well characterized. In the methanogenes of the Methanosarcinaceae family, the histone-like protein MC1 is both highly conserved and abundant (1 protein/150 bp)(26Imbert M. Laine B. Prensier G. Touzel J.P. Sautière P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1988; 34: 931-937Crossref Google Scholar). Our aim was to understand the effect of this protein on DNA conformation and whether it can contribute to DNA packaging. In this paper, the interaction between MC1 and a 207-bp relaxed DNA minicircle was investigated. The complexes were first identified at low ionic strength, and binding was shown to be sequence and conformation independent. We then studied binding at higher ionic strength, where the formation of complex C2 was found to be highly favored. Although the stoichiometry of the complexes is not directly measured, the quasi-identical order of appearance of the complexes with the linear and circular fragments (Fig. 2) strongly suggests that, as in the case of linear fragments, the complex C2 arises from the binding of two MC1 monomers per minicircle. The fact that MC1 binding increases the electrophoretic mobility of DNA shows that MC1 compacts the DNA minicircles. This compaction is particularly significant for the complex C2. It is likely that only two levels of DNA compaction could be induced, since the binding of an additional MC1 molecule to complex C2 regularly retards the DNA migration. Similar behaviors of DNA minicircles on retardation gels have been previously reported for two different protein-induced DNA conformational changes. First, in the case of the Lac and Ara repressors, when the simultaneous binding of one protein to two DNA sites induces the DNA molecule to form a loop(16Eismann E. Müller-Hill B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Lobell R.B. Schleif R.F. Science. 1990; 250: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and second, in the case of chromatin, where DNA wraps around proteins(15Zivanovic Y. Goulet I. Révet B. Le Bret M. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Visualization of MC1-DNA complexes by EM excludes these two possibilities and shows that a tight DNA bending is responsible for the compaction of the minicircles. It is likely that MC1 preferentially binds to the minicircles since the DNA is already curved. For a 207-bp minicircle, the mean bending is 1.7° per base pair. One can therefore postulate that since MC1 binding bends the DNA, a prior bending of the double helix must decrease the energy required to change the DNA conformation and consequently would favor protein binding. One of the most important results of this study is that the complex C2 is highly favored with minicircles and not with linear fragments(10Culard F. Laine B. Sautière P. Maurizot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This difference probably results from the topological constraints existing on circular DNA and most particularly on short minicircles. It has been proposed that bent DNA converts Twist (Tw) into Writhe (Wr) in closed DNA. In the case of two intrinsic bends in phase and diametrically opposite, each bend should induce a local discontinuity of the twist and a conversion of this Tw into Wr(28Bauer W. Lund R. White J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the local variations of DNA conformation depend upon the contribution of the bending in the plane, resulting from modifications of the wedge angle and the torsional contribution that results from a modification of twist angles. The different kink configurations selected in Fig. 8(c-h) suggest that MC1 induces both a bending and a torsional stress in the DNA. We propose therefore that the binding of the first MC1 molecule induces at the opposite side of the minicircle a configuration that favors the binding of the second MC1 molecule required to obtain a stable complex C2. This configuration probably corresponds to an increase of the local curvature and/or a modification of the torsional constraints of the DNA. Furthermore, the complex C2 is probably so tapered and stable that the binding of additional MC1 molecules is energetically unfavored. At least three non-exclusive factors could explain that the complex C2 is only favored in the presence of salt (at least 4 mM MgCl2 or 75 mM NaCl). First, at low ionic strength, the binding constants are very large as demonstrated by fluorescence experiments (8Laine B. Culard F. Chartier F. Imbert M. Sautière P. Marion C. Chromatine, Édition du CNRS. 1991: 37-46Google Scholar) and, consequently, the lifetimes of the various complexes may be too long to allow the adjustment of equilibrium. Indeed, we observed that the half-lives of all of the complexes formed in TE buffer are longer than 4 h (not shown). Second, the conformation of the protein may change since we observed that the CD spectra of the protein in 10 mM Tris and in 10 mM Tris plus 1 mM MgCl2 are different. ( 2F. Culard, unpublished results. )Finally, a decrease in the DNA chain stiffness can be expected. The DNA stiffness can be explained, at least for a large part, by electrostatic repulsions between negative charges of the phosphates. When the ionic strength is increased, phosphate charges are effectively neutralized, and DNA flexibility increases. Reports in agreement with this point show that the persistence length of DNA strongly decreases upon addition of NaCl in the range of 0-0.1 M NaCl in the absence of Mg2+(29Kam Z. Borochov N. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2671-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Cairney K.L. Harrington R.E. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We previously showed that upon polymerization, MC1 binding favors cyclization of short linear DNA fragments by T4 DNA ligase. During this process, negatively supercoiled minicircles are formed. With a 207-bp DNA fragment, a −1 and −2 variation in the linking number of the DNA was observed, depending of the amount of MC1 complexed to the fragment(14Laine B. Culard F. Maurizot J.C. Sautière P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms can be responsible for a reduction of the linking number of a circular DNA by a protein in the presence of ligase or topoisomerase. EM visualization of the complexes allows us to exclude two of those mechanisms: DNA wrapping around MC1 as in the case of HU (1Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Broyles S. Pettijohn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and DNA looping as in the case of HMG proteins(32Sros M. Stokrova J. Thomas J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since MC1 protects DNA against thermal denaturation(9Chartier F. Laine B. Sautière P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a local strand separation is unlikely, and we can postulate that an untwisting of the double helix is certainly responsible for the reduction of the linking number of the DNA. In addition, this hypothesis is consistent with the configurations of the MC1 minicircle complexes shown in Fig. 8, d, e, and h, where a local twisting of the DNA can be seen. Bacterial chromatin is considered to be a dynamic structure(1Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gualerzi C. Losso M.A. Friedrich K.

Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1986: 101-134Crossref Google Scholar) where histone-like proteins dissociate rapidly from DNA(31Broyles S. Pettijohn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 33Krzycki J.A. Sandman K.M. Reeve J.N. Heslot H. Davies J. Florent J. Bobichon L. Durand G. Penasse L. Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Genetics of Industrial Microorganisms. Société Française de Microbiologie, Strasbourg, France1990: 603-610Google Scholar). Our results show that, depending on DNA conformation, remarkably stable complexes can be formed with histone-like proteins. In the same way, it has been recently shown that HU binds strongly to particular DNA structures containing sharp angles(34Pontiagga A. Negri A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 35Bonnefoy E. Takahashi M. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The fact that MC1 on the one hand can compact DNA and, on the other hand, can bind DNA non-randomly, is consistent with the importance of MC1 as a factor of chromosomal DNA organization. An attractive hypothesis would be that our results reveal a kind of phasing of MC1 binding to DNA. Such a phasing would not be due to signals on DNA but to the dramatic DNA conformational changes induced by the protein binding. We thank M. Barray for the preparation of the electron micrographs, M. Buckle for critical reading of the manuscript, and M. Charlier for numerous helpful discussions."

The class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility complexBLSbare lymphocyte syndromeCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. )present processed peptides derived from exogenous antigen to CD4-positive helper T cells(1Germain R.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes three functional isotypic forms of these molecules (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP), each of which is a disulfide-linked heterodimer of two transmembrane glycoproteins: an acidic α chain and a β chain. The genes encoding these polypeptides are clustered in discrete loci in the 1 megabase HLA-D region on the short arm of chromosome 6 (2Kappes D.J. Strominger J.l. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 991-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Unlike the related class I MHC molecules, which bind and present peptide antigen to cytotoxic T cells, class II MHC molecules are expressed only on a limited number of cell types such as dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages, and activated T cells, and the expression on these cell types is developmentally regulated(3Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The expression of the class II molecules can also be induced on normally class II-negative cells by specific cytokines such as interferon-γ or interleukin-4(4Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev.

These induction pathways are probably operating at sites of active immune response, where de novo expression of the class II molecules is frequently observed. major histocompatibility complex bare lymphocyte syndrome chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay. De novo expression of class II molecules is also observed at target sites in organ-specific autoimmune disease, and it has been hypothesized that this might trigger or exacerbate the disease by presentation of tissue-specific antigen to helper T cells(5Pujol-Borrell R. Todd I. Doshi M. Bottazzo G.F. Sutton R. Adolf G.R. Feldman M. Nature. 1987; 326: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In contrast, hereditary MHC class II deficiency, also called bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) results from the complete lack of expression of class II MHC molecules(6Reith W. Satola S. Sanchez C.H. Amaldi I. Lisowska-Grospiere B. Griscelli C. Hadam M.R. Mach B. Cell. 1988; 53: 897-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Patients afflicted with this autosomal recessive disease are prone to multiple infections and usually die during childhood. The potential association of these two types of disorders with aberrant class II MHC gene expression have prompted an intense analysis of the regulatory elements and transcription factors that control the proper expression of these genes(7Ting J.P.-Y. Immunol. Res. 1993; 12: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The regulation of the class II MHC genes is mainly transcriptional, and all of the class II proximal promoters studied to date contain highly conserved elements referred to as the X- and Y-boxes(3Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A number of DNA-binding proteins that interact with these and other less conserved sequences have been identified, and complementary DNAs encoding some of the factors have been molecularly cloned(4Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 13-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The regulatory roles of the individual recombinant proteins encoded by the cDNAs have been investigated via cotransfection or in vitro transcription and have been found to encode both activators and repressors of class II gene transcription(5Pujol-Borrell R.

While the different class II isotypes HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP are usually coordinately expressed, there is now abundant evidence that differential regulation of the class II genes occurs in particular cell types and in response to various stimuli(4Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 13-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 14Symington F.W. Levine F. Braun M. Brown S.L. Erlich H.A. Torok-Storb B. J.

Such differential regulation could result either from the use of different transcription factors or from mechanisms that would selectively inhibit the interaction of shared transcription factors with a subset of the class II gene promoters. Apriori, both mechanisms appear to be feasible. The genes encoding the α and β chain polypeptides of each isotype are located in distinct physically separate loci (approximately 350 kilobases separate the DP and DQ loci and approximately 100 kilobases separate the DQ and DR loci), which could easily accommodate distinct chromatin structures at each locus, resulting in differential accessibility of shared transcription factors. On the other hand, although the different class II genes share highly conserved X- and Y-box elements, the nucleotide sequence of intervening and surrounding regions of the proximal promoter diverge significantly. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for differential binding of specific transcription factors to the various class II promoters. Moreover, these two potential control mechanisms for differential expression are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We have previously described a mutant cell line, Clone-13, that expresses HLA-DQ in the absence of HLA-DR and -DP(16Ono S.J. Bazil V. Sugawara M. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using a variety of criteria, the differential expression of isotypes in this cell line was shown to result from a defect in (or operating through) a trans-acting factor since the transcriptionally silent genes in this cell line could be reactivated upon interspecific fusion with a MHC class II positive murine cell line. Transient transfection assays also indicated that the defective factor operated through the proximal promoter (between −141 base pairs and the transcription initiation site). To further study the molecular basis of defective transcription of a subset of the human class II MHC genes in this cell line, we have more precisely mapped the cis-elements that mediate this defect using a series of hybrid promoter constructs between the transcriptionally competent HLA-DQB gene and the transcriptionally silent HLA-DRA gene. The data indicate that the divergent X2-box found immediately 3′ of the consensus X1-box mediates the isotype-specific defect in this cell line and provides further evidence that this element may play a major role in determining the isotype-specific expression observed in vivo. Raji (ATCC CCL86), RJ2.2.5, 6.1.6, BLS-1, Clone-13, TF, Jurkat, JY, and Jijoye cells were all maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mM Hepes, 5 × 103 units/100 ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The cells were split 1:5 every 3 days. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at the same concentration as RPMI 1640 complete media. RJ2.2.5 is derived from the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji (DR2, DR10) after irradiation and immunoselection with class II-specific monoclonal antibodies and complement. Raji cells express all three class II isotypes, while RJ2.2.5 cells do not express any class II antigen. Jijoye cells (also originally from a Burkitt's lymphoma patient) were originally isolated by Pulvertaft and designated then as P3(17Henle W. Diehl V. Kohn G. zurHausen H. Henle G. Science. 1967; 157: 1064-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Jijoye cells also express all three class II isotypes. Hinuma et al.(18Hinuma Y. Konn M. Yamaguchi J. Wudarski D.J. Blakeslee J.R. Grace Jr., J.T. J. Virol. 1967; 1: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) then isolated subclones of the line in semisolid media and generated a line designated p3J-HR-1, which is a high producer of viral capsid antigen. Clone-13 cells were derived by further subcloning of the P3J HR-1 cell line with the aim of producing isogenic cell lines with varying efficiencies of conversion from the latent to lytic cycles of the virus (19Heston L. Rabson M. Brown N. Miller G. Nature. 1982; 295: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The HLA phenotype of the Clone-13 cell lines is class I positive, HLA-DQ positive (DQ1), HLA-DR, and -DP negative. 6.1.6 is a mutant B-LCL derived from the T5.1 cell line that does not express any of the class II genes(20Gladstone P. Pious D. Nature. 1978; 271: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). BLS-1 and TF are class II-negative cell lines derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome(21Benichou B. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4285-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). JY is a class II positive B-LCL, and Jurkat is a class II-negative T cell line. The previously described plasmids DQB160CAT, DRA 1028CAT, and DRA300CAT were used for CAT assay(5Pujol-Borrell R. Todd I. Doshi M. Bottazzo G.F. Sutton R. Adolf G.R. Feldman M.

Cell. 1988; 53: 897-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The DRA141CAT (construct 1) plasmid was generated by amplification of nucleotides −141 to +31 using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGGGAAGCTTTGTGTCCTGGACCCTTTGCAAGAA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTCTAGAAGCTCGGGAGTGAGGGAGAACAGACAA-3′. The template for the amplification was plasmid BSDRA300 containing nucleotides −260 to +20 from the DRA gene inserted between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pBluescrpt cloning vector. ( 2S. J. Ono, unpublished observations. )The insert for this plasmid was derived from the pp34-RI fragment originally isolated by the laboratory of S. Weissman, Yale University(22Das H. Lawrance S.K. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3543-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These primers incorporate unique HindIII and XbaI sites into the amplification product. The PCR product was then purified by affinity to silica fragments (Bio 101), sequentially digested with HindIII and XbaI restriction enzymes, subjected to a second round of purification by silica affinity, and subcloned into the pCAT basic plasmid between the HindIII and XbaI sites (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Construct 3 was generated by amplification of the DNA fragment containing nucleotides −173 to −42 from the DQB gene promoter using purified genomic DNA from ATCC CCL86 as a template. The following oligonucleotides (5′-GGGGAAGCTTAATTTGAAGACGTCACAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAAGCTTTGGTAGGATTGGATGGTCCTT-3′) were employed and introduce HindIII sites on both ends of the amplification product. After purification and restriction with HindIII, this DQB proximal promoter fragment (lacking its own transcription initiation site) was inserted into HindIII cleaved/calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated construct 1. Constructs 4-6 were generated by first producing double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the following strands and their complements by annealing via sequential incubation in decreasing temperatures: DQB W, 5′-TCCAGTGCAGGCACTGGATTCAGAACCTTCACAAAAAAAAAA-3′; DQB X, 5′-CAAAAAAAAAATCTGCCCAGAGACAGATGAGGTCCTTCAG-3′; DQB Y, 5′-GTCCTTCAGCTCCAGTGCTGATTGGTTCCTTTCCAAGG-3′. These blunt ended double-stranded oligonucleotides were then ligated, and dimers were purified by elution from polyacrylamide gels. HindIII linkers were then attached to the purifed dimers, the ligation products were cleaved with HindIII, and the purified dimers were ligated into the HindIII site of construct 1. The orientation and number of oligonucleotides inserted into the HindIII site was determined using the DRA primer (5′-TCTTGCAAAGGGTCCAGGACA-3′), which primes synthesis of the “bottom” strand of the DRA proximal promoter oriented 5′ to 3′ toward the upstream direction. Constructs containing two oligonucleotides ligated in the wild-type orientation were identified and propagated. Construct 7 was generated by first ligating the 564-base pair HindIII fragment of bacteriophage λ DNA to the DQBX-box dimer isolated from construct 5, followed by gel purification of the dimer/564-base pair ligation products. This was then ligated into the HindIII site of construct 1. Plasmids containing the DQBX-box dimer ligated in the wild-type orientation were identified by dideoxy sequence analysis using a primer that initiates DNA synthesis through the HindIII insertion site from the plasmid backbone. Construct 8 was generated by first ligating the 2,322-base pair bacteriophage λ HindIII fragment to the DQBX-box dimer, followed by gel purification of the dimer/2,322 ligation products. This was then inserted into the HindIII site of construct 1. Construct 9 was generated by ligating BamHI linkers onto the DQBX-box dimer, cleaving with BamHI, and insertion of the dimer into the unique BamHI site downstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the pCAT basic plasmid. Constructs 10-14 were generated by overlap PCR of two or three PCR subfragments to generate the final chimeric class II promoters. The nucleotide sequences of the recombination sites are shown in the appropriate figures. 500 ml of log phase cells was pelleted at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 25 ml of nuclear isolation buffer I (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). 0.3 ml of ice-cold 10% Nonidet P-40 was added dropwise (while vortexing at lowest setting) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cell lysate was layered onto 12 ml of ice-cold nuclear isolation buffer I containing 1.7 M sucrose and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min in an SW27 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Purified nuclei were then resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The suspension was then rocked for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g in an SS34 rotor. The supernatant was then dialyzed against 150 ml of transcription buffer (-rNTPs) (12 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.12 mM EDTA, and 60 mM KCl for 5 h). MgCl2 was omitted from these preparations as it inhibits some of the complexes discussed in this report. For EMSA, a double-stranded probe spanning nucleotides −141 to −43 was amplified by PCR, labeled by polynucleotide kinase, and separated from unincorporated 32P by spun-column chromatography on Biogel P-2. DNA binding was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature in a 10 μl volume containing 5 μg of nuclear extract and 5,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe in the presence of 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) (in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol). The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved from free DNA by separation on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The products were then visualized by autoradiography of the fixed, dried gel. 107 recipient cells were washed extensively with serum-free media. 20 μg of cesium chloride-purified supercoiled plasmid DNA was added to the cells in a 1-ml volume of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing either 20 μl of lipofectamine or 200 μg of DEAE-dextran (Life Technologies, Inc. and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively). 5 μg of plasmid pXGH5, a mammalian expression vector encoding human growth hormone, was cotransfected with reporter constructs to control for variability in transfection efficiency. In the case of lipofectamine, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C before the addition of 50 ml of complete medium. For DEAE-dextran transfection, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C before the addition of medium. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with serum-free media and pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 300 μl of 0.25 M Tris and freeze-thawed 3 times. After centrifugation to remove debris, 150 μl of the cell extract was incubated with 20 μl of 10 mM acetyl-coenzyme A (Pharmacia) and 2 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN) (49 mCi/mmol, 0.1 mCi/ml) for 4 h at 37°C. The chloramphenicol was then extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, speed vacuum dried, and spotted onto thin-layer chromatography plates. After the solvent front was allowed to travel three-quarters of the length of the plate, the plate was removed from the chromatography tank, allowed to dry for 30 minutes, and subjected to autoradiography. The finding that the HLA-DQB promoter is active and that the HLA-DRA promoter is inactive (directing a transcriptional activity 6% of the DQB promoter activity; Fig. 1, A and B) in Clone-13 cells indicated an approach to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying differential expression of these two human class II MHC genes. This approach was to generate chimeric reporter constructs using portions of the two promoters and to assess the ability of these chimeric constructs to support transcription of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene upon transient transfection into this cell line. To test the feasibility of this approach, an initial construct was generated (Fig. 1A, construct3), where nucleotides −173 to −42 from the DQB promoter were ligated upstream of nucleotide −141 in a DRA reporter plasmid, in the correct orientation. These nucleotides from the DQB promoter were chosen since a reporter plasmid containing only these nucleotides ligated upstream of the CAT gene was transcriptionally inactive (having only 3% of the activity of DQB reporter constructs containing downstream nucleotides up to +30, data not shown) while retaining all of the important conserved upstream activation sequences. The insertion of these nucleotides from DQB upstream of the −141 DRA reporter plasmid conferred a transcriptional activity approximately 80% of that conferred by the wild-type DQB160CAT reporter plasmid (Fig. 1, A and B). This result indicated that the generation of further hybrid reporter constructs was a feasible approach to map divergent cis-elements within these two class II genes. As a first step in mapping regions of the HLA-DRA and -DQB promoters that might mediate the differential expression of the two genes in the Clone-13 cell line, an initial series of six chimeric reporter plasmids was constructed to rapidly screen for general subregions of the promoters that might mediate differential expression. Oligonucleotides containing the conserved W(S), X- and Y-boxes and surrounding nucleotides from the DQB promoter (Fig. 1A) were concatenated and subcloned upstream of nucleotide −141 in the DRACAT reporter plasmid, and plasmids containing dimers of the oligonucleotides arranged in “head to tail” orientations were selected and expanded. While the hybrid reporter constructs containing dimers of the DQB W(S) region (construct 4) and the DQB Y-box region (construct 6) did not have transcriptional activities significantly different from the wild-type DRA reporter plasmid (construct 1), the plasmid containing dimers of the DQBX-box region had a transcriptional activity that was elevated 10-fold over the wild-type DRA reporter plasmid and which was 50% of the wild-type DQB reporter plasmid (Fig. 1, A and B). These data indicated that an element or elements within the X-box region of these class II genes mediate differential expression of the genes. Constructs 4-6 contain dimers of DQB upstream elements ligated upstream of nucleotide −141 in the DRA promoter. In the case of the X-box oligonucleotides, this places the inserted elements 49 bases upstream of their natural position within the promoter, approximately five complete helical turns from the DRA X-box. Assuming that the restoration of expression by the upstream DQB X-box dimers results from protein-protein interactions between transcription factors bound to the inserted elements and DQB promoter binding proteins (or general transcriptional machinery), three additional constructs were synthesized inserting additional distance between the DQB X-box dimers and the DRA X-box element to determine the distance and helical-orientation requirements for these interactions. Construct 7 introduces an additional 56.4 helical turns between the inserted and DRA X-boxes; construct 8 introduces an additional 232.2 helical turns; and construct 9 places the dimer 175.2 helical turns downstream of the DRA X-box element (Fig. 1A). Of these constructs, only construct 7 exhibited a transcriptional activity that was significantly above that of the wild-type DRA reporter (a 4-fold elevation and a P-value <0.05; Fig. 1, A and B). Since the DQB X-box dimer is located on the opposite side of the helix relative to the DRA X-box, this indicates that the additional inserted distance may allow flexibility to the usual requirement for strict stereo-specificity of the X- and Y-box elements(24Vilen B.J. Penta J.F. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23728-23734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional inactivity of plasmids 8 and 9 (which are stereospecifically aligned with the DRA Y-box), however, indicates that the additional distances between the DQB X-box dimer and the DRA Y-box are excessively large to allow protein-protein interaction. Since the previous experiments indicated that the extended X-box element and surrounding nucleotides might mediate the differential expression of the DRA and DQB genes in Clone-13, additional constructs were synthesized by overlap PCR to 1) more precisely map the relevant element and 2) to address the question using substitution constructs where the inserted element replaces the wild-type element (Fig. 2A). Construct 10 replaces the nucleotide sequence 5′-CCTAGCAACAGATGCGTCATCTC-3′ containing the DRA X1- and X2-boxes (and not the pyrimidine tract found immediately upstream of the X1-box, or the A/T-rich HMG I/Y binding site located in the interspace region) with the sequence 5′-CCCAGAGACAGATGAGGTCCTTC-3′ containing both the X1- and X2-boxes from DQB. This replacement and the others described later in this work were designed so that no alterations in the helical orientation or distance of the new element (relative to the wild-type element) occur. In construct 11, the DRA X1-element 5′-CCTAGCAACAGA-3′ is replaced with the DQB X1-element 5′-CCCAGAGACAGA-3′. In construct 12, the DRA X2-element 5′-TGCGTCATCTC-3′ is replaced with the DQB X2-element 5′-TGAGGTCCTTC-3′. Each of these replacement constructs were then transfected transiently into Clone-13 cells, and the resulting CAT activities were quantitated (Fig. 2B). Construct 10, containing a complete replacement of both X1 and X2-elements of DRA with the analogous DQB elements had a transcriptional activity approximately 85% of the wild-type DQB reporter construct. Construct 11, containing a DQB substitution only at the X1-element, had a variable transcriptional activity (with a mean of 7% of DQB and a maximum activity of 17% of DQB; Fig. 2C). Construct 12, containing a DQB substitution only at the X2-element, had a mean transcriptional activity of 88% of DQB. These data demonstrate that the DQB X2-element can functionally replace the DRA X2-element in the context of the DRA promoter and indicate that the defective transcription factor in Clone-13 “interacts” directly with or requires interaction with a factor bound to the DRA X2-element. The previous experiments indicated that replacement of the DRA X2-element with the DQB X2-element restored transcription from the DRA promoter. Depending on the nature of the defect in the Clone-13 DRA X2-element binding factor(s) presumably replaced by the DQB X2-element binding factor(s) on construct 12, it does not necessarily follow that the compensatory experiment (substituting the DQB X2-element with the DRA X2-element) will yield the converse result. To gain further insight into the nature of the defect, we therefore generated two additional constructs (13 and 14), where the X2- and X1-elements within the DQB promoter, respectively, were replaced with their DRA counterparts (Fig. 3A). While insertion of the DRA X1-element had no effect on DQB promoter activity (construct 14), insertion of the DRA X2-element almost completely silenced DQB promoter activity (construct 13), (Fig. 3, B and C). These data indicate that the defect in the DRA X2-element binding protein(s) in Clone-13 also prohibit efficient transcriptional activation from the DQB promoter. As we reported in the original communication describing this cell line, we have not been able to detect differences in nucleoprotein complex formation with DRA S, X- or Y-box oligonucleotides in extracts from wild-type Jijoye and mutant Clone-13 cell lines by EMSA analysis. Since several laboratories have now shown that the promoters of many class II negative cell lines (in sharp contrast with class II positive cells) are not occupied in vivo despite the presence of direct promoter binding proteins, we w"

This reconstituted transcription system provides a starting point for the biochemical dissection of the yeast RNA polymerase I transcription complex, thus allowing in vitro experiments designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling rRNA synthesis. In rapidly growing cells, rRNA synthesis is one of the largest single consumers of cellular resources. In these cells, the high level of rRNA synthesis is required to produce the number of ribosomes necessary to meet the translational load. In contrast, cells growing at a slower rate do not require the same level of protein synthesis. One would predict that these cells would conserve energy by reducing the rate of rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, resulting in fewer ribosomes per cell. Indeed, this has been demonstrated in both procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms, although the mechanisms involved remain quite obscure in all cases. In eucaryotes, the bulk of rRNA synthesis is catalyzed by RNA polymerase I (RNAP I). ( 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseUbfupstream binding factorTBPTATA binding protein. )Three RNAP I ancillary factors have been described in a number of different systems. These factors, and their nomenclature in various systems, have been recently reviewed(1Reeder R.H. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation, Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 315-347Google Scholar). The best characterized factor is a rather nonspecific DNA binding protein termed Ubf (upstream binding factor). The identification and isolation of the genes encoding Ubf from these organisms has facilitated detailed structural and functional studies of this protein. Ubf binds rather promiscuously to DNA, although it does produce a distinct footprint on both the promoter (primarily the upstream element) and enhancer regions from several organisms(2Bell S.P.

It has been shown that Ubf may not be absolutely required for transcription in vitro under specific conditions but rather it acts as a stimulatory factor(4Smith S.D. Oriahi E. Lowe D. Yang-Yen H.F.

The possible role of Ubf as a facilitator of transcription complex formation is also supported by recent experiments that show that Ubf induces considerable conformational changes in the promoter structure (7Bazett-Jones D.P.

The second widely recognized RNAP I transcription factor, termed SL-1 in human systems, contains several polypeptides, and it appears to form the core of the transcription complex. Independently, this protein complex has a variable DNA binding activity. Human SL-1 does not exhibit any specific DNA binding properties(2Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although the rat and mouse homologues can bind the promoter(4Smith S.D. Oriahi E. Lowe D. Yang-Yen H.F. O'Mahony D. Rose K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A major breakthrough in the characterization of SL-1 was the discovery that it contained the TATA binding protein (TBP), along with a number of other associated proteins termed TATA-associated factors(11Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TBP was originally identified as a component of the RNAP II transcription factor IID, and it was subsequently found to be involved in all three nuclear transcription systems(12Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S. Cell. 1992; 69: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). rRNA synthesis in vivo is responsive to a wide variety of agents or treatments that alter cellular growth or protein synthesis. In a number of cases, extracts isolated from these treated cells exhibit the regulatory response observed in vivo; that is, they have altered levels of specific RNAP I transcription (reviewed in (1Reeder R.H. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation, Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 315-347Google Scholar) and (14Sollner-Webb B. Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In these cases, this response is due to the inactivation of a factor found associated with RNAP I. This factor, known as C∗, TIFI-A, or TFIC(15Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1987; 50: 873-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Brun R.P. Ryan K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell.

Several lines of evidence suggest that regulation of the activity of the RNAP I-associated factor may not be the only mechanism by which rRNA synthesis is regulated. Additional targets of regulation may include Ubf (21Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). While the reconstitution of enzymatic activity in vitro has been a valuable tool for a functional dissection of these macromolecular structures, the yeast RNA polymerase I system has been much less amenable to this type of analysis. Several protocols for the preparation of small scale yeast RNAP I transcription extracts have been described(25Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18091-18094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These extracts have been useful for delineating the structure and function of cis-acting elements, but the inherent limitations of their scale have precluded a detailed biochemical analysis of trans-acting factors. Yeast is a potentially very powerful system in which to study rRNA synthesis because of well defined genetics, as well as the relative ease with which one can rapidly alter cell growth rate through precise, chemically defined nutritional changes. The potential of this system has yet to be fully realized in large part because of difficulties in biochemically defining the RNAP I transcription apparatus. Here, we report the development of a protocol to prepare large quantities of very active transcription lysates and their use in an initial biochemical identification and characterization of the yeast RNAP I trans-acting factors. This work provides a starting point for the purification and complete characterization of the components of the yeast RNAP I transcription complex, which, in conjunction with genetic analysis, will help us to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate rRNA synthesis. The plasmid pDR10 contains the RNAP I promoter on an rDNA PvuII fragment (from −1478 to +582 relative to the start point of RNAP I transcription) inserted into the SmaI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). This construct also contains the 5 S rRNA gene, which is transcribed by RNAP III. In some experiments, the 5 S rRNA gene template pBB111R (28Braun B.R. Riggs D.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2530-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used. The yeast strain JHRY20-2CΔ1 (29Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Saari G.C. Valls L.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) was cultured at 30°C in YEPD (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, and 2% w/v glucose) with the pH adjusted to 5.5 with HCl. The medium was inoculated with a low density overnight culture (optical density at 595 nm, A595, of less than 3.0) resulting in an initial density of 0.1-0.2 A595 units. The culture was incubated at 30°C for at least three generations in exponential phase (generation time of 1.5 h): then, the cells were harvested when the culture density reached an A595 of 1-2 (corresponding to approximately 5 × 107 cells/ml). For the preparation of transition and stationary phase cultures, the growth medium was supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/liters) to discourage bacterial growth, and the cultures were vigorously aerated. The transition phase cells were harvested at a point when the culture was still growing but at a reduced growth rate of about 20 h per generation. Stationary phase cells were harvested 30 h after growth had ceased. All manipulations were performed at 0−4°C with ice-cold solutions. The buffers all contained 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride unless otherwise noted. The cells were resuspended in solubilization buffer (0.2 M Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate) at a final concentration of 0.5 g of cells/ml. For the large scale lysates, approximately 80-100 g (wet pellet weight) of cells were lysed using a Bead Beater (Bio-Spec, Bartlesville, OK) in a 300-ml chamber filled with 180 ml of beads (0.5 mm in diameter). Sufficient additional solubilization buffer was added to the chamber to exclude all of the remaining air. The cells were beaten for 30 s followed by several minutes of rest in an ice/ethanol bath. Typically, 12-16 cycles were needed for adequate breakage (50-75% breakage as determined by phase contrast microscopy). The cell lysate was removed, and the beads were washed with solubilization buffer. The combined lysate and washes (about 280 ml, or 3 ml/g of cells) were centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 2 h. After the high speed spin, all of the supernatant was decanted and used for the subsequent steps. No attempt was made to pull off only the clear intermediate layer(26Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only modifications made for the preparation of small scale lysates concerned the breakage. The cells were broken in 8-ml plastic screw top tubes (for example, Sarstedt, Newton NC; 60.542PP) containing 3 ml of glass beads and several large beads (5 mm in diameter). The resuspended cells were added to the vial, the trapped air bubbles removed, and the vial sealed with the cap. The cells were lysed by vortexing as previously described(26Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high speed supernatant from the ultracentrifugation (either small or large scale), which was in 10% saturated 400 mM ammonium sulfate, was adjusted to 60% saturation by adding solid ammonium sulfate and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), the 10-60% pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of TA buffer (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM magnesium acetate) containing no KCl (here referred to as TA-0). The protein concentration was about 20-30 mg/ml, as determined using the Bradford dye binding procedure (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar). The residual ammonium sulfate was removed from this sample by extensive dialysis against TA-0 buffer. This sample was then diluted to about 10 mg/ml protein with TA-0 buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Typically, the resulting pellet contained 10-25% of the total protein present in the 60% ammonium sulfate cut. When making small scale lysates, both the “low salt pellet” and “low salt supernatant” were retained for further analysis. The low salt pellet, when resuspended, contained a significant amount of specific RNAP I activity as determined by in vitro transcription assays. To assay activity, this pellet was resuspended in a small volume of TA buffer containing 200 mM potassium glutamate (TA-200 KGlu). This suspension had a protein concentration of about 5 mg/ml, and typically 15 μg of this suspension was used in each transcription assay. The low salt supernatant contained a significant amount of RNAP III-specific transcriptional activity. To assay this material, this supernatant was first dialyzed against the transcription buffer TA-200 KGlu. Typically, the supernatant had a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, and 50 μg of protein was added to the RNAP III transcription assay. The low salt pellets and supernatants were used to determine the levels of specific RNAP I and III transcriptional activity present in the cells that had been grown through transition phase into stationary phase. For large scale RNAP I lysates, the low salt pellet was first solubilized in TA buffer containing 400 mM ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed against TA-0 to a conductivity equivalent to TA buffer containing 100 mM KCl (TA-100 KCl). After adjustment of the conductivity, the insoluble material, usually about half of the total protein, was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). It was necessary to solubilize the low salt pellet in 400 mM ammonium sulfate instead of 100 mM KCl as the RNAP I components in the low salt pellet remained partially insoluble in TA-100 KCl buffer. The supernatant was applied to a 10-ml column containing Macro-Prepr high Q anion exchange support (Bio-Rad) at the rate of 3 mg of protein/ml of column bed volume. The loaded column was first washed with TA-100 KCl, and then the column was developed with a gradient from 100 to 700 mM KCl over 5 column volumes. Approximately 100 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The A, B, and C activities each eluted in 3-5 fractions, with 10-15 fractions separating adjacent activities. Specific RNAP I transcription assays contained 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 mM potassium glutamate, 1.25 μg/ml creatine kinase, 30 mM creatine phosphate, 450 μM ATP, 200 μM UTP, 200 μM CTP, 15 μM [α-32P]GTP (20-40,000 cpm/pmol, 5-10 μCi/40 μl assay), and 2.5-4 μg/ml DNA template (pDR10 linearized with EcoRV unless indicated) in a final volume of 40 μl. The extracts were preincubated with the DNA template for 5 min at 30°C in the complete transcription assay mix without the G, U, and C nucleotides. Transcription was initiated by the addition of the omitted nucleotides. The reaction was then incubated for 5 min at 30°C, after which it was stopped by extraction with phenol/chloroform. The RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol containing 1 M ammonium acetate. The dried pellets were then resuspended in 3 μl of a denaturing loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70°C, typically for several hours. Nonspecific RNAP assays were performed under the same conditions, except that sheared salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) replaced the specific transcription template and the final volume of each assay was 20 μl. The assays were terminated by the addition of phenol/chloroform and 10 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA. Radiolabeled transcripts were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol containing 1 M ammonium acetate, and then the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of water. A total of three sequential precipitation-resuspension cycles were performed to remove unincorporated radioactive nucleotides. The final resuspended pellet was spotted onto a disc of DE81 filter paper (Whatman), dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. To determine the background cpm for each sample assayed, an identical reaction was performed in parallel, but the sample was not incubated; rather, it was immediately terminated with phenol/chloroform after the addition of nucleotides to the assay. The results of these background assays were consistently about 1% of the most active samples (300 cpm). Tagetitoxin (TagetinTM) was obtained from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI), and 20 units were added per assay. The α-amanitin concentration in the assays was 75 μg/ml. The samples, containing approximately 20 μg of protein each, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a discontinuous buffer system and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (PantherTM, Owl Scientific, Inc. Cambridge, MA). The transfer buffer consisted of 25 mM Tris-Cl, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Western blotting was done in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate), following the ECL protocol RPN 2106 (Amersham Corp.). The primary antiserum was polyclonal anti-yeast TFIID (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). The TBP standard was a cell extract prepared from an Escherichia coli strain, which overexpressed yeast TBP (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schmidt). The identity of TBP in this extract was confirmed by Western analysis alongside purified TBP. We have extensively modified a protocol developed for making small scale extracts (26Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to enable us to prepare large quantities of very active extracts that are amenable to biochemical analysis (Fig. 1). Here, we describe the protocol and the initial biochemical characterization of a reconstituted yeast RNAP I transcription system. Whole cell extracts were prepared from exponential phase cells, which had been harvested at least one generation before the end of exponential phase. Cells were broken using glass beads in a blender with typically about 50-75% of the cells being lysed as judged by phase contrast microscopy. The high molecular weight cell material was removed by ultracentrifugation (210,000 × g for 2 h) as has been done for the yeast RNAP II transcription system(33Woontner M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8979-8982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleared supernatant derived from the cell lysate after ultracentrifugation was raised to 2.4 M ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). This step concentrated the RNAP I transcription apparatus in the pellet while removing small RNA species (tRNA), resulting in an extract with modest RNAP I transcriptional activity (Fig. 2, lane1). RNAP I transcriptional activity was assayed using the template pDR10, which was linearized with EcoRV, to produce a run-off transcript of 405 nucleotides (Fig. 3). This template also carries the 5 S rRNA gene, which is transcribed by RNAP III. A significant step in the protocol is the precipitation of the RNAP I transcription apparatus in low salt buffer. The residual ammonium sulfate in the resuspended 60% ammonium sulfate pellet was removed from the sample by extensive dialysis against buffer lacking salt, followed by centrifugation. Less than 25% of the total protein precipitated under these conditions. We found significant RNAP I activity in this pellet (termed “low salt pellet”), while the RNAP III activity was found in the supernatant (Fig. 2, lanes2 and 3). Efficient solubilization of the RNAP I transcription apparatus in the pellet was achieved in 400 mM ammonium sulfate (lanes4 and 5). To prepare the sample for column chromatography, the extract was dialyzed into buffer with a conductivity equivalent to 100 mM KCl. Roughly half of the total protein in this sample was insoluble, which was removed by centrifugation. Fractionation of the crude cell lysate by precipitation in high and low salt buffers results in an RNAP I extract having more specific transcriptional activity per equivalent volume and less than 10% of the protein found in the initial crude lysate. The composition of the crude cell lysate after ultracentrifugation is very complex with numerous inhibitory compounds. The high activity of the RNAP I extract may reflect both the efficient recovery of the RNAP I apparatus and the removal of such inhibitors. Using this protocol, we have produced transcription extracts from as little as 5 g of cells to as much as several hundred g of cells. The resolution of the components of the RNAP I transcription system by column chromatography was significantly enhanced by the initial precipitation and solubilization treatments.Figure 3The structure of the yeast rDNA-containing plasmids.

Transcription assays with combinations of fractions identified three well separated, distinct activities that were each required for specific RNAP I transcription (Fig. 4). In the absence of fraction A, high molecular weight radioactive nucleic acids were reproducibly produced in the transcription assay (lane2). Each of the three fractions have been subjected to further chromatography, and we have been unable to further resolve any of the three fractions into subfractions, suggesting that this transcription system has three essential components, each of which consists of one or multiple proteins that remain associated under the fractionation conditions. By analogy to other eucaryotic RNAP I transcription systems, we expect the polypeptide composition of at least two of the three components to be quite complex. In the following experiments, we examine the possible functions of each component. The fraction containing RNAP I was identified by nonspecific transcription assays. Transcription of a nonspecific DNA template (such as salmon sperm DNA) is a measure of the catalytic activity of RNA polymerase and is not influenced by the presence of ancillary factors. Fractions A, B, and C were each assayed for RNA polymerase activity. Only fraction B had significant RNA polymerase activity (Table 1), and it was largely resistant to α-amanitin, which inhibits RNAP II(34Schultz L.D. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and tagetitoxin, which inhibits RNAP III(35Steinberg T.H. Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A trace amount of RNA polymerase activity was observed in the leading edge of the C activity peak from the Q column. Fractions from the trailing edge of the C activity peak had no polymerase activity yet were able to reconstitute specific RNAP I transcription with the A and B fractions. Consistent with B containing RNAP I, an activity in this fraction is specifically deficient in stationary phase cells (see below).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Promoter recognition is an obligatory initial step in transcription. In eucaryotes, transcription factors first bind promoter sequences to form stable preinitiation complexes, which then recruit other transcription factors and RNA polymerase to the promoter. These DNA binding proteins can be detected by transcriptional competition assays between two templates that direct the synthesis of different length transcripts (see Fig. 3 for template structures). The fractions, either alone or in combination, are incubated with one template while the complementing fractions are incubated with the second template (Fig. 5A). The two reactions are then mixed and incubated to permit assembly of complete complexes; then, the transcription assay is initiated. As expected, when all three fractions were preincubated together on the first template, a transcription complex was formed that was stable to a challenging template (Fig. 5B, lanes1 and 2). To determine which fraction is responsible for the initiation of complex assembly, different combinations of the three fractions were preincubated with the two templates. These experiments showed that fraction A was necessary and sufficient to catalyze the formation of the stable transcription complex (lane3). Preincubation of fraction A with fraction B did significantly increase the quantity of transcript produced, and, to a lesser extent, C had the same effect (lanes4 and 5). These experiments show that the A fraction contains the transcription factor responsible for initiating assembly of the transcription complex, presumedly by tightly binding the DNA template. TBP, originally identified as an RNAP II transcription factor, is also an essential component of the RNAP I transcription factor SL-1 and homologues(11Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 36Eberhard D. Tora L. Egly J.-M. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4180-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown to be a pivotal factor in all three nuclear transcription systems (see (37Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) for a recent review). It has been directly demonstrated that TBP is an essential component of the yeast RNAP I transcription apparatus(12Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S. Cell. 1992; 69: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). With the goal of identifying the fraction A, B, or C that contains the TBP-containing RNAP I factor, we performed Western blotting analysis of each fraction using anti-TBP antiserum. Fraction A was found to contain virtually all of the TBP, although a slight amount was also observed in the B fraction (data not shown). Next, we examined the Q column elution profiles of A activity and TBP. If TBP is a component of the A activity, we would expect to find a correlation between A activity and TBP content. All of the chromatographic fractions containing A activity also contained TBP, consistent with the suggestion that the A fraction contains the yeast SL-1 homologue. TBP eluted off the Q column in a broad peak from less than 180-250 mM KCl, while the A activity eluted in a much sharper peak from 215 to 250 mM (data not shown). The broad elution profile of TBP may be due to the different populations of TBP. The presence of multiple TBP complexes in the cell has recently been demonstrated by Poon and Weil(38Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They fractionated a whole cell extract using size exclusion chromatography and identified TBP-containing fractions using Western blotting analysis. Less than one-third of the total TBP eluted as a monomer, while the remainder was found in high molecular weight complexes. The strong relationship between growth rate and rRNA synthesis has been reported in a number of systems ranging from bacteria to higher eucaryotes. While the molecular mechanisms in procaryotes remain rather obscure, in eucaryotes it is clear that one mechanism of regulation of rRNA synthesis involves a modification of a factor closely associated with RNAP I. We analyzed RNAP I- and III-specific transcriptional activities in extracts prepared from cells that had either a reduced growth rate or had stopped growing altogether. At high cell densities, the cells leave exponential phase, during which energy is derived primarily through the fermentation of glucose, and enter a transition phase that is characterized by a slower growth rate and a high rate of respiration. Eventually, the cells leave the transition phase and enter stationary phase. These cells are morphologically and physiologically distinct from growing cells(39Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small scale transcription extracts (low salt pellets and supernatants) were prepared from portions of the culture harvested during the transition and stationary phases. The extracts prepared from the transition phase cells completely lacked specific RNAP I transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A, lane2). Extracts from stationary phase cells had a pronounced increase in the synthesis of high molecular weight RNA and reproducibly contained a trace of RNAP I-specific activity (lane3). The regulatory response in transition phase cells is specific for RNAP I, as extracts prepared from these cells retained significant RNAP III activity (5 S rRNA) (Fig. 6B, lane1). In contrast, extracts prepared from the stationary phase culture exhibited a decrease in RNAP III-specific transcription (lane2). This protocol for extract preparation minimizes the chance of inactivation due to trivial reasons as the RNAP I and III extracts are prepared from the same batch of cells carried through the same steps. Only at the final step is the specific RNAP I activity (low salt pellet) separated from the RNAP III activity (supernatant). Using the reconstituted transcription system, we were able to determine which of the three fractions was affected by entry of the culture into transition phase. The inactive low salt pellet from transition phase cells was supplemented with the A, B, or C fractions isolated from exponential phase cells (Fig. 7). The B fraction alone was able to restore significant specific RNAP I transcriptional activity to the transition phase extract (lane3), while addition of the A and C fractions had no effect. These results are consistent with a mode of regulation analogous to that which has been observed in higher eucaryotes involving the modification of a factor associated with the RNA polymerase. Here, we have presented the resolution and initial characterization of three components of the yeast RNAP I transcription apparatus. Several factors seem to be critical for the preparation of extracts containing the robust RNAP I transcriptional activity that is required for column chromatography. First, the cells must be harvested while they are still in exponential growth phase, as yeast RNAP I transcription extracts faithfully reflect the decrease in transcription observed in vivo as cells leave the exponential phase of growth(26Riggs D.L. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7596-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, when breaking cells with glass beads, we found it important to carefully monitor the process. The most active extracts were obtained when 50-75% of the cells had their walls disrupted. These cells can be distinguished using phase contrast microscopy as they appear dark, while intact cells are light and more refractive. When the cells were extensively homogenized, which could be confirmed by the lack of any large wall fragments, little or no activity was recovered. The third important consideration is the removal of extraneous proteins with the low salt precipitation. Material that had not been precipitated in the low salt buffer (for example the 10-60% ammonium sulfate cut) was much less effectively resolved into the three fractions on an anion exchange column, and the material obtained was much less active. Precipitation of the RNAP I transcription components has been previously observed in mouse cell extracts(40Culotta V.C. Wides R.J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). But unlike the precipitation of the yeast RNAP I and associated factors we report here, precipitation of the mouse components was dependent upon the addition of an rDNA template. Not unexpectedly, the yeast system appears to be very similar to higher eucaryotic RNAP I systems. We have preliminary evidence for the function of the components in two of the three fractions. Based on DNA binding activity and TBP content, fraction A may contain a factor similar to SL-1 studied in other systems. Using a template commitment assay, we have shown that the A activity is responsible for initiating the assembly of the transcription complex. We have observed a protein-DNA complex formed between the RNAP I promoter and a component in the A fraction by gel retardation analysis. ( 2E. Clarke and J. Crowell, unpublished observations. )The relationship between this complex and RNAP I transcription remains to be determined. The B fraction contributes RNAP I. Presently, we are further purifying the B activity from exponential phase cells. In more purified preparations having B activity, we have been able to detect two polypeptides that have a molecular weight similar to the two largest subunits of RNAP I. A factor in this fraction is also the target of growth rate regulation. Extracts prepared from slowly or non-growing cells can be rescued by exogenous fraction B. This suggests that the inactivation of the transcription complex does not occur by the accumulation of an inhibitor but rather through the inactivation of an essential component of the transcription apparatus. The relationship between the regulated factor and the RNAP I enzyme awaits further purification of the B fraction. One advantage of addressing this question in the yeast system is that unlike the RNAP I complex of other systems, the subunits of yeast RNAP I have been quite well characterized, so any alteration in subunit composition or subunit size can be traced to a specific gene product. The function of the third fraction, C, remains obscure. Although it is essential in the transcription assays, it does not appear to have a strong binding affinity for RNAP I promoter DNA. It may function by facilitating or stabilizing the binding of the fraction of the A activity to the promoter or, alternatively, it may be involved in recruiting the polymerase to the transcription complex.
