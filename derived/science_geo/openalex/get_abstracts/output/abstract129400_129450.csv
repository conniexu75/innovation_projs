https://openalex.org/W1986068161,"NEDD8 is a novel 81 amino acid polypeptide which is 60% identical and 80% homologous to ubiquitin. Northern blot analysis showed that the NEDD8 message was developmentally down-regulated. In adult tissues, NEDD8 expression was mostly restricted to the heart and skeletal muscle. Antiserum specific for NEDD8 detected a 6-kDa monomer in SK-N-SH, BJAB, and HL60 cell lysates. A 14-kDa band was also detected in BJAB, HL60, and SK-MEL28 but not in SK-N-SH and K562 cell lysates. An approximately 90-kDa band was detected in all cell lines tested. Thus, NEDD8 is likely to be conjugated to other proteins in a manner analogous to ubiquitination. However, the conjugation pattern of NEDD8 is entirely different from that of ubiquitin in all cell lines tested. To study NEDD8 conjugation in more detail, hemagglutinin-epitope-tagged NEDD8 was expressed in COS cells. Western blot analysis revealed an NEDD8 monomer and a series of higher molecular weight NEDD8-conjugated proteins or NEDD8 multimers. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that NEDD8 expression was highly enriched in the nucleus and was much weaker in the cytosol. In contrast, ubiquitin expression was detectable equally well in the nucleus and cytosol. Mutational analysis showed that the C terminus of NEDD8 was efficiently cleaved and that Gly-76 was required for conjugation of NEDD8 to other proteins. Taken together, NEDD8 provides another substrate for covalent protein modification and may play a unique role during development."
https://openalex.org/W2041199992,"Measuring electrical activity in large numbers of cells with high spatial and temporal resolution is a fundamental problem for the study of neural development and information processing. To address this problem, we have constructed a novel, genetically encoded probe that can be used to measure transmembrane voltage in single cells. We fused a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) into a voltage-sensitive K+ channel so that voltage-dependent rearrangements in the K+ channel would induce changes in the fluorescence of GFP. The probe has a maximal fractional fluorescence change of 5.1%, making it comparable to some of the best organic voltage-sensitive dyes. Moreover, the fluorescent signal is expanded in time in a way that makes the signal 30-fold easier to detect. A voltage sensor encoded into DNA has the advantage that it may be introduced into an organism noninvasively and targeted to specific developmental stages, brain regions, cell types, and subcellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2068382039,"We have identified a neuronal-restricted precursor (NRP) cell that expresses E-NCAM (high polysialic-acid NCAM) and is morphologically distinct from multipotent neuroepithelial (NEP) cells (17Kalyani A Hobsen C Rao M Neuroepithelial stem cells from the embryonic spinal cord isolation, characterization, and clonal analysis.Dev.

Biol. 1997; 188: 48-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). NRP cells self renew over multiple passages in the presence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and differentiate in the presence of retinoic acid and the absence of FGF into postmitotic neurons. NRP cells can also be generated from multipotent E10.5 NEP cells. Clonal analysis shows that NRP cells arise from a NEP progenitor that generates other restricted CNS precursors. The NEP-derived NRPs undergo self renewal and can differentiate into multiple neuronal phenotypes. Thus, a direct lineal relationship exists between multipotential NEP cells and more restricted neuronal precursor cells present in vivo at E13.5 in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2079317830,"Members of the chemokine receptor family CCR5 and CXCR4 have recently been shown to be involved in the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target cells. Here, we investigated the regulation of CXCR4 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) stably transfected with wild type (Wt CXCR4) or a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant (ΔCyto CXCR4) of CXCR4. The ligand, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) stimulated higher G-protein activation, inositol phosphate generation, and a more sustained calcium elevation in cells expressing ΔCyto CXCR4 relative to Wt CXCR4. SDF-1 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not a membrane permeable cAMP analog induced rapid phosphorylation as well as desensitization of Wt CXCR4. Phosphorylation of ΔCyto CXCR4 was not detected under any of these conditions. Despite lack of receptor phosphorylation, calcium mobilization by SDF-1 in ΔCyto CXCR4 cells was partially desensitized by prior treatment with SDF-1. Of interest, the rapid release of calcium was inhibited without affecting the sustained calcium elevation, indicating independent regulatory pathways for these processes. PMA completely inhibited phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization in Wt CXCR4 but only partially inhibited these responses in ΔCyto CXCR4. cAMP also partially inhibited these responses in both Wt CXCR4 and ΔCyto CXCR4. SDF-1, PMA, and cAMP caused phosphorylation of phospholipase Cβ3 in Wt and ΔCyto CXCR4 cells. Both SDF-1 as well as PMA induced rapid internalization of Wt CXCR4. SDF-1 but not PMA induced internalization of ΔCyto CXCR4 albeit at reduced levels relative to Wt CXCR4. These results indicate that signaling and internalization of CXCR4 are regulated by receptor phosphorylation dependent and independent mechanisms. Desensitization of CXCR4 signaling, independent of receptor phosphorylation, appears to be a consequence of the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cβ3.

Chemokines are a group of proteins that mediate directed migration and activation of leukocytes (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). These have been classified into two main families, CXC or CC-chemokines. Two newly identified proteins define additional groups of C and CX3C chemokines based on the position of conserved cysteines (2Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R.

Using this model, we demonstrate that CXCR4 signaling is regulated at the level of receptor as well as a downstream component.

Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester and pluronic acid were purchased from Molecular Probes. GDP, GTP, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Nucleotides encoding a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin-epitope (HA) sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted between the NH2-terminal initiator methionine and the second amino acid of human CXCR4 by polymerase chain reaction methods as described previously for other chemoattractant receptors (27Ali H.

The same epitope tag was also placed at the COOH-terminal end before the stop codon in some constructs. A COOH terminally truncated CXCR4 at the amino acid 318 by altering the codon 319 into a stop codon was also made using standard polymerase chain reaction methods. The integrity of the epitope tag as well as the rest of the molecule was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing after cloning into eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3.1 and pRK-5. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (27Ali H.

RBL cells (1 × 107 cells) were transfected by electroporation with pRK5 containing the receptor cDNAs (25 μg) along with pcDNA3 (5 μg) plasmid containing the geneticin-resistant marker and clones were isolated as described previously (27Ali H.

For ligand binding assays, RBL cells (5 × 105) were distributed in Eppendorf tubes in a final volume 100 μl of binding medium (DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing different amounts of unlabled SDF-1 and 0.2 nm125I-labeled SDF-1 (2200 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the cells were centrifuged through a 10% sucrose gradient. The tips of tubes containing the pellets were cut and the radioactivity determined in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding in the presence of 100 nm SDF-1 (25–40% of total binding) was subtracted to give specific binding (29Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Rieppi M. Proost P. Magazin M.

RBL cells (5 × 107) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were prepared and GTPase activity was determined in the absence and presence of various concentrations of SDF-1 as described previously (28Richardson R.M.

Cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 20 mm LiCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the same buffer with and without SDF-1. Reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of chloroform, methanol, 4 n HCl (100:200:2) and the generation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D.

For Ca2+ mobilization, cells (3 × 106) were washed in HEPES-buffered saline and loaded with 1 μm Indo I-AM in the presence of 1 μm pluronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured as described (30Tomhave E.D. Richardson R.M. Didsbury J.R. Menard L. Snyderman R. Ali H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3267-3275PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells (5–10 × 106) were surface labeled with 125I, lysed, immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography as described (27Ali H.

Phosphorylation of CXCR4 was performed essentially as described for other chemoattractant receptors (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

The following day, cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in the same medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/dish) for 90 min to metabolically label the intracellular ATP pool. Labeled cells were stimulated and epitope-tagged CXCR4 were immunoprecipitated from lysates with 12CA5 (10 μg) monoclonal antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (27Ali H.

Phosphorylation of PLCβ3 was performed essentially by the same method as described above except 1-1.5μg of PLCβ3 antibody was used in place of 12CA5 antibody. Stably transfected RBL cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 nm SDF-1 or 100 nm PMA in HEPES (20 mm)-buffered DMEM. Cells were washed with ice-cold medium and incubated with 12G5 antibody for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were again washed in cold medium and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Single color immunofluorescence analysis of 10,000 cells was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer. Percent receptor internalization was calculated from the mean channel fluorescence values of cells treated with buffer versus ligand or PMA. To study the regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, stably transfected clonal lines of RBL cells expressing epitope-tagged wild type (Wt CXCR4) or a COOH-terminal truncation mutant at amino acid 318 of CXCR4 (ΔCyto CXCR4, Table I) were generated. Fig.1 A shows FACS analysis with the CXCR4-specific 12G5 antibody (14Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stoebenauhaggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J.

The epitope tag-specific 12CA5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the Wt CXCR4 (∼44 kDa) and ΔCyto CXCR4 (∼41 kDa) proteins from surface-iodinated RBL cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 5). No125I-labeled proteins in this size range were detected in untransfected RBL cells. The epitope tag peptide (YPYDVPDYA) inhibited the immunoprecipitation of these proteins (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4and 6).Table IAmino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminal tails of the wild type CXCR4 and the COOH-terminal truncation mutant of CXCR4308 352 ↓ ↓C-tail Wt CXCR4 KFKTSAQHALTSVSRGSSLKILSKGKRGGHSSVSTESESSSFHSS-COOHΔCyto CXCR4 KFKTAAQHALA-COOHPotential phosphorylation sites in the wild type CXCR4 are indicated in bold.

The epitope-tagged Wt and ΔCyto CXCR4 expressed in RBL cells bound SDF-1 with similar apparent affinity (Wt CXCR4 K d = 6.1 ± 1.5 nm; ΔCyto CXCR4 K d = 9.6 ± 1.4 nm, Fig.2 A). The native receptors expressed in neuronal cells had a K d = 54 ± 6.4 nm. (17Hesselgesser J. Halksmiller M. Delvecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Based on the maximum specific binding of SDF-1, a similar number of Wt CXCR4 (9800 ± 5200) or ΔCyto CXCR4 (7200 ± 1800) receptors were expressed in these cells. The receptors expressed in RBL cells were functionally active and induced SDF-1 dose-dependent GTPase activity in membranes, inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization in whole cells (Fig. 2,B-D). The ΔCyto CXCR4 was more active relative to Wt CXCR4 in stimulating GTPase activity (Fig. 2 B) and phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 2 C). ΔCyto CXCR4 resulted in a ∼4-fold increase in total inositol phosphates upon SDF-1 treatment as compared with the ∼1.6-fold increase observed with the Wt CXCR4 (Fig. 2 C). While the peak calcium mobilization by the Wt CXCR4 or ΔCyto CXCR4 were comparable (250–300 nm) the calcium transients induced by the ΔCyto CXCR4 contained a prolonged phase of elevated intracellular calcium (Fig.2 D). SDF-1 and PMA, but not a membrane permeable analog of cAMP, stimulated by severalfold, the phosphorylation of the 44-kDa form of Wt CXCR4 (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–4). None of these stimulated detectable phosphorylation of the ΔCyto CXCR4 even after prolonged exposures (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, completely inhibited PMA-induced phosphorylation (Fig.3 B, lanes 5 and 6) but partially inhibited the SDF-1 induced phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and4). Calcium mobilization in response to SDF-1 was completely desensitized in cells expressing Wt CXCR4 by prior treatment with SDF-1 or PMA both of which phosphorylate the receptor. Interestingly, cAMP which did not cause phosphorylation of the Wt CXCR4 also desensitized the calcium mobilization by ∼70% (Fig. 4 A), suggesting a distal site of inhibition. Desensitization of calcium responses in ΔCyto CXCR4 showed that prior treatment with SDF-1 resulted in almost complete inhibition of the initial calcium peak with substantial maintenance of the sustained response (Fig. 4 A). The sustained response was not seen in the presence of EGTA, indicating the second phase results from calcium influx (data not shown). Treatment with pertussis toxin resulted in complete inhibition of both rapid and sustained increases in calcium in ΔCyto CXCR4 cells (data not shown). PMA and cAMP also resulted in inhibition of the calcium responses in ΔCyto CXCR4 (Fig. 4 A). The effect of PKC and PKA activation on the generation of inositol phosphates by the Wt and ΔCyto CXCR4 cells was determined. PKC activation resulted in complete inhibition of inositol phosphate generation in Wt CXCR4 cells and partial inhibition in ΔCyto CXCR4 cells (Fig. 4 B). cAMP resulted in partial inhibition of inositol phosphates both in Wt and ΔCyto CXCR4 cells (Fig. 4 B). Among the known phospholipase Cβ isoforms, only PLCβ3 is expressed in RBL cells (25Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effects of SDF-1, PMA, and cAMP on the phosphorylation of PLCβ3 are shown in Fig. 5. cAMP resulted in ∼2-fold increase in PLCβ3 basal phosphorylation where as SDF-1 and PMA resulted in ∼3-fold increases in PLCβ3 phosphorylation.Figure 5Phosphorylation of PLCβ3. RBL cells expressing Wt CXCR4 or ΔCyto CXCR4 (3 × 106cells/60-mm dish) were 32P-labeled and incubated for 5 min with SDF-1 (lanes 2 and 6), PMA (lanes 3 and 7), or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP) (lanes 4 and 8) as indicated. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with PLCβ3 antibody, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Internalization was studied in RBL cells using the 12G5 antibody. Fig. 6 A is a typical FACS analysis of Wt CXCR4. Data from several independent experiments on internalization of CXCR4 and ΔCyto CXCR4 by SDF-1 or PMA treatment are shown in Fig. 6 B. Both SDF-1 and PMA induced internalization of the Wt CXCR4. The ΔCyto CXCR4 was also internalized by SDF-1 treatment, although consistently lower than the Wt CXCR4. PMA did not induce internalization of ΔCyto CXCR4 (Fig.6 B). In this study, a well established model system was utilized to investigate the regulation of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor of considerable biological interest because of its role as a co-receptor for HIV-1 infection. The results suggest at least two distinct mechanisms for regulation of signal transduction, one at the level of receptor phosphorylation and the other at the level of phospholipase C activation. Functional expression of the native and the cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant of CXCR4 allowed for clear distinctions to be made of relative contributions of multiple mechanisms in the overall regulation of these receptors. The higher activity of ΔCyto CXCR4 in inositol phosphates formation and in the induction of sustained calcium fluxes relative to Wt CXCR4 receptors suggests loss of some down-regulatory control of the function of the mutant receptors. While comparable number of receptors with similar affinity were expressed in Wt CXCR4 and ΔCyto CXCR4 transfectants, cells expressing the latter receptor displayed a more potent ligand-induced GTPase activity (Fig. 2 B). Such enhanced G-protein activation was previously noted for other phosphorylation-deficient mutants of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the chemoattractant receptors for platelet activating factor (32Takano T.

Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is likely due to the lack of desensitization in G-protein coupling (34Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, activation of ΔCyto CXCR4 by SDF-1 resulted in a biphasic calcium transient (Figs. 2 C and4 A). Desensitization of calcium mobilization revealed unexpected complexity in the regulation of these receptors. While the calcium mobilization in Wt CXCR4 was completely desensitized by prior treatment with SDF-1, only the rapid release but not the sustained increase was inhibited in ΔCyto CXCR4. Selective desensitization of the first calcium peak suggests that calcium influx, as opposed to mobilization of intracellular calcium, is independently regulated, perhaps by distinct pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins or G-protein independent effectors. This remains to be explored. The cytoplasmic tail of CXCR4 contains 18 serine/threonine residues which are likely targets for phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and second messenger-activated protein kinases (35Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51 (352–353): 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Like other CXC chemokine receptors (28Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), CXCR4 is also phosphorylated by PKC activation by PMA (Fig. 3). The complete inhibition of PMA-induced phosphorylation and partial inhibition of SDF-1-induced phosphorylation by staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, suggests that agonist-induced phosphorylation of CXCR4 has two components, one represented by the activation of PKC and another due to a staurosporine-insensitive G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) that phosphorylates the agonist occupied form of the receptors. Multiple G-protein-coupled receptor kinases were previously identified in phagocytic leukocytes (37Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9398-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the homologous and heterologous desensitization of chemoattractant receptors (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, signals other than receptor phosphorylation were reported to be responsible for a phenomenon termed class desensitization (38Richardson R.M. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27829-27833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,39Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that PLCβ3 was phosphorylated both by PKC and PKA mediated pathways (25Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and PLCβ2 was phosphorylated by PKA (24Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Previous Western blot experiments using isoform-specific antibodies have shown that PLCβ3 is the only known PLCβ isoform expressed in RBL cells. Recent experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction also indicate that PLCβ3 is the only PLCβ isoform expressed in these cells. 2B. Haribabu, S. Sozzani, H. Ali, and R. Snyderman, unpublished results. The data presented herein with CXCR4 and ΔCyto CXCR4 indicates that both PKC and PKA activation negatively regulates the signaling of CXCR4 independent of receptor phosphorylation. In addition, PKC also has a receptor phosphorylation-dependent action on the function of CXCR4. Demonstration of PLCβ3 phosphorylation by SDF-1, PMA, and cAMP in cells expressing ΔCyto CXCR4 suggest that phosphorylation of this enzyme may be responsible for attenuation of signal transduction through phospholipase C (Fig. 5). Ligand binding is known to cause rapid internalization of many G-protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (36Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 40von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SDF-1 binding results in the internalization of CXCR4 and phosphorylation facilitates this process but is not absolutely required. In the case of β2-adrenergic receptors, phosphorylation by receptor kinases was shown to enhance the arrestin-dependent internalization (43Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). PKC activation by PMA also induced sequestration of CXCR4 which was completely dependent on the presence of cytoplasmic tail. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR4 is likely responsible for the down-regulation of CXCR4, but this contention will have to be confirmed by substitution mutations of the PKC sites on the receptor. PMA-induced down-regulation of CD4 in the presence of GP120 required an accessory protein and it was recently shown that this accessory protein is likely CXCR4 (44Golding H. Dimitrov D.S.

Dimitrov D.S. Golding H. Science. 1996; 274: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that this down-regulation may involve phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic tail of CXCR4. The phosphorylation independent reduction in surface expression of ΔCyto CXCR4 suggests an additional motif regulating internalization. Multiple mechanisms for internalization of surface proteins were described (40von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zhang J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation at either one of the two independent clusters of phosphorylation sites in m2-muscarinic receptors is sufficient for agonist-induced internalization of the receptor, whereas mutation of both clusters severely impaired internalization (48Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Internalization of type A cholecystokinin receptor was unaffected by C-terminal truncation, whereas internalization of type B cholecystokinin receptor was significantly reduced in a C-terminal truncation mutant (49Pohl M. Silvente-Poirot S. Pisegna J.R. Tarasova N.I. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18179-18184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While arrestins and dynamin appear to play an important role in phosphorylation-dependent sequestration of G-protein-coupled receptors (43Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S.

It is, at present, not known whether internalization of receptors has any direct relevance to HIV-1 infection. While signal transduction through G-proteins is not required for the usage of CCR5 as co-receptor for HIV-1L, it is not known whether internalization defective mutants will act as co-receptors (50Atchison R.E.

Mackay C.R. Gerard N.P. Sodroski J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6854-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The rapid ligand-induced internalization will have the effect of reducing surface expression and as a consequence availability of the co-receptor. In addition, PMA induced desensitization as well as down-regulation of CXCR4 suggests that activation of other receptors that enhance PKC activity are likely to have an effect on signal transduction and surface expression of this receptor. In summary, we have established a model for stable functional expression of CXCR4 and shown that receptor activity is regulated at multiple levels by receptor phosphorylation dependent and independent mechanisms. The ability to express mutant receptors should allow for the analysis and functional consequences of interactions of HIV-1 GP120 and CD4 with CXCR4. We thank Dr. Barton F. Haynes for sharing the 12G5 antibody generously provided by Dr. James Hoxie."

The domain, as expected, adopts the dinucleotide-binding fold, and contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif with bound Mg2+ at the top of the β-sheet. Comparison with the crystal structures of the leukocyte integrin I domains reveals a new helix (the C-helix) protruding from the metal ion-dependent adhesion site face of the domain which creates a groove centered on the magnesium ion. Modeling of a collagen triple helix into the groove suggests that a glutamic acid side chain from collagen can coordinate the metal ion, and that the C-helix insert is a major determinant of binding specificity. The binding site for echovirus-1 maps to a distinct surface of the α2-I domain (one edge of the β-sheet), consistent with data showing that virus and collagen binding occur by different mechanisms. Comparison with the homologous von Willebrand factor A3 domain, which also binds collagen, suggests that the two domains bind collagen in different ways.

The integrins are a family of plasma membrane proteins that transduce bidirectional signals between the cytoplasm and the extracellular matrix or other cells (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar). The integrin α2β1 is expressed on a variety of cell types, serving as the collagen receptor on platelets and fibroblasts, and as both a collagen and laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (2Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 3Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J.

Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In common with six other integrin α-chains (α1, αD, αE, αL, αM, and αX) the α2 chain contains a 200-amino acid inserted domain, the I domain, that is homologous to the von Willebrand factor A domains (5Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R. Matrix. 1993; 13: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recombinant α2-I domain recapitulates many of the ligand binding properties of the parent integrin (6Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H.

Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It exhibits specific binding to various fibrillar collagens, and two groups have shown that, like collagen binding to the complete receptor (9Santoro S.A.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), binding to the I domain is cation-dependent, being supported by magnesium or manganese but not by calcium (7Tuckwell D.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The triple-helical structure of collagen is required for recognition by α2β1, but specific collagen sequences have not been identified (for review, see Ref. 12Tuckwell D. Humphries M. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 649-657Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of an integrin I domain, from αMβ2, showed that it adopts the dinucleotide-binding fold, with a central parallel β-sheet surrounded on both sides by α-helices (13Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In this class of fold, a functional surface of the domain always lies at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet (14Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). In the I domain, a novel cation coordination sphere is located there, and in the αM-I domain crystal structure with bound Mg2+, a glutamate side chain from a neighboring I domain in the crystal lattice completes the octahedral coordination sphere of the metal. This led to the suggestion that the glutamate behaves as a ligand mimetic, as most integrin ligands possess a critical aspartate residue (or glutamate) as a key feature of their integrin-binding motifs, and mutation of any of the metal-coordinating side chains of the I domain (8Kamata T.

This motif was therefore dubbed the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; vWF-A3, von Willebrand Factor A3 domain; αLMn-I, αL-I domain with bound Mn2+; αMMn-I, αM-I domain with bound Mn2+; αMMg-I, αM-I domain with bound Mg2+; RMS, root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; vWF-A3, von Willebrand Factor A3 domain; αLMn-I, αL-I domain with bound Mn2+; αMMn-I, αM-I domain with bound Mn2+; αMMg-I, αM-I domain with bound Mg2+; RMS, root mean square. (13Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Apart from the highly conserved residues that directly coordinate the metal, the upper surface of the domain surrounding the MIDAS motif is highly variable, suggesting that the metal-Glu/Asp bond contributes some but not all of the binding energy, with the rest of the energy, and the specificity, arising from further interactions (ionic/polar/hydrophobic) between complementary surfaces of the integrin and ligand. In support of this notion, Huang and Springer (18Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) utilized mouse-human chimeras and site-specific mutagenesis to demonstrate that residues essential for the interaction of αLβ2 with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 are located on the MIDAS face surrounding the site of metal coordination. In addition, two of the epitopes for function-blocking antibodies map to the same face (19Champe M. McIntyre B.W. Berman P.W. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of an A-domain from von Willebrand Factor (vWF-A3) has also been solved recently (24Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We now report the crystal structure of the α2-I domain, which we determined as a first step in understanding the atomic level determinants of ligand binding, and compare the structure with other A/I domains. vWF-A3 also binds collagen, suggesting that the two domains might have similar binding motifs. Our crystal structure suggests that they do not. Human α2-I domain (residues 140–337) was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, cleaved, and purified as described previously (25King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was next loaded onto an affinity iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) charged with Ni2+ and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–200 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled, diluted 3-fold with distilled water and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion, by mixing 3 μl of protein and reservoir solution (16–20% polyethylene glycol 8 K, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol) at room temperature. Crystals grow to a typical size of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm in 2–3 days and belong to the space group P1 with cell dimensions: a = 40.5 Å,b = 43.3 Å, c = 68.0 Å, α = 88.3°, β = 76.6°, γ = 66.7°. Isomorphous crystals grow in the presence of manganese. A 2.5-Å data set (see Table I) was collected from a single crystal mounted and frozen in a stream of boiled-off nitrogen at 100 K using a Rigaku RU-200 x-ray generator with focusing mirrors and an RAXIS II image plate. Data were reduced with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing.

This data set was used to perform the molecular replacement calculations and the early stages of refinement. A room temperature data set was subsequently collected from an imperfect twin. As the twins of the crystal were randomly oriented and diffracted with approximately equal intensity, both triclinic lattices could be indexed and data merged, with anR merge = 11.2% (31% in the outer shell) and completeness of 96.5% to 1.9-Å resolution.

Molecular replacement was performed with AMoRe (28Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The top two peaks in a cross-rotation function gave the correct orientations of the two monomers, and their relative displacement was readily determined with a translation function. Applying this solution to all protein atoms in the αM-I structure resulted in a model with good crystal packing, and an R factor and correlation coefficient of 52% and .24, respectively (20-6 Å), improving to 50% and .48 on rigid body refinement. The αM-I model was next stripped of side chains and loop regions; the remaining 114 alanine and glycine residues constituted 5 α-helices (α7 omitted) and 6 β-strands, which were refined as individual rigid bodies in XPLOR (29Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using 10–2.8 Å data. TheR factor at this stage was 41.6% andR free (calculated on 10% of reflections) was 47.9%. A 2F o − F c electron density map revealed a number of new features including several side chains and the C-terminal helix α7. At this point, the refinement was extended to the resolution limit of the room temperature data set (1.9 Å). Several cycles of simulated annealing XPLOR refinement, followed by inspection of 2F o − F c maps and manual model building, led to a complete polypeptide trace. Water molecules were then added at the positions of F o −F c peaks greater than 3ς, where reasonable hydrogen bonding partners existed. After applying a bulk solvent correction, the current R factor is 19.6% for all data between 15 and 1.9 Å (R free = 24.8%); the model includes residues 139–339 (including 2 residues at the C terminus from the expression construct) for both molecules in the asymmetric unit, and 267 water molecules. The only residue in an unfavored region of the Ramachandran plot is Ala188. Electron density for this residue is persuasive and stabilizing hydrogen bonds exist. There are two cis proline residues, Pro158 in the βA-α1 turn and Pro307 in the α6-βF turn.Table ISummary of crystallographic analysisResolutionNo. of observations (completeness/redundancy)R sym1-aR sym = Σ‖I−〈I〉‖/ΣI,where I = observed intensity, 〈I〉 = average intensity from multiple observations of symmetry related reflections.

We built a collagen triple helix based on the published crystal structure (30Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) (PDB entry 1cag) of a collagen-like peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Hyp-Ala-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5. This peptide contains a single Gly to Ala substitution at the center of a 30-residue sequence which disrupts the (X-Y-Gly) n motif, creating a local untwisting of the helix. We used repeats 2 to 4 (residues 4–12) of each polypeptide chain and extended these along the helical axis to generate an ideal collagen triple helix 80 Å long. At the center of this triple helix, a proline (at the Xposition) or a hydroxyproline (at Y) was replaced with a glutamate in its preferred gauche(+),trans side chain conformation. The collagen model and I domain were then manually docked as rigid bodies by constraining the distance between the glutamate carboxylate and the metal ion to 2 Å (the observed bond distance in the αMβ2 I domain) and by minimizing intermolecular steric clashes (monitored using the CCP4 program CONTACT (28Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar)). With Glu at either theX or Y position, a convincing fit could be found with only minor steric clashes. These clashes could be relieved either by trimming 3 or 4 of the collagen Pro/Hyp side chains to Ala or Gly, or by allowing a small number of side chains on the I domain to adopt alternate rotamer conformations. When the Glu was replaced by an Asp, severe steric clashes occurred between backbone atoms of the two docking partners. The structure, as expected, adopts the classic dinucleotide-binding fold, with seven helices surrounding a core of five parallel β-strands and one short antiparallel β-strand (Figs. 1 and2). Compared with the αM and αL-I domains, the most striking difference is a new turn-and-a-half of α-helix, residues 284–288, which we call the C-helix, extending from the top of strand βE and protruding from the MIDAS face (see below). There is a buried glutamic acid in place of the usual glycine in the position following the MIDAS aspartic acid (DESNS), but this is accommodated without distortion of the MIDAS motif. Space is created by a 1-residue insertion in the α3-α4 loop that wraps over the top of βA and βB, and the charge is neutralized by a salt bridge to Arg192 from βC. A buried water molecule adjacent to the MIDAS motif is closely conserved in αM-I and αL-I; it makes hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbon oxygen of Gly255, to the side chain hydroxyls of Thr223and Thr253 and to the carboxylate of Glu299.Figure 2Sequence alignments of the human integrin I domains (α2-I, αM-I, and αL-I) and the vWF-A3, with α-helices and β-sheets indicated for the α2-I domain. Sequences are aligned based on structural superpositions (38May A.C.W. Johnson M.S. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Lowercase letters denote a lack of structural similarity. Sequence identities with the α2-I domain are 26.7% (αM), 24.0% (αL), and 20.3% (vWF-A3). The αM and αL-I domains form a subfamily with 33.9% sequence identity. The α1-I domain sequence alignment is also shown; its structure has not been determined but is likely to be very similar to the α2-I domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The buried Phe in αM-I and αL-I (Ile in vWF-A3) at the top of helix α7 (which becomes exposed in the “active” conformer of αM-I (21Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar)) is replaced by a glutamic acid in the α2-I domain (Glu318). The side chain turns upwards to avoid complete burial, creating a cavity which is filled by a water molecule that is not found in αL-I, αM-I, or vWF-A3. The water molecule hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of the MIDAS aspartate (Asp254), the main chain nitrogens of Gly284 and Tyr285, as well as the carboxylate of Glu318. A salt bridge is provided by the side chain of Arg288 from the C-helix. The orientation of the α7 helix is nevertheless very similar to that in the αM-IMn structure. Sequences of α2β1 have been reported from human, cow, mouse, and pig. Within the I domains, 43 positions are not invariant. These all lie on the surface of the molecule, except for two conservative changes in the hydrophobic core (Val182-Met and Leu328-Ile in bovine). None of the changes are found on the MIDAS face, including the new C-helix. Although the two molecules in the crystal unit cell were refined independently the overall structures are almost identical (RMSD = 0.25 Å for main chain atoms) except for the chain termini. Both chain termini are ordered to a greater extent than in other I domain structures. The N terminus extends 5 residues before strand βA, and the C terminus 3 residues beyond helix α7. In the crystal, a disulfide bridge is formed between the N-terminal cysteine residues (Cys140) of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and this results in different conformations of the termini. It is unlikely that such a disulfide bond forms in vivo, and Springer (31Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) has predicted that Cys140 makes a disulfide bridge with a cysteine residue within the 4-1 loop of his propeller model. In one molecule, the C-terminal residues (335–337) pack into a crevice formed by the N-terminal loop (residues 138–142) and the α4-βD loop (residues 244–246). The side chain of Ile335 packs into this crevice, the main chain makes a number of β-sheet hydrogen bonds to both loops, and the N and C termini are brought into very close proximity. In the second molecule in the crystal, it appears that disulfide bond formation induces a new conformation in the N-terminal loop which squeezes the C-terminal residues out of the crevice, and we suggest that the first molecule better reflects the native conformation of the domain termini in the intact integrin. The MIDAS motif (Fig.3) binds a magnesium ion in the α2-I domain, as expected given the strict sequence conservation of the motif throughout the integrin I domains (the MIDAS motif in the vWF-A3 domain is not strictly conserved, and the vestigial motif does not bind a metal ion (24Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). The metal is directly coordinated by three side chains (from residues Ser153, Ser155, and Asp254) and three water molecules, making strong bonds (2.0 ± 0.1 Å) in an octahedral arrangement. Asp151makes hydrogen bonds to Ser153 and a water molecule (2.7–2.9 Å) but no direct bond. Thr221 does not coordinate the metal directly (Mg-OH(Thr) = 4.1 Å), but makes a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) to one of the water molecules. This coordination is very similar to that found in the Mn2+-bound structures of αL-I and αM-I (αLMn-I and αMMn-I, defined as the “inactive” form by Lee et al. (21Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar)), but different from the coordination observed in the αM-I structure with bound Mg2+ (αMMg-I, the active form). It is the first high resolution crystal structure of the inactive conformer with bound Mg2+, and confirms the coordination predicted from the lower resolution (2.8 Å) structure of αL-I with bound Mg2+ (23Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The role of the MIDAS threonine is intriguing; it is the only MIDAS residue that is absolutely critical for collagen binding to the recombinant α2-I domain (32Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is also critical for ligand binding in the αM-I and αL-I domains (33Kamata T. Wright R. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12531-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Only in the active αMMg-I domain does the threonine coordinate the metal directly, suggesting that the threonine is required for stability of the active conformer and supporting the theory of tertiary structure change within the I domain (21Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It appears that using modified protein, the requirement for cation can be circumvented (see below), but it is puzzling that the threonine remains essential under those conditions also (32Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This issue will only be properly resolved by structure determination of an authentic I domain-ligand complex. The central core of five parallel β-strands and one short antiparallel β-strand is highly conserved among the integrin I domains and vWF-A3, with RMS deviations of 0.6–0.7 Å (Figs. 1 and 2). The βB-βC hairpin and a β-bulge at the end of βC are almost identical in all four structures. By contrast, the helices are more variable, with only helices α1 and α4 showing a general agreement of length and orientation. Helix α2 is replaced by a short turn and helix α3 extended by a turn in α2-I and vWF-A3. The C-terminal helix, α7, has a similar conformation in αM-IMn, α2-I, and vWF-A3, but is different in αL-I, where the helix splays out from the side of the domain, exposing a large hydrophobic crevice that is filled by a hydrophobic C-terminal sequence from another molecule in the crystal lattice (22Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The conformation of helix α7 is also very different in the active conformer of αM-IMg, where a functional role in propagating structural changes from the MIDAS face to the rest of the integrin has been proposed (21Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The loops surrounding the MIDAS motif, which comprise the MIDAS face, are βA-α1, α3-α4, βD-α5, and βE-α6 (Fig. 4). These loops, except for βE-α6, have been implicated in ligand binding to the αL-I and αM-I domains by mutagenesis experiments (18Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Champe M. McIntyre B.W. Berman P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1388-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15858-15861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The loops have highly variable surface-exposed residues in all of the A/I domains, even when the main chain conformation is conserved, consistent with their being the principal determinants of ligand binding specificity. The βA-α1 loop, which includes the metal-coordinating DxSxS consensus sequence, has a 2-residue deletion in the α2-I domain, at the beginning of the α1 helix, but is otherwise conserved. The α3-α4 loop has a 1-residue insertion in the α2-I domain, which creates space for the glutamate (in DESNS), as already noted. The βD-α5 loop is similar in α2-I, αL-I, and vWF-A3, but different in αM-I, while αL-I lacks most of helix α5. The βE-α6 loop is the site of the principal insertion in the α2-I domain that creates the protruding C-helix. Its conformation is similar in αL-I and αM-I, but very different in α2-I and vWF-A3. It undergoes substantial rearrangement in the two structures of αM-I, creating an acidic pocket in the active conformer, and we suggest that this loop is a major determinant of ligand specificity. Integrin α2β1 binds several types of fibrillar collagens (types I-VI and XI), and recombinant α2-I domain exhibits specific binding to some, but not all of these (reviewed in Ref. 12Tuckwell D. Humphries M. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 649-657Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two groups have shown that collagen binding to the α2-I domain is cation-dependent, being supported by Mg2+ and Mn2+ but not by Ca2+ (7Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MIDAS residues Asp151, Thr221, and Asp254 are all essential for collagen binding to the α2β1 integrin, and Thr221 is also critical in the recombinant α2-I domain (8Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the sequence motifs in collagen to which α2β1 bind have yet to be defined, the triple helical structure is required, and Asp/Glu and Arg (but not Lys) have been shown to be important for the binding of α1β1 to collagen IV (34Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The new C-helix on top of the MIDAS face creates a groove about 25 Å long and 20 Å wide centered on the metal ion, with a tyrosine residue (Tyr285) projecting prominently into the groove. Into this groove we manually docked a collagen triple helix, which was derived from the crystal structure of a collagen-like peptide (30Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) and modified to contain a glutamate residue to coordinate the MIDAS metal ion (Fig.5). The shape of the groove places strong constraints on the position of the collagen helix; in particular, the projecting C-helix, the top of helix α6, and their connecting loop, severely restrict rotations of the collagen about an axis parallel to the glutamate-metal bond. The amino acid side chains in natural collagen sequences would restrict rotations still further. Replacement of the glutamate by the shorter aspartate creates steric clashes in all possible orientations of the collagen. The model predicts that the following I domain residues make contact with the collagen: from the βA-α1 turn (Asn154), from the α3-α4 turn (Asp219 and Leu220), from the βD-α5 turn (Glu256 and His258), and from the C-helix, α6 and C-α6 turn (Tyr285, Asn289, Leu291, Asn295 and Lys298). The “footprint” on the collagen is about 10 residues long. Mutagenesis data (32Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that individual alanine mutants of two of these residues, Glu256 and Asn295, do not detectably affect collagen binding, but given the large number of potential contacts this may not be surprising. The epitopes for two blocking antibodies have been mapped to Asp160 and Tyr216 (8Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These residues lie on the surface of the domain to the side of the MIDAS face, 12–15 Å from the MIDAS motif, consistent with their forming parts of epitopes for blocking antibodies. Takada's group (32Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported conflicting data on collagen binding, showing that in their system binding is cation-independent. They did, however, also show that binding was completely abrogated by alanine mutagenesis of the MIDAS residue Thr221. A possible resolution of these conflicting data has been provided by Tuckwellet al. (7Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that although most binding was cation-dependent, there was nonetheless a cation-independent fraction which correlated with the degree of protein modification. Takada's group modified their protein by iodination. Our crystal structure reveals a tyrosine residue on the MIDAS face very close to the metal ion, and our modeling studies suggest that this tyrosine is intimately involved in collagen binding. It is therefore plausible that iodination of this tyrosine affects I domain-collagen binding, either by providing an additional hydrophobic element to binding, or by directly inducing a conformational change to a high affinity state, abrogating the need for a metal ion. The α1-I domain has a similar but not identical ligand-binding range as α2-I, binding collagen types I and III-VI, and laminins (17Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 sequences form a subfamily distinct from the leukocyte integrins, and the sequences can be aligned with no gaps, so that the α2-I domain crystal structure provides an excellent main chain model for α1-I. The MIDAS motif is strictly conserved in α1-I, as is the aspartic acid at the top of helix α7. The new C-helix is structurally conserved, although divergent in sequence (Tyr285 is replaced by a serine, while Leu286 is replaced by a tyrosine). The βA-α1 and βD-α5 loops are strictly conserved around the MIDAS motif, while the α3-α4 loop is divergent. The vWF-A1 and A3 domains have been shown to bind collagens type I and III. Binding to A3 is independent of cation, and the crystal structure of vWF-A3 does not contain a bound metal (24Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the MIDAS residues do not affect collagen binding. The βE-α6 loop, which contains the C-helix insert in α2-I, is truncated in vWF-A3, so that it is even shorter than in αL-I and αM-I. The result is that the vestigial MIDAS face is quite featureless, suggesting that α2-I and vWF-A3 bind collagen in different ways. The α2β1 integrin is the receptor for the human pathogen echovirus-1 (4Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the α2-I domain binds directly to the virus (25King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus binding is cation-independent (35Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is not affected by mutations of the MIDAS motif (37King S.L. Kamata T. Cunningham J.A. Emsley J. Liddington R.C. Takada Y. Bergelson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28518-28522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and does not require activation of the integrin (35Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). King et al. (37King S.L. Kamata T. Cunningham J.A. Emsley J. Liddington R.C. Takada Y.

These residues map to the loops flanking both ends of helix α3, forming part of a flat surface (∼20 Å × 30 Å) at one end of the β-sheet, adjacent to but not overlapping the MIDAS face. This location is consistent with biochemical data suggesting that the collagen and echovirus-binding sites are distinct (35Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Several monoclonal antibodies block both virus and collagen binding, supporting the idea that the binding sites are in close proximity (35Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Part of the epitope for one such antibody, 5E8, has been mapped; it includes residue Tyr216 (36Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J.

https://openalex.org/W2098867430,"The mechanism of IFN resistance was examined in three long-term cell lines, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96, exhibiting significant variation in responsiveness to the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of type I IFNs. The JAK-STAT components involved in IFN signal transduction were analyzed in detail. After exposure to IFN, activation of the IFN type I receptor-linked tyrosine kinases, JAK-1 and TYK-2, was detected at similar levels in both IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cell types, indicating that IFN resistance did not result from a deficiency in signaling at the level of receptor-associated kinase activation. However, analysis of ISGF3 transcription factor components, STAT1, STAT2, and p48-ISGF3γ, revealed that their expression and activation correlated with cellular IFN responsiveness. The analysis was extended to also include IFN-sensitive primary melanocytes, three additional IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines, and seven cell cultures recently established from melanoma patient biopsies. It was consistently observed that the most marked difference in ISGF3 was a lack of STAT1 in the resistant versus the sensitive cells. Transfection of the IFN-resistant MM96 cell line to express increased levels of STAT1 protein partially restored IFN responsiveness in an antiviral assay. We conclude that a defect in the level of STAT1 and possibly all three ISGF3 components in IFN-resistant human melanoma cells may be a general phenomenon responsible for reduced cellular responsiveness of melanomas to IFNs. The mechanism of IFN resistance was examined in three long-term cell lines, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96, exhibiting significant variation in responsiveness to the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of type I IFNs. The JAK-STAT components involved in IFN signal transduction were analyzed in detail. After exposure to IFN, activation of the IFN type I receptor-linked tyrosine kinases, JAK-1 and TYK-2, was detected at similar levels in both IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant cell types, indicating that IFN resistance did not result from a deficiency in signaling at the level of receptor-associated kinase activation. However, analysis of ISGF3 transcription factor components, STAT1, STAT2, and p48-ISGF3γ, revealed that their expression and activation correlated with cellular IFN responsiveness. The analysis was extended to also include IFN-sensitive primary melanocytes, three additional IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines, and seven cell cultures recently established from melanoma patient biopsies. It was consistently observed that the most marked difference in ISGF3 was a lack of STAT1 in the resistant versus the sensitive cells. Transfection of the IFN-resistant MM96 cell line to express increased levels of STAT1 protein partially restored IFN responsiveness in an antiviral assay. We conclude that a defect in the level of STAT1 and possibly all three ISGF3 components in IFN-resistant human melanoma cells may be a general phenomenon responsible for reduced cellular responsiveness of melanomas to IFNs. The interferons (IFNs) comprise a family of multifunctional polypeptides, recognized for their antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunoregulatory functions (reviewed in Refs. 1Joklik W.K. Field B.N.

Lippincott, Philadelphia1991: 247-274Google Scholar). Type I IFNs, IFN-α and -β, exert their biological actions by binding to high-affinity cell-surface receptors that stimulate phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on type I receptor components (3Platanias L.C.

Following tyrosine phosphorylation, the activated tyrosine kinases then induce the formation and activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor IFN-stimulated gene factor 3α (ISGF3α) (8Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The ISGF3α transcription factor is a complex of STAT molecules, including STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1 exists in two forms of 91 kDa (STAT1α) and 84 kDa (STAT1β), and STAT2 is a 113-kDa protein (reviewed in Refs. 9Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

During the classical type I IFN response, the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 proteins form heterodimers (11Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which complex with p48-ISGF3γ, a DNA-binding protein. The ISGF3 complex then migrates to the nucleus and binds to the ISRE to activate transcription of IFN-regulated genes (reviewed in Ref. 12Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The effect of IFN in the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma has been demonstrated in several clinical trials with an overall response rate of approximately 22% (reviewed in Ref. 13Estroz Z. Kurzrock R. Talpaz M. Interferons: Basic Principles and Clinical Applications. R. G. Landes Company, Texas1993: 53-76Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of results from studies using tumor colony-forming assays in vitro suggests that approximately 50% of the tumors contain cells nonresponsive to the antiproliferative effects of IFNs (14Schiller J.H.

The reasons for the differences in responsiveness of human melanoma cells to IFN in vitro and in vivo remain unclear. However, many studies have reported various defects in the IFN system as being responsible for the different sensitivities to type I IFNs in cell lines established from other tumor types. Such defects include: i) IFN-α/-β gene deletion in acute leukemia cell lines (16Colamonici O. Domanski P. Platanias L.C. Diaz M.O. Blood. 1992; 80: 744-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and malignant T cells (17Heyman M. Granders D. Brondum-Nielsen K. Cederblad B. Liu Y. Xu B. Einhorn S. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 425-434PubMed Google Scholar); ii) alteration or down-regulation of IFN-α receptor gene expression in hairy cell leukemia (18Billard C. Sigaux F. Castaigne S. Valensi F. Flandrin G. Degos L. Falcoff E. Aguet M. Blood. 1986; 67: 821-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lymphoblastoid cells (19Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2654-2659PubMed Google Scholar); iii) interference with the induction of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes in B lymphoid cell lines (20Aman P. von Gabain A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Burkitt's lymphoma cells (21Kanda K. Decker T. Aman P. Wahlstrom M. von Gabain A. Kallin B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4930-4936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); iv) defects in the activation of transcription factors in Daudi cells (22Dron M. Tovey M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1993; 13: 377-383Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), primary leukemia cells (23Xu B. Grander D. Sangfelt O. Einhorn S. Blood. 1994; 84: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in many other cancer cell types (24Petricoin III, E. David M. Fang H. Grimley P. Larner A.C. Vande Pol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, melanoma cell lines with a wide variation in their responsiveness to the antiproliferative (25Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and antiviral (26Wines B.D. Choe C.C. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. Ralph S.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1111-1120PubMed Google Scholar) activities of IFNs have been described. We have previously demonstrated that the difference in responsiveness among these melanoma cell lines is related neither to the receptor binding affinity nor to the numbers of IFN receptors on the cell surface (27Hertzog P.J. Johns T.G. Callister K.A. Dinatale A. Linnane A.W. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1990; 22: 1095-1102Google Scholar). In addition, the cDNA sequence encoding the type I receptor subunit (28Uze G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) isolated from IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines contained no significant difference from the prototypic Daudi cDNA sequence (29Payne M.J. Ralph S.J. De Veer M.J. Allen K. Linnane A.W. Devenish R.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 283-288PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular differences in responsiveness to IFN of the melanoma cell lines could not be at the level of expression of the receptor, and the defect was likely to be the result of events downstream from the receptor (28Uze G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the IFN responsiveness of human melanoma cells could be correlated with the levels of IFN-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins (30Ralph S.J. Wines B.D. Payne M.J. Grubb D. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2248-2256PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to IFN was further investigated by analyzing the level of IFN-α2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, the expression and activation of components in the IFN signal transduction pathway, including the type I receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, JAK-1 and TYK-2, and the components of ISGF3. We present evidence that the loss of sensitivity to IFN in melanoma cells arises from a deficiency in the levels of the components of ISGF3, particularly STAT1 and a resulting deficiency in ISRE binding activity. M533, primary human melanocytes (Center for Hormone Research, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) were maintained in MGM2 melanocyte basal medium (Clonetics Corp., San Diego). Melanoma cell cultures (patient 1–7) were established from fresh surgical biopsies of melanoma metastases in regional lymph nodes (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III melanoma) and used from passages 2 to 15 (Immunology and Oncology Unit, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia) and melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, HT-144, SK-MEL-1, Hs294T (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), Li-Br (31Coates A.S. Crawford M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 59: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and MM96 (32Whitehead R.H. Little J.H. Mc Govern V.J. Russell P. Pigment Cell, Vol. 1. S. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1973: 382-389Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum. In all experiments, cells were stimulated with either 1000 IU/ml IFN-α2 (Hoffman-La Roche) or IFN-β (Berlex Biosciences, San Francisco) for the indicated time periods. For IFN-γ priming, cells were pretreated with 1000 IU/ml IFN-γ (Amersham Corp.) for 16 h prior to stimulation with IFN-α2. Cells were washed with ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with either ice-cold 1 × modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (33Luttrell D.K.

Antibodies used included anti-JAK-1 antiserum provided by Dr Andrew Wilks (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Victoria, Australia), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology (New York), anti-TYK-2, anti-STAT1 supershift, and anti-p48-ISGF3γ supershift antisera from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20, anti-STAT1, and anti-STAT2 antisera from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antiserum from Accurate Chemicals and Scientific Corp., (Westbury, NY), AC88 antibody to 90-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP 90) (34Sanchez E.R.

Chem. 1987; 262: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sheep anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody from Silenus (Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia). Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blots. The blot was incubated with the relevant primary antibody at a dilution according to the manufacturer's instruction. After stringent washing, the blot was incubated with the relevant secondary antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim). An HP Scan Jet IIcx/T (Hewlett Packard) densitometer calibrated using Kodak optical density (0.0–2.0 units) standard test strips was used to scan autoradiographs exposed to the immunoblot chemiluminescence signal. The MCID-M4 (version 3, Rev 1.3) microcomputer optical imaging system (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines, Ontario) was used for quantitation. The auto-contouring function was applied to quantitate the relative densities of bands. The optical density value for each band obtained was background subtracted before comparisons of the relative ratios of optical densities were determined. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1–5 μg of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies in 500 μl of 1 × IP (immunoprecipitation) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). If a monoclonal antibody was used, 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose suspension (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. When polyclonal antibody was used, 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension (Pharmacia) was used instead of protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with 1 × IP buffer and the proteins were eluted by the addition of 60 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a microfuge for 5 min, and the supernatant containing proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated by the procedure of Gough (35Gough N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 173: 93-95Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and subjected to Northern blot analysis (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The blot was probed with an α-32P-labeled full-length STAT1α/β cDNA (a gift from Dr. Chris Schindler, Dept. of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, NY) prepared using a Gigaprime random priming kit (Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia). The blot was stripped of probe by incubating the membrane in 95 °C distilled water for 30 min and subsequently reprobed with an α-32P-labeledPstI fragment of a rat GAPDH cDNA as described previously (37Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Dani C. Panabieres F. Sabouty S.E. Fort P. Jeanteur P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6951-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with IFN-γ as described in the text. 10 mm NaF was added with the IFN-α2 before the lysis of cells to inhibit the translocation of ISGF3 factor to the nucleus (8Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by resuspension of cells in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) followed by Dounce homogenization for 30 strokes. Cytoplasmic extracts were collected as supernatants following a 5 min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and incubated with 2 ng of γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the ISRE of ISG15 (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) and its complement (a gift from Dr. David Levy, Dept. of Pathology, New York University) in the presence of 2.5% Chaps (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid) detergent (38Hassanain H.H. Dai W. Gupta S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 4 μg of double-stranded poly dI/dC in 1 × binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 4% Ficoll, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40) for 20 min at room temperature. For supershifting, p48-ISGF3γ supershift antiserum was added into the reaction mixture after 10 min, and the incubation continued for a further 10 min. Following incubation, 2 μl of loading dye (containing 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanole) was added to each binding reaction, and samples were then electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 270–300 V in 0.25 × TBE (0.089 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.089m boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 4–5 h. Gels were dried and exposed to film. Antiproliferative (25Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl.

Int. 1993; 31: 1111-1120PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. An expression plasmid for STAT1 was constructed by inserting the full-length STAT1 cDNA into mammalian expression vector, pBPSTR1 (39Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce M. Breakfield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing a puromycin resistance gene (a gift from Dr. Steve Reeves, Massachusetts General Hospital, Molecular Neuro-Oncology). Transfection of BING cells (40Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), an amphotropic counterpart to the BOSC23 viral packaging cell line, was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as recommended (41Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). BOSC23 cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline (Sigma) during packaging of virus. MM96 cells that had been plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells the day before transfection were infected with filtered medium containing virus in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Cells were allowed to grow for 48 h before addition of puromycin (2.5 mg/ml; Sigma) for selection of resistant clones. The expression levels of STAT1 in clones were determined by immunoblotting. To study the mechanism responsible for the variation in IFN responsiveness in melanoma cells, three cell lines, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96, with well characterized differences in responsiveness to IFN-α2 were chosen. The levels of IFN-α2 required for 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) and 50% reduction in viral-mediated cytopathic effect (CPE50) were determined previously using antiproliferative (25Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and antiviral assays (26Wines B.D. Choe C.C. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. Ralph S.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1111-1120PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-α2concentrations required for IC50 were 190 IU/ml (SK-MEL-28), 1185 IU/ml (SK-MEL-3), and >5000 IU/ml (MM96) and for CPE50 were 6, 800, and >104 IU/ml, respectively. Thus, the order of responsivness to IFN-α2of these cell lines is SK-MEL-28 > SK-MEL-3 > MM96. A detailed analysis of the activation of the signaling components of the IFN signal transduction pathway in melanoma cell lines with different responses to IFN was undertaken. Antibodies to JAK-1 and TYK-2 were used to immunoprecipitate proteins from total cell lysates prepared from the melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96 following treatment with IFN-α2. All three cell lines exhibited an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases, JAK-1 (130 kDa) and TYK-2 (135 kDa) after a 30-min IFN-α2treatment (Fig. 1, A andC, respectively), whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK-1 or TYK-2 were not observed in unstimulated cells. When the immunoblots were stripped and analyzed for the level of expression of the protein kinases, JAK-1 and TYK-2, both the untreated and 30-min IFN-α2-treated samples prepared from each cell line were found to contain similar levels of protein (Fig. 1, B andD). These results indicate that after binding of IFN-α2 to the type I IFN receptor, the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases, JAK-1 and TYK-2, was induced in all three melanoma cell lines. The level of STAT1 protein expressed in each of the three melanoma cell lines was examined (Fig.2 B). Total cell lysates were prepared from equal numbers of SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting with antisera to STAT1. The IFN-resistant cell lines SK-MEL-3 and MM96 contained markedly less STAT1 protein compared with the level detected in the IFN-sensitive cell line, SK-MEL-28. A comparatively high level of STAT1, similar to that found in SK-MEL-28, was detected in another IFN-sensitive melanoma cell line, Hs294T (data not shown). Thus, SK-MEL-28 is not an atypical cell line with respect to STAT1, despite it being the most IFN-responsive melanoma cell line that we have tested. Northern blotting analysis of STAT1 transcript levels (Fig. 3) also revealed decreased STAT1 mRNA expression in the IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-3 and MM96. These results are consistent with a correlation between the IFN resistance of cells and a deficiency in the levels of STAT1.Figure 3STAT1 mRNA levels in SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96. Whole cell RNA was isolated and 20 μg was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. RNA was then transferred onto zeta-probe membrane for hybridization with a α-32P-labeled STAT1α/β cDNA probe. The membrane was washed and autoradiographed. Subsequently, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a α-32P-labeled GAPDH probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the IFN-resistant cell lines SK-MEL-3 and MM96 were shown to be deficient in STAT1, the levels of STAT1 present in several other melanoma cell lines that had been previously characterized to be IFN-resistant (25Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar,26Wines B.D. Choe C.C. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. Ralph S.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1111-1120PubMed Google Scholar) were also analyzed by immunoblotting with antiserum to STAT1. All three of the additional IFN-resistant cell lines examined, HT-144, Li-Br, and SK-MEL-1, had a reduced level of STAT1 protein compared with the level of STAT1 in the IFN-sensitive cells (Fig.4 A). Similar levels of the two different housekeeping control proteins, HSP90 and GAPDH (Fig.4 B), were detected by immunoblotting equivalent amounts of the cell samples indicating that similar amounts of total cellular proteins were loaded for each of these cell types. Thus, the reduced levels of STAT1 in IFN-resistant cells were not simply due to variation in sample loadings but reflected differences in cellular STAT1 expression. The relative levels of STAT1 were determined by comparing the ratio of densitometric values obtained for STAT1 to the densitometric values obtained for GAPDH (TableI).Table ISTAT1 levels in melanoma cell linesCellsDensitometric value of STAT1/densitometric value of GAPDH1-aValues derived from analysis of Fig. 4, Aand B.Relative STAT1 level1-bRatios of densitometric values of STAT1/densitometric values of GAPDH were standardized for comparison relative to SK-MEL-28 arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.00.SK-MEL-2811.7811.00HT1444.3000.36SK-MEL-31.7850.15LiBr1.1780.10SK-MEL-13.9090.33MM961.0600.091-a Values derived from analysis of Fig. 4, Aand B.1-b Ratios of densitometric values of STAT1/densitometric values of GAPDH were standardized for comparison relative to SK-MEL-28 arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.00. Open table in a new tab Cell lysates prepared from equal numbers of SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting to compare the levels of STAT2 (Fig. 2 A). As with STAT1, the IFN-sensitive SK-MEL-28 cells contained the highest levels of STAT2; the less IFN-responsive SK-MEL-3 cells contained the intermediate levels and the IFN-resistant MM96 cells contained the lowest levels of STAT2. The difference in the level of STAT2 between SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-3 was not as significant as the difference found in the levels of STAT1. Densitometric analysis of immunoblot signals indicated that the STAT2 level of SK-MEL-28 was only 2 times higher than that of SK-MEL-3. MM96 had a much lower expression level of STAT2, some 4 times lower than that observed for SK-MEL-28. Examination of the levels of p48-ISGF3γ expression (Fig. 2 C) revealed that SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-3 have relatively similar levels of p48-ISGF3γ. The level of p48-ISGF3γ in MM96 is approximately 2 times lower than SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-3 as determined by densitometric analysis. Thus, the IFN-resistant cell lines have mild deficiencies of STAT2 and p48-ISGF3γ compared with the IFN-sensitive cell line, SK-MEL-28. To determine whether the deficiency of ISGF3 components particularly STAT1 in IFN-resistant cells affected the ability of IFN to activate ISGF3 binding to the ISRE, EMSA was performed using the standard ISGF3-ISG15 response element interaction (8Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from cultures of SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, and MM96 cells incubated with IFN-α2for 30 min, and then samples were subjected to EMSA. Lysates prepared from SK-MEL-3 and MM96 cells were found to have lower levels of activated ISGF3 complex in comparison to that prepared from SK-MEL-28 cells (Fig. 5). For some of the experiments, where indicated, cells were IFN-γ-primed for 16 h prior to the stimulation with IFN-α2 because IFN-γ-priming has been shown to result in the up-regulation of cellular ISGF3 levels (42Gao P.-Q. Sims S.H. Chang D.C. Deisseroth A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12380-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A higher amount of ISGF3 was detected in IFN-γ-primed SK-MEL-28 cells when compared with non-IFN-γ-primed cells (Fig. 5). The low levels of activated ISGF3 in the IFN-resistant cell lines, SK-MEL-3 and MM96, could only be detected by EMSA when lysates were prepared from IFN-γ-primed cells and when there were much greater numbers of cells (SK-MEL-3, 2×; MM96, 4×) relative to SK-MEL-28. The levels of STAT1 in cultured melanoma cells established from patient biopsies were also studied to determine whether the deficiency in ISGF3 components, in particular STAT1, was a common phenomenon. All of the melanoma cells established from patient biopsies were extremely unresponsive to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-β (IC50 of >5000 IU/ml IFN-β) (data not shown). Cultures of primary human melanocytes that were responsive to IFN were included as a positive control (IC50 of approximately 20 IU/ml). These melanocytes contained levels of STAT1 protein similar to that of SK-MEL-28 (Fig.6 A). Total cell lysates prepared from recently cultured patient biopsies were examined on the basis of equivalent amounts of total cellular protein instead of equal numbers of cells because a great variation in the sizes of cells was found. Immunoblotting with GAPDH antiserum (Fig. 6 B) showed almost identical levels of GAPDH present in each sample. Reduced levels of STAT1 were observed in the IFN-resistant melanoma cells compared with SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 6 A). The relative levels of STAT1 were determined by comparing the ratio of densitometric values obtained for STAT1 to the densitometric values obtained for GAPDH (TableII). As shown in Table II, primary human melanocytes have a significantly higher level of STAT1 than was detected in the IFN-resistant melanoma cells from patients. As STAT1 protein in melanoma cells established from patients 3 and 5 could not be detected (Fig. 6 A), samples from patients 3 and 5 containing greater amounts of protein were analyzed. For comparison, an equivalent sample was prepared from the moderately IFN-sensitive (IC50 of approximately 500 IU/ml) cells established from patient 7. The relative expression of STAT1 in these different melanoma cell samples (Fig. 6 C) was analyzed by determining the comparative ratios of the densitometric values obtained for STAT1 to the densitometric values obtained for GAPDH (Fig. 6 E and Table III). A low level of STAT1 protein was detected in the sample from patient 3 but STAT1 could only be observed in the sample of patient 5 when the blot was developed and exposed for a longer time period (10 min instead of 1 min) (Fig.6 D). The sample from the moderately IFN-sensitive cells of patient 7 contained much more STAT1 protein than the IFN-resistant cells, consistent with the observation that cellular responsiveness to IFN correlates with cellular STAT1 levels.Table IISTAT1 levels in melanoma patient cellsCellsDensitometric value of STAT1/densitometric value of GAPDH2-aValues derived from analysis of Fig. 6, Aand B.Relative STAT1 level2-bRatios of densitometric values of STAT1/densitometric values of GAPDH were standardized for comparison relative to melanocytes arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.00.Melanocytes0.7881.00SK-MEL-280.9311.18SK-MEL-30.1950.24MM960.1660.21Patient 10.2100.26Patient 20.0800.10Patient 3Patient 40.3580.45Patient 5Patient 60.5290.672-a Values derived from analysis of Fig. 6, Aand B.2-b Ratios of densitometric values of STAT1/densitometric values of GAPDH were standardized for comparison relative to melanocytes arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.00.

Open table in a new tab Since STAT1 levels are low in IFN-resistant melanoma cells such as MM96, we examined whether overexpression of STAT1 would improve the responsiveness of MM96 to the antiviral effects of IFN-β. The antiviral effects of IFN-β were examined in IFN-sensitive SK-MEL-28, IFN-resistant MM96 and STAT1 transfected MM96 cells (Fig.7 A). As expected, SK-MEL-28 is sensitive to treatment with IFN-β (CPE50 of 5 IU/ml), which failed to protect the parental MM96 cells from the viral mediated cytopathic effects (CPE50 of 1600 IU/ml). However, with the STAT1-transfected MM96 cells, the effect of IFN-β is significantly increased by approximately 10 times (CPE50 of 150 IU/ml). The expression of STAT1 in the MM96 transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 7 B) and found to be about 3 times higher than the level of STAT1 detected in the parental MM96 cells. Several studies using protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revealed the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in IFN signal transduction (43Gutch M.J. Daly C. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11411-11415Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that the responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to IFN correlated with the IFN-α2-induced changes in tyrosine phosphorylation (29Payne M.J. Ralph S.J. De Veer M.J. Allen K. Linnane A.W. Devenish R.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 283-288PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have further investigated the nature of the reduction in type I IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines. We have also extended our investigation to include a comparison of the relative levels of STAT1 expression found in primary human melanocytes and melanoma cells recently established from patient biopsies. Analysis of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK-1 and TYK-2 (Fig. 1), both of which are involved in the type I IFN-signaling pathway, revealed that there were no significant differences in their activation between the three melanoma cell lines tested following IFN-α2 stimulation. In addition, our results suggested that both TYK-2 and JAK-1 were constitutively expressed in all three cell lines. Thus, we conclude that the defect in IFN-resistant melanoma cells is neither at the level of the expression of the tyrosine kinases nor their activation. However, examination of the presence and activation of the components of the ISGF3 transcription factor, STAT1, STAT2, and p48-ISGF3γ revealed significant differences between IFN-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cell lines. In particular, a marked reduction in the levels of STAT1 was consistently observed in all of the IFN-resistant cell lines (Fig. 4 A) and in low passage cultures of melanomas recently established from cancer patient biopsies resistant to the antiproliferative effects of type I IFNs. Additionally, we also observed mild deficiencies in the levels of the other ISGF3 components, STAT2 and p48-ISGF3γ (Fig. 2) in the IFN-resistant cell lines. An analysis of the ISGF3 interaction with the ISG15 ISRE sequence by EMSA (Fig. 5) revealed significantly reduced levels of ISGF3 present in SK-MEL-3 and particularly in MM96 cells, the most IFN-resistant cell type. The observation that IFN-resistant cell lines such as MM96 contain lower levels of STAT1, STAT2 and p48-ISGF3γ (all three components that constitute ISGF3 activity) is consistent with the observed decrease in ISGF3 DNA binding activity and the lack of IFN responsiveness. Given the marked reduction in STAT1 protein levels in IFN-resistant cells, it follows that this form of transcription factor-DNA enhancer element interaction in the cells would be severely affected. Transfection of IFN-resistant MM96 cells, which have a marked deficiency of STAT1, with STAT1 cDNA resulted in cells having an increased responsiveness to IFN as judged by altered sensitivity to viral-mediated cytopathic effect (Fig. 7). Full restoration of IFN responsiveness equivalent to SK-MEL-28 may require further increasing levels of STAT1 or restoration of levels of STAT2 and p48-ISGF3γ. The molecular basis for the reduction in cellular levels of ISGF3 components in IFN-resistant cells remains to be determined. However, it is possible that it is caused either by the failure of the IFN-resistant cells to constitutively express ISGF3 components or a loss of normal regulation of their expression. IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction via activation of transcription at the ISRE is what ultimately dictates the cellular outcome in terms of IFN responses. Previous analysis of the IFN-induced expression of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), ds-RNA-induced protein kinase (PKR) and MX antigen showed no significant differences between IFN-resistant and -sensitive melanoma cell lines (30Ralph S.J. Wines B.D. Payne M.J. Grubb D. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2248-2256PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our observations with melanoma cell lines clearly demonstrate a determining role for ISGF3 in the establishment of cellular responses to type I IFNs, albeit that these responses must depend on ISG expression other than that of OAS, PKR and MX. Our results provide an explanation for the previous observations obtained using antiproliferative and antiviral biological assays, which revealed widely differing responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to IFN (25Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Callister K.A. Hertzog P.J. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Wines B.D. Choe C.C. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. Linnane A.W. Ralph S.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1111-1120PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the observed lack of ISGF3 in IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines helps to explain the reduced level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected in the IFN-resistant cells reported previously (30Ralph S.J. Wines B.D. Payne M.J. Grubb D. Hatzinisiriou I. Devenish R.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2248-2256PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to our observations in melanoma cells, a similar type of ISGF3 deficiency has been described in other cancer cell types (22Dron M. Tovey M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1993; 13: 377-383Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Petricoin III, E. David M. Fang H. Grimley P. Larner A.C. Vande Pol S. Mol. Cell.

These observations lead to the suggestion that ISGF3 deficiency may be a more general mechanism underlying the development of IFN resistance in a wide variety of cancers. Thus, a diagnostic assay based on determining deficiency in ISGF3 components may serve as a useful clinical marker of IFN resistance in melanomas and other cancers. Finally, our results may have wider implications with respect to the role of the IFNs in carcinogenesis given that many cancers are resistant to IFN therapy (13Estroz Z. Kurzrock R. Talpaz M. Interferons: Basic Principles and Clinical Applications. R. G. Landes Company, Texas1993: 53-76Google Scholar) and that IFNs have a role as a tumor suppressor (48Lengyel P. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.

P-selectin, expressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells, and E-selectin, expressed on activated endothelial cells, bind to ligands on myeloid cells and subsets of lymphocytes.

These mediators activate leukocyte integrins, which strengthen adhesion and direct transendothelial migration. Cell-cell contacts through selectins may themselves transduce signals that are integrated with those produced by lipids and chemoattractants. The combined signals may produce leukocyte responses that are not observed with either individual stimulus. For example, adhesion of neutrophils to P-selectin enhances β2-integrin activation and potentiates intracellular calcium transients in response to low concentrations of an agonist (23Lorant D.E.

Phosphorylation of intracellular proteins is an important proximal regulator of cellular responses to many extracellular stimuli (28Hunter T. Karin M.

Here we demonstrate that engagement of PSGL-1 on neutrophils rapidly enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins; it also activates the GTPase Ras and the MAP kinases, ERK-1 and/or ERK-2. These data suggest a mechanism for signaling through a specific mucin ligand for selectins on leukocytes.DISCUSSIONInteractions of PSGL-1 with P-selectin mediate the initial tethering of leukocytes to activated platelets or endothelial cells at sites of infection or tissue injury (20Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Fugang L. Johnson D.A. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 22Norman K.E.

These tethers lead to juxtacrine signaling of leukocytes by lipid autacoids and chemokines that are expressed by activated endothelial cells or platelets (23Lorant D.E. Patel K.D. McIntyre T.M.

Here we demonstrate that ligation of PSGL-1 on human neutrophils with mAbs or P-selectin increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation, activated the ERK family of MAP kinases, and induced secretion of IL-8. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocked IL-8 secretion, suggesting that PSGL-1-propagated tyrosine phosphorylation initiates biologically important responses in neutrophils. Engagement of PSGL-1 was sufficient to activate IL-8 secretion. To elicit other effector responses, PSGL-1-dependent signals may require integration with signals generated by other mediators.Tyrosine phosphorylation increased when neutrophils were incubated with anti-PSGL-1 mAbs that were presented as bivalent IgG but not when they were presented as monovalent Fab fragments. This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation requires clustering of PSGL-1, which itself is a dimer (5Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.L. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Adhesion of neutrophils to immobilized P-selectin rapidly induced the same profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, supporting the physiologic relevance of the response. Ligation of PSGL-1 also activated the MAP kinases ERK-1 and/or ERK-2. MAP kinases must be tyrosine-phosphorylated to be activated (41Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar); therefore, ERK-1 and ERK-2 represent a portion of the 44- and 42-kDa proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon ligation of PSGL-1.The pathway for PSGL-1-induced activation of the ERKs requires further characterization. ERK activation appears to be downstream of MEK, because the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked the ability of anti-PSGL-1 mAbs to activate the MAP kinases in neutrophils. Engagement of PSGL-1 activated the GTPase Ras. The mechanism for Ras activation is obscure, because ligation of PSGL-1 did not cause detectable phosphorylation of PSGL-1, activation of Shc, or association of PSGL-1 with the Grb2·Sos1 complex. Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain of PSGL-1 lacks canonical sequences for binding of the SH2 or SH3 domains found in many signaling proteins. GTP-bound Ras might bind to and activate Raf, leading to activation of MEK and ERKs. However, engagement of some integrins may bypass Ras to activate MEK and MAP kinases (44Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that cross-linking of PSGL-1 initiates a similar Ras-independent pathway to signal MEK and MAP kinases in neutrophils.The identities of the other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in neutrophils are unknown. Recently it was reported that adhesion of human T cells to P-selectin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK, but the role of PSGL-1 in this response was not examined (45Haller H. Kunzendorf U. Sacherer K. Lindschau C. Walz G. Distler A. Luft F.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1061-1067PubMed Google Scholar). Although pp125FAK was reportedly found in neutrophils (46Fuortes M. Jin W.-W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we have not detected this protein in Western blots of neutrophil lysates, 2K. I.-P. J. Hidari and R. P. McEver, unpublished observations. and pp125FAK has not been detected in human monocytes (47Lin T.H. Yurochko A. Kornberg L. Morris J. Walker J.J. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies also suggest that the 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated neutrophil protein(s) is not a related focal adhesion kinase (PYK2, CAKβ, or RAFTK) (48Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 49Lev S.

Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol.

Diaz S. Smith D.L. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, immunoblotting experiments did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation on PSGL-1 that was immunoprecipitated from lysates of PL2-activated neutrophils, and PSGL-1 was not detectably phosphorylated in lysates of32P-labeled neutrophils. The PSGL-1 cytoplasmic domain has two tyrosines, but they are not in a consensus sequence for tyrosine phosphorylation. There are also several serines and threonines that could be phosphorylated (7Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). It remains possible that PSGL-1 is phosphorylated under conditions that we did not examine.The pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation elicited by occupancy of PSGL-1 is similar to that induced when neutrophils are incubated with mAbs to L-selectin or with a sulfated carbohydrate ligand for L-selectin (39Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15403-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Simultaneous addition of saturating concentrations of anti-L-selectin and anti-PSGL-1 mAbs to neutrophils did not increase the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation elicited by either individual mAb.2 Although this implies that the two proteins signal through common pathways, the proximal steps may still differ. Partial occupancy of both molecules may transmit cooperative signals, as might occur when only part of the surface of a leukocyte is in contact with another cell. In this regard, interactions of L-selectin with PSGL-1 promote leukocyte-leukocyte contacts under shear conditions (16Guyer D.A. Moore K.L. Lynam E. Schammel C.M.G. Rogelj S. McEver R.P. Sklar L.A.

Bidirectional signaling through L-selectin and PSGL-1 may augment the effects of other mediators that stimulate integrin-dependent leukocyte aggregation and leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall.The mechanisms by which engagement of PSGL-1 or L-selectin initiates tyrosine phosphorylation in neutrophils are unknown. Both molecules are concentrated in the microvillous tips of leukocytes (20Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Fugang L. Johnson D.A. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. J.

Cell. 1991; 66: 921-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). PSGL-1 or L-selectin may interact with the cytoskeleton under some conditions (53Lorant D.E. McEver R.P.

But cytochalasins do not block induction of tyrosine phosphorylation through either protein, suggesting that an intact cytoskeleton is not required for this response (Ref. 39Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15403-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar and this study). Cytochalasins, in contrast, prevent the protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases that occur after cross-linking of integrins (35Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K.

Engagement of L-selectin on cultured T cell lines induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of L-selectin, binding of L-selectin to Grb2 and Sos, and the activation of Ras and MAP kinases; these responses require the presence of the T cell Src kinase p56lck (60Brenner B. Gulbins E. Schlottman K. Koppenhoefer U. Busch G.L. Walzog B. Steinhausen M. Coggeshall K.M. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15376-15381Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is not known whether engagement of L-selectin on neutrophils induces similar responses. Cross-linking of L-selectin activates β2 integrins in naive, but not memory, peripheral lymphocytes (61Hwang S.T. Singer M.S. Giblin P.A. Yednock T.A. Bacon K.B. Simon S.I. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that engagement of L-selectin or PSGL-1 need not use identical signaling mechanisms in different classes of leukocytes. We did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PSGL-1 or binding of PSGL-1 to Grb2 or Sos-1 in neutrophils that were incubated with anti-PSGL-1 mAbs.We found that engagement of PSGL-1 was sufficient to induce secretion of IL-8 from neutrophils. In most situations, however, interactions of PSGL-1 with P-selectin do not directly activate leukocyte effector responses, but they do enhance the abilities of other mediators to elicit such responses. Thus, adhesion of neutrophils to P-selectin does not directly induce intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, superoxide generation, granule secretion, or functional activation of β2 integrins. However, adhesion augments these responses upon exposure to platelet-activating factor, a potent lipid mediator that is co-expressed with P-selectin on activated endothelial cells (23Lorant D.E.

McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Activated platelets may use P-selectin plus other mediators to cooperatively induce superoxide generation and integrin up-regulation in adherent neutrophils (62Ruf A. Schlenk R.F. Maras A.

Blood. 1996; 88: 4183-4194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under shear stress, neutrophils rolling on P-selectin rapidly modify the velocity of β2 integrin-dependent migration in response to fMet-Leu-Phe or platelet-activating factor (67Rainger G.E. Buckley C. Simmons D.L. Nash G.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 316-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Adhesion of monocytes to P-selectin does not elicit cytokine synthesis and secretion, but it potentiates the ability of platelet-activating factor to mobilize the transcription factor NF-κB to the nucleus, which leads to secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (26Weyrich A.S. McIntyre T.M. McEver R.P. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Monocytes secrete monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and IL-8 after they adhere to activated platelets; this response requires both binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin and exposure to the chemokine RANTES that is secreted by the platelets (27Weyrich A.S. Elstad M.R. McEver R.P. McIntyre T.M. Moore K.L. Morrissey J.H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Adhesion to immobilized P-selectin primes monocytes for increased synthesis of platelet-activating factor in response to opsonized zymosan particles (68Elstad M.R. La Pine T.R. Cowley F.S. McEver R.P. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2109-2122PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes also express tissue factor when exposed to P-selectin in some assays (69Celi A. Pellegrini G. Lorenzet R. De Blasi A. Ready N. Furie B.C. Furie B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8767-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) but not in others (27Weyrich A.S. Elstad M.R. McEver R.P. McIntyre T.M. Moore K.L. Morrissey J.H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), suggesting that this response requires an additional mediator that stimulates adherent leukocytes. The cooperative stimulation of leukocytes by two or more signals ensures that the full complement of leukocyte responses is generated only where adhesion molecules, chemokines, and other activators are simultaneously expressed (43Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanisms that integrate signals transduced by adhesion molecules and other receptors in leukocytes are largely unknown. MAP kinases may be important participants because they are activated by different classes of conventional signal-transducing receptors (70van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) as well as by certain adhesion molecules (35Chen Q. Kinch M.S.

The kinetics of activation of ERK-1,2 upon engagement of PSGL-1 are sufficiently rapid to mediate signaling responses in leukocytes (23Lorant D.E. Patel K.D. McIntyre T.M. McEver R.P. Prescott S.M.

Biol. 1997; 7: 316-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 partially decreased IL-8 secretion from neutrophils. This suggests that PSGL-1 engagement initiates both MAP kinase-dependent and -independent pathways that activate synthesis of IL-8. MAP kinases may be required to activate other genes, and they are important regulators of cytoskeletal proteins (41Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar, 71Reszka A.A. Bulinski J.C. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation of other kinases and phosphorylation of their targets may also be important for signal integration. The use of cooperative signals implies that activation through a single pathway need not be robust.Interactions of PSGL-1 with P-selectin (and possibly E- and L-selectin) are sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activate MAP kinases in human neutrophils. This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation represents a critical proximal ste"
https://openalex.org/W1978040433,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a C-C chemokine thought to play a major role in recruiting monocytes to the atherosclerotic plaque. Tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation, is found in the atherosclerotic plaque, macrophages, and human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). The exposure of TF during plaque rupture likely induces acute thrombosis, leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. This report demonstrates that MCP-1 induces the accumulation of TF mRNA and protein in SMC and in THP-1 myelomonocytic leukemia cells. MCP-1 also induces TF activity on the surface of human SMC. The induction of TF by MCP-1 in SMC is inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting that the SMC MCP-1 receptor is coupled to a Gi-protein. Chelation of intracellular calcium and inhibition of protein kinase C block the induction of TF by MCP-1, suggesting that in SMC it is mediated by activation of phospholipase C. SMC bind MCP-1 with a K d similar to that previously reported for macrophages. However, mRNA encoding the macrophage MCP-1 receptors, CCR2A and B, is not present in SMC, indicating that they possess a distinct MCP-1 receptor. These data suggest that in addition to being a chemoattractant, MCP-1 may have a procoagulant function and raise the possibility of an autocrine pathway in which MCP-1, secreted by SMC and macrophages, induces TF activity in these same cells.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a member of the CC chemokine family, may play an important role in atherosclerosis (14Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Sarkioja T. Yoshimura T.

Res. 1995; 76: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts (19Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and is one of the most abundant proteins secreted by SMC in response to growth agonists (20Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Like TF, MCP-1 is found in the atherosclerotic plaque (14Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Sarkioja T. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5252-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) and is rapidly induced in arterial SMC by balloon injury (21Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that human SMC bind MCP-1 specifically and appear to possess an MCP-1 receptor distinct from that previously identified in monocytes (22Charo F.I. Myers J.S. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly J.A. Coughlin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar,23Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCP-1 induces TF mRNA, protein, and activity in human aortic SMC. Thus, MCP-1 may have an autocrine function to enhance thrombosis in the injured arterial wall and in the atherosclerotic plaque. Recombinant human MCP-1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Actinomycin D and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was obtained from Calbiochem. Immunohistochemical grade 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was purchased from Biogenex (San Ramon, CA). Collagenase type II was purchased from Worthington. Chromogenic substrate for activated factor X, Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroaniline was synthesized in our laboratory. SMC were isolated from human thoracic aortas. The adventitia and connective tissue were removed; the remaining arterial intima and media were cut into 1-cm2 segments and placed in culture dishes with 2.5 mg/ml collagenase and 15% FCS. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were identified as smooth muscle by their typical appearance on light microscopy and by immunostaining with antibody to human smooth muscle α-actin (0.1 μg/ml) (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). The lack of EC contamination of SMC was established by the absence of staining with antibody (0.03 μg/ml) to von Willebrand factor (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Prior to treatment, SMC (passages 3–10) were made “quiescent” by incubation in a defined medium (DM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with BSA (25 μg/ml), ascorbate (200 μm), insulin (1 μm), and transferrin (5 μg/ml). Under these conditions, incorporation of [3H]thymidine was <10% that seen with 10% FCS. THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in 25 mm HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary human umbilical vein EC were harvested from umbilical veins treated with 1% collagenase as described (16Rollins B.J. Yoshimura T. Leonard E.J. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1229-1233PubMed Google Scholar). Human EC (passages 2–5) were determined to be free from SMC contamination by the absence of staining for human smooth muscle α-actin. EC were grown on 0.5% gelatin-coated single-well chamber slides in medium M-199 containing 20% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, ascorbate (200 μm), glutamine (2 mm), HEPES (15 mm), and endothelial cell growth factor (60 μg/ml). For induction of TF antigen in EC, MCP-1 or vehicle alone were added in 0.5% FCS. Extraction of total RNA, agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose, and hybridization to 32P-labeled DNA were as described previously (21Taubman M.B. Rollins B.J. Poon M. Marmur J. Green R.S. Berk B.C. Nadal-Ginard B. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 314-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 42 °C. Final washes for all blots were in 0.1 × SSC (1 × = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Hybridization was performed with a 1271-bp insert from human TF (nt 84–1354) (24Spicer E.K. Horton R. Bloem L. Bach R. Williams K.R. Guha A. Kraus J. Lin T.C. Nemerson Y. Konigsberg W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5148-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or with the full-length (∼2000 bp) human CCR2B receptor cDNA (22Charo F.I. Myers J.S. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly J.A. Coughlin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), labeled by random oligomer priming to a specific activity of greater than 108 cpm/mg, and used at 2 × 106 cpm/ml. Experiments shown in the figures represent blots in which all lanes had equal loading as confirmed by staining of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA with ethidium bromide and by hybridization with fibronectin cDNA. Immunopurified polyclonal anti-human TF antibody was raised in rabbits to the extracellular domain (residues 1–218) of TF (soluble TF, sTF) as described previously (5Thiruvikraman S.V. Guha A. Roboz J. Taubman M.B. Nemerson Y. Fallon J.T. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 451-461PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-sTF antibody was detected on slides using a biotin/streptavidin-amplified detection system (SuperSensitive Kit, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). Human SMC were incubated in single well Permanox or glass slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, Ill). Twenty-four hours after plating (≈70% confluent), cells were switched to DM for ∼18 h and then treated with agonists. Slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4), blocked with normal goat serum and 3% H2O2 in water, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-sTF antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, coverslipped, and examined. THP-1 cells were grown in suspension to a concentration of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml and then treated with agonists as indicated. After treatment, samples were centrifuged at 200 ×g and washed, and 100 μl were spread on glass slides, air dried, fixed, and stained with anti-sTF antibody as above. Positive controls for TF (human placenta) and negative controls using non-immune IgG or the absence of primary antibody were performed for each cell type. To measure factor Xa generation on the cell surface in response to MCP-1, human SMC (passages 5–10) were seeded on gelatin-coated 9.4-cm2 Permanox chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). Upon reaching confluence, cells were placed in DM for 24 h and then treated with agonists or vehicle alone in DM. Slides were mounted in a closed-circuit parallel-plate flow chamber and perfused continuously with 150 nm factor X and 1.0 nm factor VIIa in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 g/liter BSA, and 5 mmCaCl2 using a peristaltic pump at a 1.0 ml/min flow rate (corresponding to a wall shear rate of 97 s−1). Samples (40 μl) were taken from an in-circuit 1.5-ml Eppendorf reservoir every 3 min for 15 min and placed sequentially in a 96-well plate containing 100 μl/well of Bicine buffer, pH 8.5, 25 mmEDTA, and 1 g/liter BSA to stop the reaction. Factor Xa was assayed by adding 25 μl of Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroaniline-pNA (15 mm) to each well and measuring changes in absorption at 405 nm at 35 °C in a thermostated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Tmax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The concentration of factor Xa was calculated from the slope of the absorption over time. Femtomoles of TF/cm2 were obtained assuming a k cat of the TF-VIIa complex of 300 min−1 at 20 °C. This k cat was determined using TF in vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine and 80% phosphatidylcholine at 20 °C. As far as we are aware, thek cat is not sensitive to the lipid composition. To determine total cellular TF activity, SMC were grown to confluence in 12-well plates and placed in DM for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and duplicate 160-μl aliquots were lysed by incubation with 15 mm (final concentration) octyl-β-d-glycopyranoside (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Factors VIIa and X were then added sequentially to a final volume of 320 μl, and 40-μl aliquots were measured every min for 6 min as described above. Binding of MCP-1 to human SMC was performed as described (25Ernst C.A. Zhang Y.J. Hancock P.R. Rutledge B.J. Corless C.L. Rollins B.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 52: 3541-3549Google Scholar). SMC (passage 3–9) were incubated with a fixed amount of 125I-labeled MCP-1 (M*) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% BSA), and subsequently increasing concentrations of unlabeled MCP-1 (Mc) were added to displace the 125I-labeled MCP-1. Measurements were performed in duplicate on two different preparations of human aortic SMC. For each experiment, the non-displaceable M* was estimated by fitting the free M* versus Mc to Equation 1. M*=a·e−k·Mc+NSBEquation 1 where M* is the free 125I-labeled MCP-1,a and k are constants, and NSB is the nonspecific binding when cold MCP-1 is extrapolated to an infinite concentration. This number was used to calculate the specifically (i.e.reversibly) bound MCP-1 for each data point. The specifically bound MCP-1 was plotted versus free MCP-1; Equation 2 was then fit to the data as shown. B=Bmax·C/(Kd+C)Equation 2 where B is the specifically bound MCP-1;B max is the maximum number of ligands specifically bound as the concentration approaches infinity; C is the concentration of free MCP-1, and the K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant. A global fit of the data obtained from all four experiments yielded aK d of 1.04 ± 0.15 (S.E. of estimate) nm and the maximum sites of binding per cell of 60,000 ± 2,500 (S.E. of estimate). Nonspecific binding for all four experiments represented 49 ± 11% of the total binding. However, no significant differences in K d were found when duplicate experiments with ∼30% nonspecific binding were used in the calculations. RT-PCR for all segments of the CCR2 gene was done with the following cycling conditions: for RT, RNA was incubated with antisense oligonucleotide at 70 °C for 10 min and then quick-chilled, and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) were added with RT mix and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C and then 10 min at 70 °C. All subsequent PCR reactions were performed under the following cycling conditions: initial incubation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 50 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, 75 s at 72 °C, and a final incubation for 10 min at 70 °C. RT-PCR products were ligated into the TA3 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced commercially (Biotechnology Center, Utah State University). One set of primer pairs, corresponding to nt 37–54 (sense) and 227–243 (antisense) of CCR2A, is common to the 5′-coding region of both receptors (22Charo F.I. Myers J.S. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly J.A. Coughlin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For the second set, the antisense primer is unique to nt 1252–1274 of CCR2B. The sense primer (nt 363–380 of CCR2B) is common to both receptors. For the third set, the antisense primer is unique to nt 1246–1268 of CCR2A. The sense primer (nt 748–768 of CCR2A) is common to both. To investigate other CCR receptors, the following primers were synthesized: CCR1 (26Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) (sense, nt 1210–1229; antisense, nt 1404–1387), CCR3 (27Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16491-16494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (sense, nt 1102–1119; antisense, 1201–1182), CCR4 (28Hoogewerf A. Black D. Proudfoot A.E. Wells T.N. Power C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (sense, nt 1390–1408; antisense, 1553–1534), and DARC (29Tournamille C. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) (sense nt, 1985–2004; antisense 2243–2226). As a control for the quality of the human SMC RNA, RT-PCR was also performed with primers spanning nt 320 and 760 of the human TF cDNA (24Spicer E.K. Horton R. Bloem L. Bach R. Williams K.R. Guha A. Kraus J. Lin T.C. Nemerson Y. Konigsberg W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5148-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at least 3 times and values presented as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used in the analysis of paired and unpaired means. Unless indicated, all values were significant at p < 0.05. Quiescent human aortic SMC contained low levels of TF mRNA. Exposure of these SMC to MCP-1 resulted in the accumulation of TF mRNA, peaking at 4 h and returning to base line by 8 h (Fig.1 A). The levels of TF mRNA were comparable to those induced by serum. The accumulation of TF mRNA by MCP-1 was concentration-dependent and was seen with as little as 0.1 ng/ml MCP-1 (Fig. 1 B). Unstimulated THP-1 cells contained low levels of TF mRNA. Exposure of THP-1 cells to MCP-1 resulted in accumulation of TF mRNA levels comparable to the induction of TF seen with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fig.1 C). By immunohistochemical analysis, quiescent SMC contained minimal amounts of TF antigen (Fig.2 A). Exposure to as little as 0.01 ng/ml MCP-1 resulted in the accumulation of TF antigen around the nucleus at 4 h (Fig. 2 B). Significantly, accumulation of TF antigen was seen in virtually all cells, suggesting that the response to MCP-1 was uniform and not limited to a subpopulation of SMC or a small number of contaminating fibroblasts. Accumulation of perinuclear TF at 4 h was also seen when SMC maintained in 10% FCS were treated with MCP-1. Concomitant treatment with MCP-1 and the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D markedly diminished the perinuclear accumulation of TF antigen (Fig. 2 C). Addition of actinomycin D 1 h after MCP-1 treatment had no effect on the perinuclear accumulation of TF antigen. In further experiments, SMC were treated with MCP-1 and at varying times the medium was removed, the cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh serum-free medium added. TF antigen was examined 4 h after the initial exposure. Only 30 min of exposure to MCP-1 was required for the accumulation of TF antigen around the nucleus (not shown). MCP-1 also induced TF mRNA (Fig. 1 C) and antigen (Fig.2, D–F) in human THP-1 myelomonocytic leukemia cells to an extent similar to that of LPS (not shown) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), known activators of TF in these cells (30Donovan-Peluso M. George L.D. Hassett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1361-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the induction of TF by MCP-1 was due to contaminating LPS, SMC and THP-1 cells were treated with 20 mg/ml polymyxin B. Polymyxin, which inhibits many of the actions of LPS, failed to inhibit the induction of TF by MCP-1 (31DeMarco R. Ensor J.E. Hasday J.D. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 140: 304-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MCP-1 did not induce TF antigen in EC (Fig. 2, G–I). This suggests that the response to MCP-1 is cell type-restricted and further argues against contamination with LPS, a potent inducer of TF in EC (32Crossman D.C. Carr D.P. Tuddenham E.G. Pearson J.D. McVey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9782-9787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MCP-1 induced active TF on the cell surface, TF activity (factor Xa generation) was measured from SMC monolayers perfused with purified clotting factors in a parallel plate chamber. Four hours after treatment with MCP-1 (1 ng/ml), surface TF activity was 2.6 ± 0.8 × that seen with DM alone (p < 0.05;n = 6). This corresponds to ∼0.2 fmol/cm2of surface TF generated in response to MCP-1 and is similar to that seen with 10 ng/ml PDGF AB. 2Schecter, A. D., Giesen, P. L. A., Taby, O., Rosenfield, C. L., Rossikhina, M., Fyfe, B. S., Khotz, S., Fallon, J. T., Nemerson, Y., and Taubman, M. B. (1997) J. Clin. Invest.in press. MCP-1 also induced a 29 ± 9% increase in total cellular TF activity at 4 h. (n = 10). This was comparable to that found with treatment with 10 ng/ml PDGF AB (49 ± 19%;n = 6). Two MCP-1 receptors, generated by alternative splicing of a single gene, have been cloned from human monocytes (22Charo F.I. Myers J.S. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly J.A. Coughlin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 25Ernst C.A. Zhang Y.J. Hancock P.R. Rutledge B.J. Corless C.L. Rollins B.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 52: 3541-3549Google Scholar). The presence of functional MCP-1 receptors has been described solely on cells of myelomonocytic origin. The above results suggest that human arterial SMC also possess a functional MCP-1 receptor. Accordingly, specific binding of MCP-1 to human aortic SMC was examined (Fig. 3). The K d, which was derived from a specific binding curve, was approximately 1.0 nm, comparable to the affinity of MCP-1 for human macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes (33Myers J.S. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The number of binding sites per cell was approximately 60,000 which is greater than the number described for other cell types (23Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15918-15924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Myers J.S. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MCP-1 receptors (CCR2A and B) cloned from macrophages were expressed in human SMC, RNA blot analysis was performed using a 2.2-kb fragment of the human CCR2B cDNA that hybridizes to both alternatively spliced forms (Fig.4 A). SMC RNA (S) hybridized to a band of higher molecular weight than the CCR2 mRNA found in THP-1 cells (T); this higher molecular weight band hybridized only at very low stringency. No band was seen by RT-PCR of SMC RNA using primers derived from either the shared 5′ end of the CCR2A and B mRNAs or specific to the 3′ end of CCR2A (Fig. 4 B; lanes 1 and5, respectively). Primers specific to the 3′ end of CCR2B yielded a band of lower molecular weight than the expected product (lane 3). The sequence of this 600-bp band was not present in the GenBank and had no significant homology to CCR2 or other C-C chemokine or G-protein-coupled receptors. In addition, the 600-bp RT-PCR product hybridized predominantly to an ∼1.2-kb mRNA (not shown) and not to the ≈5-kb species detected in SMC in Fig.4 A. These data suggest that the 600-bp band is an artifact of RT-PCR and does not represent the SMC MCP-1 receptor. To investigate whether human aortic SMC possess the other known C-C chemokine receptors, RT-PCR was also performed with primers specific to CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and DARC. No signals were seen with any of these primers (not shown). CCR2A and -B belong to the family of seven transmembrane spanning, pertussis-sensitive heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors that mobilize intracellular calcium (Ca2+ i ) (34Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Treatment of quiescent SMC with pertussis toxin prior to MCP-1 exposure blocked the accumulation of TF mRNA (Fig. 5), suggesting that the SMC MCP-1 receptor is G-protein-coupled. Incubation of SMC in a calcium-free buffer containing EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium (Ca2+ e ) did not inhibit the accumulation of TF mRNA in response to MCP-1 or PDGF. In contrast, the addition of BAPTA/AM to chelate Ca2+ i completely blocked the accumulation of TF mRNA (Fig. 5) and protein (Fig.6 B), suggesting that Ca2+ i mobilization is involved in the induction of TF by MCP-1.Figure 6The role of calcium mobilization and PKC activation in the synthesis of TF antigen: immunohistochemical analysis. Quiescent SMC were treated for 4 h with MCP-1 (1 ng/ml) alone (A) or in the presence of 10 μmBAPTA/ AM (B) or 1.0 nm staurosporine (C).

Laminin α1 has been reported to localize to human fetal muscle and to be induced in muscular dystrophies based on immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody 4C7, suggested to recognize the human laminin α1 chain. Nevertheless, there seems to be no expression of laminin α1 protein or mRNA in developing or dystrophic mouse skeletal muscle fibers. To address the discrepancy between the results obtained in developing and dystrophic human and mouse muscle we expressed the E3 domain of human laminin α1 chain as a recombinant protein and made antibodies specific for human laminin α1 chain (anti-hLN-α1G4/G5). We also made antibodies to the human laminin α5 chain purified from placenta. In the present report we show that hLN-α1G4/G5 antibodies react with a 400-kDa laminin α1 chain and that 4C7 reacts with a 380-kDa laminin α5 chain. Immunohistochemistry with the hLN-α1G4/G5 antibody and 4C7 revealed that the two antibodies stained human kidney, developing and dystrophic muscle in distinct patterns. Our data indicate that the previously reported expression patterns in developing, adult, and dystrophic human muscle tissues with 4C7 should be re-interpreted as an expression of laminin α5 chain. Our data are also consistent with earlier work in mouse, indicating that laminin α1 is largely an epithelial laminin chain not present in developing or dystrophic muscle fibers.

Development (Camb.). 1990; 109: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hughes S.M. Blau H.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is thus important to understand the molecular composition of basement membranes in muscle. Laminin-2, with the chain composition α2, β1, γ1, is present in the muscle lineage from early stages of development in the mouse (9Schuler F. Sorokin L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Velling T. Collo G. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Zhang H.Y. Gullberg D. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and is apparently the major laminin isoform in adult muscle basement membranes (11Ehrig K. Leivo I. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The finding that genetic defects affecting laminin α2 can cause muscular dystrophy has highlighted the importance of laminin-2 for the structural integrity of muscle (12Allamand V. Sunada Y. Salih M. Straub V. Ozo C. Al-Turaiki M. Akbar M. Kolo T. Colognato H. Zhang X. Sorokin L. Yurchenco P. Tryggvason K. Campbell K. Hum. Mol.

Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Molecular compensation in certain forms of muscular dystrophies by increased expression of laminin chains may decrease the severity of the diseases. Some evidence for this has been obtained in immunohistochemistry studies with the antibody 4C7, which is one monoclonal antibody from a panel of antibodies raised against human placental laminins (14Engvall E. Davis G.E. Dickerson K. Ruoslahti E. Varon S. Manthorpe M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These antibodies were generated prior to the current knowledge about the existence of multiple laminin isoforms. The 4C7 antibody does not react with the laminin α2 chain but has been considered to react with the human α1 chain (14Engvall E. Davis G.E. Dickerson K. Ruoslahti E. Varon S. Manthorpe M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The antibody, commercially available under different names, has been widely used to detect human α1 chain (previously called A chain) both in muscle and non-muscle tissues (14Engvall E. Davis G.E.

The 4C7 antigen has been detected in basement membranes of normal muscle, and in blood vessels in muscle tissue (21Sewry C.A. Chevallay M. Tome F.M. Histochem. J. 1995; 27: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and increased expression of it in muscular dystrophies has been documented in numerous reports (22Sewry C.A. Philpot J. Mahony D.

Neurology. 1995; 45: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It thus seemed reasonable to suggest molecular compensation by α1 chain in muscular dystrophies (22Sewry C.A. Philpot J. Mahony D. Wilson L.A. Muntoni F. Dubowitz V. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1995; 5: 307-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Mundegar R.R. von Oertzen J. Zierz S.

Neurology. 1995; 45: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), particularly since many reports convincingly have shown that laminin-1 (α1, β1, γ1) can stimulate proliferation, motility, and development of muscle cells in vitro (1von der Mark K. Öcalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Echtermeyer F. Schober S. Pöschl H. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we and others have failed to detect laminin α1 chain in developing mouse muscle tissue (9Schuler F. Sorokin L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tiger C.-F. Gullberg D. Muscle & Nerve. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and no increased expression of this chain was seen in dystrophic mouse muscle (28Tiger C.-F. Gullberg D. Muscle & Nerve. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparing the staining pattern in non-muscle tissue of 4C7 in human, rat, and hamster with the pattern seen in mouse and rat with other antibodies, there is a discrepancy. In non-neural tissues of mouse and rat the α1 chain is largely confined to epithelial basement membranes (27Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P.

Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the 4C7 antigen is widely distributed in developing and adult human, rat, and hamster tissues (15Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19Virtanen I. Laitinen L. Korhonen M. J. Histochem.

The staining pattern of 4C7 in human tissues is also in disagreement with the distribution of the α1 mRNA in human tissues (31Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Saino K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Sariola H. Engvall E. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Nissinen M. Vuolteenaho R. Boot-Handford R. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Antibody 4C7 might thus detect some other α laminin chain, but this proposal is speculative (33Ekblom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and has not been rigorously tested. Currently, five different laminin α chains have been described (35Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and 4C7 could potentially detect any of these or might detect several α chains. In a cell line, 4C7 immunoprecipitated a large chain in the 400-kDa range together with 200-kDa chains, but the nature of the 400-kDa chain was not studied (15Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To clarify the discrepancies in laminin α1 distribution in mouse and human tissues, we made antibodies to the recombinant E3 domain of human laminin α1 and compared the specificity of these antibodies with that of 4C7. Immunoprecipitation of laminins from cell lines producing varying amounts of either α1 or α5 mRNA allowed a precise distinction of antibody specificity. Furthermore, we compared the distribution of laminin α1 chain and the 4C7 antigen in developing human muscle and in dystrophic human muscle tissue. Since the distribution of the laminin α1 chain in mouse kidney has been well described, we also analyzed the expression patterns in human kidney. A 1180-base pair-long fragment from the 3′-end of human laminin α1 chain (nucleotide residues 8140–9320) corresponding to the E3 region (carboxyl-terminal globular domain G4-G5) was amplified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. from a 4.5-kb laminin α1 cDNA sequence ((36), clone number 7 supplied by E. Engvall The Burnham Institute, La Jolla Cancer Research Center) using AmpliTaq® (Perkin-Elmer). The primers were modified to include restriction sites for NotI and NheI to facilitate cloning into the expression vector. Primer sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5′ GCC CCG CTA GCT CCC GAT GCA GAG GAC AGC A 3′; reverse primer, TCA GTT GCG GCC GCT CAG GAC TCG GTC CCA GG. The obtained PCR product was ligated into a TA-vector (PCR II™, Invitrogen) for sequence confirmation. Sequencing was performed with a Pharmacia T7 Sequencing™ kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The sequenced PCR product was cleaved with NotI/NheI and inserted into the episomal pCEP-Pu vector (which is a modified pCEP4 (Invitrogen) vector, provided by E. Pöschl Institute of Experimental Medicine, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany). The insertions sites were sequenced prior to transfection. 106 human embryonic kidney cells 293 EBNA (Invitrogen, Catalog number R-620-07) were stably transfected with 15 μg of hLN-α1G4/G5 in pCEP-Pu using lipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according the instructions from the manufacturer. Transfected cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin and 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the medium from cells grown under serum-free conditions was analyzed for recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE. Purified protein was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, excised, and digested “in-gel” with trypsin according to Ref. 37Rosenfeld J.

For the generation of antibodies to human laminin α1, medium was collected from confluent 293 EBNA hLN-α1G4/G5 cells under serum-free conditions and supplemented with 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Collected medium was diluted 1:2 in water, passed over a 10-ml DEAE-Sepharose® Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column, serially connected to a 5-ml Hi trap Heparin-Sepharose® column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The DEAE column was disconnected, and the heparin column was washed in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, prior to eluting in 0.3 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Peak fractions containing recombinant protein were concentrated on a second 1-ml Hi trap Heparin-Sepharose column, and the resulting peak fraction was used for immunizations of two rabbits, using 50-μg injections intramuscularly at intervals of 3 weeks. For immunohistochemistry, the antibodies were affinity-purified on the recombinant protein as described in Ref. 39Rose O. Rohwedel J. Reinhardt S. Bachmann M. Cramer M. Rotter M. Wobus A.

The polyclonal antibody to human laminin α5 was generated as follows: an extract from human placenta was purified by affinity chromatography on a laminin β1 chain antibody (Ab 545) as described in Ref. 40Champliaud M.

A major 380-kDa purified protein band on SDS-PAGE was cleaved with trypsin and microsequencing of resulting peptides revealed laminin α5 sequences (see “Results”). The original 380-kDa SDS-PAGE band was used to generate the rabbit polyclonal antibodies to laminin α5 chain. The monoclonal antibody recognizing laminin β1/γ1 chains (clone 4C12.8) was obtained from Immunotech. The polyclonal antibody to intact mouse laminin-1 was from Sigma (L9393). The 4C7 antibody (sold under the name mAb 1924) was from Chemicon. To visualize the proximal tubules a polyclonal antibody specific for a brush border antigen of proximal tubules was used (41Ekblom P. Miettinen A. Saxén L. Dev. Biol. 1980; 74: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). JAR cells (human choriocarcinoma cells ATCC No HTB-144), RD (rhabdomyosarcoma ATCC No CCL-136), WWCS-1 (Wilm's tumor cell line (42Talts J.F. Aufderheide E. Sorokin L. Ocklind G. Mattson R. Ekblom P.

Cells were labeled overnight in in the presence of 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (pro-Mix 35S cell labeling mix (Amersham Corp.)). Medium was collected from cells, centrifuged, and supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide). The centrifuged medium was processed for immunoprecipitation as described (44Eng H. Herrenknecht K. Semb H. Starzinski-Powitz A. Ringertz N. Gullberg D. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, conditioned medium was collected from JAR cells. Medium was passed over a Ricinus communis agglutinin I-agarose column (Vector Laboratories), washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with 0.5 md(+)-galactose (Sigma). Eluted proteins were directly used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody, washed in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20, followed by peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) and developed using the ECL system (Amersham). Serial sections, 5–8-μm thick, of muscle biopsies of boys referred for diagnostic purpose and shown to lack dystrophin, of muscle samples of human fetuses with a gestation age of 22 weeks, and of biopsies of human kidneys were cut in a Reichert Jung cryostat at −25 °C. The sections were collected on individual slides as well as on the same slide (one sample of human muscular dystrophy, one of human fetal muscle, and one of human kidney) to allow a direct comparison of staining intensity in the three different types of samples. The staining procedure was carried out as described in Ref. 28Tiger C.-F. Gullberg D. Muscle & Nerve. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy midi kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blotting was performed as described (28Tiger C.-F. Gullberg D. Muscle & Nerve. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For laminin α1, the 1180-base pair-long fragment used for recombinant laminin expression was used as a probe. For laminin α5 a reverse transcription PCR amplified mouse cDNA (nucleotides 290–891) was obtained from newborn mouse kidney total RNA and used as a probe as described (30Durbeej M. Fecker L.

In addition a 1.3-kb human EST clone (accession W67855) was obtained from the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (I.M.A.G.E.) consortium (I.M.A.G.E. consortium Clone ID:342926, United Kingdom Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and was sequenced from the vector T7 site and in a span of 360 nucleotides found to show 73% identity to mouse laminin α5 chain (nucleotides 9874–10233) (45Miner J.H.

The opposite end of the EST clone was found to be identical to the untranslated end of the partial human laminin α5 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 2891–3125) (46Durkin M.E. Loechel F. Mattei M.-G. Gilpin B.J. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 1.3-kb fragment was excised with NotI/EcoRI and used as a probe. To obtain reagents specific for human laminin α1 for immunohistochemistry on human tissues, we stably expressed cDNA coding for the E3 region (carboxyl-terminal globular domains G4-G5) of laminin α1 episomally in 293 EBNA cells. Recombinant protein (hLN-α1G4/G5) displayed an estimated molecular mass of 45 kDa under nonreducing conditions, shifted mobility to 55 kDa upon reduction, and bound heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 1). Following purification on DEAE- and heparin-Sepharose the hLN-α1G4/G5 (Fig. 1) was used as an immunogen to generate polyclonal antibodies. These antibodies are further characterized below. We also generated an antibody to human laminin α5 chain. The polyclonal rabbit antibody, anti-hLNα5, was raised to a 380-kDa SDS-PAGE band purified from human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography on anti-laminin β1 IgG (data not shown). Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides obtained from the 380-kDa band revealed two peptides, which were identified in the deduced amino acid sequence from a recently identified partial human laminin α5 cDNA sequence (46Durkin M.E.

As a comparison we also probed for laminin α5 mRNA. Laminin α1 mRNA was only detected in JAR cells, whereas laminin α5 mRNA was detected at moderate levels in JAR cells and RD cells and and at lower levels in WCCS-1 cells (Fig.2 A). The size of laminin α1 mRNA was estimated to approximately 10 kb, and the laminin α5 mRNA, as detected by both laminin α5 probes, was distinctly larger. The size was in agreement with the previously reported size of 11–12 kb in mouse (45Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When laminins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to laminin β/γ chains, two α chain bands with molecular masses of 400 and 380 kDa were observed on SDS-PAGE from JAR cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the hLN-α1G4/G5 antibodies only precipitated a complex containing 400- and 200–220-kDa bands. The monoclonal antibody 4C7 has been suggested to recognize laminin α1 chain. However, when medium from metabolically labeled JAR cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-hLN-α1G4/G5 and 4C7 in parallel, different laminin α chain bands were obtained. Whereas anti-hLN-α1G4/G5 precipitated the 400-kDa band, 4C7 precipitated a 380-kDa band (Fig. 2 B). In mouse the laminin α5 chain has been reported to have an molecular mass of 380 kDa (47Sorokin L. Frieser M. Pausch F. Kröger S. Ohage E. Deutzmann R. Dev. Biol. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). From JAR cells anti-hLNα5 precipitated a 380-kDa band (Fig. 2 B). From RD cells lacking reactivity with anti-hLN-α1G4/G5, antibodies to laminin β/γ chains and anti-hLNα5 still precipitated a laminin with a molecular mass of the α chain of 380 kDa. A 380 kDa α chain band was also precipitated from RD and G6 cells with 4C7 (data not shown). WWCS-1 cells, shown in Northern to lack laminin α1 mRNA and to express low levels of laminin α5 mRNA, only precipitated visible β/γ chain complexes in immunoprecipitation under the conditions used. Western blotting of JAR cell medium and proteins immunoprecipitated from this medium with antibodies to laminin β/γ chains, and subsequently blotted with antibodies to hLN-α1G4/G5 (Fig. 2 C, lane a), revealed strong reactivity with the 400-kDa band. Anti-hLNα5 reacted weakly with a 380-kDa band in the material precipitated by laminin β/γ chains (lane b). As shown inC the material immunoprecipitated from JAR cells with the 4C7 antibody did not react with hLN-α1G4/G5 antibodies (lane c), whereas Western blotting with anti-hLNα5 resulted in reactivity with the 380-kDa band (lane d). We also performed silver staining to independently illustrate the size difference between the laminin α chains precipitated by the two antibodies. Silver staining of proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-hLN-α1G4/G5 revealed a distinct 400-kDa band together with 200–220-kDa bands (lane e), whereas silver staining of 4C7 reactive material revealed the 380-kDa band in addition to 200–220-kDa bands (lane g). The 200–220-kDa bands were recognized in Western blotting by a polyclonal antibody to mouse laminin α1β1γ1 chains (data not shown). When human adult kidney was stained with affinity-purified antibodies to human laminin α1 (anti-hLN-α1G4/G5) and human laminin α5 (4C7), contrasting staining patterns were observed. Anti-hLN-α1G4/G5 selectively stained a subset of proximal tubuli, whereas 4C7 stained proximal and distal tubuli, glomerular basement membranes, and blood vessels (Fig.3, A–C). In agreement with previously reported data, 4C7 stained muscle fibers in addition to blood vessels in human fetal muscle (Fig.4 A). In biopsy material from a dystrophic DMD boy, 4C7 stained basement membranes of muscle fibers, blood vessels, and somewhat more intensely groups of small diameter regenerating muscle fibers (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the hLN-α1G4/G5 antibody did not specifically stain either developing or dystrophic muscle tissue (Fig. 4, C and D).Figure 4Detection of laminin α1 and laminin α5 in human skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence with 4C7 on cross-sections of human fetal muscle revealed the presence of laminin α5 in muscle fiber basement membranes and blood vessels (A), whereas a parallel section lacked detectable levels of human laminin α1 (C).

https://openalex.org/W2043685409,"The cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (FASII) is involved in synapse development and plasticity. Here we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that proper localization of FASII at type I glutamatergic synapses of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction is mediated by binding between the intracellular tSXV bearing C-terminal tail of FASII and the PDZ1-2 domains of Discs-Large (DLG). Moreover, mutations in fasII and/or dlg have similar effects on presynaptic ultrastructure, suggesting their functional involvement in a common developmental pathway. DLG can directly mediate a biochemical complex and a macroscopic cluster of FASII and Shaker K+ channels in heterologous cells. These results indicate a central role for DLG in the structural organization and downstream signaling mechanisms of cell adhesion molecules and ion channels at synapses."

Despite the lack of a transmembrane domain, the urokinase receptor (uPAR) is capable of transducing extracellular signals affecting growth, migration, and adhesion. Several Tyr kinases of the src family as well as β1, β2, and β3 integrins were found to be associated with the uPAR.

Upon clustering of uPA·uPAR complex by a monoclonal antibody, JAK1 associates with uPAR, which in turn leads to STAT1 phosphorylation, dimerization, specific binding to DNA, and gene activation. To prove the dependence of STAT1 activation on the uPAR, TCL-598 cells were treated with sense and antisense uPAR oligonucleotides. In antisense-treated cells in which uPAR expression was reduced to less then one third, activation of STAT1 by the clustering antibody was abolished while STAT1 activation by interferon-γ was unaffected.

These vesicles, termed “caveolae” (17Anderson R.G. Curr. Opin.

Based on this evidence, it was hypothesized that caveolae may serve as signaling organelles (24Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). We could show that clustering of uPA·uPAR by a monoclonal antibody directed against the protease domain of uPA stimulates migration and proliferation of the human epithelial kidney tumor cell line TCL-598 (25Ruthner M. Koshelnick Y.R. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 1132Google Scholar) and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins (19Ruthner M. Binder B.R. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 97Crossref Google Scholar). JAK1 kinase was found to be associated with the receptor upon receptor clustering (26Ruthner M. Koshelnick Y. Binder B.R. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 17Google Scholar). It was the aim of the present study to analyze whether, in addition to JAK1, other components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway are also associated with uPAR and whether this pathway is in fact activated by uPA·uPAR clustering. We found that two other components of the JAK/STAT pathway are associated with uPAR, namely the transmembrane protein gp130 and a STAT1 protein. All components of the JAK/STAT pathway together with uPAR are co-localized in Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fractions. Upon activation of uPAR by clustering, JAK1-kinase associates with the receptor, and the STAT1-protein is phosphorylated, dimerized, excluded from the cytosol, and binds to a specific DNA site. This activation of STAT1 was clearly dependent on uPAR, as cells treated with uPAR antisense oligonucleotide show no detectable STAT1, activation upon uPAR clustering while STAT1 activation via IFN-γ was intact.

The human kidney epithelial tumor cell line TCL-598 has been characterized previously (27Geiger M. Priglinger U. Griffin J.H. Binder B.R. J. Biol.

Cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% supplemented calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 0.25 units/ml fungizone and passaged using trypsin-EDTA solution. Confluent TCL-598 cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with monoclonal antibodies directed against either the protease domain of uPA (scuPA8), which induces clustering of uPA·uPAR complex, or against the EGF homology domain of uPA (scuPA35) as a control. TCL-598 were grown to approximately 70% confluency and treated with 3 μm uPAR antisense oligonucleotide or uPAR-sense oligonucleotide (as a control) for 24 h in serum-free medium. Triton-insoluble complexes were obtained as described (29Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar); briefly, confluent cells (1.5 × 108) were incubated for 24 h in serum-free RPMI 1640, washed with serum-free medium, and afterward incubated for 20 min at 37 °C either with 1.5 μg/ml scuPA8 or 1.5 μg/ml scuPA35. Controls were run without antibodies. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold MBS buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl), containing 50 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4 and lysed in MBS buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates of the cells were subjected to centrifugation for 20 h at 100,000 × g on a sucrose density gradient ranging from 40 to 5% sucrose, the starting material being made 40% in sucrose. Fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and analyzed by dot blotting for the presence of caveolin with appropriate antibodies. The fractions enriched with caveolin (15–20% sucrose) were combined and further analyzed for presence of uPAR, clustering antibody, Tyr(P), JAK1, and STAT1 using appropriate polyclonal antibodies by Western blotting. Proteins associated with uPAR were analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-uPAR antibody followed by Western blotting. Cells (5 × 106) were incubated for 10 min with scuPA8 or scuPA35 (control), washed in ice-cold PBS, and lyzed for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8,0) containing 138 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 11,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted 4 times in the same buffer and used for overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with 3 μg of antibodies. Samples were incubated for an additional 2 h with 50 μl of slurry protein A-Sepharose, briefly centrifuged at 11,000 × g, washed 3 times in ice-cold lysis buffer, and boiled 5 min with 50 μl of reducing Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and detected with the appropriate antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL. Phosphorylation of STAT1 upon uPAR stimulation was analyzed by anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) Western blotting of anti-STAT1 immunoprecipitates obtained from cells, stimulated with scuPA8 or scuPA35. For analysis of STAT1, dimerization cells were stimulated for 20 min with scuPA8 or scuPA35, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lyzed. Cell lysates were then incubated for 20 min with 1 mm DSS, blocked with 0.5 mm NH4OH, and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-STAT1 antibodies. Cytosol fractions of TCL-598 cells were obtained in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 by three freezing-thawing cycles of cells in liquid nitrogen and centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 60 min. TCL-598 were conditioned in serum-free medium with or without addition of 3 μmuPAR-sense oligonucleotide or uPAR-antisense oligonucleotide for 24 h and stimulated with scuPA8 (1.5 μg/ml) or IFN-γ (200 units/ml) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested with a cell scraper, and collected by centrifugation (5 min at 1500 rpm). Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, left on ice for 20 min, and homogenized with 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 13,000 rpm), resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and after addition of 1/9 volume of 4 m(NH4)SO2 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, extracted for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4 and stored at −70 °C. The oligonucleotide probe was labeled by incubation of 2.5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide with overhanging ends with 5 units of Klenow enzyme, 0.5 mm dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP each, and 20 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated in buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT in a final volume of 20 μl with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 106 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature. Control assays for unspecific binding were performed by addition of 2 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe; supershift assays for detection of STAT1 or STAT3 binding were performed by addition of a rabbit antibody to STAT1 or STAT3 at a final dilution of 1:200. The oligonucleotide probe used for all assays was thesis-inducible element of the human c-fos promoter mutated in a way to allow equal recognition of STAT1 and STAT3. After DNA·protein complex formation, samples were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 2 h; the running buffer was 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA. The gels were dried onto Whatman No. 3MM paper and autoradiographed overnight at −70 °C. Sucrose density fractions of TCL-598 lysates were firstly analyzed for caveolin using dot blot technique. Caveolin-enriched low density fractions of a sucrose gradient (15–20% of sucrose) were collected and further analyzed by Western blotting. Using a set of specific antibodies, we could find that uPAR, caveolin, JAK1, and STAT1 are co-localized within the detergent-insoluble low density fractions of a sucrose gradient. After treatment of cells with scuPA8, the amount of uPAR, clustering antibodies (IgG), and JAK1 in these fractions was increased while the amount of STAT1 found in the respectively treated cells was lower (Fig.1). Specific Tyr phosphorylation of 75–90 kDa and 130 kDa proteins was increased upon uPA·uPAR clustering. Levels of caveolin (Fig. 1) were not significantly changed after uPA·uPAR clustering. Treatment of the cells with the other anti-uPA antibody (scuPA35), which interferes with binding of uPA to uPAR and does neither induce receptor clustering nor activation of the cells, did not significantly alter protein distribution in these high molecular weight complexes. In all cases, Western blot analysis revealed the expected molecular weights of the proteins analyzed; the two protein bands reacting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody upon uPAR clustering corresponded in their mobility seen in the Western blot to JAK1 protein (high molecular weight band) on the one hand and to one of the two bands of STAT1 (lower molecular weight band) on the other hand. As several components of the JAK/STAT pathway were found co-localized in detergent-insoluble fractions, an association of these components with uPAR was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody against uPAR. Precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-JAK1, anti-STAT1, and anti-gp130 antibodies (Fig.2). While JAK1-kinase was associated with uPAR predominantly after receptor clustering with scuPA8 (Fig.2 A), the STAT1 protein was found in the immunoprecipitates also without activation of the cells by scuPA8, and its amount was decreased after receptor clustering (Fig. 2 B). In addition, gp130, the transmembrane adapter linking the receptors of the interleukin-6 family to the JAK1/STAT1 pathway, was found to be associated with uPAR in the resting cells and to be increased after receptor clustering (Fig. 2 C). Incubation of cells with the non-clustering scuPA35 antibody did not induce changes in proteins co-precipitated with uPAR. These data are consistent with the relative changes in the respective proteins seen in the sucrose density gradient fractions and indicate that the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway is not only co-localized with uPAR in caveolae but is in fact associated with this receptor. As we have found that the level of STAT1 protein in the caveolin-containing low density fractions as well as in the co-precipitates was decreased upon stimulation with scuPA8 (Figs. 1 and 2 B) and was not affected by scuPA35, we tried to analyze a possible activation of the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway by uPA·uPAR clustering. As revealed by immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT1 antibodies and detection with anti-Tyr(P)-antibodies, phosphorylation of the STAT1-protein was induced in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). To prove whether STAT1 phosphorylation actually led to dimerization, we analyzed STAT1-protein interactions using the bifunctional chemical cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). We could show that 5 min after uPA·uPAR clustering, STAT1 appeared in cell lysates also in a high molecular weight complex (greater than 300 kDa); after 20 min; it was detected to about 50% in a form corresponding to a STAT1 dimer (Fig.3 B). Fig. 3 C shows changes of STAT1 amount in the cytosolic fraction of TCL-598. One h after stimulation with scuPA8, levels of STAT1 in the cytoplasm were significantly decreased. STAT1 activation was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay utilizing the mutated sis-inducible element of the human c-fos promoter as an oligonucleotide probe. This probe allows equal recognition of STAT1 and STAT3. As can be seen in Fig.4, the clustering antibody induced an increase in the intensity of the shifted bands already seen in the controls (left lanes); a STAT1-specific antibody induced a supershift (right lanes) while an anti-STAT3 antibody did not (data not shown). In the presence of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, the shifted bands were quenched (middle lanes). Treatment of the cells with IFN-γ induced specific activation of STAT1 as revealed by shift and supershift assays. However, the position of bands was different in IFN-γ-treated cells as compared with cells treated with scuPA8. Since some shift was already seen in control cells, we wanted to analyze the specificity of STAT1 activation via clustering of the urokinase receptor by using cells treated with uPAR antisense oligonucleotide. In these cells, the amount of uPAR expressed was reduced to less then 1/3 (data not shown), and in fact, neither in the controls nor in cells treated with clustering antibody were any specific bands seen (Fig. 4 B). IFN-γ, however, induced the same band shift as in untreated cells. Utilizing a sense oligonucleotide as a further control, a band shift pattern comparable with that in untreated cells was revealed both for the control as well as scuPA8 and IFN-γ-treated cells (Fig.4 C).Figure 4Activation of STAT1 protein upon uPAR activation with clustering antibody. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TCL-598 cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium (A) or in serum-free medium containing uPAR antisense oligonucleotide (B) or uPAR sense oligonucleotide (C) and stimulated with scuPA8 or IFN-γ for 20 min.Left lanes, labeled oligonucleotide probe; middle lanes, competitive inhibition with unlabeled oligonucleotide probe; right lanes, supershift with anti-STAT1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we can show that in the TCL-598 cell line components of the JAK/STAT pathway are associated with uPAR and participate in signal transduction.

While members of the IL-6 family such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, and IL-11, as well as the GPI-anchored ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), utilize gp130 as a common signal transducer. STAT1 activation by IFN-γ is mediated through a cytosolic tyrosine motif, Tyr-440, of the IFN-γ receptor (39Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Kurapkat G. Grotzinger J. Wollmer A. Zhong Z.

Growth factors, such as insulin, EGF, bFGF, and PDGF induce activation of STAT proteins independently of gp130 and, partially, independently of JAK. On the other hand, gp130 is not only associated with receptors for cytokines but was also found to form complexes with tyrosine kinases hck, fes, btk, and tec (40Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41Matsuda T. Fukada T. Takahashi Tezuka M. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Hanazono Y. Hirai H. Hirano T. J. Biol.

Witte O.N. Hirano T. Blood. 1995; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that JAK/STAT as well as gp130 participate in differently regulated signal transduction pathways. We found that, in the resting state, gp130 as well as STAT1 protein form a complex with uPAR, and JAK1 associates with uPAR after stimulation with the clustering antibody. This indicates that, in addition to pathways mentioned above, gp130/JAK1/STAT1 participate also in signal transduction via uPAR. In this context, it is of interest that thesrc family kinase hck, which associates with gp130, was also found to be associated with uPAR in a monocytic cell line THP-1 (9Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Upon clustering of uPAR by the scuPA8 antibody, JAK1 associates with the receptor, but STAT1 protein seems to dissociate. Dissociation of STAT1 from the receptor coincides with its phosphorylation and dimerization. In case of STAT1 activation via receptors of the IL-6 family, the initial step of signal transduction is homo or heterodimerization of receptors followed by activation and phosphorylation of multiple JAK family kinases and STAT proteins. In case of uPAR activation, clustering seems to substitute receptor dimerization leading to STAT1 activation. Upon phosphorylation, STAT1 is translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus and binds to a specific site on the DNA inducing gene activation. This is made evident by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide representing thesis-inducible element (SIE) present in the c-fosgene promoter (Fig. 4). The addition of an anti-STAT1 antibody induced a supershift of part of the oligonucleotides while an anti-STAT3 antibody did not. The position of the shifted band upon scuPA8 clustering was different as compared with IFN-γ used as a positive control; furthermore, in the case of IFN-γ, the supershift induced by anti-STAT1 antibody was almost complete. This indicates that in the case of uPAR, binding of STAT1 to the sis-inducible element might not occur via a homodimer but via a complex with other proteins. This shift was specific because it could be quenched by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. As can be seen from Fig. 4 A, some gel shift was present also in cells not exposed to scuPA8 as a clustering antibody. This indicates that activation of the STAT1 signaling might already occur in the untreated cells. Such activation could be mediated by pro-uPA secreted by the cells and might occur also in the absence of the clustering antibody. To address this question and to further prove that STAT1 activation induced by clustering antibody is specific for uPAR, we used cells treated with an anti-uPAR oligonucleotide. Cells made deficient in uPAR (panel B) failed to show any bandshift regardless of whether cells were treated with scuPA8 or not, whereas the bandshift induced with the IFN-γ could still be seen. In the sense control (panel C), scuPA8 induced a bandshift and antibodies against STAT1 induced a respective supershift, indicating that the effect seen in the cells treated with uPAR antisense oligonucleotide was specific for quenching the uPAR. It is of interest that the proliferation rate of TCL-598 treated with antisense uPAR oligonucleotide was significantly decreased (data not shown). In the TCL-598 cell line, all components of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway including uPAR are localized in detergent-insoluble caveolin-containing complexes. All changes in associated proteins seen upon immunoprecipitation are also reflected by the relative content of the respective proteins in these fractions; upon receptor clustering, the amount of JAK1 is increased while STAT1 decreases. Therefore, activation of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway seems to take place in conjunction with caveolae. In fact, localization of uPAR in caveolae was already reported by us and others (19Ruthner M. Binder B.R. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 97Crossref Google Scholar, 43Stahl A. Mueller B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and other potential activators of JAK1/STAT1, such as insulin, EGF, bFGF, and PDGF were also found to be localized in caveolae (21Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Mineo C. James G.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that caveolae participate in signal transduction. However, this is the first evidence that components of JAK1/STAT1 pathway can be co-localized in caveolae together with the uPAR. The data presented in this report indicate for the first time that components of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway are associated with uPAR, localized in caveolin-containing detergent-insoluble fractions, and participate in the signal transduction processes mediated by uPA·uPAR clustering in the TCL-598 cell line. Apparently, uPA·uPAR/antibody complexes form clusters that are taken up into caveolae. Such clustering of uPAR should also lead to clustering of the associated gp130 and association of JAK1-kinase with these complexes. JAK1-kinase would then be activated in a fashion similar to that in the interleukin 6 pathway and in turn would activate STAT-proteins. It is likely that upon activation STAT1 is released from these high molecular weight caveolae fractions, phosphorylated, and dimerized; then STAT1 translocates to the nucleus and causes gene activation. The results obtained by the gel-shift assay in sense and antisense uPAR-treated cells further indicate that activation of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway in this cell line occurs also to some extent under resting conditions. This basal “autocrine” activation of the uPAR pathway might further be responsible for basal cell proliferation as already described by us several years ago for a human melanoma cell line (44Kirchheimer J.C. Wojta J. Christ G. Binder B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5424-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This hitherto not described association of uPA·uPAR with the JAK1/STAT1 signal transduction pathway, in addition to other signaling systems, points toward a general modifier role of uPA·uPAR in regulation of cell activity. uPA·uPAR might be linked to several intracellular signal transduction pathways depending on other receptors activated simultaneously rather than to a single specific pathway. The gp130 found in this cell line, as the likely linker between the GPI-linked uPAR outside the cell and the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway inside the cell, is not necessarily the general adapter molecule for uPAR signaling but might serve as the adapter for that specific pathway. Therefore, uPAR might not only utilize different signal transduction pathways but also different adapter molecules. Such diversity of signal transduction pathways was also found for integrins (10Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A.

Platelet-derived growth factor induces an elevation in cellular levels of sphingosine and S-1-P and activates sphingosine kinase in quiescent fibroblasts. These studies imply that S-1-P participates in the mitogenic action of this and other growth factors (6Rani C.S.S. Wang F. Fuior E. Berger A. Wu J. Sturgill T.W. Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sphingolipids have been demonstrated to be essential for cell viability, based on studies of long chain sphingoid base auxotrophs that are defective in serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme in the de novopathway of sphingolipid synthesis (7Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, at least some sphingolipid-mediated cell events are conserved between mammalian cells and S. cerevisiae (8Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ceramide inducesS. cerevisiae growth suppression and cell cycle arrest, and the mammalian counterpart of ceramide-activated protein phosphatase has been identified in S. cerevisiae (9Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a novel enzyme in S. cerevisiae as a dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (DHS-1-P) phosphatase by characterizing sphingosine resistance genes (YSRs). Our studies show that dihydrosphingosine is phosphorylated to DHS-1-P once it enters cells. Dephosphorylation of DHS-1-P regulates synthesis of sphingolipids and glycerolipids in response to exogenous sphingolipids. Yeast strains listed in TableI were maintained on YPD medium, synthetic minimal medium (SC), or SC medium without uracil (SC-ura) as described previously (10Gietz R.D. Woods R.A.

To determine minimum inhibitory concentrations of sphingosine to the JS16 strain, 20 μl of 3 × 107 exponential phase cells/ml was spotted on SC agar plates with serial dilutions of sphingosine. The lowest concentration with which cell growth was completely inhibited was designated as the minimum inhibitory concentration. To test sphingosine resistance, cells were streaked on suitable media containing 35 μmsphingosine and 0.005% Nonidet P-40.

The microsome-containing supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes, pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, resuspended in the extraction buffer, recentrifuged, and resuspended in the extraction buffer without EDTA. To purify the epitope-tagged protein from the microsomes, total membrane proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA). After removal of membrane debris, the agarose beads coupled with the anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 were added to the above protein solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were loaded onto the affinity column coupled with M2 antibody and washed with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl). The fusion proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine (pH 3.5). The eluants were neutralized immediately by adding 0.05 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Phosphatase activity was measured as described (19De Ceuster P. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly,d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, NBD-C6-ceramide 1-phosphate, or NBD-PA in methanol was dried down under N2 and resuspended in the assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml CLAP, and 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) to a final concentration of 20 μm and a specific activity of 1 μCi/mmol ford-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine. In 50 μl of reaction, 25 μl of microsomes (∼20–30 μg of protein), whole cell extract, or the affinity-purified protein (∼1 ng) were added to 25 μl of the above substrates to initiate the enzymatic reaction at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1) and 0.35 ml of water. Lipids were extracted and dried. The products were separated from substrates on TLC plates, which were developed in a solvent system (chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2)). Radioactivity of [3H]dihydrosphingosine as well as fluorescent intensity of NBD-C6-ceramide and NBD-DAG on TLC plates were quantitated using PhosphorImager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics). The dephosphorylation by enzymes was calculated based on formation ofd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, NBD-C6-ceramide, or NBD-DAG. Higher concentrations of protein (>0.1 μg/μl) were determined by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214159) Google Scholar) using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad whereas lower concentrations were determined by silver staining (using a silver staining kit, Bio-Rad) of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with bovine serum albumin as standard. In an ongoing effort aimed at identifying genes that impart resistance to sphingolipids in the yeast S. cerevisiae, we have identified several genes that impart resistance to sphingosine. One of these genes, designated YSR2 (yeast sphingolipid resistance), has an ORF indicated as YJL134w in the Saccharomycesgenomic data base. It encodes a protein with 409 amino acids and is predicted to be a membrane protein with several transmembrane domains. Upon sequence determination, a homologous sequence was found inSaccharomyces genomic data base (the ORF isYKR053c) with 53% identity at the protein level. This gene encodes a protein with 404 amino acids and is here designated as theYSR2–1. Both ORFs were subcloned into theSaccharomyces expression vector pYES2 to form expression constructs, pYSR2 and pYSR2–1, respectively. pYSR2 and pYSR2–1 imparted resistance to sphingosine when overexpressed into the S. cerevisiae mutant strain (JS16) deficient in sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This latter mutant has been demonstrated by Saba et al. (21Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (26070): 26087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) to be hypersensitive to sphingosine, such that a concentration of 25 μm sphingosine was completely inhibitory to growth. This is probably due to the accumulation of S-1-P (21Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (26070): 26087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Overexpression of both YSR2 and YSR2–1 in JS16 driven by the Gal1 promoter conferred sphingosine resistance up to 35 μm (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the products of the YSR2 andYSR2–1 genes function either in sphingolipid metabolism or in regulating responses of yeast to sphingoid bases. During our analysis of these genes, Stukey and Carman (22Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) identified a novel phosphatase motif among several lipid phosphatases and hypothetical proteins. Both YSR2 and YSR2–1 proteins encoded by YJL134wand YKR053c were identified to have these phosphatase motifs. We therefore investigated whether these proteins may be DHS-1-P phosphatases. To examine the effects of these proteins on metabolism of sphingoid bases, JS16 cells overexpressing the proteins were labeled withd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These cells accumulate DHS-1-P due to the absence of the catabolic enzyme DHS-1-P/S-1-P lyase. Overexpression of either YSR2 orYSR2–1 in this strain prevented accumulation of DHS-1-P (Fig. 2 A). This failure to accumulate DHS-1-P is consistent with the function of these gene products as DHS-1-P phosphatase or as regulators of enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism. Moreover, JS16 cells become resistant to sphingosine, probably due to elimination of S-1-P accumulation by overexpression of these two proteins. To further investigate the role of these genes in sphingolipid metabolism, the ysr2Δ mutant and ysr2–1Δ mutant were established as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Twelve asci from the diploid strain bearingysr2Δ allele or ysr2–1Δ were dissected; four ascospores from each of 12 asci were viable. According to this tetrad analysis, both mutants were viable. To investigate if theysr2Δ mutant and the ysr2–1Δ mutant accumulate DHS-1-P, cells were labeled withd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, and total lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC resolution. We found that the ysr2Δ mutant accumulated DHS-1-P at the earlier time points, unlike the wild type strains (Fig. 2 B) but similar to the JS16 strain (Fig. 2 A). At later time points (more than 2 h), the ysr2Δ mutant strain had the same DHS-1-P level as the wild type strain, but more glycerolipids (PI, PE, and PC) were labeled in the mutant than in the wild type (Fig.2 C). Thus, excess accumulated DHS-1-P may be converted to glycerolipids, probably through the DHS-1-P/S-1-P lyase pathway. Theysr2–1Δ mutant also accumulated DHS-1-P at the early time points (less than 15 min) compared with the wild type JK9–3d α (Fig.2 D). We conclude that the proteins themselves degrade DHS-1-P in a reaction different from S-1-P lyase, making them strong candidates to be DHS-1-P phosphatases. To verify if the protein encoded by YSR2 has phosphatase activity, a system for in vitro assay of the phosphatase activity was established. Whole cell extracts from the YSR2 overexpression strain and its wild type strain were obtained. Because the protein is predicted to be a membrane protein, microsomes from both strains were isolated. Using DHS-1-P as a substrate, the enzymatic reaction was carried out using similar conditions as were used for mammalian DHS-1-P phosphatase (19De Ceuster P. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using the same amount of proteins, the microsomes from the overexpression strain had 6-fold more DHS-1-P phosphatase activity (0.19 nmol of dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein) compared with the wild type strain (0.03 nmol of dihydrosphingosine/min/mg of protein). To eliminate the possibility that the increase in activity was caused by activation of a regulatory protein or by a nonspecific phosphatase, we tagged the proteins (YSR2 and YSR2–1) with Flag peptide and purified the resultant fusion proteins. To prevent the substrate DHS-1-P from being degraded by S-1-P lyase, we took advantage of the lyase deletion mutant. Therefore, the epitope-tagged proteins (YSR2-Flag and YSR2–1-Flag) were expressed in the JS16 strain using the Saccharomyces expression vector pYES2. The expression was under the control of the Gal1 promoter, which is induced in the presence of galactose. Cells that expressed the fusion proteins were disrupted by vortexing in the presence of glass beads, and microsomes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of the fusion proteins was detected by Western blot analysis. The fusion proteins were predominantly located in the membrane pellet fraction (Fig.3 A). The fusion proteins were then purified by an affinity column coupled with the monoclonal antibody against Flag peptide. Partially purified fusion proteins were obtained as shown on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining (Fig. 3 B). The activity assay usingd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine as a substrate demonstrated that the specific activity of the partially purified fusion protein YSR2 increased 250-fold as compared with the starting crude membrane extract, whereas the specific activity of YSR2–1 increased approximately 200-fold (TableIII). Thus, both proteins are enzymes and have an activity to dephosphorylate DHS-1-P. Using the partially purified proteins, we next tested their substrate specificity. No phosphatase activity toward ceramide 1-phosphate and phosphatidic acid was detected in the partially purified proteins (Table III). Thus, we conclude that the YSR2 and YSR2–1 genes encode lipid phosphatases, and they specifically dephosphorylate DHS-1-P.Table IIIPurification and substrate specificity of Flag fusion proteinsSubstrateEnzyme activityJK9–3d α curde membrane extractYSR2 crude membrane extractYSR2–1 crude membrane extractYSR2 affinity pure proteinsYSR2–1 affinity pure proteinsDHS-1-P0.050.180.1649.232.8Cer-1-P0.170.110.160.00.13PA0.290.220.260.060.11The Flag-tagged YSR2 and YSR2–1 were partially purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphatase activities toward DHS-1-P, NBD-C6-ceramide 1-phosphate (Cer-1-P), and NBD-phosphatidic acid (PA) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results indicate the specific activity (dihydrosphingosine, ceramide, and DAG (nmol/min/mg of protein). Open table in a new tab The Flag-tagged YSR2 and YSR2–1 were partially purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphatase activities toward DHS-1-P, NBD-C6-ceramide 1-phosphate (Cer-1-P), and NBD-phosphatidic acid (PA) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results indicate the specific activity (dihydrosphingosine, ceramide, and DAG (nmol/min/mg of protein). The cells of the ysr2Δ deletion strain (YSR2Δ) and the wild type strain (JK9–3d α) were labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine for 2 h. Unlike in the JK9–3d α strain, none of the major sphingolipids such as inositol phosphorylceramide, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide, and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide were labeled in the YSR2Δ strain. Failure of sphingolipid labeling in the mutant strain was restored by re-introducing the YSR2 gene back into the YSR2Δ strain (Fig. 2 C). Importantly, this failure to label sphingolipids was not due to a generalized defect in sphingolipid biosynthesis. First, the YSR2Δ strain had normal levels of sphingolipids when analyzed by mass measurements of sphingoid bases or ceramide levels (232.0 ± 16 pmol of sphingoids including dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine, and 78.0 ± 12 pmol of phytoceramide per 5 × 108 wild type (JK9–3d α) cells; 266.0 ± 9 pmol of sphingoids and 66.0 ± 14 pmol of phytoceramide per 5 × 108 ysr2Δ cells). Second, when the mutant cells and the wild type cells were labeled with [3H]inositol, all sphingolipids were labeled in both types of cells (Fig. 4 A). These data show that the failure of the deletion mutant to incorporate dihydrosphingosine into sphingolipids is due to the inability to dephosphorylate DHS-1-P, suggesting a role for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of exogenous dihydrosphingosine in incorporation into sphingolipids. When the JK9–3d α strain and the YSR2Δ strain were pretreated with 200 μm fumonisin B1 and then labeled with [3H]dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine accumulated in wild type cells but not in the ysr2Δ mutant cells (Fig.4 B). Thus exogenously supplied dihydrosphingosine was not converted to phytosphingosine in the mutant. These data also suggest that dihydrosphingosine is not directly converted to phytosphingosine without prior phosphorylation followed by dephosphorylation. In contrast to labeling of sphingolipids, we observed that glycerolipids including PI, PE, and PC were labeled 5–10 times more in the DHS-1-P phosphatase deletion strain (YSR2Δ) than in the wild type strain (JK9–3d α) (Fig. 2 C). On the other hand, in the DHS-1-P/S-1-P lyase-deficient mutant (JS 16), glycerolipids such as PI, PE, and PC were hardly labeled when cells were fed [3H]dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, dihydrosphingosine was probably incorporated into these glycerolipids through phosphorylation followed by cleavage by DHS-1-P/S-1-P lyase. Taken together, these results suggest that the fate of exogenous dihydrosphingosine appears to be a result of the distinct action of the DHS-1-P phosphatase and the DHS-1-P/S-1-P lyase with the latter enzyme being responsible for the shift of sphingolipid metabolites into glycerolipids. These data are in agreement with previous studies that have suggested a relationship between sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism (1Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). For example, treatment of yeast or mammalian cells with the mycotoxin fumonisin B1, which blocks sphingolipid biosynthesis, resulted in an elevation in the concentrations of free sphingoid bases such as dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate as well as an increase in the concentrations of glycerolipids (23Wu W. McDonough V.M. Nickels J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1304: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data also suggest that the sphingolipid pathway interacts with the glycerolipid pathway. While this work was in progress, Qie et al. (25Qie L. Nagiec M. Baltisberger J. Lester R. Dickson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16110-16117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) identified a gene they named LCB3 with an identical sequence toYSR2. They demonstrated that LCB3 was necessary for incorporation of exogenous long chain bases into sphingolipids. They speculated that YSR2/LCB3 transports or facilitates uptake of long chain bases. Based on the fact that the ysr2Δ mutant accumulates DHS-1-P and glycerolipids when exogenous dihydrosphingosine is added to the medium, it does not appear that YSR2 acts on uptake of sphingoid bases. Rather, dihydrosphingosine may need to be phosphorylated to facilitate its uptake and delivery to the cellular compartment where it will be dephosphorylated by YSR2 and then incorporated into sphingolipids. Although YSR2–1 has DHS-1-P phosphatase activity as indicated in thein vitro assay (Table III) and in the study where theysr2–1Δ mutant accumulated DHS-1-P at early time points (Fig. 2 D), defects of YSR2–1 only slightly reduced synthesis of sphingolipids from exogenous [3H]dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, while sharing similarity in sequence and biochemical function, YSR2 and YSR2–1 appear to play different physiological functions. This observation requires further study of the YSR2–1 gene. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that the sphingolipid and the glycerolipid pathways are closely connected through phosphorylation of dihydrosphingosine. Dephosphorylation of DHS-1-P then provides a substrate for sphingolipid biosynthesis whereas cleavage of DHS-1-P by the lyase provides a substrate for glycerolipid biosynthesis. These studies, therefore, demonstrate that YSR2 is a DHS-1-P phosphatase that plays a critical role in these metabolic interconnections.

In this report we present evidence that cyclin D1 protein is regulated by the calcium-activated neutral cysteine endopeptidase calpain (EC3.4.22.17). PC-3-M cells, a human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, were a gift of Dr. James Kozlowski, Department of Urology, Northwestern University Medical School (29Kozlowski J.M. Fidler I.J. Campbell D. Xu Z.-L. Kaighn M.E. Hart I.R. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3522-3529PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells, a human estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma cell line, and the mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (PC-3-M and MDA-MB-231 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (NIH 3T3 cells) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). For serum starvation, NIH 3T3 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in complete medium, washed with serum-free medium, and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of the appropriate agent. Polyclonal antibody to cyclin D1 and monoclonal antibody to cyclin B1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin were purchased from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. Calpain inhibitor I (LLnL) and calpain inhibitor II (LLM), m-calpain, and PMSF were obtained from Sigma. Lactacystin was obtained from Dr. Edwin Corey, Department of Chemistry, Harvard University. ZVAD-FMK, ZFA-FMK, and BD-FMK were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed with TNN lysis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml PMSF) at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. The blots were blocked, incubated with polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 or monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 antibody, washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm EDTA, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and cyclin protein was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). The membrane used for anti-ubiquitin Western blot was first autoclaved in water for 20 min to ensure complete denaturation of ubiquitinated proteins prior to probing with anti-ubiquitin antibody (30Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To determine cyclin D1 half-life, 60–70% confluent monolayers of cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). At each time point indicated cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed in TNN lysis buffer, and cyclin D1 levels determined by Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl. Purified calpain (m-calpain, the 80-kDa subunit of Ca2+-activated neutral protease from rabbit skeletal muscle, 1 unit per 33 μg of protein) was incubated with 40 μg of cell lysate for 1 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 60 μl. After incubation SDS sample buffer was added, the samples were boiled and centrifuged, and the supernatant was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cyclin D1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1.5 μg/ml calpastatin plasmid in pcDNA3 vector, or with pcDNA3 vector alone (31Asada K. Ishino Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Vector control and calpastatin-transfected cells were co-transfected with a GFP expression vector (pEGFP-N1, 1.5 μg/ml;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were grown on sterile coverslips, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature (32Szekely L. Uzvolgyi E. Jiang W.-Q. Durko M. Wiman K.G. Klein G. Sumegi J. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 287-295PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody was added to the coverslip and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The coverslip was washed two times for 2 min with PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After incubation, the coverslips were washed with PBS, rinsed quickly with water, air-dried, mounted using SlowFade (Molecular Probes), and imaged using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope interfaced with a CCD camera (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA). The half-life of the D-type cyclins is very short and the withdrawal of growth factors during the G1 phase of the cell cycle results in a rapid decrease of D-type cyclin protein (15Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 19Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). When NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking serum, steady-state levels of cyclin D1 protein were markedly decreased between 6 and 12 h (data not shown), and by 24 h the cyclin D1 protein level was undetectable (Fig.1 lane 6). To determine whether protease inhibitors could prevent the degradation of cyclin D1 we investigated the effect of the peptide aldehyde calpain inhibitors LLnL and LLM, the serine protease inhibitor PMSF, and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin on cyclin D1 levels in log phase control and serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The protease concentrations and incubation times chosen resulted in cell viability greater than 70% (data not shown). LLnL, LLM, and lactacystin all increased the level of cyclin D1 protein in control NIH 3T3 cells (lanes 1–5). PMSF had no effect (lane 6). In serum-starved cells LLnL completely reversed cyclin D1 loss, LLM partially reversed cyclin D1 loss, and lactacystin had no effect (lanes 6–12). LLnL and LLM are calpain and cathepsin inhibitors. LLnL also has activity as a proteasome inhibitor (24King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 7: 1343-1357Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 33Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol.

This raised the possibility that, like cyclins B1, A, and E, cyclin D1 was being degraded by the proteasome. However, the complete absence of reversal of cyclin D1 degradation by lactacystin, the most specific proteasome inhibitor available (36Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 37Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggests that cyclin D1 is being degraded by a calpain-type enzyme. We investigated whether these findings could be extended to human tumor cell lines. PC-3-M prostate carcinoma cells and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells can continue to proliferate even in the absence of serum. To induce loss of cyclin D1 in these cells we treated the cells with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. An initial concentration dependence experiment showed that treatment with 500 ng/ml for 24 h was not toxic to the cells (viability greater than 80%) and that RNA synthesis was blocked by greater than 90% (data not shown). Log phase control or actinomycin D-treated cells were cultured with or without LLnL, LLM, or PMSF for 24 h, and cyclin D1 protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.2, LLnL prevented the loss of cyclin D1 protein in both PC-3-M and MDA-MB-231 cells (lane 6). LLM and PMSF had no effect (lanes 7 and 8). Recent studies have shown the existence of a family of cysteine proteases, related to the Caenorhabditis elegansdeath gene ced-3, which are activated during induction of apoptosis (38Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 39Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thonberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This caspase family of proteases can be selectively inhibited by synthetic cleavage site-directed fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitors (41Sarin A. Wu M.-L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of the active inhibitors ZVAD-FMK and BD-FMK, and the inactive peptidyl analogue ZFA-FMK on cyclin D1 expression in the human prostate carcinoma PC-3-M cells (Fig. 3). Cells were incubated with or without actinomycin D for 24 h, and, where indicated, peptidyl analogues were added to the culture dishes for the last 12 h of incubation. Total cell lysates were prepared and Western blot analyses were performed using anti-cyclin D1 antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Cyclin D1 protein levels of PC-3-M cells treated with the caspase inhibitors was similar to control cells (lanes 1 and 3–5). Furthermore, these protease inhibitors did not block the actinomycin D-induced loss of cyclin D1 protein in PC-3-M cells (lanes 6–8). These data further indicate that the proteolysis of cyclin D1 in these cell cultures is specifically calpain-associated. Ubiquitination is known to target cellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome pathway (27Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 42Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Lactacystin, aStreptomyces metabolite, is a specific proteasome inhibitor that has been used as a tool to investigate intracellular protein degradation pathways (36Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 37Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1 was one of the first proteins shown to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (23Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Cyclins A and E are also inactivated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (24King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 7: 1343-1357Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We next examined culture conditions in which both cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 protein become undetectable to compare the effect of lactacystin to the effect of LLnL. PC-3-M cells were treated with actinomycin D for 24 h in the presence or absence of lactacystin or LLnL for the last 12 h. Treatment of PC-3-M cells with actinomycin D induced loss of cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4). LLnL, an inhibitor of both calpain and the proteasome, blocked degradation of cyclin B1 and cyclin D1. In contrast, lactacystin reversed loss of cyclin B1 and not cyclin D1. These data are consistent with previous reports showing that cyclin B1 degradation is through the proteasome and further support a calpain-mediated, non-proteasomal degradation mechanism for regulation of cyclin D1 under these experimental conditions. Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC1.1.1.88), an enzyme required for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid in the pathway leading to cholesterol biosynthesis (44Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albers-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). In a number of cell types lovastatin also inhibits cell proliferation by inducing a block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (45Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar,46Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hunter and colleagues (46Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have shown that lovastatin lowers the level of cyclin D1 protein in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, the steady-state level of cyclin D1 protein was markedly decreased in both PC-3-M and MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to 10 μm lovastatin for 36 h (Fig.5 A). To examine the role of proteases in cyclin D1 regulation in lovastatin-treated cells, log phase control and lovastatin-treated PC-3-M and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of LLnL or lactacystin, and the levels of cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 were examined by Western blot analysis. LLnL reversed the loss of both cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 protein. In contrast, consistent with the data in Fig. 4, lactacystin prevented the loss of cyclin B1 and not cyclin D1 protein. To confirm that lactacystin was active in increasing the level of ubiquitinated proteins in PC-3-M cells, a control experiment was performed in which total cellular levels of ubiquitinated proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibody in untreated cells and in cells incubated for 12 h with lactacystin or LLnL. Lactacystin caused an increase in total cellular ubiquitinated protein (Fig. 5 B). LLnL also caused an increase in total ubiquitinated proteins, as would be predicted by the reported ability of LLnL to block proteasome-associated protease activity (33Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 34Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 35Lane R.D. Allan D.M. Mellgren R.L. Exp.

The half-life of cyclin D1 is among the shortest in eukaryotic cells, typically in the range of 30 to 60 min (19Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). If cyclin D1 is degraded by calpain in vivo, then inhibition of calpain in cells would be expected to stabilize cyclin D1 protein. To test this we determined the half-life of cyclin D1 protein in the presence or absence of LLnL in the NIH 3T3, PC-3-M, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Log phase control cells or cells treated with LLnL for 12 h were treated with cycloheximide and harvested at the times indicated. In the absence of calpain inhibitor, the half-life of cyclin D1 was less than 2 h in the three cell types (Fig.6 A). In contrast, in the presence of LLnL the half-life of cyclin D1 was greater than 12 h in each of the cell lines (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the cyclin D1 protein half-life increased by at least 6-fold in each cell type in response to calpain inhibitor. Calpain is an intracellular nonlysosomal cysteine protease that requires calcium ions for activity (33Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 34Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-W. Trends Pharmacol.

The results presented above indicated that calpain may act as an endogenous regulator of cyclin D1. These data prompted us to determine if cyclin D1 acts as a substrate for purified calpain in vitro and to examine the Ca2+dependence of cyclin D1 degradation. Cell lysates from control PC-3-M and MDA-MB-321 cells were incubated with purified calpain under varying conditions, and cyclin D1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In the absence of added Ca2+ there was no evidence of calpain activity toward cyclin D1 (Fig.7, lane 2). Boiling of calpain before addition also resulted in no detectable loss of cyclin D1 (lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of 6.0 mm CaCl2, however, calpain caused a complete loss of detectable cyclin D1 (lanes 2 and 3). We have subsequently determined that the EC50 for Ca2+ in stimulation of calpain-mediated cyclin D1 proteolysis in the PC-3-M cell lysates is between 100 and 500 μm (data not shown). Consistent with the Ca2+requirement for calpain-mediated cyclin D1 proteolysis, simultaneous incubation of cell lysates with calpain and the calcium chelator EGTA resulted in a complete block of calpain activity toward cyclin D1 (lanes 6 and 7). Calpastatin is a highly specific endogenous protein inhibitor of intracellular calpain (35Lane R.D. Allan D.M. Mellgren R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaka H. Minami Y. Ohno S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of calpain in cyclin D1 regulation in vivo, we studied the effect of overexpressing calpastatin on cyclin D1 levels. Cyclin D1 levels were determined by immunocytochemistry in logarithmic phase NIH 3T3 cells growing in 10% serum, in cells that were serum-starved for 24 h, and in serum-starved cells that were transiently co-transfected with a calpastatin cDNA expression vector and a GFP expression vector. The cells were analyzed for green fluorescence, indicative of GFP expression, and red fluorescence, which reflected cyclin D1 levels. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 8. All log phase NIH 3T3 cells expressed moderately high levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 8 A); however, only some of the cells expressed GFP (Fig. 8 B), reflecting a transfection efficiency of approximately 50% (data not shown). After 24 h of serum starvation, the cyclin D1 level was uniformly reduced (Fig. 8,C and D). In contrast, cells transiently transfected with the calpastatin expression vector, as evaluated by GFP expression, had a markedly higher cyclin D1 level (Fig. 8, Eand F). Twenty high-power fields were examined per experimental condition, and the results were tabulated in TableI. In cells growing in 10% serum, greater than 90% of the cells that were successfully transfected, as determined by GFP positivity, were also positive for cyclin D1 expression. Serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells resulted in less than 30% of the cells being positive for cyclin D1 protein. In contrast, serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells co-tr"

G., Yu, F. H., Kapus, A., Gergely, L., Grinstein, S., and Orlowski, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 3590–3599). To further define determinants of PKA regulation, six serine residues located in potential recognition sequences for PKA within, or adjacent to, this region (positions 552, 605, 634, 661, 690, and 691) were altered either independently or in various combinations using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutant NHE3s tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope were stably expressed in exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) for functional studies. Of the individual mutations examined, only substitutions at Ser605 or Ser634 affected sensitivity to forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, although partial inhibition of NHE3 activity by forskolin remained. By contrast, simultaneous mutation of both these serines completely abolished cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 without greatly affecting basal transport activity. Two-dimensional analysis of tryptic digests of immunoprecipitated NHE3 labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate revealed several phosphopeptides under basal conditions. Phosphorylation was increased approximately 3-fold in one of these peptides following forskolin treatment, and this change was eliminated by mutation of residue Ser605. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser605 is essential for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3. In addition, Ser634 is also required for the effect of cAMP, even though this residue does not become phosphorylated upon activation of PKA.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). NHE1 is the “housekeeping” isoform present in nearly all cells. The other isoforms have a more restricted tissue distribution. Of these, NHE3 is confined to the apical (i.e. brush-border) membranes of some epithelial cells of the renal and gastrointestinal tracts, where it participates in transepithelial Na+ and HCO3− absorption. Bacterial enterotoxins and neurotransmitters that elevate intracellular cAMP (cAMP i ) levels are known to inhibit NaCl absorption which, together with a concomitant stimulation of net Cl−secretion, promotes diarrhea (7Donowitz M.

Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven, New York1987: 1351-1388Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which cAMP inhibits the absorptive process. Recent studies of epithelial cells expressing NHE3 as well as exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) transfected with NHE3 showed that this isoform is inhibited following activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (11Kandasamy R.A. Yu F.H. Harris R. Boucher A. Hanrahan J.W. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29209-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20004-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of NHE chimeras and C-terminally truncated mutants revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3, particularly the region between amino acids 579 and 684, is essential for the cAMP response (13Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This region contains several potential sites for phosphorylation by PKA. Furthermore, recent work by Moe et al. (14Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that acute inhibition by PKA is accompanied by an increase in the total phosphorylation of NHE3 expressed in AP-1 cells. However, it is unclear whether direct phosphorylation of NHE3 by PKA mediates the inhibition of this transporter. Other studies suggest that an ancillary protein is required for cAMP-induced inhibition and may itself be the relevant PKA substrate (15Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of NHE3 regulation by PKA, a series of point mutations were made to selectively eliminate possible phosphorylation sites recognized by PKA using site-directed mutagenesis. The data identify two sites in NHE3 that confer responsiveness to cAMP. Carrier-free 22NaCl (range of specific activity, 300–900 mCi/mg; concentration, ∼5 mCi/ml) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Mandel Scientific, Guelph, ON). Amiloride, ouabain, forskolin, deoxyglucose, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma. Nigericin and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) acetoxymethylester were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Corp. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (HA) were from BAbCO (clone 16B12; Berkeley, CA). α-Minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario). Cell culture dishes and flasks were purchased from Becton-Dickinson and/or Corning (Montréal, Québec). All other chemicals and reagents used in these experiments were purchased from BDH Inc. (St. Laurent, Québec) or Fisher Scientific and were of the highest grade available. Bicarbonate-free medium RPMI 1640 was buffered with 25 mmHEPES to pH 7.3 and adjusted to 290 ± 5 mosm. Phosphate-buffered saline consisted of (in mm): 140 NaCl, 10 KCl, 8 sodium phosphate, 2 potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The isotonic Na+-rich medium used in the fluorimetric pH measurements contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.3. Isotonic Na+-free medium contained the same salts with the exception of NaCl which was substituted by N-methyl-d-glucammonium chloride. Isotonic K+-rich medium had the same composition as Na+-rich medium, except that NaCl was replaced by KCl. A modified rat NHE3 cDNA engineered to contain a series of unique restriction endonuclease sites was inserted into a mammalian expression vector under the control of the enhancer/promoter region from the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus (plasmid called pNHE3′) as described previously (17Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The influenza virus HA epitope YPYDVPDYAS, preceded by a single Gly amino acid linker (inserted to create peptide flexibility), was inserted at the very C-terminal end of NHE3′ using the polymerase chain reaction to allow for immunological detection of the protein. In control experiments, these modifications had no obvious effect on the basal activity or functional properties of NHE3 (called NHE3′HA) when expressed in AP-1 cells (data not shown). Substitution of serine residues in NHE3′HA was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using the unique site elimination method (18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and to ensure that other random mutations were not introduced. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (AP-1 cells), which was functionally selected for its lack of endogenous NHE activity following chemical mutagenesis (19Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transfected with plasmids containing the wild type and mutant NHE3 constructs by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation technique of Chen and Okayama (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Starting 48 h after transfection, the AP-1 cells were selected for survival after repeated (5–6 times over a 2-week period) acute NH4Cl-induced acid loads (21Franchi A. Perucca Lostanlen D. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9388-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to discriminate between Na+/H+ exchanger-positive and -negative transfectants. The AP-1 cells were maintained in complete α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, and incubated in an humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells expressing NHE activity were regularly selected by an acute acid challenge, as described above. This process was repeated to eliminate possible revertants and maintain stable functional expression of the exchanger. Na+/H+ exchanger activity was measured as the rate of amiloride-inhibitable Na+ influx at a constant intracellular H+ concentration. For these studies, pH i was set at 6.3 by incubating confluent cell monolayers on 24-well plates in medium containing the appropriate K+ concentration and the K+/H+exchange ionophore nigericin (23Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Since at equilibrium [K i +]/[K o +] = [H i +]/[H o +], the desired pH i was calculated from the imposed [K+] gradient and the extracellular pH (pH o = 7.4), assuming an intracellular [K+] of 140 mm. To clamp pH i at 6.3, the cell monolayers were first washed with aN-methyl-d-glucammonium+-balanced salt solution and then preincubated in a K+-nigericin solution containing 153 mm N-methyl-d-glucammonium Cl, 11.2 mmKCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm nigericin, 10 mm HEPES, pH o 7.4, for 3 min at room temperature. This solution was then removed and22Na+ influx measurements were initiated in the same K+-nigericin solution supplemented with 1 μCi of22NaCl/ml and 1 mm ouabain (to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase and thereby minimize22Na+ efflux) in the absence or presence of 2 mm amiloride. 22Na+ influx was terminated after 10 min by aspirating the radiolabeled medium and rapidly washing the cells 3 times with ice-cold NaCl stop solution (130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). To extract the radiolabel, 0.25 ml of 0.5 n NaOH was added to each well to solubilize the cells and the wells were washed with 0.25 ml of 0.5 n HCl. Both the solubilized cell extract in NaOH and the HCl wash solution were suspended in 5 ml of scintillation fluid and the radioactivity assayed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. 22Na+ influx was linear with time for at least 10 min under these experimental conditions. Stably transfected cells were grown to 60–70% confluence on glass coverslips and serum-starved for at least 16 h. Next, cells were incubated for 20 min in HPMI with 2 μg/ml BCECF-acetoxymethylester at 37 °C. Cells were pulsed with 50 mm NH4Cl during the last 15 min of the incubation with BCECF and stimulation with forskolin was performed during the last 10 min of incubation with the dye. Cells were next washed three times with NH4Cl- and Na+-free solution and resuspended in this medium. To study the sodium-dependent pH i recovery, cells were next incubated in isotonic Na+-rich medium. To measure the fluorescence of BCECF, the coverslip was placed in a thermostatted Leiden holder on the stage of a Nikon TMD-Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon Fluor 40X oil-immersion objective. A chopping mirror was used to direct the excitation light alternately to two excitation filters (500 ± 10 and 440 ± 10 nm) in front of a xenon lamp. To minimize dye bleaching and photodynamic damage, neutral density filters were used to reduce the intensity of the excitation light reaching the cells. The excitation light was directed to the cells via a 510-nm dichroic mirror and fluorescence emission was collected by a 535 ± 25-nm band-pass filter. Data were recorded every 10 s by irradiating the cells for 500 ms at each of the excitation wavelengths. Photometric data were acquired using Oscar software (Photon Technologies Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Calibration of the fluorescence ratio versus pH was performed for each experiment by equilibrating the cells in isotonic K+-rich medium buffered to varying pH values (between 7.45 and 5.85) in the presence of the K+/H+ionophore nigericin (5 μm). Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the extracellular pH, which is assumed to be identical to the internal pH, against the corresponding fluorescence ratio (23Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were grown to 60–70% confluence on 10-cm dishes and serum-starved for at least 16 h. Cells were then labeled in vivo for 4 h with 4 ml of phosphate-free α-minimal essential medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with PBS, and treated with or without 10 μm forskolin in Na+-rich medium for 10 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and processed immediately for immunoprecipitation. The confluent layer of cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described above were scraped into a hypotonic solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 18 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm iodoacetamide, pH 7.2). Cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge, resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100, mixed by pipetting, and agitated on a rotating rocker at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris, the supernatants were pre-cleared with Protein G-Sepharose beads by rocking for 2 h to reduce nonspecific binding. The beads were spun down and the supernatants incubated overnight with 4 μl of the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added and allowed to rock for a further 2 h, and then washed eight times with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. For each sample, an aliquot of 40 μl was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and analyzed by autoradiography. The phosphoprotein corresponding to NHE3 was further characterized by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The band corresponding to NHE3, which was identified by autoradiography and its gel mobility in relation to prestained low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad), was excised and soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-360; Sigma) in 100 mm acetic acid at 37 °C for 30 min to block nonspecific absorption of trypsin, washed briefly in water, and then with fresh 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Digestion was achieved by incubating the piece of membrane in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate with 10 μg of trypsin overnight at 37 °C, followed by addition of another 10 μg of trypsin and a second 2-h incubation at 37 °C. The digested proteins were lyophilized, washed once with 100 μl of water and re-lyophilized, resuspended in 10 μl of H2O, and spotted at the origin on thin-layer cellulose plates. Phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis in formic acid/glacial acetic acid/H2O (25:78:897) (pH 1.9, 1000 V, 40 min) in the first dimension, and then by ascending chromatography in glacial acetic acid/pyridine/H2O (10:1:189) for 20 h in the second dimension. The incorporation of radioactive 32P in the phosphopeptides was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To assess the expression of the gene products, immunoblotting was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against HA. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes as described above. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against HA were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. The second antibody, goat anti-mouse coupled to horseradish peroxidase, was applied at a 1:5000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To assess the distribution of the expressed gene products, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. AP-1 cells stably expressing HA epitope-tagged wild type and mutant NHE3s were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to 80% confluence. They were washed three times with PBS, and then fixed for 15 min at room temperature using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following fixation, the cells were washed 3–4 times with PBS and incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min. The coverslips were washed again and the cells permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h, then incubated with a mouse anti-HA antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h. After this period, the coverslips were washed 4–5 times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with a donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:1000 dilution). The coverslips were finally washed and mounted onto glass slides using DAKO Fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA to test for statistically significant differences between control and treated cells. The molecular basis for transducing the inhibitory effect of PKA on NHE3 activity is equivocal, with some evidence supporting direct phosphorylation (14Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and other data suggesting indirect regulation through phosphorylation of ancillary PKA-sensitive regulatory protein(s) (15Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To distinguish these proposed mechanisms, rat wild type NHE3′ tagged at its C-terminal end with the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA epitope (NHE3′HA) was stably expressed in AP-1 cells devoid of endogenous NHE activity. The state of phosphorylation of NHE3′HA was evaluated under basal conditions, and following acute exposure to 10 μm forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase. This latter treatment increases the intracellular cAMP (cAMPi) concentration severalfold and significantly depresses NHE3 activity via a PKA-dependent pathway in AP-1 cells (24Azarani A. Goltzman D. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14931-14936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells expressing NHE3′HA were pulse-labeledin vivo with [32P]orthophosphate for a 4-h period. NHE3′HA was then immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by blotting to Immobilon membranes and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.1 A, NHE3′HAmigrates largely as a phosphoprotein band of ∼85 kDa under basal conditions, but small amounts of a dimerized form are often discernible. However, contrary to a previous study (14Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using very similar experimental conditions, no apparent change in the degree of total phosphorylation was observed. Western blot analysis (Fig.1 B) of the same membrane filter confirmed that equal amounts of NHE3′HA were loaded on the gels, thereby eliminating the possibility that any potential differences in phosphorylation could have been masked by unequal efficiency of immunoprecipitation in basal and cAMP i -stimulated cells. In three independent experiments, the average radioactivity of 32P-labeled NHE3′HA normalized for the amount of NHE3′HAimmunoprecipitated showed no significant difference between control and forskolin-treated cells (Fig. 1 C). In summary, inhibition of NHE3 transport activity by PKA is not associated with observable changes in total phosphorylation of the protein when evaluated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. At present, we cannot account for the difference between our results and those of Moe et al.(14Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). While the above analysis did not reveal an apparent change in the total phosphorylation of NHE3′HA in response to PKA, it was conceivable that several phosphorylation sites exist which might mask minor changes in phosphorylation of one or a few sites in response to PKA. To examine this possibility, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed on immunoprecipitated NHE3′HA. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, seven major phosphopeptides (P1–P7) were identified together with additional minor spots (a, b, and c). The major phosphopeptides always appeared in different sets of experiments, but the minor spots were not consistently observed. To calculate the levels of phosphorylation, the radioactivity associated with each major spot was counted and then expressed relative to that of P1, which was normalized to a value of 100 (Fig. 2 D). Based on the analysis of three separate experiments, only one phosphopeptide (P5) showed a significant increase (3-fold; p < 0.01) in its incorporation of 32P following activation of PKA. Taken together with previous phosphoamino acid analysis showing that only serine residues are phosphorylated in NHE3 (14Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), these findings strongly suggest that PKA phosphorylates at least 1 serine residue in NHE3 during down-regulation of its activity. We previously identified a small segment in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of NHE3 (residues 579–684) that is essential for the cAMP response (13Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Within and adjacent to this region are several serine residues located in potential recognition sequences for PKA. Of these, six serines at positions 552, 605, 634, 661, 690, and 691 (Fig. 3 A) were considered good candidates for further structural studies. These residues were substituted either singly or in various combinations by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting mutants assayed for altered regulation by PKA. Na+/H+ exchange activity was initially assessed by measuring rates of amiloride-inhibitable22Na+ influx at pH i 6.3 in cells pretreated with or without 10 μm forskolin. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, activation of adenylate cyclase reduced wild type (WT) NHE3′HA activity by nearly 50%, consistent with previous observations (11Kandasamy R.A. Yu F.H. Harris R. Boucher A. Hanrahan J.W. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29209-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Cabado A.G. Yu F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The data also indicate that the regulatory properties of NHE3 are not influenced by the presence of the C-terminal HA-tag. The behavior of one triple mutant, S661A/S690G/S691G, was indistinguishable from WT, whereas the other triple mutant, S552A/S605G/S634A, was completely unresponsive to activated PKA. Further dissection of these latter residues showed that the S552A mutant mirrored wild type responsiveness to PKA, whereas single mutations at either Ser605 (S605G) or Ser634 (S634A) significantly reduced (p < 0.01), but did not eliminate, inhibition of22Na+ influx by forskolin. Simultaneous substitutions at both positions completely abolished cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity (p < 0.01) without appreciably affecting basal transport activity (TableI), indicating additive interactions between these two sites.Table IBasal rates of amiloride-inhibitable 22 Na+ uptake at pH i 6.3 in AP-1 cells stably expressing wild type (WT) and mutant NHE3sNHE3 constructsRates of transportnmol/min/mg proteinWT3.33 ± 0.31S661A/S690G/S691G1.61 ± 0.42S552A/S605G/S633A3.31 ± 0.40S552A/S605G2.20 ± 0.26S552A/S634A5.20 ± 0.74S605G/S634A4.07 ± 0.90S552A1.43 ± 0.20S605G3.32 ± 0.27S605T2.88 ± 0.28S605R2.93 ± 0.81S634A6.04 ± 0.76S634T4.08 ± 0.56S634R4.17 ± 0.98S634N2.19 ± 0.95Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four to six experiments Open table in a new tab Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four to six experiments Additional analyses (Fig. 3 C) showed that a conservative substitution of Ser605 with Thr maintained the wild type behavior, whereas replacement with Arg caused a significant reduction in the response to PKA. Preservation of the cAMP-inhibitory response in the S605T mutant is consistent with this modified site (i.e.RRRT605IR) retaining an optimal recognition motif (R(R/K)X(S/T)) for PKA (25Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of Ser634 with Thr, Arg, or Asn resulted in either a partial or a complete loss of responsiveness to cAMP. Again, these substitutions did not appreciably affect basal transport activity (Table I). One caveat to comparing basal transport rates using stably transfected cells is that they are affected by secondary events unrelated to protein structure, such as protein expression levels which are influenced by the number of cDNA copies incorporated into the genome and the sites of integration. When compared with Ser605, Ser634 is in a much weaker context (KHLYS634RH) for recognition by PKA. While the above results supported the structural importance of these specific serine residues (S605G an"

Many E13.5 ventral telencephalic progenitors were observed to integrate and adopt local phenotypes following heterotopic transplantation into telencephalic or mid-hindbrain targets, whereas mid-hindbrain cells of the same stage were unable to integrate and change fate in the telencephalon. In contrast, many mid-hindbrain cells from an earlier developmental stage (E10.5) were capable of integrating and adopting a forebrain phenotype after grafting into the telencephalon, suggesting that mouse mid-hindbrain progenitors become restricted in their developmental potential between E10.5 and E13.5."

https://openalex.org/W2068939472,"Two genes encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (sod-2 and sod-3) have been identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Each gene is composed of five exons, and intron positions are identical; however, intron sizes and sequences are not the same. The predicted protein sequences are 86.3% homologous (91.8% conservative), and the cDNAs are only 75.2% homologous. Both deduced protein sequences contain the expected N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptides. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis shows that both genes are expressed under normal growth conditions and that their RNA transcripts aretrans-spliced to the SL-1 leader sequence. The latter result together with Northern blot analysis indicate that both genes have mono-cistronic transcripts. The sod-3 gene was mapped to chromosome X, and the location of sod-2 was confirmed to be chromosome I. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the cDNA regions encoding the predicted mature manganese superoxide dismutase proteins and each was cloned and expressed to high levels inEscherichia coli cells deficient in cytosolic superoxide dismutases. Both proteins were shown to be active in E. coli, providing similar protection against methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress.

A key sequence of Ser-Tyr-Gly at amino acids 65–67 near the N terminus functions as the GFP fluorophore (7Cody C.W. Prasher D.C. Westler W.M. Prendergast F.G. Ward W.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Enhanced GFP (EGFP) is a mutant of GFP with a 35-fold increase in fluorescence (9Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 10Haas J. Park E.C. Seed B. Curr.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4592-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This variant has mutations of Ser to Thr at amino acid 65 and Phe to Leu at position 64 and is encoded by a gene with optimized human codons (10Haas J. Park E.C. Seed B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies of wild-type GFP and the mutant S65T indicate that the GFP tertiary structure resembles a barrel (12Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar,13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). It consists of 11 antiparallel β sheets and a single central α helix surrounded by the β sheets. The chromophore resides in the center of the barrel, completely shielded from the extral environment. There are three small α helices within the protein, one of which is located at the N terminus. Most of the β sheets are connected by small loops of one to four amino acids. Two larger connecting loops, beginning at positions 128 and 188, contain 15 and 9 amino acids, respectively. The compact structure of GFP presumably contributes to its unusual resistance to proteolysis and denaturation. This structure might also explain the observation that few amino acids can be removed from the termini of GFP without affecting its activity. Based on deletion analysis, Dopf and Horiagon (1996) concluded that amino acids 2–232 are the minimal domain required for the fluorescence of wild-type GFP (14Dopf J. Horiagon T.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). N-terminal deletions of amino acids 2–8 abolished activity. In contrast, the C terminus of GFP is slightly less critical. A deletion of amino acids 233–238 has activity, but the slightly larger deletion of amino acids 226–238 does not. A finer map could likely be established by making single amino acid deletions from both ends. Such defined analysis would provide not only the minimal region of GFP that is required for its fluorescence but also information about key amino acids at the termini of GFP that are required for its structure and function. Here we report a more defined map of the minimal functional domain of GFP based on single amino acid truncation studies of EGFP, and substitution analysis of several important amino acids at the termini of the minimal fluorescent domain. Our study shows that the minimal domain of GFP consists of amino acids 7–229. Additional amino acid deletions at either end dramatically decrease GFP activity. We also found that Glu residues at amino acids 6 and 7 and Ile at amino acid 229 are critical for maintaining GFP activity. Our mutation studies indicate that the amino acid at the N terminus of the GFP minimal domain must be Glu, while the specific amino acid at its C terminus is not critical. Furthermore, internal deletions eliminate GFP fluorescence. Wild-type EGFP and its deletion mutants were made by PCR withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). EGFP cDNA was amplified by using plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) as a template and a 5′ primer with an introduced SacII sequence and a 3′ primer with EcoRI sequence. These two restriction sites were used for cloning of the amplified sequences into the mammalian expression vector pTRE (CLONTECH). To make the N-terminal deletions, the translation initiation codon AUG was introduced into the 5′ primer such that translation would start at nucleotide sequences encoding amino acid 7, 8, or 9. To make the C-terminal deletions, a stop codon was introduced into the 3′ primer such that translation would terminate at amino acid 233, 232, 231, 230, 229, 228, or 227. Site-specific mutations at amino acid 6, 7, or 229 were also created by two-step PCR. First-round PCR was carried out with the primers that contain the mutated nucleotides, and second-round PCR was with the EGFP-5′ and -3′ primers containing SacII andEcoRI sites. An insertion sequence containingBglII and HindIII recognition sites was introduced between amino acids 132 and 133, 137 and 138, and 192 and 193, respectively. The mutants were made according to the homology extension procedure (15Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Peasse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). First, the insertion sequence was introduced into a pair of primers that were complementary to each other. In the primers, the inserted sequence was flanked by 15 nucleotides of EGFP cDNA sequence on each side. These two primers along with EGFP-5′ and -3′ primers were used for PCR amplification to generate two DNA fragments, corresponding to the N and C termini of GFP. The two DNA fragments were then denatured and renatured to allow them to hybridize at their homologous sequences. The hybrid molecule was then extended to synthesize a full-length EGFP containing the insertion. Internal deletion and mutations were also made by this method. The deletions include Del [76–81], Del [83–88, Del [132–139], and Del [191–195]. Amino acids 71–81 and 83–88 were mutated to Ala, Ala [73–81] and Ala [83–88]. The amplified DNAs were cloned into pTRE for expression in mammalian cells. pTRE is a tetracycline (Tc)-inducible expression vector developed by Gossen and Bujard (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). In this expression system, a modified cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with a Tc-repressor binding element is regulated by a fusion of the tet-repressor and the herpes simplex virus VP-16, designated as tTA (16Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). It binds to the promoter only in the absence of Tc. Gene expression needs to be carried out in the cells that have been transfected by tTA, such as CHO/tTA (CLONTECH). This system gives a higher level of expression than wild-type CMV-promoter systems (17Ying D.X. Zhu L. Schimke R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The constructs were purified with Qiagen columns and transfected into CHO/tTA cells with a liposome transfection reagent (CLONfectin,CLONTECH). 5.0 μg of DNA were incubated with 5 μg of CLONfectin for 30 min and overlaid onto 106 cells for 1 h in serum-free medium. After 16 h of growth in the medium with serum, the cells were examined with a fluorescence microscope. The transfected cells were also analyzed for fluorescence intensity by FACS (Becton Dickinson). The deletion study of Dopf and Horiagon (14Dopf J. Horiagon T.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that the minimal domain of wild-type GFP begins at the N terminus somewhere between amino acids 2 and 8 and ends at the C terminus somewhere between amino acids 226 and 233 (14Dopf J. Horiagon T.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further define this map, we made a series of single amino acid deletions from both ends of an enhanced version of GFP. EGFP was used as a target, instead of wild-type GFP, because of its 35-fold higher fluorescence and ease of detection in mammalian cells. The crystal structures of GFP and S65T suggest that mutations in EGFP are unlikely to affect the N- and C-terminal structure of the protein (12Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, we made three N-terminal deletions, δ 6, 7, and 8 and seven C-terminal deletions, δ 233, 232, 231, 230, 229, 228, and 227. All of these deletion mutants were made by PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pTRE. The fluorescence of these mutants was determined by fluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected CHO/tTA cells. Expression from several key constructs was also quantitatively analyzed by FACS. We found that the N-terminal deletion mutant δ 6 has similar fluorescence to the full-length EGFP, but additional deletion of one or two more amino acids dramatically reduced the fluorescence (Fig. 1 B). We also determined the activity of some of these mutants by FACS analysis and found that, after subtraction of the autofluorescence background, δ 6 exhibited 112% activity compared with the full-length EGFP, while δ 7 retained only 12% activity (TableI). These data indicated that the minimal functional region of GFP starts at amino acid 7.Table IFACS analysis of EGFP and mutations in transfected CHO/tTA cellsEGFP mutationsRelative fluorescence intensity% ControlIntact EGFP610100%N-Terminal Deletions Del6683112% Del77612%C-Terminal Deletions Del2291055173% Del22834456%N-Terminal Mutations A6E/A7E34657% K6E/K7E20433% D6E/D7E33455%C-Terminal Mutations L229I696114% K229I670110% D229I54289%Negative Control264%Transfections were performed in CHO/tTA cells using the procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 h, cells were collected and analyzed for fluorescence intensity by FACS Caliber (Becton Dickinson).

Open table in a new tab Transfections were performed in CHO/tTA cells using the procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 h, cells were collected and analyzed for fluorescence intensity by FACS Caliber (Becton Dickinson). Untransfected cells were included in the analysis as a negative control. Similar analyses were performed with the C-terminal deletions of EGFP. All of the C-terminal mutations were shown to have the same fluorescence as the full-length protein, except for δ 228 and 227 (Fig. 1 C). Surprisingly, the δ 229 mutant exhibits a brighter fluorescence than full-length EGFP (Fig. 1 C and Table I). One possible explanation for this is that some of the amino acids after amino acid 229 may have a negative affect on GFP fluorescence via a non-favorable interaction with residues located in the barrel structure. δ 228 has 56% fluorescence compared with the full-length protein (Table I). δ 227 mutant exhibits the similarly declined fluorescence as δ 228 (data not shown). Western blot analysis with GFP antibodies indicated that similar amounts of protein were used in this study, suggesting that variations in fluorescence are due to the difference in structure rather than protein levels (data not shown). Therefore, the minimal functional domain of GFP ends at amino acid 229. Taken together, these N- and C-terminal deletion analyses reveal that amino acids 7–229 comprise the minimal functional domain of EGFP required for fluorescence. From the N-terminal deletion analysis, we know the importance of amino acid 7 in determining GFP fluorescence. Primary amino acid sequence of GFP indicates a Glu residue at this position. There are at least two possible ways that this amino acid might contribute significantly to the fluorescence properties of GFP. First, the negatively charged Glu may be needed for interaction with another oppositely charged amino acid to maintain the structure and function of GFP. Alternatively, this position may simply need to be physically occupied by an amino acid. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we changed the Glu residue to other amino acid residues. Because there is another Glu residue at amino acid 6, we made single and double mutations of these two Glu residues to a neutral amino acid, Ala, or to the positively charged amino acid, Lys (Fig. 2 A). Change of either one of these two Glu residues to Ala or Lys did not affect fluorescence compared with unmodified EGFP in transfected CHO/tTA cells (Fig. 2 B). However, when both of the Glu residues were changed to Ala or Lys, the activity was reduced dramatically (Fig. 2 B and Table I). These results indicate that one of these two Glu residues, at either position 6 or 7, is essential for GFP fluorescence. Therefore, we conclude that negative charge of these two Glu residues is important to GFP structure and function. To test if these two Glu residues can be replaced by other negatively charged amino acids, we mutated both of them to Asp. We found the green fluorescence of this mutant to be reduced to the same degree as in the Ala and Lys double mutants (Fig. 2 B and Table I). These suggest that the Glu residues at positions 6 and 7 are important not only in providing negative charges but also in maintaining specific contacts. One of these two negatively charged residues might interact with a positively charged residue within GFP, and the interaction is important to GFP structure and function. According to the crystal structure of GFP, these two Glu residues are located in a short α helix at the N terminus, from amino acids 3 to 9 (12Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Although the α helix is destroyed in the deletion mutant δ 6, this variant has the same fluorescence as full-length GFP (TableI). Therefore, we conclude that an intact α helix structure near the N terminus is not critical for fluorescence. The last amino acid at the C terminus of the GFP minimal domain is a neutral Ile residue. Thus, ionic charge interaction at this position is probably not an essential factor in determining the GFP structure and function. Since Ile is a hydrophobic amino acid, it is possible that the hydrophobic character of the amino acid may be important to GFP structure and function. To determine the contribution of this single amino acid to GFP structure and function, we mutated this Ile residue to another hydrophobic residue Leu and to the positively charged Lys or the negatively charged Asp (Fig.3 A). The fluorescence of these three mutants was examined in CHO/tTA cells and no difference was found between the fluorescence of the mutants and full-length GFP (Fig.3 B and Table I). Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the Ile residue at amino acid position 229 is not critical. According to the crystal structures of GFP and S65T (12Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 13Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), the last antiparallel β sheet ends at amino acid 228. Ile at amino acid 229 is excluded from the β sheet, so the disturbance of this structure by the mutations does not account for its importance in GFP function. Based on the lack of preference for a specific amino acid at this position, we conclude that physical occupancy of this position is important to GFP structure and function. According to its crystal structure, GFP contains the two largest loops, which locate from amino acids 129 to 142 and from 189 to 196. The regions do not directly participate in forming the β-can structure but rather serve as ”lid“ to the barrel. To determine if these regions are critical to GFP fluorescent activity, we generated two internal deletions, Del [132–139] and Del [191–195], one within each of these regions. Eight amino acids are deleted from Del [132–139] and 5 amino acid from Del [191–195]. These two deletion mutants showed no fluorescence after they were transfected into CHO/tTA cells (Table II). Therefore, these loop regions are required for either proper folding of GFP or for maintaining its structure. We found that these two regions are sensitive not only to deletions but also to insertions. We chose three insertion sites, two in between amino acids 132 and 133 and 137 and 138 and one in between 192 and 193. These three insertions also inactivate GFP activity (data not shown). The results suggest that the structures of these two loops are important to GFP structure and fluorescence. Change of their length, either by shortening or enlarging, will destroy GFP fluorescence.Table IIFunction analysis of EGFP and mutations in transfected CHO/tTA cellsEGFP mutationsFluorescenceIntact EGFP+Del [132–139]−Del [191–195]−Del [76–81]−Del [83–88]−Ala [76–81]−Ala [83–88]−Transfections were performed in CHO/tTA cells using the procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 hours, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. Open table in a new tab Transfections were performed in CHO/tTA cells using the procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 hours, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. There are two small α helixes that span from amino acids 76 to 81 and from 83 to 88. To test if these two small structures are necessary for GFP fluorescence, we first deleted these two structures. We found no fluorescence when they were examined in CHO/tTA cells (Table II). The inactivation might be due to the changed global structure of GFP by such deletions. To eliminate such influence, we then mutated each of the amino acids within these two regions to Ala, Ala [76–81] and Ala [83–88]. The mutations also destroyed GFP fluorescence (Table II). The results indicate these two α-helix structures are required for GFP fluorescence. In conclusion, we have determined that the minimal functional domain of GFP spans the region from amino acids 7 to 229. Additional amino acid deletions from either terminus of GFP dramatically reduced fluorescence. Our results indicate that a total of 15 amino acids can be deleted from GFP. Removal of a total of 15 amino acids from GFP defines a smaller form of the reporter that might be useful for systems where the size of full-length GFP is limiting, such as studies with neuronal cells where axonal movement of the reporter may be improved. The smaller form may also be useful as a tag for GFP-fusion studies. It is feasible that direct fusion of some proteins to the N or C terminus of GFP for use in protein localization studies may alter the tertiary structure of GFP and thereby decrease its fluorescence (17Ying D.X. Zhu L. Schimke R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Removal of the N or C terminus may prohibit this structural influence. According to the crystal structure of GFP, a small α helix structure extends from amino acid 3 to 9, at the N terminus of GFP. Our N-terminal deletion results indicate that this α helix is not critical to GFP structure and function because some of our N-terminal deletions have destroyed the structure while maintaining fluorescence. In contrast to this N-terminal small α helix, the internal two small α helixes are critical for GFP fluorescence. Either deletions or mutations of these two α helixes destroy GFP activity. The fluorescence of GFP is also sensitive to the other internal deletions within the two largest loop regions. The sensitivity of GFP fluorescence to such internal deletion mutations suggest the importance of these loops in maintaining GFP structure and function. There is a short tail, from amino acids 229 to 238, following the last β sheet. This tail, but not amino acid 229, can be deleted from GFP without affecting fluorescence. Amino acid 229 is important in maintaining GFP activity, but changing Ile to other amino acids does not affect GFP activity. Therefore position 229 is not Ile-specific. Physical occupancy of this position is likely to be more important than the chemical property of the amino acid. This occupancy may play a role in maintaining the last β sheet. In contrast, positions 6 and 7 are Glu-specific. Change of these amino acids to other amino acids, including Asp, remarkably reduces GFP activity. These results indicate that the Glu residues at position 6 and 7 contribute not only negative charge but also specific interactions within the GFP structure. The exact structural and functional role of the Glu residues at amino acids 6 and 7 and Ile at amino acid 229 in GFP needs further study.

In this study, phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated α1BAR revealed that both epinephrine- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation predominantly occurs at serine residues of the receptor. The findings obtained with receptor mutants in which portions of the C-tail were truncated or deleted indicated that a region of 21 amino acids (393–413) of the carboxyl terminus including seven serines contains the main phosphorylation sites involved in agonist- as well as phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR. To identify the serines invoved in agonist- versus phorbol ester-dependent regulation of the receptor, two different strategies were adopted, the seven serines were either substituted with alanine or reintroduced into a mutant lacking all of them. Our findings indicate that Ser394 and Ser400 were phosphorylated following phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C, whereas Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 were phosphorylated upon stimulation of the α1BAR with epinephrine. The observation that overexpression of G protein-coupled kinase 2 (GRK2) could increase agonist-induced phosphorylation of Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410, strongly suggests that these serines are the phosphorylation sites of the α1BAR for kinases of the GRK family. Phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the Ser394 and Ser400 as well as GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410, resulted in the desensitization of α1BAR-mediated inositol phosphate response.

This study provides generalities about the biochemical mechanisms underlying homologous and heterologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors linked to the activation of phospholipase C. Desensitization is a general regulatory phenomenon of G protein-coupled receptors resulting in the attenuation of the receptor-mediated response. Two major patterns of desensitization referred to as homologous and heterologous desensitization can be distinguished. Homologous desensitization is defined as a rapid loss of responsiveness for a receptor repeatedly exposed to its specific agonist, whereas in heterologous desensitization stimulation of a receptor by an agonist can attenuate the response mediated by other receptors eliciting similar cellular effects (1Hausdorff W.P.

The second messenger-dependent cAMP-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate and desensitize the β2AR both in response to its agonist as well as to other agents increasing the cellular content of cAMP. On the other hand, a prominent role in homologous desensitization of rhodopsin and β2AR is played by the second messenger-independent rhodopsin kinase (3Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K.

Once the receptor is occupied by the agonist, it is recognized by the kinase and becomes phosphorylated. The subsequent uncoupling of the receptor and G protein is then mediated by arrestin proteins, which specifically bind to the phosphorylated receptor (5Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These protein kinases have the unique ability to recognize and phosphorylate their G protein-coupled receptor substrates predominantly in their active (i.e. agonist-occupied) conformations. Recently, we have provided evidence that the α1BAR coupled to Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C can be phosphorylated by at least two types of protein kinases, a protein kinase C (PKC) upon its stimulation by phorbol esters (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinases belonging to the GRK family once the receptor is stimulated by its agonist (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L.

The observation that agonist-induced phosphorylation of the α1BAR is insensitive to inhibitors of PKC suggests that a PKC is involved mainly in heterologous desensitization, whereas a GRK mediates agonist-induced desensitization (homologous) of the α1BAR (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sites involved in GRK-mediated phosphorylation have been unambiguously identified only for rhodopsin and more recently for the β2AR. Rhodopsin is phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1). Bothin vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the sites for GRK1-mediated phosphorylation are represented by specific serines located in the distal part of the C terminus of rhodopsin (10Palczewski K.

The phosphorylation sites for the second messenger-dependent PKC have been characterized only for a few G protein-coupled receptors, including rhodopsin (20Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10341-10344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), β2AR (21Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19957-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using site-directed mutagenesis. Recently, we have demonstrated that the sites for phorbol ester- as well as agonist-induced phosphorylation of the α1BAR are located in the C-tail of the receptor as suggested by the fact that a truncated mutant (T368) lacking the last 147 amino acids was totally impaired in its ability to undergo phophorylation (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed a large number of receptor mutants to identify the phosphorylation sites of the C-tail involved in agonist- versus phorbol ester-induced desensitization of the α1BAR. Our findings demonstrate that GRK and PKC can phosphorylate the α1BAR on different serine residues of the C-tail, triggering desensitization of the receptor-mediated response. The cDNA encoding the hamster α1BAR (23Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mutated DNA fragments obtained were digested with BssHII and ApaI and cloned into the expression vector pRK5 (24Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl.

Recombinant clones were isolated and sequenced by cycle sequencing using Exo− Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with different DNA by the DEAE-dextran method. The cDNA encoding the bovine GRK2 (25Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was subcloned in pCMV5 (26Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphorylation experiments, COS-7 cells (5 × 106) were grown in 100-mm dishes, and the transfected DNA was 1 μg/million cells for the receptors and for GRK2 3 μg/million cells. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (4 μg/million cells) under different conditions adding pCMV. For inositol phosphate determination, COS-7 cells (0.25 × 106) grown in 20-mm dishes were transfected with 0.2 μg of DNA/million cells for the receptors and 0.6 μg of DNA/million cells for GRK2. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (1 μg/million cells) under different conditions adding pCMV. COS-7 cells were harvested 48 h after their transfection. The expression of bovine GRK2 in transfected COS-7 cells was assessed as previously described (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) using an antiserum raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein encoding residues 467–688 of rat GRK3 (27Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane preparations derived from cells expressing the wild type or mutated α1BAR and ligand binding assays using [125I]HEAT were performed as described previously (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prazosin (10−6m) was used to determine nonspecific binding. [125I]HEAT concentration was 300 pm for saturation binding and 80 pm for competition binding analysis of epinephrine. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least-square regression analysis (28De Lean A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing the different α1BAR in the absence or presence of bovine GRK2 were grown in 100-mm dishes, equilibrated in phosphate-free DMEM for 2 h, and then incubated in the same buffer containing32Pi (0.2 mCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. The incubation was then continued in the presence of epinephrine (10−4m) or PMA (10−7m). Solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the receptors was as described previously (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the32P content of gel slices containing the receptor was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy and normalized to the receptor amount loaded on the gel. The portion of gel encompassing the phosphorylated receptor was excised, and the protein was extracted and hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl. After thin layer chromatography using using a HTLE 7000 electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific Company, Del Mar, CA), the phosphoamino acid content of the phosphorylated receptor was analyzed by autoradiography. For the determination of labeled total inositol phosphates, cells expressing the different receptors in the absence or presence of bovine GRK2 were grown in 20-mm dishes and labeled with [3H]inositol at 4 mCi/ml for 15–18 h in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. After labeling, cells were stimulated for 20 min with epinephrine (10−4m) in the presence of 20 mm LiCl. Inositol phosphates were extracted as described previously (23Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and separated by Dowex AG1-X8 columns. Total inositol phosphates were eluted with 1 m ammonium formate, 0.1m formic acid. Materials were DMEM and fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), [125I]HEAT (NEN Life Science Products), [3H]inositol (Anawa), Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad), epinephrine (Sigma), prazosin (Research Biochemical International), and COS-7 (American Tissue Culture Collection). We previously showed (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the carboxyl portion of the α1BAR plays a crucial role in receptor regulation. This was demonstrated by the fact that truncation of the last 147 amino acids abolished both agonist- and phorbol ester-induced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. To assess which amino acids could be acting as phosphate acceptors, we performed a phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated α1BAR immunoprecipitated from cells treated with epinephrine or PMA. As shown in Fig.1, the phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that both exposure to epinephrine and PMA results in the phosphorylation of serine, but not of threonine or tyrosine, residues of the α1BAR. To identify the amino acids of the α1BAR involved in agonist- versus phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation, we compared the phosphorylation properties of five receptor mutants: four truncated mutants T469, T412, T387, and T368, lacking the last 46, 103, 128, and 147 amino acids, respectively, and a deletion mutant (Δ393–413) missing a region of 21 amino acids (393–413) containing seven serines (Fig. 2). Ligand binding of [125I]HEAT on membranes from transfected COS-7 cells indicated that the expression levels of the different α1BARs were similar. The B maxranged from 1 to 2 pmol/mg of protein, and the K d of [125I]HEAT binding was approximately 80 pmfor all the receptors. The K i values of epinephrine ranged from 10−5 to 3 × 10−5m for all receptors (data not shown). To assess the phosphorylation properties of the receptors, the wild type α1B and mutated receptors were immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of cells expressing the α1BAR to epinephrine (10−4m) or PMA (10−7m) for 15 min resulted in a maximal increase of receptor phosphorylation of 60 and 80% above basal, respectively (Fig.3). As previously reported (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the T368 receptor mutant could not be detected as a phosphorylated protein. Similarly, the T387 mutant did not display any basal or stimulated phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, the T469 and T412 truncated receptors could be detected as phosphorylated proteins, migrating at ∼75 and ∼70 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 A). When compared with the wild type α1BAR, the T469 mutant did not display any significative difference in receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the serines located in the last 46 amino acids of the C terminus of the receptor are involved in neither agonist- nor in PMA-induced phosphorylation. In contrast, for the T412 receptor PMA-induced phosphorylation was reduced of about 30% as compared with that of the wild type receptor, whereas epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation was not significantly different (Fig. 3 B). Altogether, these results indicate that the serines involved in the phosphorylation of the α1BAR are located in two different regions of the C terminus; the first including amino acids 387–412 contains the majority of the sites for both agonist- and PMA-induced phosphorylation, whereas the second, located between residues 412 and 469, includes sites involved in part of PMA-induced phosphorylation of the α1BAR. A crucial role of serine residues located between amino acids 387 and 412 was confirmed by the results obtained with the deletion mutant Δ393–413 which was completely impaired in its ability to undergo receptor phosphorylation either upon stimulation with epinephrine or PMA (Fig. 3). We next investigated the correlation between agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the inositol phosphate (IP) response mediated by the wild type and mutated α1BAR. In our previous work, we demonstrated that overexpression of GRK2 and GRK3 enhanced both agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous findings, overexpression of GRK2 caused an inhibition of 52% of the α1BAR-mediated IP response as compared with that of the receptor expressed alone (Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of GRK2 on the receptor-mediated IP increase for the T469 and T412 receptor mutants was similar to that observed for the wild type α1BAR (Fig. 4). In contrast, the IP response mediated by the T368, T387, and Δ393–413 receptors, which cannot undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation, was not significantly decreased by overexpression of bovine GRK2 (Fig. 4). This strongly suggests that the serines located between residues 393 and 413 are involved in both GRK-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR. In a second set of experiments, we assessed the correlation between PMA-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the wild type and mutated receptors. Cells expressing the α1BAR or T368 receptor were treated with increasing concentrations of PMA for 10 min. Fig. 5 shows that at a concentration of 10−8m PMA inhibited the α1BAR-mediated response of about 45%, without any significant effect on the response mediated by the T368 mutant (Fig.5 A). However, at a concentration of 10−7m PMA could also impair the T368-mediated response, even if at a smaller extent as compared with the wild type receptor (25%versus 68% of impairment for the T368 and α1BAR, respectively). Thus, high concentrations of PMA (>10−8m) might inhibit the receptor-mediated IP response by a mechanism independent from receptor phosphorylation. This was confirmed by experiments exploring the effect of PMA on the IP response mediated by Gqα expressed in COS-7 cells following its stimulation with AlF4−. Fig. 5 shows that 10−7m PMA could inhibit the Gqα-mediated response of about 30%, whereas no significant inhibition could be observed at a concentration of 10−8m (Fig.5 A). Taken together, these results suggest that PMA can impair the α1BAR-mediated response by at least two different mechanisms, depending on its concentration. The first occurring at low PMA concentrations (10−8m) might be truly mediated by receptor phosphorylation, because it was not observed with the T368 receptor mutant lacking all the phosphorylation sites. The second, occurring at higher concentrations of PMA (>10−8m), might involve phosphorylation of other signaling proteins acting downstream of the receptor, including Gqα. On the basis of these observations, we compared the effect of a low concentration of PMA (10−8m) on the IP response mediated by different receptor mutants expressed in COS-7 cells. Fig. 5 B shows that treatment of cells with PMA (10−8m) reduced the IP response of 40% for the wild type and T469 receptors and of 30% for the T412, without any significant effect on the response mediated by the T368, T387, and Δ393–413 receptor mutants. In conclusion, the lack of phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation observed for the T368, T387, and Δ393–413 receptor mutants (Fig. 3) correlates well with the loss of PMA-mediated receptor desensitization. For the T412 mutant, PMA-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor were also closely related being both reduced as compared with the wild type α1BAR (Figs. 3 and 4). To identify the individual serine residues involved in agonist-versus phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR, we mutated all seven serines located between amino acids 393 and 413 (Ser394, Ser398, Ser400, Ser404, Ser408, Ser410, and Ser413) (Fig.2). The serine residues were substituted with alanine either individually or in different combinations as indicated in Fig.6. For all the mutant receptors theB max and the K d of [125I]HEAT as well as the K i for epinephrine binding were similar to those of the wild type α1BAR (data not shown). All the receptor mutants could mediate the epinephrine-induced IP response at a similar extent to that of the wild type α1BAR (results not shown). As indicated in Fig. 6, mutagenesis of either Ser394 or Ser400 caused a decrease of the PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation of 31 and 38%, respectively, without any significant effect on agonist-induced phosphorylation. On the other hand, substitution of either Ser404 or of the doublet Ser408-Ser410, resulted in a decrease of epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of 36 and 64%, respectively, without affecting PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation. Substitution of either Ser398 or of the doublet Ser413-Ser415 did not alter receptor phosphorylation. Finally, the substitution of all the serines located between residues 393 and 415 (S394–415A mutant) resulted in an almost complete loss of the agonist-induced phosphorylation and in a reduction of 76% of the PMA-induced phosphorylation. These findings identify, on one hand, Ser394 and Ser400 as sites of PMA-dependent phosphorylation and, on the other, Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 as sites of agonist-induced phosphorylation of the α1BAR. The fact that the mutagenesis of all the serines between amino acids 393 and 415 (S394–415A mutant) did not completely abolish PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation suggests the existence of additional sites of phosphorylation for PKC. In agreement with this finding, pretreatment of the cells expressing the S394–415A mutant with the specific PKC inhibitor RO-318220, completely abolished the residual agonist- as well as PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation (results not shown). As mentioned above, the T412 truncated mutant, but not the T469, displayed a 30% decrease of the PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This suggests that a PMA-dependent phosphorylation site is located between amino acids 413 and 469 of the α1BAR. To identify the residue which contributes to this residual phosphorylation, all the serines and threonines of the S394–415A mutant located between amino acids 415 and 469 (Ser421, Ser423, Ser425, Ser447, Ser452, and Ser465) as well as Ser369, Thr385, and Thr390, were individually mutated into alanine. None of these substitutions was able to abolish or reduce the residual PMA-induced phosphorylation of the S394–415A receptor mutant (results not shown). This might reflect the fact that the mutation of one serine or threonine can be compensated by the phosphorylation of another. To further characterize the role of individual serines in the phosphorylation of the α1BAR, serines 394, 398, 400, 404, 408, 410, 413, and 415 were reintroduced individually or in combination in the S394–415A mutant, which lacks all of them. As shown in Fig. 6, the epinephrine- and PMA-induced phosphorylation of the S394–415A mutant was only 12 and 24% of that of the wild type α1BAR, respectively. Reintroduction of Ser394(S394i) or Ser400 (S400i) restored the PMA-, but not agonist-induced phosphorylation of the S394–415A mutant to 64 and 71% of that of the the wild type α1BAR, respectively. The effect of Ser394 and Ser400 seemed to be additive as demonstrated by the fact that reintroduction of both (S394i/S400i) almost completely restored the PMA-dependent phosphorylation of the S394–415A mutant to the level of the wild type α1BAR. The individual or combined reintroduction of Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 (S404i, S408i, S410i, S408i/S410i, and S404i/S408i/S410i) did not have any effect on the phosphorylation of the Ser394–415A mutant induced by PMA, but could restore that induced by epinephrine. In particular, reintoduction of Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 increased the phosphorylation of the S394–415A mutant to levels ranging from 41 to 46% of that of the wild type α1BAR. The role of these serines in epinephrine-induced phosphorylation is additive as demonstrated by the fact that for the mutant S408i/S410i and S404i/S408i/S410i, the epinephrine-induced phosphorylation was 66 and 94% of that of the wild type α1BAR, respectively. To investigate whether serines 404, 408, and 410 could be substrates of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the α1BAR, the wild type as well as the S404i, S408i/S410i and S404i/S408i/S410i receptors, carrying serines involved in agonist-induced phosphorylation, were coexpressed with bovine GRK2 in COS-7 cells. Overexpression of GRK2 significantly increased epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of the α1BAR as well as that of the S404i, S408i/S410i, and S404i/S408i/S410i receptors as compared with that of the receptors expressed alone (Fig.7). These findings indicate that these three serines might be independently phosphorylated by GRK2 following stimulation of the receptor with the agonist. Since the level of epinephrine-induced phosphorylation of the S404i/S408i/S410i mutant was comparable to that of the wild type α1BAR either in the absence or presence of GRK2, it is likely that Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 represent the only sites for agonist-induced phosphorylation which can be mediated by GRK2. As shown in Fig. 8, overexpression of GRK2 in COS-7 cells decreased the α1BAR-mediated IP response by 52% as compared with that of the receptor expressed alone, without any significant effect on the response mediated by the T368 and S394–415A receptor mutants, which were impaired in agonist-induced phosphorylation. However, overepression of GRK2 could reduce the IP response mediated by the S404i, S408i, and S410i mutants of about 30–35% and that mediated by the S404i/S408i/S410i receptor of 49%. On the other hand, the IP response mediated by receptors carrying Ser394 (S394i) and Ser400 (S400i) was insensitive to the overexpression of GRK2. Altogether, these findings provide strong evidence that Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410, confer to the α1BAR the ability to undergo both GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization. To assess whether the PMA-induced phosphorylation of Ser394and Ser400 induced by PMA could impair the α1BAR-mediated IP response, cells expressing wild type α1BAR or different mutated receptors were treated with low concentration of PMA (10−8m) for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 9, in cells treated with PMA (10−8m) the IP response mediated by the α1BAR was inhibited by 45%. On the other hand, that mediated by the S394–415A mutant, which was impaired in its ability to undergo PMA-induced phosphorylation, was inhibited by 15%. The individual or combined reintroduction of serines 394 or 400 in the S394–415A mutant could restore the inhibitory effect of PMA on the receptor-mediated IP response (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the reintroduction of Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 did not confer any sensitivity of the receptor mutant to PMA (Fig. 9). The fact that the IP response mediated by the S394–415A mutant was still impaired by 15% by PMA as compared with that of the T368 mutant is in agreement with the previous observation that the Ser394–415A mutant displayed a small level of PMA-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Altogether these findings provide strong evidence that Ser394 and Ser400 mediate a large portion of the PMA-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR. In the absence of any stimulus, the α1BAR expressed in COS-7 cells, HEK293 (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), or Rat-1 cells (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) displays a basal level of phosphorylation which is approximately similar in the different cell systems expressing the recombinant receptor. Treatement of cells with the PKC inhibitor RO318220 did not significantly decrease the basal level of receptor phosphorylation (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, for several of the α1BAR mutants described in this study the basal level of phosphorylation was clearly lower than that of the wild type α1BAR (Fig. 6). In general, mutations of one or two serines included in the sequence 393–413 resulted in a decrease of basal phosphorylation ranging from 13 to 30% as compared with the wild type α1BAR (Fig. 6). On the other hand, mutation of all the serines (S394–415A mutant) (Fig. 6) or their removal in mutants T368, T387, and Δ393–413 (Fig.3) dramatically reduced the basal level of receptor phosphorylation. The reintroduction of any of the serines included in the sequence 393–413 into the S394–415A mutant lacking all of them could restore basal phosphorylation to levels ranging from 20 to 64% that of the wild type α1BAR (Fig. 6). Altogether, these findings indicate that in the α1BAR different serines of the C-tail might be phosphorylated under basal conditions. However, there seems to be no clear relationship between the role of distinct serines in maintaining basal phosphorylation and their involvement in agonist- or phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. In addition, whether the basal phosphorylation of the α1BAR has any functional correlate remains to be explored. In our experiments, the mutation of different serines did not result in any significant change in either basal or agonist-induced IP response of the mutated receptor as compared with the wild type under the experimental conditions used in this study (results not shown). In this study we provide strong evidences that GRK and PKC can phosphorylate different subsets of serines in the C-tail of the α1BAR. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified a first cluster of two serines (Ser394 and Ser400) phosphorylated following PMA-induced activation of PKC from a second cluster of three serines (Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410) phosphorylated upon agonist-induced stimulation of the α1BAR. The phosphorylation of these two clusters of serines by PKC and GRK2, respectively, resulted in desensitization of the α1BAR. We recently demonstrated the involvement of GRK2 and GRK3 in agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the α1BAR (9Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 as the phosphorylation sites involved in GRK2-induced desensitization (Fig. 6). This was mainly demonstrated by two observations. First, receptor phosphorylation was reduced 36 and 64% by the mutation of Ser404 alone and by that of Ser408 and Ser410 in combination, respectively (Fig. 6). Second, the reintroduction of all the three serines in a receptor mutant lacking all of them (S394–415A mutant) could almost completely restore agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. Since the extent of receptor phosphorylation correlated with the number of serines reintroduced, it seems that Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 can be phosphorylated independently following agonist stimulation of the receptor. Overexpression of GRK2 was able to specifically increase agonist-induced phosphorylation of those receptor mutants carrying Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 individually or in different combinations (Fig. 7). This argues for a nonsequential mechanism of receptor phosphorylation by GRK2. The fact that Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 are in proximity of a pair of acidic amino acids (Fig. 2) is in agreement with the notion that both GRK1 and GRK2 are acidotropic kinases (29Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rhodopsin and the β2AR possess a doublet of negatively charged residues located on the proximal side of the residue phosphorylated by GRK1 and GRK2, respectively. The N-formyl peptide receptor (for which the GRK2 phosphorylation sites have been deduced from in vitrostudies using a fusion protein corresponding to the whole C-tail) as well as the α2AAR (for which the sites for GRK2 phosphorylation have been proposed on the basis of mutagenesis studies) also possess a doublet of acidic amino acids in proximity to the phosphorylated residues (17Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, substitution of the two acidic residues with alanine seems to strongly reduce GRK2-induced phosphorylation of the N-formyl peptide receptor (18Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For rhodopsin (12Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the N-formyl peptide receptor (18Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as well as the C5a receptor (19Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), GRK-mediated phosphorylation seems to proceed sequentially. On the contrary, our findings suggest that GRK2 can phosphorylate Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 of the α1BAR independently (Fig. 6). Similar results were reported for the α2AAR, for which phosphorylation of four consecutive serines in the third intracellular loop seems to occur nonsequentially as demonstrated by the fact that mutation to alanine of any single serine reduced the extent of phosphorylation by about 25% (17Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the sequential or nonsequential nature of GRK phosphorylation can vary depending on the receptor substrate and could be dictated by the structural or conformational properties of the phosphorylation site. Our findings provide strong evidence that GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser404, Ser408, and Ser410 might trigger the desensitization of the α1BAR. This is supported by the fact that the combined mutation of these three serines (S394–415A mutant) impaired the receptor's ability to undergo GRK2-mediated receptor desensitization (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the reintroduction of any of these serines in the S394–415A mutant, lacking all of them, partially restored the GRK2-induced receptor desensitization (Fig. 8). Indeed, the presence of one of the three serines is sufficient to confer to the receptor some ability to undergo partial desensitization. Our finding identify Ser394 and Ser400 as the main phosphorylation sites of the α1BAR for PKC. This was demonstrated by the observation that mutation of either Ser394 or Ser400 reduced PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation, whereas the reintroduction of Ser394 and Ser400in the S394–415A mutant, lacking both of them, could restore receptor phosphorylation to the levels observed in the wild type α1BAR (Fig. 6). A large number of proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC (30Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Among the sites phosphorylated by PKC, the most recurrent motif is (S/T)X(K/R) (30Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), where X indicates any amino acid. Of the two PMA phosphorylation sites identified in the C-tail of the α1BAR, Ser400 is a classical phosphorylation site (SRK) for PKC (Fig. 2), while Ser394is included in the motif RXXSXXR, which is a less commun consensus site. In addition to Ser394 and Ser400, a third site seems to be phosphorylated upon stimulation of cells expressing the α1BAR with PMA. This is demonstrated by two findings. First, the Ser394–415A mutant lacking both Ser394 and Ser400 retained a small level of PMA-induced phosphorylation, which was 24% that of the wild type α1BAR. Second, the truncated receptor T412, in which both Ser394 and Ser400 are conserved, displayed a 30% decrease of PMA-induced phosphorylation. However, using site-directed mutagenesis, we were unable to identify the amino acid residues involved in this residual PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the α1BAR. The cellular response mediated by most G protein-coupled receptors, linked to the activation of phospholipase C, has been shown to desensitize rapidly following phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC. Moreover, for many receptors, including the α1BAR (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the M3-mAchR (31Klueppelberg U.G. Gates L.K. Gorelick F.S. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2403-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the receptor of thrombin (32Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the CCK receptor (31Klueppelberg U.G. Gates L.K. Gorelick F.S. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the activation of PKC by phorbol ester can increase receptor phosphorylation. However, a clear demonstration for a direct causal relationship between PKC-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization is still missing for many G protein-coupled receptors. In this study we provide evidence that PKC-mediated desensitization of the α1BAR results, at least in part, from receptor phosphorylation. This was demonstrated by three main observations: (a) the individual mutation of both Ser394 and Ser400 partially impaired PMA-induced desensitization, (b) the reintroduction of either Ser394 or Ser400 in the S394–415A mutant lacking both of them could restore PMA-induced receptor desensitization, and (c) the S394–415A mutant still retained its ability to undergo PMA-induced phosphorylation and desensitization, even if at a smaller extent as compared with the wild type α1BAR. Similar evidence for a causal relationship between PKC-induced phosphorylation and desensitization has been provided for the 5-HT1A (34Lembo P.M. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar) and NK2 (33Alblas J. van Etten I. Khanum A. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) receptors. However, our findings indicate that, in addition to receptor phosphorylation, other mechanisms might underlie PMA-induced desensitization of the α1BAR. Low concentrations of PMA (10−8m) could exclusively desensitize the wild type α1BAR-mediated IP response (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, concentrations higher then 10−8m could impair the IP response mediated by the T368 receptor, which could not undergo phosphorylation, as well as by Gqα upon its stimulation with AlF4−(Fig. 5 A). Thus, PKC-mediated desensitization of G protein-coupled receptor linked to phospholipase C might involve phosphorylation of both receptors and other signaling proteins including Gqα. Our findings are in agreement with recent work showing that PKC-mediated desensitization of the receptor for platelet-activating factor involves both phosphorylation of the receptor and that of the phospholipase C β3 (35Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our study has several implications. First it provides strong evidence that both GRK2- and PKC-mediated desensitization of the α1BAR might result from the phosphorylation of distinct serines in the C-tail of the receptor. Second, it contributes to the elucidation of the consensus sites for the phosphorylation mediated by kinases of the GRK family. Finally, it might provide generalities about the biochemical mechanisms involved in homologous and heterologous regulation of G protein-coupled receptors linked to the activation of phospholipase C."

In addition to regulation by phosphorylation and association with Cdk inhibitors, the cyclin-Cdk complexes are subject to a more irrevocable form of regulation, i.e. the degradation of cyclin via the cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway (4Glotzer M.

These three proteins can form a large complex whose function is required for the metaphase to anaphase transition (12Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Many of the genes encoding tetratricopeptide proteins have been reported to functionally interact with members of the WD repeat family (13Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have demonstrated that other cell cycle-regulated proteins undergo proteolysis at defined cell cycle stages, and that proteins other than cyclins must be degraded to allow the metaphase to anaphase transition (6Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 7King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W.

Centromereprotein (CENP)-E and CENP-F are mammalian kinetochore localized proteins whose expression peaks at mitosis, exhibit dynamic changes in their localization at different mitotic stages, and are rapidly degraded after mitosis (15Brown K.D.

In Aspergillus nidulans mitotic exit apparently requires the destruction of the cell cycle-regulated NIMA protein kinase (17Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and inDrosophila the separation of sister chromatids has been reported to require the product of the pimples gene, a protein that is degraded after the metaphase-anaphase transition (18Stratmann R.

Most of these proteins do not have the cyclin destruction box motif, which targets the A and B type cyclins for destruction (4Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Goetsch L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1974; 38: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cdc20p is required for modulation of microtubule structure, either by altering the surface of microtubules or by promoting disassembly (20Sethi N. Monteagudo M.C.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fzy mutants have demonstrated that the failure to degrade cyclins A and B, and the failure of sister chromatids to separate, is due to a lack of functional Fizzy (Fzy) protein (21Dawson I.A.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The high degree of homology between p55Cdc, Fzy, Cdc20p, and slp1 protein, as well as their essential role in cell cycle, has prompted the proposal that they are orthologous members of a gene family within the highly degenerate WD repeat superfamily (21Dawson I.A.

Mammalian p55Cdc exhibits several properties that are consistent with its role in the cell cycle. p55Cdc, not expressed in differentiated or quiescent cells, is readily detectable in dividing cells. p55Cdc appears to be essential for cell division, since transfection of antisense p55Cdc cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells results in isolation of only those cells that exhibit a compensatory increase in p55Cdc transcripts in the sense orientation (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Immune complexes of p55Cdc exhibited a protein kinase activity that was higher in actively proliferating cells than in quiescent cells and fluctuated with the cell cycle. Overexpression of p55Cdc in myeloid cells inhibited granulocytic differentiation and accelerated apoptosis, suggesting that p55Cdc regulation is critical for normal cell cycle control during myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation (26Kao C.T. Lin M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Weinstein J. Sakamoto K.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1221-1229PubMed Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to examine the expression, phosphorylation, degradation, and localization of p55Cdc at different stages of the mammalian cell cycle. The mitotic Cdk, p34 cdc2, was analyzed in parallel and served as an additional control in the course of this work. Pulse labeling experiments with 35S or32P showed that both the biosynthesis and phosphorylation of p55Cdc were low at G1 and peaked at G2, with a significant drop in phosphorylation during the G2 to M transition. Immunecomplexes, obtained from different cell cycle stages and subcellular fractions, showed distinct p55Cdc-associated proteins. A steady accumulation of p55Cdc during the course of the cell cycle culminated in rapid loss at the M to G1 transition. This loss could only be prevented by a 26 S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that p55Cdc may be another cell cycle protein to be degraded by the cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway. Localization of p55Cdc by indirect immunofluorescence displayed dynamic changes during mitosis, from the centromeres at prometaphase, mitotic spindle in metaphase, to the spindle equator in anaphase. These observations indicate a role for p55Cdc in G2 and/or M. HeLa and IMR-90 cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium or minimum essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of S (G1/S) by the double thymidine/aphidicolin block (27Heintz N. Sive H.L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). S phase cells were harvested 4 h, G2 cells were harvested 8 h, and mitotic cells were obtained by shake off 10–11 h following release from the aphidicolin block. The remaining adherent monolayer was the late G2population. To obtain a G1 population, the nonadherent pseudo-mitotic (G2/M) cells collected following 12–14 h of nocodazole treatment (0.1 μg/ml) were washed and replated in media without nocodazole. Approximately 60% of these cells had completed mitosis 2 h later, and the daughter cells had adhered to the plates by 3 h. At this stage, the nonadherent cells were rinsed off. The cells were used for G1 analysis 4–8 h following replating. To obtain cells at the M/G1 transition, pseudo-mitotic cells were harvested 7 h after nocodazole treatment. The washed cells were replated in media without drugs (carrier dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO), or with media containing the following additions: 50 μm N-acetylleucylnorleucinal (LLnL), 50 μg/ml (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester (E64d), 0.1 μg/ml staurosporine, or 5 μg/ml dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB), (Sigma Chemical Co). Following a 2.5-h incubation, the cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometer (DNA QC Particles kit, Becton Dickinson), and for p55Cdc, cyclin B, and p34 cdc2 by Western analysis. An identical analysis was performed on cells that had been treated for 15 h with 5 μg/ml aphidicolin to obtain a population of cells accumulated in G1 and S phase. IMR-90 cells were arrested in G0 by growing the cells for 3 days in low serum (0.5%). The quiescent cells were activated by addition of 20% serum to the media, and the 35S-labeled cells were harvested at 4 h intervals following activation. Cells were preincubated with methionine- and cysteine-free media containing 5% dialyzed serum for 30 min, followed by 1 h in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). The media for the 0 time point contained only 0.5% dialyzed serum. 32P labeling was done for 1 h after a 30-min incubation in phosphate-deficient medium containing 5% dialyzed serum. The label32Pi (ICN Biomedicals) was present at a concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml. Subcellular fractions were obtained by lysing the cells in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 100 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) after a quick rinse in cold distilled water. All protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. The cells were left on ice for 30 min with intermittent swirling and then scraped off the plates with a cell scraper. The nuclei were pelleted by a 1000 × g spin in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min. The supernatant was separated into S100 (cytosol) and P100 (particulate) fractions by spinning for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The nuclear and P100 pellets were resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, described previously (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nonidet P-40 and NaCl were added to the S100 fraction to make its composition closer to the other two fractions. The resuspended P100 and nuclear fractions were spun for 30 min at 20,000 × gto obtain a clarified lysate for immunoprecipitation experiments. Preparation of a total cell lysate has been described previously (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All lysates were stored at −80 °C until needed. The preparation of the antibody against a glutathioneS-transferase-p55Cdc fusion construct has been described (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies were generated against the carboxyl-terminal end of p55Cdc (CKSSLIHQGIR), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin antigen. Antisera were affinity-purified by passage through a Sulfolink (Pierce) column to which the peptide had been coupled. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS, and the affinity-purified antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, into tubes containing 1 m Tris, pH 8. The pH of the pooled fractions was adjusted to neutral, and they were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated with the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). The protocol for immunoprecipitations has been described (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The concentration of antibody was increased to 5 μg/100 μg of lysate for the glutathioneS-transferase-p55Cdc fusion protein antibody and to 15 μg/100 μg of lysate for the carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody. The concentration of the control adsorbed antisera was always 5–10-fold higher than that of the affinity-purified antibodies. Antibodies to p34 cdc2 (monoclonal antibody 17), cyclin A (BF683), cyclin E (E-19), and goat polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of human lamin B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The monoclonal antibody to human cyclin B1 (GNS-1) was purchased from Pharmingen, and the monoclonal antibody to human lactate dehydrogenase was from Sigma. The band intensity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Total cell lysates were prepared in 1.5 × SDS sample loading buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 106 cells/0.15 ml. The subcellular fractions were prepared exactly as described above, except that the S100 fraction was concentrated so that normalization was by cell number for all three fractions. The proteins were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.) for 2 h at 80 mA with the Pharmacia Multiphor II apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The transferred proteins were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp). For indirect immunofluorescence experiments, an asynchronous population of HeLa cells was fixed in −20 °C methanol, 2 mm EGTA for 10 min, blocked, and permeabilized for 7 min in PBS containing 5% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 and rinsed briefly in PBS, 0.1% BSA. The cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml p55Cdc affinity-purified antibody and 1/50 dilution of β-tubulin monoclonal antibody from Amersham Corp. or 50 μg/ml control adsorbed antisera for 75 min. The slides were washed twice in PBS, 0.1% BSA and blocked again with 5% donkey serum in PBS. Incubation with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (1/400 diluted Cy3 conjugated to AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti rabbit IgG, 1/100 diluted FITC-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′) fragment donkey anti rabbit IgG and 1/100 diluted FITC-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) was for 1 h. Slides were washed twice in PBS, 0.1% BSA and once in PBS containing 2.5 μg/ml Hoescht 33342 (Molecular Probes). The slides were rinsed in distilled water and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Results were observed under fluorescence with a Nikon Microphot-FXA equipped with a Plan Apo 50× oil immersion lens (Nikon Inc). Cells at various mitotic stages were photographed under identical conditions with the appropriate filters. All experiments were performed reproducibly at least twice. Previous work demonstrated that p55Cdc expression was readily detectable in a rapidly proliferating, but not quiescent population of Rat1 fibroblasts (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To identify the stage of the cell cycle at which p55Cdc expression is initiated, a normal diploid untransformed human fibroblast cell line was examined. IMR-90 cells were arrested at G0 by serum starvation and induced to enter the cell cycle by the addition of 20% serum to the medium. IMR-90 cells enter S phase 16 h following serum stimulation and show peak DNA synthesis at 24 h (29Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Lukas J. Baldin V. Ansorge W. Bartek J. Draetta G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). At 4-h intervals following serum activation the cells were labeled with 35S and immunoprecipitated with p55Cdc antibody or p34 cdc2 antibody for comparison. The results in Fig. 1 show the appearance of p55Cdc 16 h following growth stimulation and a barely detectable band at 12 h, coincidental with the biosynthesis of p34 cdc2 . The p34 cdc2 immunoprecipitates consistently show a band of slightly higher mobility than p55Cdc, which could be due to cyclin A. At 24 h both p55Cdc and p34 cdc2 synthesis were still increasing. Activation of p34 cdc2 synthesis has been shown to occur at the G1/S transition (30Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Spurr N.K Nurse P. Nature. 1988; 333: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3093-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Furukawa Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Ernst T.J. Kanakura Y. Griffin J.D. Science. 1990; 250: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine the half-life of p55Cdc, an asynchronous population of HeLa cells was labeled for 1 h with35S and total cell lysates or subcellular fractions were prepared after 0, 1, 2, 6, or 21 h of chase. Lanes 3,5, 7, 9, and 12 in Fig.2 a show the amount of p55Cdc at 0, 1, 2, 6, and 21 h following the labeling pulse. PhosphorImager analysis revealed the half-life of p55Cdc to be 2 h, followed by a slower loss so that 35% of the label remained with p55Cdc at 6 h (data not shown). p34 cdc2 (Fig.2 a, lanes 2, 4, 6,8, and 10) showed no significant loss of radioactivity over the time course of the experiment but showed a conversion to the slower mobility phosphorylated forms over time. This result is generally in agreement with the reported long half-life of 18 h for this protein (31Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3093-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PhosphorImager analysis of the half-life of p55Cdc at different subcellular locations showed it to be unique for each site. Comparison of p55Cdc detection of the S100 fraction (Fig. 2 b, lanes 3, 5,7, 9, and 12) showed the half-life in this fraction to be approximately 1 h. The P100 fraction had a half-life of 6 h (Fig. 2 c), while the nuclear fraction still retained 70% of its radioactivity at this time (Fig.2 d). Apparently, the newly synthesized p55Cdc was rapidly degraded or transferred from the cytosol to the cytoskeletal membranes and nucleus, where it had a longer half-life. Interestingly, p34 cdc2 showed a steadily increasing accumulation over time in the P100 (Fig. 2 c, lanes 2, 4,6, 8, and 10) and nuclear (Fig.2 d, lanes 2, 4, 6,8, and 10) fractions of the slower mobility hyperphosphorylated form while the cytosol fraction (Fig.2 b) showed a steady loss of the high mobility form. This would be consistent with the phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 prior to or immediately following nuclear entry. To analyze the cell cycle-regulated expression, distribution and phosphorylation status of p55Cdc, HeLa cells were synchronized and labeled at various stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 3 a). At indicated times, the cells were solubilized and the lysates immunoprecipitated. Since p55Cdc is known to be associated with protein kinase(s) activity, which fluctuates with the cell cycle (19Weinstein J. Jacobsen F.W. Hsu-Chen J. Wu T. Baum L.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3350-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and partitions to different subcellular locations, 2J. Weinstein, unpublished observations. it would be of interest to observe p55Cdc immune complexes from the cytosol (S100), particulate (P100), and nuclear fractions. Biosynthesis of p55Cdc in HeLa cells was detectable in G1 and increased steadily through the cell cycle to peak at G2 (Fig. 3, band c). The regulation of p55Cdc biosynthesis was similar to that of p34 cdc2, being very low at G1 and peaking at G2. The p55Cdc immunoprecipitates showed the presence of a 100-kDa protein in the P100 and nuclear fractions through the entire cell cycle. The p34 cdc2 immunoprecipitates showed a faint band that appeared to comigrate with p55Cdc and could be due to cyclin A and/or B. A 10-fold increase in the rate of p34 cdc2 synthesis has been observed as HeLa cells progress from G1 to G2 (33McGowan C.H. Russel P. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3847-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the bulk of newly synthesized p34 cdc2 was found in the S100 fraction, p55Cdc had the highest relative concentration in the P100 fraction (Fig. 3 c) and this pattern did not change with the cell cycle. As expected, the nuclear p34 cdc2 in the G2 samples was primarily the slower mobility (inactive) form, while that in the S100 and P100 fraction of mitotic cells (Fig. 3 b) was of the faster mobility (active) form. The results of labeling HeLa cells with 32P for 1 h at different stages of the cell cycle are shown in Fig.4. The late G2 cells represent the adherent monolayer after the mitotic cells have been harvested by repeated pipetting. This population also has cells that have already exited mitosis and entered G1. p55Cdc phosphorylation is undetectable in any of the fractions obtained from a G1 population of cells, followed by progressive increase in phosphorylation of p55Cdc as the cells proceed from G1 to G2. The p55Cdc immunoprecipitates from P100 fractions (Fig.4 b, lanes 2 and 3) contain a unidentified band of 35 kDa that co-migrates with the slower mobility form of p34 cdc2, and is undetectable in the mitotic P100 fraction. The S100 fractions (Fig. 4 a, lanes 2and 3) showed a diffuse band at longer exposures (data not shown), which could represent different phosphorylated forms of p55Cdc. Immune complexes obtained from the nuclear fraction with antibody against glutathione S-transferase-p55Cdc fusion protein (Fig. 4 c, lane 2) also showed a slower migrating band around 58 kDa that was not detected by the p55Cdc COOH-terminal antibody (Fig. 4 c, lane 3). Since the nuclear membrane has disintegrated in the mitotic cells, only the S100 and P100 fractions were obtained. The mitotic S100 fraction showed a unique profile of p55Cdc-associated phosphorylated proteins in the immune complex, including the appearance of proteins of 72 and 140 kDa. The same profile was obtained by two different antibodies to p55Cdc (Fig.4 a, lanes 2 and 3). The rate of p34 cdc2 phosphorylation in the various subcellular fractions from different stages in the cell cycle (Fig. 4, a,b, and c, lane 4) paralleled that of p55Cdc, although unlike p55Cdc, phosphorylated p34 cdc2 was detectable during G1. Enhancement in the rate of p34 cdc2 phosphorylation at G2 has been observed previously (34Draetta G. Beach D. Cell. 1988; 54: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The data obtained in Fig. 4 were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Except for the late G2 population, both proteins exhibit the highest concentration of phosphorylated protein in the P100 fraction. This is noteworthy since 35S labeling detected most p34 cdc2 in the cytosol fraction and similar results were obtained for the distribution of p34 cdc2 in the various subcellular fractions (Fig. 6,lanes 1–3), although longer exposure showed detectable low mobility form of p34 cdc2 in the membrane fraction (data not shown). Thus, the p34 cdc2 associated with cell membranes must be in a highly phosphorylated state. This is consistent with the report that myt1, the inhibitory kinase that phosphorylates p34 cdc2 on both threonine 14 and tyrosine 15, is a membrane-associated kinase (35Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar,36Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17:"
https://openalex.org/W2137801310,"We have isolated a cDNA clone coding for a birch pollen allergen, Bet v 4. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bet v 4 contained two typical EF-hand calcium-binding domains. Sequence similarities of Bet v 4 to calmodulin are primarily confined to the calcium-binding domains. However, significant sequence similarities extending outside the Ca2+-binding sites were found with a recently described group of pollen-specific allergens of Brassica and Bermuda grass. Both EF-hand domains of Bet v 4 are able to bind Ca2+, as demonstrated by45Ca2+ blot overlay of wild type and calcium-binding deficient mutants of Bet v 4. Among pollen-allergic patients, protein-bound Ca2+ was not an absolute requirement for IgE recognition of Bet v 4. However, disruption of the carboxyl-terminal Ca2+-binding domain indicated that most IgE antibodies from allergic patients are directed against this site. IgE inhibition experiments suggested that Bet v 4 represents a highly cross-reactive pollen allergen. Pre-absorption of allergic sera with Bet v 4 drastically reduced IgE binding to proteins of similar molecular weight in pollen extracts from distantly related plant species (e.g. timothy grass, mugwort, lily) but not in extracts from plant-derived foodstuff. To test for a possible biological role in pollen germination and tube growth, we introduced recombinant Bet v 4 protein into growing lily pollen tubes by iontophoresis. As a result, cytoplasmic streaming stopped in the vicinity of the electrode tip, and a slight depolarization of the membrane voltage was measured. These effects were not observed with Ca2+-binding deficient mutants of Bet v 4. Thus, Bet v 4 and homologous proteins represent a new class of pollen-specific Ca2+-binding allergens that may have a physiological role as inhibitors of cytoplasmic streaming in outgrowing pollen tubes.

Atopic allergies, which comprise a wide range of IgE-mediated disorders such as hay fever, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies, affect 12–20% of the population. Pollen originating from trees, grasses, and weeds are among the most important sources of airborne allergens and are associated with seasonal patterns of allergic diseases. In addition, the patterns of sensitization of the human population are precisely related to the geographic distribution of the plants. Thus, during springtime in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere, pollen grains from trees of the order Fagales (birch, hazel, alder, hornbeam, and oak) become the main source of allergens (1D'Amato G. Spieksma F.T.M. Bonini S. Allergenic Pollen and Pollinosis in Europe. Blackwell, Oxford1991Google Scholar). Aqueous extracts of birch (Betula verrucosa) pollen and related species contain a complex mixture of proteins. Approximately 40 distinct proteins are easily released from the pollen grains upon hydration, but several studies showed that only some of these proteins (approximately 10–12) are recognized by IgE from allergic individuals (2Viander M. Fräki J. Djupsund B.M. Laine S. Allergy (Cph.). 1979; 34: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Jarolim E. Rumpold H. Endler A.T. Ebner H. Breitenbach M. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Allergy (Cph.). 1989; 44: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Presently, cDNA clones coding for three of these birch pollen allergens have been isolated and characterized, all showing sequence similarities to known proteins as follows: Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen showed significant sequence similarity to a group of plant pathogenesis-related proteins (4Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A. Valenta R. Kraft D. Rumpold H. Scheiner O. Breitenbach M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar); Bet v 2 was identified as the actin-binding protein profilin (5Valenta R. Duchene M. Ebner C. Valent P. Sillaber C. Deviller P. Ferreira F. Tejkl M. Edelmann H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 365-374Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar); and Bet v 3 was found to belong to a novel class of calcium-binding proteins (6Seiberler S. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Lonsdale D. Valenta R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to homology to pathogenesis-related proteins, Bet v 1 shows high sequence similarity to the major pollen allergens from alder (Alnus glutinosa) Aln g 1 (7Breiteneder H. Ferreira F. Reikerstorfer A. Duchene M. Valenta R. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Ebner C. Breitenbach M. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 90: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), from hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) Car b 1 (8Larsen J.N. Ströman P. Ipsen H. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and from hazel (Corylus avellana) Cor a 1 (9Breiteneder H. Ferreira F.D. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Ebner C. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the clinical observation that patients displaying specific IgE to Bet v 1 also show symptoms during the flowering season of hazel and other trees belonging to the order Fagales (10Dirksen A. Østerballe O. Allergy (Cph.). 1978; 33: 299-309PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, profilin (Bet v 2) was shown to be an allergen in pollens of trees, grasses, and weeds (5Valenta R. Duchene M. Ebner C. Valent P. Sillaber C. Deviller P. Ferreira F. Tejkl M. Edelmann H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 365-374Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar), which helped to explain why some patients suffer from allergic symptoms throughout the pollen season. Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 homologous proteins were also detected in various plant-derived foodstuffs (11Ebner C. Hirschwehr R. Bauer L. Breiteneder H. Valenta R. Ebner H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 962-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12Vanek-Krebitz M. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Laimer da Camera Machado M. Susani M. Ebner C.

Kraft D. Scheiner O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) providing an explanation for the clinical observation that birch pollen-allergic patients frequently display an intolerance to a variety of fruits and vegetables (14Eriksson N.E. Formgren H. Svenonius E. Allergy (Cph.). 1982; 37: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Loewenstein H. Eriksson N.E. Allergy (Cph.). 1983; 38: 162-172Google Scholar, 16Van Ree E. Aalberse R.C. J. Clin. Immunoassay. 1993; 16: 124-130Google Scholar). Similar cross-reactivities were described for other allergen sources like grass pollen, mites, and animal dander. For example, albumin seems to be a common allergen responsible for cross-reactivity in dog and cat allergies as well as allergies to other mammalian allergen sources (17Spitzauer S. Pandjaitan B. Söregi M.D. Mühl S. Ebner C. Kraft D. Valenta R. Rumpold H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 951-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the relatively large number of allergens, a picture is now emerging that outlines extensive IgE cross-reactivities between homologous allergens that are present in various (sometimes unrelated) allergen sources. Based on these studies, it had been proposed that a reasonable number of recombinant allergens bearing most IgE epitopes can be established to be used for diagnosis and therapy of atopic allergies (18Valenta R. Kraft D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A major advantage of this approach would be that large amounts of pure, well characterized molecules would be available permitting the precise definition of the allergen profile (allergogram) for each patient. Based on the individual IgE reactivity profile, a panel of allergens can then be selected for allergen-specific immunotherapy. Taking all this into consideration, the characterization of allergens with respect to their occurrence and IgE binding properties might help in the development of adequate tools for diagnosis and therapy of type I allergic diseases. In this paper we describe the isolation of a cDNA coding for a novel birch pollen allergen that we designated Bet v 4. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bet v 4 showed sequence similarity to calcium-binding proteins like troponin C and calmodulin, but the similarity is basically confined to the region of the EF-hand calcium-binding domain of these proteins. Using purified recombinant Bet v 4 in IgE inhibition experiments, we could demonstrate that Bet v 4 represents a cross-reactive component in tree, grass, and weed pollen allergies. We have also performed experiments to evaluate the influence of protein-bound calcium on IgE binding properties of Bet v 4. In addition, experiments were carried out to evaluate a possible biological function of Bet v 4 in the control of calcium metabolism during pollen germination and pollen tube growth. Patients allergic to birch pollen, timothy grass pollen, and mugwort pollen were selected according to typical case history, positive skin prick test, and radioallergosorbent test classes >3.5. A serum pool from non-allergic (case history, skin prick test, radioallergosorbent test) healthy donors (NHS) 1The abbreviations used are: NHS, normal human serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; rBet v 4, recombinant Bet v 4; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; bp, base pair; Bicine,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. was used as control. Sera were stored at −20 °C. Total RNA was isolated from mature birch (B. verrucosa) pollen (Allergon AB, Engelholm, Sweden) as previously described (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Poly(A)+ was selected using oligo(dT)-magnetizable particles (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used with 3 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA for the first strand cDNA synthesis. DNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and RNase H were employed for the second strand synthesis (20Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). The double-stranded cDNAs were then cloned into the lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After in vitro packaging with the Gigapack Cloning Kit (Stratagene), the library was amplified once onEscherichia coli strain XL-1 blue. The amplified library was screened with serum IgE from a birch pollen-allergic patient. Bound IgE was detected using 125I-rabbit anti-human IgE (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Isolated immunopositive phage clones were treated according to the in vivo excision protocol for subcloning into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). cDNA inserts were sequenced according to the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was performed using standard procedures (22$$Google Scholar). Poly(A)+-enriched RNA from different plant tissues was separated on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (Stratagene), and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. Gel-purified Bet v 4 cDNA was32P-labeled according to Ref. 23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar. The membrane was washed at 55 °C in 5 × SSPE (SSPE, 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS and then used for autoradiography. Expression plasmid containing the Bet v 4 cDNA was constructed in the vector pMW175 (24Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) which is based on the original pET vectors (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The complete coding sequence of Bet v 4 was modified by adding anNcoI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end by PCR. The following primers were used: 5′GAGACCATGGCTGATGATCATCCA3′ (NcoI primer,NcoI site underlined), 5′GAGAGAATTCTTAAAATATCTTGGCAACATC3′ (EcoRI primer, EcoRI site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and EcoRI, ligated to the respective sites of the pMW175 expression vector, and sequenced according to Ref. 21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar. For expression of the pMW175/Bet v 4 plasmid, competent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed and selected on plates containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). A single transformant colony was picked and grown to an A 600 of 1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and incubation was continued for 6 h at 37 °C. After expression, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 220 mm NaCl. Cells were then disrupted by freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at 37 °C. This step was repeated twice. rBet v 4 was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, which was then used for immunoblot analysis. rBet v 4 was purified from crude E. coli lysates by chromatofocusing on a PBE-94 (Pharmacia) exchanger column and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described in detail previously (26Ferreira F.D. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Ebner C. Sommergruber W. Steiner R. Bohle B. Sperr W.R. Valent P. Kungl A.J. Breitenbach M. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Biol.

Mutations in the two calcium-binding domains of Bet v 4 were engineered using the three-primer PCR mutagenesis method (28Marini III, F. Naeem A. Lapeyre J.-N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2277-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to convert Asp to Ala at the first coordinating position (positionx, see Fig. 1) in each EF-hand site. These Asp → Ala mutants were designated by the number of the mutated residue in the Bet v 4 amino acid sequence as follows: D19A, mutation in EF-hand site I; D54A, mutation in EF-hand site II; D19A,D54A, mutations in both EF-hand sites. Internal mismatch primers and flanking primers that were used in the present study to generate Bet v 4 mutants are listed as follows. Internal mutagenic primers: EF1 primer 5′CCATTGGCGgCAAAGCGCT3′; EF2 primer 5′CCGAGATTGcCACCGATGG3′. Bases exchanged are indicated in lowercase. Flanking primers: Ncoprimer 5′GAGACCATGGCTGATGATCATCCA3′, NcoI site is underlined; Eco primer 5′GAGAGAATTCTTAAAATATCTTGGCAACATC3′, EcoRI site is underlined. The PCR products were digested with NcoI andEcoRI and subcloned in the pMW175 expression vector. The resulting plasmids were used to transform competent E. coliBL21 cells. All PCR-amplified products were sequenced according to the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Expression in E. coli and purification of Bet v 4 mutants from crude bacterial lysates was done following the protocol described above for wild type rBet v 4. For mass spectrometry analysis, 0.5 μl (approximately 0.5 μg) of purified rBet v 4 and Bet v 4 mutants, 0.5 μl of protein calibration standard (insulin, average molecular weight 16,950.9), and 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of gentisic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (matrix) were applied to the target slide with intermittent drying in an air stream. Samples were analyzed with the Kompact MALDI III mass spectrometer from Kratos Analytical in the linear flight mode. The molecular peaks of insulin and gentisic acid were used as internal standards. Aqueous protein extracts from birch (B. verrucosa) pollen (Allergon AB), timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen (Allergon AB), and mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) pollen (Allergon AB) were prepared by resuspending the grains in distilled water and shaking for 15 min at room temperature. Pollen grains from lily (Lilium longiflorum) were collected from fully developed flowers purchased from local flower shops. After washing once with 5% ethanol to remove the pollenkitt, lily pollen grains were resuspended in distilled water and shaken at room temperature for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Pollen extracts and bacterial lysates of rBet v 4 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 27: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), using 15% acrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) onto nitrocellulose membranes. IgE immunoblots were performed as described previously (3Jarolim E. Rumpold H. Endler A.T. Ebner H. Breitenbach M. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Allergy (Cph.). 1989; 44: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Bound human IgE was detected using 125I-rabbit anti-human IgE (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). To determine the influence of protein-bound Ca2+ on patients' IgE recognition of Bet v 4, during antibody binding assays nitrocellulose strips were incubated either in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, as described previously (6Seiberler S. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Lonsdale D. Valenta R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For IgE inhibition experiments, sera from allergic patients were preincubated with purified rBet v 4 (0.1 μg/ml 1:10 diluted serum) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, blotted pollen extracts from different sources were incubated with pre-absorbed serum samples, and IgE was detected as above. Mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (31Sistrunk M.L. Antosiewicz D.M. Purugganan M.M. Braam J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1553-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of E. coli lysate of recombinant Bet v 4 were adjusted to 10 mm CaCl2 plus 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm EGTA, or 10 mmMgCl2 plus 2 mm EGTA. 2 mm EGTA was added to all samples to chelate trace amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the protein extracts. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was then developed using serum IgE from a birch pollen-allergic patient. Purified rBet v 4 and Bet v 4 mutants were run on 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and incubated with45Ca2+ (Amersham Corp., UK) in 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, for 10 min at room temperature (32Pedrocchi M. Schäfer B.W. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6732-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The overlay was performed using 0.1 mCi of45Ca2+/blot, corresponding to a final Ca2+ concentration of 64 μm. Unbound45Ca2+ was removed by washing and bound radioactivity was visualized by exposing an x-ray film. Bet v 4 protein samples in 0.2m Bicine, pH 8.5, were treated with 1 mmdimethyl suberimidate at 20 °C for 1 h in the presence of either 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm CaCl2(33Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santome J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Afterward the reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 10 mm, and reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CD spectra of aqueous allergen solutions were recorded as described previously (34Kungl A.J. Susani M. Lindemann A. Machius M. Visser A.J.W.G. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Breitenbach M. Auer M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, cuvettes with a path length of 0.1 cm were used for collecting the sample CD spectra on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) with a response time of 0.25 s and with a data point resolution of 0.2 nm. Each spectrum represents an average of five scans. Dehydrated pollen grains from lily (L. longiflorum) were resuspended in pollen culture medium (10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm H3BO3, pH 5.6) and incubated at room temperature. Pollen germinated after approximately 45 min, and after 2 h pollen tubes of 200–600 μm length were collected. Pollen tube suspension (40 μl) was pipetted onto a microscope slide and quickly but gently mixed with 60 μl of culture medium (40 °C) additionally containing low melting agarose (Sigma, type VII) to give a final agarose concentration of 2%. Slides with immobilized pollen tubes were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a video camera to monitor cytoplasmic streaming and tube growth. In some experiments, purified rBet v 4 was added to the pollen culture medium at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The pollen tubes were impaled with microelectrodes fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments GC 120F) and filled with 100 mmpotassium acetate, pH 7.4, as described previously (35Obermeyer G. Blatt M.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 803-813Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes were mounted into half cells filled with 1m KCl. To minimize liquid junction potentials the reference electrodes were built like the microelectrodes and filled with the same solutions. Both electrodes were connected to an amplifier (Wye Science), and membrane voltage was recorded on a chart recorder. The very tip of the microelectrode was filled with 10 mmK+ acetate, pH 7.4, plus the recombinant wild type or mutant Bet v 4 proteins (1.8 mg ml−1). The proteins were allowed to diffuse into the cytoplasm or were injected by iontophoresis using three current pulses of −2 nA and 20 s duration. Fig. 2 Ashows typical IgE binding patterns of four birch pollen-allergic patients tested on birch pollen extract. All patients reacted with Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen (4Breiteneder H. Pettenburger K. Bito A. Valenta R. Kraft D. Rumpold H. Scheiner O. Breitenbach M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1935-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), two patients recognized the ubiquitous allergen profilin (5Valenta R. Duchene M. Ebner C. Valent P. Sillaber C. Deviller P. Ferreira F. Tejkl M. Edelmann H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 365-374Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and patients 2 and 4 showed IgE reactivity with a so far unknown low molecular mass (approximately 7–8 kDa) protein. To obtain information about this low molecular mass allergen, serum from patient 4 was selected for IgE immunoscreening of a birch pollen cDNA expression library. Fifteen IgE-positive plaques were isolated out of 500,000 plaques and further tested for reactivity with BIP1, a monoclonal antibody raised against Bet v 1 (36Jarolim E. Tejkl M. Rohac M. Schlerka G. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Breitenbach M. Rumpold H. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1989; 90: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and with a rabbit serum raised against birch profilin (37Valenta R. Ferreira F. Grote M. Swoboda I. Vrtala S. Duchene M. Deviller P. Meagher R.B. McKinney E. Heberle-Bors E. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22777-22781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four IgE-positive clones (c6, c7, c8, and c13) that did not react with antibodies against Bet v 1 and profilin were selected for DNA sequence analysis. All four clones were complete, and their coding regions were of identical length (252 nucleotides, excluding start and stop codons), thus coding for proteins of 84 amino acids. The sequences of c7, c8, and c13 clones were each coding for the same protein, whereas c6 differed from the other clones through two nucleotide exchanges, one that leads to amino acid exchange (Gln-6 → Arg). The 3′-noncoding regions of the four clones differed in their length (c6, 258 bp; c7, 248 bp; c8, 157 bp; and c13, 360 bp) but had identical sequences in their overlapping regions. We designated the protein encoded by clones c7, c8, and c13 as Bet v 4, in accordance with the IUIS allergen nomenclature system (38King T.P. Hoffman D. Loewenstein H. Marsh D.G. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Thomas W. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of Bet v 4 is shown in Fig. 1. When Bet v 4 was compared with sequences in data bases, similarities were found to Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin and troponin C from various sources and to Bet v 3, a calcium-binding allergen from birch pollen (6Seiberler S. Scheiner O. Kraft D. Lonsdale D. Valenta R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, sequence similarities between Bet v 4 and these calcium-binding proteins were primarily confined to the calcium-binding domains. Bet v 4 contained two helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding regions referred to as EF-hand structures (39Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highest sequence similarities were found to a group of calcium-binding pollen allergens recently described inBrassica (40Toriyama K. Okada T. Watanabe M. Ide T. Ashida T. Xu H. Singh M.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Bermuda grass (27Suphioglu C. Ferreira F. Knox R.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this case the sequence similarities extended outside the calcium-binding domains. Fig. 1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of Bet v 4 in its best fit alignment with the amino acid sequences of Brassica and Bermuda grass pollen allergens. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of Brassica and Bermuda grass allergens with that of Bet v 4 revealed the following identities: Bra r 1, 72%; Bra n 1, 67%; Cyn d 7, 65%; Cyn d B1, 63%; Cyn d B4, 62%. Thus, Bet v 4 and homologous proteins from Brassica and Bermuda grass seem to constitute a novel class of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins different from calmodulins and calmodulin-related proteins. Nonfusion forms of full-length cDNA coding for Bet v 4 and three Bet v 4 mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis were expressed in E. coli. The Bet v 4 mutants D19A, D54A, and D19A,D54A were each defective in one of the two calcium-binding sites or in both sites. High levels of expression of soluble recombinant proteins were obtained (Fig.2 B). Wild type rBet v 4 and Bet v 4 mutants were purified to homogeneity, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2 B). More than 20 mg of each purified protein was obtained from 500-ml cultures. The protein preparations were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The molecular masses of wild type rBet v 4, and mutants D19A, D54A, and D19A,D54A were measured as follows (theoretical mass values are given in parenthesis): 9,333.9 (9,335.8), 9,287.5 (9,291.8), 9,290.4 (9,291.8), and 9,247.0 (9,247.8), respectively. Thus, the measured mass values agree with the expected values and are consistent with the removal of the initiating methionine. The possibility that Bet v 4 exists as a dimer was tested by in vitro cross-linking experi"

Because of their importance in the cell cycle, CDKs are structurally and functionally conserved across a wide spectrum of evolution. For example, human p34 cdc2 is capable of functional complementation of temperature sensitive (ts) Cdc2 mutant strains of the fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe (3Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). During the past decade, significant progress has been made in structural and functional characterization of individual components such as cyclins and CDKs regulating the transit of cells through various checkpoints of the animal cell cycle (1Doree M. Galas S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee M.G. Nurse P.

Blood. 1995; 86: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, p34 cdc2 plays a rate-limiting role in the transition from G2 into M (6Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Cdc25C gene product, a dual specific protein phosphatase, dephosphorylates p34 cdc2 on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 residues and thereby activates p34 cdc2 kinase activity (7Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The Cdc25C phosphatase activity is also under regulation by reversible phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that extensive phosphorylation of Cdc25C amino-terminal domain occurs at the onset of mitosis by a novel enzyme (8Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation strongly activates Cdc25C's phosphatase activity toward p34 cdc2 (8Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol.

Recently, an emerging family of protein kinases (termed the polo kinase family) has been described in yeast, Drosophila, and higher animals. In Drosophila, the polo gene encodes a protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that is required for M phase functions (10Llamazares S. Moreira A. Tavares A. Girdham C. Spruce B.A. Gonzalez C.

Nature. 1993; 363: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutants of polo induce hyper-condensed chromosomes, abnormal spindle formation, and polyploidy (10Llamazares S. Moreira A.

Nature. 1993; 363: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A polo homolog encoded by CDC5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for nuclear division in the late mitotic stage (12Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Deletion of this gene is lethal, resulting in a dumbbell-shaped terminal morphology with incomplete nuclear division (12Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell.

Prk shares an extensive homology with the polo family kinases, and the homology is not confined solely to the kinase domain (13Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Dai W. J.

Human A549 fibroblast cells originally derived from a lung carcinoma were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan UT) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.). G1 cells were obtained by culturing in methionine-free DMEM containing 10% FBS for 48 h. Cells arrested at G1/S (some refer this stage as early S or S) (14Iwasaki T. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Yoshioka K. Fujii Y. Nakahara K. Matsud H. Akedo H. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2272-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were achieved by the treatment with aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) and hydroxyurea (0.5 mm) for 48 h. Later S (S/G2) cells were obtained through washing the G1/S-arrested cells as above with phosphate-buffered saline and reculturing them in DMEM with 10% FBS for 6 h. To obtain mitotic metaphase cells, A549 cells were treated with nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml) for 16 h. Aphidicolin, hydroxyurea, and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells or Xenopus oocytes using the guanidine isothiocyanate method (16Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16606) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (15 μg) were fractionated on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels. The fractionated RNA was transferred to Nytran Plus membranes. The RNA blots were baked for 2 h, prehybridized for 2 h, and hybridized with a32P-labeled prk or β-actin cDNA fragment overnight. After hybridization, the blots were washed and autoradiographed. High stringency hybridization and washing conditions were as described previously (17Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 332-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the N-terminal half (Prk-N, amino acids 20–341) (13Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal half (Prk-C, amino acids 334–607) of Prk were expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein using the plasmid pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fusion proteins were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified through affinity column chromatography according to the protocol provided by the supplier. Polyclonal anti-Prk antisera were produced in rabbits using the purified Prk-C through a commercial source (Research Genetics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). For Western blotting, cells with various treatments were collected and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml approtinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Proteins from cell lysates, representing equal numbers of cells, were analyzed through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Western blotting. The protein blots were first probed with an anti-Prk or anti-Plk (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) antibody raised in a rabbit and then with goat-anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). A549 cells were collected and lysed in the lysis buffer as above. Protein lysates from about 3 × 106 cells were preclarified by the addition of a normal rabbit serum (1:50 dilution) and 15 μl of protein A-agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation (12,500 × g for 5 min), the supernatants were supplemented with an anti-Prk antiserum (1:100 dilution) or the normal rabbit serum as a control, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads (15 μl) were then added to each immunoprecipitation mixture, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for at least 8 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected, washed four times with the lysis buffer and once with a kinase buffer (buffer for casein: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 μm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2; buffer for histone H1: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 30 μl of the respective kinase buffer. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Prk was assayed by the addition of a substrate (casein (20 μg/reaction) or histone H1 (20 μg/reaction), Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Place, NY)) and [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi) to each kinase mixture, and the reaction lasted for 30 min at 37 °C. The kinase reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Purified recombinant His6-Prk expressed through the baculoviral expression system was also assayed for itsin vitro kinase activity using substrates such as casein (15 μg/reaction) and recombinant GST-Cdc25C (2.5 μg/reaction). GST-Cdc25C was kindly provided by K. Galaktinov. The kinase reaction conditions were the same as above. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the phosphorylated GST-Cdc25C was excised and eluted from the gel. The eluted GST-Cdc25C was then hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 60 min at 110 °C. The hydrolyzed amino acids were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. Full-length recombinant Prk was expressed using the baculoviral expression system (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of human prk was cloned into PVL-1393 transfer vector. To facilitate purification of recombinant Prk protein, a short nucleotide sequence coding for six histidine residues was inserted in-frame immediately after the ATG codon of prk cDNA. Baculoviral expression vector BaculoGoldTM DNA and the transfer plasmid PVL-1393-Prk were then co-transfected into insect sf9 cells. Insectsf9 cells expressing recombinant Prk were harvested and lysed for purification of recombinant Prk using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Chatworth, CA). The prk cDNA insert was cloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Inc., San Diego, CA). In vitro transcription was performed using T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the presence of a Cap analog (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)) according to the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Antisense transcripts were synthesized with Sp6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the absence of the Cap analog. In vitro transcribed RNAs were finally dissolved in diethylpyrocarboanate-treated water at a concentration of 1 ng/nl. Stage 5–6 oocytes from female Xenopus frogs (Xenopus I, Lansing, MI) were obtained and stored at 18 °C in a modified Barth's solution (MBS) as described elsewhere (18Lu L. Montrose-Rafizadeh M. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16190-16194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection was performed under an anatomic microscope and manipulated by a micromanipulator. Each oocyte was injected with 50 ng of transcripts by positive displacement using a 10-μl micropipette. Oocytes injected with sense transcripts were incubated at 18 °C for 60 h before induction experiments. Maturation was induced by a 30 min pulse exposure to progesterone (3 μm for sense experiments or 30 μm for antisense experiments) in MBS. After induction, oocytes were transferred to fresh MBS and incubated at room temperature for various lengths of time (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 h) unless otherwise specified. Meiotic maturation of oocytes was scored by observing the frequency of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), characterized by the appearance of a white spot on the animal pole of the oocyte. Each experiment was repeated at least four times, and statistical confidence determined by the Student's t test. Reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR was performed on Xenopus oocyte or A549 total RNA using a SuperScriptTM preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A pair of oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two stretches of human prk cDNA sequences was synthesized by Oligo Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The pair of prk primers has the following sequences: forward primer, 5′-AGCGGCCTCATGCGCACA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AATCCATCTCCACTGCTTGC-3′. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed with denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 48 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. As an amplification control, a pair of human β-actin primers were also used to amplifyXenopus and A549 cell cDNA. PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and the fractionated PCR products were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Southern blots were probed with a32P-labeled human prk cDNA fragment. High stringency hybridization and washing conditions were as described previously (17Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 332-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human prk cDNA was cloned into a yeast expression vector pADNS as described elsewhere (19Colicelli J. Birchmeier C. Michaeli T. O'Neill K. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A short version of prk with a 23-amino acid deletion at the N terminus (Prk-st) was also cloned into the same vector. As a positive control, the wild-type CDC5 gene of S. cerevisiaewas obtained via polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a pADNS expression vector. Original S. cerevisiae CDC5 mutants were as described previously (20Hartwell L.H. Mortimer R.K. Culotti J. Culotti M. Genetics. 1973; 74: 267-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a CDC5 mutant strain (2751-4-3a) was kindly provided by Dr. L. H. Hartwell at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA). The mutant strain had the following genotype:Matα, cdc5-1, leu2-3, 112 his7, and was maintained on YPD (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose media) plates. Various expression constructs as well as the parental plasmid were transformed into CDC5 mutants, and transformants were cultured at 22 °C on drop-out base plates supplemented with a complete supplement mixture but without leucine (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Individual colonies from each transformation were then spread onto plates and cultured at 22 °C for 3 days. Duplicate plates were cultured at 33 °C for the same length of time. Since prk mRNA expression is rapidly activated by serum or selected cytokines (13Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we first examined the steady state level of prk mRNA during various stages of the cell cycle. Human A549 cells (21Sterner J.M. Murata Y. Kim H.G. Kennett S.B. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9281-9288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were arrested at different stages of the cell cycle as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 A shows that a low level ofprk transcript was present in G1 cells (lane 3). The prk transcript level was significantly elevated at the G1/S junction (lane 4), peaking at late S and G2 stages of the cell cycle (lane 5). Interestingly, prk mRNA level was markedly reduced during M phase (lane 6), indicating thatprk mRNA expression was tightly regulated during the cell cycle. The cell cycle status in all cells was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells (data not shown). The Prk protein has two apparent domains with the approximate N-terminal half bearing the typical protein Ser/Thr kinase structure (13Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We generated recombinant GST fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal half (Prk-N) or the C-terminal half (Prk-C) of Prk (data not shown). Since the C-terminal half of Prk shares no structural homology to any other known proteins except for polo family kinases, purified Prk-C was used to raise polyclonal anti-human Prk antibodies in rabbits. An anti-Prk antisera was first characterized for its specificity. Western blot analyses showed that two bands (with the molecular mass of about 68 and 64 kDa, respectively) were immunoreactive to an anti-Prk antiserum (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 2) but not to the preimmune serum (lanes 3 and 4). The 68-kDa band, but not the 64-kDa band, was competed by an excess amount of purified Prk-C protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the band of 68 kDa represents Prk protein. Plk is another known member of the polo family kinases in the human, and it shares about 50% amino acid sequence identity with human Prk. Western blot analysis showed that Plk is also expressed in A549 cells, and it has a faster mobility of about 66 kDa than the 68-kDa Prk on denaturing gels (Fig.1 B, lanes 7 and 8). To determine Prk antigen levels, unsynchronized A549 cells as well as the cells synchronized at various stages of the cell cycle were analyzed for Prk expression by Western blotting using the anti-Prk anti-serum. Fig.1 C shows that Prk antigen levels were low in G1, but remained relatively constant throughout the rest of the cell cycle. The same blot was stripped and probed with an anti-Plk antibody. Fig.1 D shows that little or no Plk antigen was present in G1, G1/S, or S/G2 (Fig.1 D, lanes 2–4), but very high levels of the antigen were accumulated in M (lane 5). Both anti-Prk and anti-Plk antibodies recognized the murine counterparts (Figs. 1,C and D, lane 6). To determine whether prk encodes an active kinase, Prk protein was immunoprecipitated from A549 cells and analyzed for its protein kinase activity in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and an in vitro substrate such as casein or histone H1. As a positive control for histone H1 kinase activity, p34 cdc2 kinase was also immunoprecipitated from A549 cell lysates. Fig.2 A shows that Prk immunoprecipitates catalyzed the incorporation of 32P into casein (lane 2, arrowhead). No nonspecific incorporation of radioactivity into proteins of substrate size was observed with the preimmune serum control (lane 1), indicating that Prk is an active protein kinase. When histone H1 was used as a substrate, a very low Prk kinase activity was detected (lane 4). On the other hand, p34 cdc2 immunoprecipitates strongly catalyzed the incorporation of radioactivity into histone H1 (lane 5). To determine whether the Prk kinase activity is regulated during the cell cycle, cell lysates collected from defined stages of the cell cycle were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Prk antiserum. Immunocomplex kinase assays showed that Prk kinase activity was low during G1(Fig. 2 B, lane 3) or G1/S (lane 4). The kinase activity dramatically increased during late S/G2 (lane 5), and remained at a moderate level at metaphase (lane 6). CDK's kinase activity absolutely depends on the association with a specific cyclin. To determine whether Prk's kinase activity requires the association with other protein(s), we expressed full-length Prk using the baculoviral expression system. Western blot analyses revealed that His6-Prk was strongly expressed (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and3) in sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. The purified His6-Prk (Fig. 3 A,lane 4) was analyzed for its kinase activity using casein as a substrate. Fig. 3 B shows that His6-Prk strongly phosphorylates casein (lane 2, arrowhead casein), and the addition of staurosporine, a protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, drastically inhibited phosphorylation of casein by Prk (lane 6). Prk is capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead Prk). Thesmall arrowhead (Fig. 3 B) denotes a degradation product of Prk, since it is immunoreactive to anti-Prk antibody (arrowhead in Fig. 3 A). Since Cdc25C is extensively phosphorylated by a kinase other than Cdc2 and Cdk2 before the onset of mitosis (8Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we tested whether Prk is capable of phosphorylating Cdc25C. Fig. 3 B shows that His6-Prk (lane 3), but not its deletion mutant (lane 5), phosphorylates GST-Cdc25C. No phosphorylation was detected when GST alone was used as a substrate (data not shown), indicating the phosphorylation occurs on Cdc25C moiety. We quantitated substrate phosphorylation by titrating the amount of Cdc25C used for the kinase reaction. His6-Prk phosphorylates Cdc25C to a stoichiometry of 4 mol of phosphate per mol of Cdc25C. To confirm the predicted Ser/Thr phosphorylation by Prk, GST-Cdc25C protein eluted from the gel was hydrolyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed for its phosphoamino acid content. As shown in Fig. 3 C, both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are present with a ratio of about 3 to 1. The X. laevis oocyte is a useful bioassay system for assessing complex nuclear events (22Gautier J.C. Norbury C. Lohka M. Nurse P. Malle J. Cell. 1988; 54: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 23Roy L.M. Singh B. Gautier J. Arlinhaus R.B. Nordeen S. Maller J.L.

Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Immature oocytes are arrested at the G2/M border of meiosis I. When such oocytes are stimulated with progesterone, they undergo meiotic maturation which is visibly monitored by GVBD. Microinjection of Cdc2 activators such as cyclin B and Cdc25 also induce a rapid GVBD (23Roy L.M. Singh B. Gautier J. Arlinhaus R.B. Nordeen S. Maller J.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Sinceprk homologs in yeast and Drosophila are involved in regulating mitotic and meiotic progression (10Llamazares S. Moreira A. Tavares A. Girdham C. Spruce B.A. Gonzalez C. Karess R.E. Glover D.M. Sunkel C.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 11Fenton R. Glover D.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Kitada K. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4445-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we asked whether prk is required for Xenopus oocyte maturation. Fig. 4 A shows that injection of neither vehicle nor prk transcripts alone significantly stimulated the maturation rate. Progesterone treatment alone induced GVBD of about 40% oocytes. However, when treated with progesterone, all oocytes injected with the full-length, but not the short form, prk transcripts reached the GVBD stage (Fig.4 A). The short form refers to Prk with an in-frame deletion of amino acids 2–24 in the kinase domain as described elsewhere (13Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, injection of full-length prk transcripts greatly potentiated the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. To determine whether or not loss of function could affect induced GVBD, we tested the effect of antisense prk transcripts on the maturation of frog oocytes. Fig. 4 B shows that injection of the vehicle or antisense prk transcripts alone had no effect on the maturation rate. However, injection of antisense prktranscripts significantly blocked the progesterone-induced GVBD (Fig.4 B). Thus, these oocytes experiments suggest that a progesterone-induced factor(s) is required for the activation of Prk or that activation of Prk downstream component(s) requires both Prk and a progesterone-induced factor. To gain insight into the specificity of antisense human prk transcripts, Xenopus oocyte RNA was analyzed for prk-specific transcripts using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Fig. 4 C shows that human prkprimers were capable of amplifying a Xenopus DNA product (lane 2) that has the same mobility as human prkfragment on an agarose gel (lane 3). High stringency Southern blotting analyses revealed that the amplifiedXenopus cDNA fragment, which is outside the kinase domain, hybridized strongly with a human prk cDNA probe (Fig. 4 D, lanes 2). Subsequent DNA sequencing analysis showed that Xenopus did contain prk gene and that there existed a very high homology (97%) between the amplified human and Xenopus prk cDNA fragments (data not shown). The slower mobility band in lane 3 (Fig.4 C) was most likely derived from the unsplicedprk transcript. To further determine whether suppression of Prk expression would also delay their maturation, Xenopusoocytes injected with antisense prk transcripts or the vehicle were treated with progesterone and examined for GVBD at various time post treatment. It has been observed (Fig.5) that vehicle-treated oocytes began to mature 5 h post-progesterone treatment (open squares). On the other hand, a small number of oocytes injected with antisenseprk transcripts did not show any signs of maturation until 9 h post-progesterone treatment (Fig. 5, filled circles), suggesting that a loss Prk function also significantly delayed meiotic maturation of oocytes induced by progesterone.Figure 5Prk delays progesterone-induced GVBD ofXenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with (filled circles) or without (open squares) antisenseprk transcripts were monitored for GVBD at various time post-progesterone treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2067306113,"Cdc25 regulates entry into mitosis by regulating the activation of cyclin B/cdc2. In humans, at least two cdc25 isoforms have roles in controlling the G2/M transition. Here we show, using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, that two cdc25B splice variants, cdc25B2 and cdc25B3, are capable of activating cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B/cdc2, but that mitotic hyperphosphorylation of these proteins increases their activity toward only cyclin B1/cdc2. Cdc25C has only very low activity in its unphosphorylated form, and following hyperphosphorylation it will efficiently catalyze the activation of only cyclin B/cdc2. This was reflected by the in vivo activity of the immunoprecipitated cdc25B and cdc25C from interphase and mitotic HeLa cells. The increased activity of the hyperphosphorylated cdc25s toward cyclin B1/cdc2 was in large part due to increased binding of this substrate. The substrate specificity, activities, and timing of the hyperphosphorylation of cdc25B and cdc25C during G2 and M suggest that these two mitotic cdc25 isoforms are activated by different kinases and perform different functions during progression through G2 into mitosis.

Regulation of the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. underlies cell cycle progression. Cdks are regulated by a combination of factors, including cyclin association, and phosphorylations and dephosphorylations of the cdk subunit. The final step in the activation of cyclin/cdks is catalyzed by a member of the cdc25 family of dual specificity phosphatases, which remove inhibitory phosphates from Thr14and Tyr15 of cdk2 and cdc2. The role and regulation of cdc25 phosphatase has been well defined in yeast and Xenopus egg systems, using a combination of genetics and biochemistry. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cdc25 is controlled at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The mRNA and protein levels oscillate through the cell cycle, being maximal in G2, but the protein requires further post-translational modification in the form of phosphorylation for maximal activity (1Moreno S.

Xenopus cdc25 levels do not change, but its activity is also controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (3Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol.

In humans, three isoforms of cdc25 exist, cdc25A, -B, and -C. Cdc25A has a role in regulating the G1/S cell cycle phase transition whereas cdc25B and cdc25C regulated the G2/M transition (5Jinno S.

Whereas the in vivo substrates identified for the cdc25s to date are the Tyr-phosphorylated cyclin/cdks, cdc25 activity has usually been measured in vitro using a range of substrates, most of which are non-physiological e.g. p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The cdc25 phosphatases utilize this substrate very poorly (12Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M. Burke S.P. Eckstein J.W. Ballou D.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

While different cdc25 isoforms have been demonstrated to activate a range of different cyclin/cdks (15Gabrielli B.G. Lee M.S. Walker D.H. Piwnica-Worms H. Maller J.L. J. Biol.

In this report, we provide biochemical evidence that two cdc25B splicing variants and cdc25C utilize cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdc2 as substrates with different efficiencies. Using bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of cdc25B, cdc25C, and catalytic domain constructs, we demonstrate that in vitro two cdc25B splicing variants identified (18Baldin V. Cans C.

Gabrielli, submitted for publication. have relatively high activity toward both cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdc2, whereas cdc25C will activate cyclin B1/cdc2 to the same extent as the cdc25Bs only after hyperphosphorylation. The phosphorylation induced increases in activity of all the cdc25s are due to increased binding of the cyclin/cdks. Similar increases in activity were observed for the hyperphosphorylated forms of cdc25B and cdc25C immunoprecipitated from mitotic HeLa cells. Activity assays of chimeric constructs of cdc25B and cdc25C revealed that exchanging the N-terminal regulatory domains significantly modified their catalytic activities. We propose that mitotic hyperphosphorylation modifies the structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain of the cdc25s to allow better access of cyclin/cdk to the catalytic domain. HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% bovine serum (Serum Supreme, Biowhittaker). Single and double thymidine block/release synchronies of HeLa cultures were performed as described previously (19Atherton-Fessler S. Liu F. Gabrielli B. Lee M.S. Peng C.-Y. Piwinica-Worms H. Mol.

The excisedAvrII/AvrII fragments from each cdc25 were then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the other cdc25. The fragments were ligated in-frame and encoded chimeric cdc25s from cdc25B3 codon 1–251 and cdc25C 181–472 (designated cdc25BC2), and cdc25C codon 1–180 and cdc25B3 252–580 (designated cdc25CB3). The chimeras were then subcloned in pGEX 2T (Pharmacia) as either anXbaI/XbaI fragment of cdc25BC2 into theXbaI-digested pGEX-cdc25B3 (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M.

The production of GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal fragments of both cdc25B3 and cdc25C has been described elsewhere (20Lee M.S. Ogg S. Xu M. Parker L.L. Donoghue D.J. Maller J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).2 The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and the induced proteins were extracted by Sarkosyl lysis and affinity purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), modified to include 5 mm DTT in all extraction and washing buffers. The activity of the GST-cdc25 fusion proteins was assayed by their ability to activate the Tyr15-phosphorylated forms of cyclin B1/cdc2 or cyclin A/cdk2. The cdc25 activity was quantitated as the increased histone H1 kinase activity of the activated cyclin/cdk. The cyclin/cdks were isolated by immunoprecipitation with either anti-cyclin B1 antibody (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from extracts of HeLa cells harvested 8 h after release from an overnight block in 2.5 mm thymidine (when the cells are in late S or early G2 phase, S/G2), or an anti-cdk2 polyclonal (Santa Cruz) or anti-cyclin A monoclonal (Pharmingen) antibody from overnight thymidine-blocked HeLa cells (G1/S). The cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitations performed as described previously (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity purified GST-cdc25s were eluted from glutathione-agarose with 10 mm reduced glutathione in phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.3) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The amount of GST-cdc25 eluted was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained bands of the full-length fusion proteins in 30-μl aliquots resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1 B), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The eluted GST-cdc25s (30 μl) were added to immunoprecipitates of either cyclin B1/cdc2 or cyclin A/cdk2, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 5 mm sodium vanadate, and the histone H1 kinase activity assayed as described previously (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of histone phosphorylation was quantitated by PhosphorImaging and the cdc25 activity expressed as fold increase in histone kinase activity over the control, normally the catalytically inactive GST-cdc25B3 CR/SK mutant. Where indicated, the eluted GST-cdc25s were diluted with elution buffer. In all assays, GST-cdc25CB3 was initially diluted 3-fold to give a similar level of protein as that of the eluted GST-cdc25Bs and GST-cdc25C. The activity of HeLa cell cdc25B and cdc25C was assayed by immunoprecipitation from extracts of either G1/S or S/G2 synchronized cells, or mitotic cells (M) obtained by mitotic shake-off of cells arrested in M phase with nocodazole (0.2 μg/ml) 14 h after release from a thymidine block. Cells were lysed in NETN (20 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8) supplemented with 0.3m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the phosphatase inhibitors 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μmmicrocystin, and 20 μm cantharidin. The lysates were precleared with 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose for 30 min then the cdc25s were immunoprecipitated by addition of 0.1–0.5 μg of either affinity purified cdc25B or cdc25C specific antibody (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose. The antibody was incubated with the lysate for 3 h at 4 °C, then the precipitates washed as for the glutathione-agarose precipitates with NETN supplemented with 5 mm DTT. Finally, the precipitates were washed once with phosphatase buffer into fresh tubes, and the cdc25 activity assayed by the activation of a Thr14/Tyr15 and Thr161-phosphorylated cdc2-cyclin B1 complex (PY15) produced in vitro. Briefly, baculovirus-expressed human cyclin B1 GST fusion protein was bound to glutathione-agarose, then incubated in a HeLa cell lysate with the addition of 2 mmATP, 15 mm MgCl2, and the cdk inhibitor olomoucine (0.1 mm). The agarose bound GST-cyclin B1/cdc2 was washed and cleaved from the GST moiety with thrombin. The released Thr14, Tyr15, and Thr161-phosphorylated cdc2/cyclin B1 was then stored at −70 °C until use. 5 μl of PY15 substrate was diluted with 15 μl of phosphatase buffer and incubated with the immunoprecipitated cdc25 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 5 mm sodium vanadate, and the increase in H1 kinase activity measured as described above. Cdc25 activity was quantitated as the increased histone kinase activity of the substrate. The controls in these experiments were preimmune IgG immunoprecipitates from M phase samples, although preimmune control values from each cell cycle sample were the same. In vitro phosphorylation of the GST-cdc25s was performed using extracts of mitotic HeLa cells obtained from mitotic shake-off of overnight nocodazole-blocked HeLa cultures. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above, except that the vanadate concentration was increased to 0.3 mm and microcystin to 5 μm. The lysate was precleared by incubation with 0.4 ml of a 50% suspension of glutathione-agarose for 1 h, then 2–4 mg of lysate was added to GST-cdc25s bound to glutathione-agarose. The GST-cdc25s were incubated with the lysates either with or without addition of 2 mm ATP and 15 mmMgCl2 for 15 min at 30 °C, then supplemented with a further 1 mm ATP and incubated a further 15 min. The glutathione-agarose bound GST-cdc25s were then washed, eluted, and assayed as described above. In some cases, the phosphorylated cdc25s were dephosphorylated prior to elution using 1 unit of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C as per the manufacturer's conditions. The degree of phosphorylation was assessed by electrophoresis of the eluted GST-cdc25s on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting the resolved proteins with an anti-GST antibody. The phosphorylated cdc25s migrated as lower mobility species (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J.

Molt4 cells harvested 8 h after release from a thymidine block (predominantly S/G2phase cells), were lysed in NETN supplemented with 0.3 mNaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride, and precleared with glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-cdc25 C/S mutants bound to glutathione-agarose was incubated in 1.25 mg of lysate at 0.5 mg/ml protein for 2 h at 4 °C, the bead pellets washed 4 times with NETN, and the bound protein eluted by boiling in 2 × SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-cdc2 (Santa Cruz) monoclonal antibody, anti-GST, or anti-cdk2 (Santa Cruz) affinity purified polyclonal antibodies, using ECL detection. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (30 mm) in phosphatase buffer was added to 60 μl of eluted GST-cdc25 to give a final volume of 200 μl, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of 2 m NaOH and the turnover ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate determined as the increased absorbance at 410 nm using the ε of 18,000m−1 cm−1 forp-nitrophenol. To investigate the intrinsic activities of the two splicing variants of cdc25B and cdc25C, GST fusion proteins of each were expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. These proteins have previously been shown to be active as phosphatases in vitro, using a number of different substrates (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K.

Cell. 1992; 3: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A series of chimeric proteins were also produced, where the conserved N-terminal regions of the cdc25B3 variant and cdc25C were exchanged (Fig.1 A). Exchange of the N-terminal regions was expected to change the regulation and possibly substrate specificity of chimeric catalytic subunit, but not change its catalytic properties significantly. Full-length GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified for each of the cdc25s, C-terminal constructs and two chimeric proteins, but we were unable to purify a full-length version of another chimeric cdc25, cdc25BC1 (Fig.1 B). The activity of the GST-cdc25s was initially assayed usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The catalytic C-terminal regions of the two cdc25Bs and cdc25C display a high degree of sequence identity and would thus be expected to have similar catalytic properties. When the activities of the GST-cdc25s were compared on an equimolar basis, cdc25B C-terminal fragment construct was found to have a 4–5-fold greater activity than either cdc25B variant, which had similar activities with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Table I). The full-length cdc25C and its isolated C-terminal domain construct had similar activity with this substrate, although this was less than half the activity of the cdc25Bs. Interestingly, the two full-length chimeras had very different p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities from their parent forms, cdc25BC2 was essentially inactive with this substrate, whereas cdc25CB3 had 3-fold higher activity than cdc25B3, but a similar activity to the cdc25B C-terminal fragments (Table I).Table Ip-Nitrophenylphosphatase activity of the GST-cdc25sActivityμm/min/mgCdc25B259Cdc25B374Cdc25C25Cdc25BC2<1Cdc25CB3237Cdc25B C-terminal350Cdc25C C-terminal26The activity of each GST-cdc25 was calculated from five separate experiments, and calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The activity of each GST-cdc25 was calculated from five separate experiments, and calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity of the GST-cdc25Bs and GST-cdc25C withp-nitrophenyl phosphate indicated only small differences between the catalytic activities of the bacterially expressed proteins. Others have shown that the cyclin subunit of the in vivosubstrates of cdc25, the cyclin/cdks, can contribute to the activity and possibly specificity of the cdc25 (13Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 14Zheng X.-F. Ruderman J.V. Cell. 1993; 75: 155-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, the activity of the GST-cdc25s, chimeras, and C-terminal constructs toward Thr14/Tyr15-phosphorylated cdc2/cyclin B1 isolated from S/G2 HeLa cells and Tyr15-phosphorylated cdk2/cyclin A isolated from G1/S HeLa cells was assayed. The activity of each GST-cdc25 was assayed as a dilution series to account for the differences in the levels of each GST fusion protein expressed in bacteria, and their different relative activities. Cdc25 activity was measured by the activation of immunoprecipitated, Tyr15-phosphorylated cyclin/cdk, and quantitated in terms of the increased histone kinase activity of the complexes (Fig.2 A). Cdc25B C-terminal fragments and chimeric cdc25CB3 had the highest relative activities toward both cyclin B1/cdc2 and cyclin A/cdk2 (Fig.2, B and C). Cdc25B2 and cdc25B3 had similar levels of activity toward cyclin B1/cdc2, but cdc25B2 displayed a 2–4-fold higher activity toward cyclin A/cdk2 than cdc25B3. Neither GST-cdc25C, cdc25C C-terminal fragments, nor chimeric cdc25BC2 displayed significant activity toward cyclin A/cdk2, although GST-cdc25C and GST-cdc25C C-terminal fragments activated cyclin B1/cdc2 2–3-fold. The difference in the relative activities of the GST-cdc25s toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate and the immunoprecipitated cyclin/cdks was not a consequence of steric interference of the GST moiety, as removal of the GST moiety with thrombin followed by assay using p-nitrophenyl phosphate or immunoprecipitated cyclin B1/cdc2 gave similar relative activities (data not shown). Mitotic hyperphosphorylation of cdc25C is associated with its increased activity using a number of non-physiological substrates (10Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 11Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of cdc25B is correlated with its activity in vivo (9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effects of mitotic hyperphosphorylation on cdc25 activity toward cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdc2, the full-length GST-cdc25s and chimeras were phosphorylatedin vitro using extracts from mitotic HeLa cells. The phosphorylated cdc25s displayed the characteristically retarded electrophoretic mobilities observed for these proteins in vivo (Fig. 3 A; Refs. 9Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 10Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In these experiments, all of the GST-cdc25C was shifted to the hyperphosphorylated form as was cdc25CB3, whereas only half of the cdc25B2, cdc25B3, and cdc25BC2 was in the retarded form. The phosphorylated GST-cdc25s were assayed for their activity toward immunoprecipitated S/G2 cyclin B1/cdc2 (Fig.3 B). Hyperphosphorylation of GST-cdc25B2 and cdc25B3 resulted in 2–3-fold and 3–5-fold activation, respectively. Chimeric GST-cdc25BC2 again showed no activity after mitotic phosphorylation, although phosphorylation of the cdc25B3 N-terminal regulatory domain produced a similar change in electrophoretic mobility to that seen in the full-length cdc25Bs (Fig. 3 A). GST-cdc25CB3 showed a small increase in activity (no more than 2-fold), whereas phosphorylation of GST-cdc25C produced the greatest increase in activity, to have greater cdc25 activity on a relative mole cdc25 basis than either of the activated cdc25Bs, although this was still less than the activated GST-cdc25CB3 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). The increased histone kinase activity was not due to any histone kinase associated with the phosphorylated GST-cdc25s from the HeLa extracts used for phosphorylation, as no increase in histone kinase activity was associated with mitotic phosphorylation of the catalytically inactive GST-cdc25B3 CR/SK mutant, which was used as the control for this experiment or with GST-cdc25BC2. To determine whether the mitotic phosphorylation of the GST-cdc25s was directly responsible for the increased activities observed, the GST-cdc25s were phosphorylated as in the previous experiment, then incubated either with or without recombinant λ-phosphatase to dephosphorylate the proteins, following which the phosphatase was washed away and the GST-cdc25s assayed for activity using immunoprecipitated S/G2 cyclin B1/cdc2 and G1/S cyclin A/cdk2 as substrates. The λ-phosphatase completely dephosphorylated the GST-cdc25s in each case (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, the hyperphosphorylated GST-cdc25C was poorly stained with the anti-GST antibody, which was also seen using anti-cdc25C antibody (data not shown). The differences in the activity levels of the phospho and dephospho-forms of the GST-cdc25s for cyclin B1/cdc2 (Fig.4 B) were similar to those seen with the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GST-cdc25s in the previous experiment (Fig.3 B). Surprisingly, the mitotic phosphorylation of the GST-cdc25s had little effect on their activity toward the immunoprecipitated cyclin A/cdk2 (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). The low degree of cdc25 activation in the experiment shown was due to the relatively high histone kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated cyclin A/cdk2. Despite this high background, GST-cdc25CB3 produced a 5-fold activation, indicating that the lack of hyperphosphorylation induced increase in activity of the GST-cdc25s similar to that seen with cyclin B1/cdc2 was not due to an insensitive cyclin A/cdk2 substrate. In this experiment, anti-cdk2 immunoprecipitates were used, but a similar lack of phosphorylation dependent activation was observed using anti-cyclin A immunoprecipitates (data not shown). The small increase in GST-cdc25B3 activity with cyclin A/cdk2 was consistently observed. The mechanism by which the mitotic phosphorylation increased the activity of cdc25B and cdc25C was further investigated, taking advantage of the ability of the catalytically inactive cdc25 C/S mutants to form stable complexes with the substrate cdk-cyclin complexes (21Xu X. Burke S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The C/S mutants of GST-cdc25B2, cdc25B3, and cdc25C were hyperphosphorylated with mitotic HeLa extracts as in the previous experiments, and were used to pull down interacting cdk/cyclins from extracts of synchronized S/G2 Molt4 cells. The binding of cdk2 and cdc2 complexes was analyzed by immunoblotting, compared with the unphosphorylated GST-cdc25s as controls. The levels of hyperphosphorylation obtained were equivalent to those obtained in the earlier phosphorylation experiments (Fig.5). GST-cdc25B2 C/S mutant bound a high level of cdk2 compared with the other GST-cdc25 C/S mutants, with no phosphorylation-dependent increase, whereas GST-c"
https://openalex.org/W2013463985,"We cloned and characterized a novel human member of the STE20 serine/threonine protein kinase family named mst-3. Based on its domain structure, mst-3 belongs to the SPS1 subgroup of STE20-like proteins, which includes germinal center (GC) kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK), kinase homologous to STE20/SPS-1 (KHS), kinases responsive to stress (KRS1/2), the mammalian STE20-like kinases (mst1/2), and the recently published STE20/oxidant stress response kinase SOK-1. mst-3 is most closely related to SOK-1, with 88% amino acid similarity in the kinase domain. The similarity of the mst-3 kinase domain to STE20 is 42%. The mst-3 transcript is ubiquitously expressed, and the protein was found in all human, mouse, and monkey cell lines tested. An in vitro kinase assay showed that mst-3 can phosphorylate basic exogenous substrates as well as itself. Interestingly, mst-3 prefers Mn2+ to Mg2+ as a divalent cation and can use both GTP and ATP as phosphate donors. Like SOK-1, mst-3 is activated by autophosphorylation. However, a physiological stimulus of mst-3 activity was not identified. mst-3 activity does not change upon exposure to several mitogenic and stress stimuli. Overexpression of mst-3 wild-type or kinase dead protein affects neither the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2 or ERK6), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, nor pp70S6 kinase, suggesting that mst-3 is part of a novel signaling pathway. We cloned and characterized a novel human member of the STE20 serine/threonine protein kinase family named mst-3. Based on its domain structure, mst-3 belongs to the SPS1 subgroup of STE20-like proteins, which includes germinal center (GC) kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK), kinase homologous to STE20/SPS-1 (KHS), kinases responsive to stress (KRS1/2), the mammalian STE20-like kinases (mst1/2), and the recently published STE20/oxidant stress response kinase SOK-1. mst-3 is most closely related to SOK-1, with 88% amino acid similarity in the kinase domain. The similarity of the mst-3 kinase domain to STE20 is 42%. The mst-3 transcript is ubiquitously expressed, and the protein was found in all human, mouse, and monkey cell lines tested. An in vitro kinase assay showed that mst-3 can phosphorylate basic exogenous substrates as well as itself. Interestingly, mst-3 prefers Mn2+ to Mg2+ as a divalent cation and can use both GTP and ATP as phosphate donors. Like SOK-1, mst-3 is activated by autophosphorylation. However, a physiological stimulus of mst-3 activity was not identified. mst-3 activity does not change upon exposure to several mitogenic and stress stimuli. Overexpression of mst-3 wild-type or kinase dead protein affects neither the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2 or ERK6), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, nor pp70S6 kinase, suggesting that mst-3 is part of a novel signaling pathway. Eukaryotic cells are able to couple extracellular signals to specific biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and stress responses through the activation of distinct evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling cascades, collectively known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein. cascades. In both mammals and lower eukaryotes, the core of MAP kinase cascades is a three-component module consisting of a generic MAPK kinase kinase, which phosphorylates and activates a dual-specificity MAPK kinase, which in turn activates the MAPK. In many cases the activated MAP kinases translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors, thus eliciting the biological response (1Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least six MAPK pathways have been identified. They regulate diverse biological processes such as mating and invasive growth, cell wall integrity, and the response to high osmolarity as well as pseudohyphal development and spore formation in diploid cells (2Ammerer G.

Biol. 1996; 6: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The best characterized pathway is the mitogenic signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) through both growth factor and G protein-coupled receptors (3Blumer K.J.

Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Other mammalian MAPK pathways can be activated by a variety of stress agents like tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1, UV light, and osmotic shock and lead to the activation of the MAPKs c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 (14Hibi M.

Based on epistasis experiments, the S. cerevisiaeserine-threonine kinase STE20 was placed upstream of the MAPK module consisting of the MAPK kinase kinase STE11, the MAPK kinase STE7, and the MAPKs FUS3/KSS1 in the mating pathway (23Leberer E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on their structure and regulation, members of the STE20 family can be divided into two subfamilies. First, like STE20 and Cla-4, the mammalian PAKs consist of a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain and have a small GTPase Rac1/Cdc42 binding region. PAKs bind to GTP-Cdc42 and Rac but not Rho (28Manser E. Leung T. Salhuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 29Bagrodia S. Taylor J.S.

Upon binding, they autophosphorylate and are activated (28Manser E. Leung T. Salhuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 29Bagrodia S.

Second, all other STE20-like kinases identified thus far resemble SPS1 in that they possess an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain and do not contain a small GTPase Rac-1/Cdc42-binding domain. Coexpression studies have demonstrated that some mammalian STE20 homologues are able to activate mammalian MAPK pathways. Activated PAKs can specifically activate the JNK and p38 pathways but not the ERK pathway. GCK, HPK, and KHS can also activate JNK but not p38 or the ERKs (35Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Tung R.M. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These kinases do not contain the Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain, and JNK activation is thus presumed to be Rac1/Cdc42-independent. In this paper we describe the cloning and initial characterization of a human STE20 homologue (mst-3) with unusual kinase activity characteristics. mst-3 belongs to the Sps1 subfamily of STE20-like kinases with an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. mst-3 mRNA and protein is ubiquitously expressed. mst-3 kinase prefers manganese to magnesium as a co-factor and can use both ATP and GTP as phosphate donors. mst-3 has high basal activity and does not activate any of the known mammalian MAPK pathways. In vitro, mst-3 kinase activity is positively regulated by autophosphorylation. Immunolocalization analysis demonstrates that mst-3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on conserved regions of subdomains II and VII in the kinase domain STE20 and PAK. Sense (GT(A/G/T/C)AT(A/C/T)CA(C/T)(C/A)G(A/G/T/C)GA(C/T)AT(A/C/T)AA(A/G)) and antisense (CAT(A/G/T)AT(A/G/T/C)CC(A/G/T/C)A(G/A)A/G/T/C)(G/C)(A/T)CCA(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TC primers were used to amplify 200-nucleotide cDNA fragments from a human HeLa cell library (CLONTECH). These fragments were subcloned into pBluescript (Promega) and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence was analyzed using DNASTAR. Data base searches were done using BLAST. Several clones encoded kinase domain fragments of novel kinases related to the yeast STE20 protein. A STE20-like clone was used to screen 106 plaques of a human oligo(dT)-primed T cell library (courtesy of Dr. F. McKeon). Four plaques were purified, subcloned into pBluescript, and partially sequenced (Applied Biosystems Inc.). One clone contained full-length mst-3 but no stop codon upstream of the putative start site, and both strands were sequenced. A 5′ probe was generated and used to screen 106 plaques of a random-primed human HeLa cell library (courtesy of Dr. R. Reed). Three plaques with identical sequence were purified and isolated; one contained stop codons in all three reading frames upstream of the putative start codon. Full-length mst-3, cloned into pBluescript, was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction reactions to create in-frame constructs for further subcloning. pJ3H (courtesy of Dr. J. Chernoff) was used to create hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mst-3 (with an N-terminal stuffer of 26 amino acids). The HA-tagged mst-3 was excised from pJ3H and cloned into pcDNA for mammalian expression. pGEX4T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to create a glutathioneS-transferase fusion to full-length mst-3 for bacterial expression. A kinase-dead mst-3 was created by changing lysine 53 to arginine using site-directed polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Polyclonal antisera (αmst-3.1 and αmst-3.2) were raised in two rabbits against the bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase mst-3 protein (Cocalico). αmst-3.1 (5 μl/500 μg of protein) was used for immunoprecipitations, and αmst-3.2 (1:1,000) was used for Western blotting of about 20–50 μg of protein. Hybridized poly(A+) RNAs from human tissues were obtained (CLONTECH, courtesy of L. Cantley). A probe was generated encompassing nucleotides 1–350, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and spin column-purified (Pharmacia). The probe was used to screen the RNA blot according to manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (1Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After separation on SDS-PAGE (8 or 10%), proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), blocked for at least 1 h in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and probed with αmst-2 (1:1,000), monoclonal αHA(1:1,000), or a polyclonal ERK1/2 (1:5,000) for 1 h (room temperature) to overnight (4 °C). Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Amersham) or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim). mst-3 was immunoprecipitated essentially as described previously (1Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor changes. After a 1-h incubation with antiserum, lysates were incubated for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose 4b beads with shaking. The immunocomplexes were washed once with buffer A (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA), once with buffer C (10 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), once with high salt buffer B (1 m NaCl, 0.1% nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), and finally with ST (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2). All buffers were supplemented with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin. Assays for mst-3 kinase activity were performed as described previously (1Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unless indicated otherwise, kinase assays were performed in the presence of 5 or 10 mm MnCl2 for 3–5 min at 22–24 °C to ensure linear assay conditions in a 30-μl volume with 4 μg of histone H3 (Boehringer Mannheim) as a substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2 × sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14%). The gel was then fixed and autoradiographed. 32P incorporation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager with software from Molecular Dynamics. For [35S]methionine/cysteine biosynthetic labeling, subconfluent COS cells were labeled overnight with 1.5 mCi [35S]methionine/cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) per 10-cm tissue culture dish in 4 ml of methionine/cysteine-free medium (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Cells were lysed in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer as described before, and lysates were incubated with 10 ml of αmst1, preimmune serum, or antiserum preadsorbed with an excess of 2 μg of antigen for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose 4b beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, pellets were washed in buffer A, B, and ST, resuspended in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitated and washed as described as before. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (10%), the gel was fixed, and the precipitated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. All cell types used (HeLa, A431, 293, NIH3T3, Swiss3T3, COS) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Only PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, COS cells were seeded at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells per 6-cm dish 1 day before transfection and then transfected for 4 h using the DEAE-dextran method (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labortory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A total of 10 μg of DNA was used per 6-cm plate. NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 8 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish and transfected the following day with lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Phosphate-labeled mst-3, myelin basic protein (MBP), and H3 bands were excised from dried gels and treated as described elsewhere (2Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 254-260Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were seeded on coverslips placed in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected as described above. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed (3.7% formaldehyde, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 0.1 m NaCl) for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min, and stained with αHA monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h. Slides were then washed in PBS, 0.2% Triton. The secondary antibody, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins, was used at a 1:600 dilution for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated with Hoechst dye (1 mg/ml), and washed again. Slides were analyzed using a Zeiss microscope. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved regions in the kinase domains of yeast STE20 and p65PAK were used to amplify a 200-nucleotide fragment from a HeLa cell cDNA library. This fragment was then used as a probe to screen a T cell library (courtesy of Dr. F. McKeon). A clone encoding what appeared to be a full-length cDNA was isolated and contained a perfect Kozak consensus sequence (GCCATGG) but no stop codon upstream of the putative start codon. Therefore, a 5′ mst-3 probe (encompassing nucleotides 1–350) was generated and used to screen a random-primed HeLa cell library. One clone was isolated that contained a stop codon upstream of the putative start codon and no other candidate initiation start codon in between. However, no putative polyadenylation site was identified (Fig.1). The 2.0-kilobase cDNA contains an open reading frame of 431 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 48 kDa (Fig. 1). mst-3 contains all subdomains of serine/threonine kinases (40Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). Using the BLAST program to determine sequence homologies to other kinases, mst-3 was identified as a member of the STE20 family of protein kinases. mst-3 consists of an N-terminal kinase domain and a 142-amino acid C-terminal regulatory domain. The overall structure of mst-3 more closely resembles the SPS-1 group of the STE20 family of protein kinases (see Fig. 2 C). mst-3 is highly related to the recently published SOK-1 kinase (38Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with 88% identity in the kinase domain and 68.8% overall amino acid identity. The mst-3 kinase domain is related to the kinase domains of mst-1/KRS1 (37Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

The mst-3 C-terminal regulatory domain does not contain a Cdc42/Rac binding region and does not have any identifiable sequence motifs other than several acidic regions. Northern blot analysis using poly(A+) RNA from multiple human tissues demonstrated that the mst-3 transcript is ubiquitously expressed (Fig.3). Under high stringency conditions, using a unique region upstream of the kinase domain as a probe, a single 2-kilobase mRNA was detected that is expressed at highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. To confirm equal loading of mRNAs, the blot was re-probed using a human β-actin probe (data not shown). The expression of mst-3 protein was examined using Western blot analysis. A polyclonal antiserum (αmst-3) raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the full-length mst-3 protein recognized a protein of about 52 kDa in all human (Hela, C2C12, 293, A431), mouse (NIH3T3), and monkey cells (COS) tested (Fig.4 A). The increased apparent molecular mass could be due to posttranslational modifications. Using either preimmune serum or antibody preadsorbed with antigen abolished the signal, demonstrating the specificity of the αmst-3 serum (data not shown). An HA-tagged recombinant mst-3 (HAmst-3) that contained a 26-amino acid extension at the N terminus could be detected as a slower migrating band on Western blots when transfected into COS cells (Fig. 4 A). αmst-3 also immunoprecipitated a single protein of the same size from35S-labeled COS cell lysates under denaturing conditions (Fig. 4 B, lane 2) that was absent from immunoprecipitates performed using identical conditions but with either preimmune serum (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) or antigen-preadsorbed αmst-3 antiserum (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) for the immunoprecipitation. αmst-3 was used to immunopreciptate endogenous mst-3 from COS lysates to develop anin vitro kinase assay. No phosphotransferase activity above the control preimmune precipitates was detected using histones H1, H2, H4, casein, and phosvitin as substrates (data not shown). However, mst-3 readily phosphorylated MBP and histone H3 at levels significantly above control (Fig. 5 A). A phosphoprotein migrating at the size of mst-3 was also detected, suggesting that mst-3 autophosphorylates (Fig. 5 A,lanes 2 and 4). Although the presence of a protein in the immunocomplex that phosphorylates mst-3 cannot be excluded, it is unlikely since the phosphoprotein was still present after immunoprecipitates were washed in buffer C containing 0.1% SDS and absent in immunoprecipitates from HA-tagged kinase-dead mst-3 (HAmst-3-KR)-transfected COS cell lysates (Fig. 5 C,lanes 6 and 8). Substrate phosphorylation was abolished when αmst-3 was preadsorbed with antigen before the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5 B, lane 9). To determine the mst-3 cofactor requirements, mst-3 activity was examined using either Mn2+ or Mg2+ in thein vitro kinase assay. HA-tagged wild-type (HAmst-3wt) or HAmst-3KR was transfected into COS cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using either preimmune serum (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or a polyclonal αHA antibody (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2, 4, 6,and8). Untransfected COS cell lysates were precipitated either with preimmune serum (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10 and12), αmst-3 serum (Fig. 5 B, lanes 11and 13), or with antigen-preadsorbed αmst-3 (Fig.5 B, lane 9) to precipitate endogenous mst-3.In vitro kinase assays were then performed in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or 5 mmMnCl2 and 1 μm ATP using histone H3 as a substrate. Interestingly, under these conditions, mst-3 catalytic activity was consistently found to be 20–50-fold higher in the presence of Mn2+ compared with Mg2+. Similarily, the autokinase activity in the presence of manganese was elevated (Fig. 5 C, compare lane 2 with lane 4). No activity above background can be immunoprecipitated from lysates expressing HAmst-3KR, suggesting that the observed activity is not due to coimmunoprecipitated enzymes (Fig. 5 C,lanes 6 and 8). The intracellular concentration of Mn2+ is in the μm range, whereas the Mg2+ concentration is in the mm range (42White M.F. Kahn C.R. Enzymes. 1986; 17: 248-361Google Scholar).

Whereas nuclear hnRNP A1 has been shown to bind intronic sequences and modulate splicing, cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is associated with poly(A)+ RNA, indicating different RNA ligand specificity. Previous studies indicated that cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is capable of high-affinity binding of reiterated AUUUA sequences (ARE) that have been shown to modulate mRNA turnover and translation. Through a combination of two-dimensional gel and proteolysis studies, we establish hnRNP A1 (or structurally related proteins that are post-translationally regulated in an identical manner) as the dominant cytoplasmic protein in human T lymphocytes capable of interacting with the ARE contained within the context of full-length granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA. We additionally demonstrate that cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 preferentially binds ARE relative to pre-mRNAs in both cross-linking and mobility shift experiments. RNA polymerase II inhibition increased the binding of ARE (AUBP activity) and poly(U)-Sepharose by cytoplasmic hnRNP A1, while nuclear hnRNP A1 binding was unaffected. Nuclear and cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 could be distinguished by the differential sensitivity of their RNA binding to diamide and N-ethylmaleimide. The increase in AUBP activity of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 following RNA polymerase II inhibition correlated with serine-threonine dephosphorylation, as determined by inhibitor and metabolic labeling studies. Thus, cytoplasmic and nuclear hnRNP A1 exhibit different RNA binding profiles, perhaps transduced through serine-threonine phosphorylation.

Studies of hnRNP-RNA interactions have demonstrated sequence-specific binding, both in vitroand in vivo (3Amero S.A. Matunis M.J. Matunis E.L. Hockensmith J.W. Raychaudhuri G. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell.

Similar findings have been made with recombinant hnRNP A1 (9Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Buvoli M. Cobianchi F. Biamonti G. Riva S.

These findings are of functional interest because hnRNP A1 has been shown to modulate the effects of splicing factor 2 (SF2/ASF), and promote distal 5′-splice site selection (8Mayrand S.H.

The role of hnRNP A1 in mRNA metabolism expanded with demonstration that hnRNP A1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (14Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). With inhibition of RNA polymerase II transcription, hnRNP A1 rapidly accumulates in the cytoplasm in association with poly(A)+RNA (14Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), indicating that cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 recognizes and binds non-intronic mRNA sequences under these conditions. These findings suggest that hnRNP A1 exhibits different RNA binding specificity in the cytoplasm relative to the nucleus, perhaps enabling distinct functional roles pertinent to RNA metabolism in each subcellular compartment, in a manner not dissimilar to other proteins involved in RNA metabolism that exhibit dual functions (15Klausner R.D.

In previous work, our laboratory demonstrated five cytoplasmic proteins in activated human T lymphocytes which are capable of binding the highly conserved AU-rich elements (ARE) in oligoribonucleotide probes representative of the 3′-untranslated region of lymphokines and proto-oncogenes (18Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consisting of reiterations of the pentanucleotide AUUUA or oligo(U)4–7 sequences in an AU-rich context, ARE are capable of modulating mRNA turnover and translation in heterologous constructs (Refs. 19Greenberg M.E.

The ARE have been shown to serve as binding sites for cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (AU-rich binding proteins; AUBP) that may function as trans-acting factors in regulating ARE-dependent mRNA turnover and translation (26Bohjanen P.R.

A major component of ARE binding activity in activated lymphocytes, the 35-kDa AUBP, was shown by immunoprecipitation to contain hnRNP A1, although the presence of other co-migrating proteins could not be excluded. Other studies have suggested the functional relevance of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1-mRNA interactions in terms of mRNA stability. RNA polymerase II inhibition decreases ARE-dependent mRNA turnover of c-fos mRNA (33Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), paralleling the marked increase in cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 levels (14Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 18Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stabilization of interleukin-2 mRNA turnover in the MLA-144 cell line is associated with a proviral insertion that enhanced hnRNP A1 binding to its ARE relative to native interleukin-2 or GM-CSF (34Chen S.J. Holbrook N.J. Mitchell K.F. Vallone C.A. Greengard J.S. Crabtree G.R. Lin Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7284-7289Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Henics T. Sanfridson A. Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5377-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased ARE binding by hnRNP A1 thus correlated with mRNA stability in vivo, similar to observations made with AUBF, a similarly sized protein, in an in vitro model of ARE-dependent mRNA turnover (31Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23882-23888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These past studies generated several important questions regarding the cytoplasmic 35-kDa AUBP/hnRNP A1 and regulation of its RNA binding specificity in terms of understanding ARE-dependent mRNA turnover. Is the cytoplasmic 35-kDa AUBP activity made up of other proteins besides hnRNP A1 (17Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 36Katz D.A. Theodorakis N.G. Cleveland D.W. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)? If hnRNP A1 is an important cytoplasmic AUBP, do its cytoplasmic and nuclear forms differ in their RNA binding specificity? Third, what modulates the quantitative increase in cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 that accompanies RNA polymerase II inhibition and how is this affect transduced? In this paper, we establish that hnRNP A1 (or closely related proteins that are post-translationally regulated in an identical manner) is the dominant cytoplasmic protein capable of interacting with the ARE contained within full-length GM-CSF mRNA. Moreover, AUBP activity of cytoplasmic and nuclear hnRNP A1 are differentially regulated: RNA polymerase II inhibition appears to increase the binding specificity of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 for ARE relative to other RNA ligands to a greater degree than its nuclear counterpart. Metabolic labeling and phosphatase inhibitor studies indicate that RNA binding by cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is regulated by serine-threonine phosphorylation. These findings are relevant to the regulation of RNA-protein interactions as well as the specific ability of hnRNP A1 to serve distinct roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Cytoplasmic extracts prepared from 20-h PHA (1 μg/ml) + 2-h actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) were incubated with32P-GM-CSF (8 × 104 cpm), UV cross-linked, and digested with RNase as described above. RNA-protein complexes were incubated with 15 ng of trypsin (2000:1, w/w) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 325 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 1, 2, or 3 h at room temperature. Trypsin digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling followed by analysis under denaturing conditions by 12% SDS-PAGE. Assays were performed as described previously (5Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss B. Mol Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic (100 μg) or nucleoplasmic (25 μg) extracts prepared from 20-h PHA + 2-h actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or ethanol control were incubated with poly(U)-Sepharose beads in 12 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.2 μm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and the specified concentration of NaCl for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The quantity of poly(U)-Sepharose beads (50 μl packed) used was in excess of the amount capable of completely depleting all hnRNP A1 from lysates when incubated in the absence of salt. Beads were washed extensively with the same binding buffer (6 × 500 μl) before addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE denaturing gel. Proteins were electrotransferred as described above and immunoblotted with 4B10 to detect hnRNP A1. Similar results were obtained with cytoplasmic lysates whose total hnRNP A1 levels were adjusted to have equivalent levels of hnRNP A1 between control and actinomycin D-treated samples. Two-dimensional NEPHGE was done as described by O'Farrell et al. (40O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). 100 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were separated in the first dimension with pH 3–10 ampholines (Bio-Rad) at 400 V for 135 min (900 volt-h). The second dimension was reducing denaturing 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred as described above followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting. Polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of hnRNP A1 (ACT-1) was raised in a rabbit through immunization with KLH-C-terminal peptide complex, where disulfide linkage of the N-terminal cysteine of the synthesized peptide CGYGGSSSSSSYGSGRRF was used to couple the peptide to KLH. Rabbit antiserum obtained was affinity purified by passage over a Sulfolink column (Pierce) to which disulfide linkage of the peptide had been used to immobilize the peptide. Eluted antibody was specific for hnRNP A1 and did not react with any other hnRNP proteins. Affinity-purified antibody was covalently cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads per manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (1 × 108) were cultured as described above for 20 h before washing four times with phosphate-free medium. Cells were cultured 1 h in phosphate-free RPMI (Bio-Labs, Rockville, MD) plus 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum before addition of 10 mCi of [ortho-32P]H3PO4 for 3.5 h. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or ethanol control was added for 2 h before preparing cytoplasmic extracts. Extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads before immunoprecipitation with ACT-1-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C on rotator in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmPefabloc, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A. The beads were washed extensively before addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Samples were electrophoresed by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose before autoradiography and immunoblotting. Under these conditions, lysates are cleared of all immunoreactive hnRNP A1, as measured by Western blotting of immunodepleted lysates with 4B10 or ACT-1. The relative RNA binding specificity of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 from mitogenic lectin-PHA-activated human T lymphocytes for ARE and 3′-intron splice sites was initially analyzed by incubation with radiolabeled [32P]UTP-RNA (full-length GM-CSF mRNA and β-globin pre-mRNA shown in TableI) followed by UV cross-linking, RNase digestion, SDS-PAGE, and electroblotting on nitrocellulose (Fig.1), as previously described (18Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic lysates demonstrated qualitative differences in their RNA binding profile relative to previous studies with oligoribonucleotide probes containing ARE (18Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, a 35-kDa protein appeared to be the major protein labeled by UV cross-linking following incubation with full-length GM-CSF, which colocalized with hnRNP A1 by subsequent immunoblotting. Second, this 35-kDa complex demonstrated a much higher degree of labeling (reflecting binding and subsequent UV cross-linking) with GM-CSF relative to that seen with a β-globin pre-mRNA transcript.Table IRNA sequences used in AUBP assaysRNA sequencesΔ2R15′-GGAUCCAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAAGCUUGG-3′Δ2R1:U → C5′-GGAUCCAUCUAUCUAUCUAUCUAAGCUUGG-3′Δ2H35′-CCUAGGUAAAUAAAUAAAUAAAUUCGAACC-3′GM-CSF5′-AUG-(N)597AAGAAUGGGAAUAUUUUAUACUGACAGAAAUCAGUAAUAUUUAUAUAUUUAUAUUUUUAAAAUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAAGUUCAUAUUCCAUAUUUAUUCAAGAUGUUUUACCGUAAUAAUUAUAUUAAAAAUAUGCUUCUAAA–3′β-Globin5′-(N)246UUGGUAUCAAGGUUACAAGACAGGUUUAAGGAGACCAAUAGAAACUGGGCAUGUGGAGACAGAGAAGACUCUUGGGUUUCUGAUAGGCACUGACUCUCUCUGCCUAUUGGUCUAUUUUCCCACCCUUAG(N)23-3′DUP33Y55′-(N)246UUGGUAUCAAGGUUACAAGACAGGUUUAAGGAGACCAAUAGAAACUGGGCAUGUGGAGACAGAGAAGACUCUUGGGUUUCUGAUAGGCACUGA[CUCUCUCU C CCU U UU UC UCU U UUUUCCCACCCUUAG](N)33UUGGUAUCAAGGUUACAAGACAGGUUUAAGGAGACCAAUAGAAACUGGGCAUGUGGAGACAGAGAAGACUCUUGGGUUUCUGAUAGGCACUGACUCUCUCUGCCUAUUGGUCUAUUUUCCCACCCUUAG(N)210-3′The AUUUA sequences in GM-CSF and Δ2R1 are underlined.

Thus, DUP33Y5 is very similar to the β-globin, with two intronic sequences that are identical to that found in the β-globin probe, but for the presence of 28 uninterrupted pyrimidines in the first. Following actinomycin D treatment, increased 35-kDa GM-CSF and β-globin binding activity was observed, but the relative binding intensity of these two RNA probes was maintained. Relative to the other proteins (68, 50, and 40 kDa) bound and labeled by these RNA, the cytoplasmic 35-kDa protein demonstrated not only the greatest level of binding, but also the greatest differential of labeling between the GM-CSF and β-globin pre-mRNA transcripts. In other experiments, the cytoplasmic 35-kDa AUBP consistently bound more effectively to β-globin than DUP33Y5 pre-mRNA (data not shown). The DUP33Y5 pre-mRNA transcript contains two 3′-splice sites, the distal one identical to that contained in the β-globin pre-mRNA, while its proximal site contains several oligouridine sequences (Table I), thereby controlling for oligouridine-dependent effects on RNA binding and cross-linking. From these studies, we infer that the increased binding of the 35-kDa AUBP to the GM-CSF mRNA sequence relative to β-globin pre-mRNA cannot be accounted for by the presence of o"
https://openalex.org/W2004721490,"The HECA452 carbohydrate epitope, also termed cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, is known to bind to E-selectin and defines a human T cell subset preferentially found in inflamed skin. Activated T cells can express a functional form of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), the major ligand known for P-selectin. Here we show that PSGL-1 can exist in two forms, of which only one carries the HECA452 epitope and binds to E-selectin, while the other only binds to P-selectin. We have analyzed the glycoprotein ligands for E- and P-selectin on the mouse CD8+ T cell clone 4G3 at 4, 8, and 12 days after antigen-specific activation. Only at day 4 did the cells bind to E-selectin, whereas cells at all three activation stages bound to P-selectin. Expression of the HECA452 epitope correlated with E-selectin binding. In affinity isolation experiments, PSGL-1 was isolated as the major ligand by E-selectin-IgG and by P-selectin-IgG; however, PSGL-1 only bound to E-selectin at day 4, whereas it bound to P-selectin at all three activation stages. Immunoprecipitated PSGL-1 from cells at day 4, but not from cells at days 8 and 12, was recognized in immunoblots by monoclonal antibody HECA452. In immunoblots of total extracts of cells at day 4, HECA452 recognized a 240/140-kDa pair of protein bands as the major antigen. These bands could be completely removed by depletion of cell extracts with anti-PSGL-1 antibodies. Our data suggest that the carbohydrate requirements for binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin differ from those necessary for binding to E-selectin. Furthermore, we conclude that the major glycoprotein carrier for the HECA452 epitope on activated 4G3 cells is PSGL-1.

The selectins are a family of three carbohydrate-binding cell adhesion molecules that mediate initial interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells leading to leukocyte extravasation (1$$Google Scholar). Among other leukocytes, the two endothelial selectins E- and P-selectin bind previously activated “memory” T cells (2Picker L.J. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Warnock R.A. Butcher E.C.

In addition, sulfation of tyrosine residues within the first 10 N-terminal amino acids of the mature protein was found to be essential for P-selectin binding (10Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M.

Cloning of mouse PSGL-1 allowed to generate antibodies against an N-terminal peptide, which blocked binding of mouse neutrophils to P-selectin in vitro (15Yang J. Galipeau J. Kozak C.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4176-4186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the help of similar polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, the importance of mouse PSGL-1 for the entry of neutrophils into inflamed peritoneum and of T helper 1 lymphocytes into inflamed skin could recently be demonstrated in vivo (16Borges E.

Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Human PSGL-1 was also demonstrated to bind to E-selectin (8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R.

Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural requirements for binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin differ from those for the binding to E-selectin, since tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1 is only necessary for P-selectin binding (19Li F.

It has not yet been analyzed whether the carbohydrate modifications that mediate the binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin differ from those that are involved in the binding to E-selectin. A subpopulation of human T lymphocytes that avidly binds to E-selectin and is enriched in sites of chronic inflammation in the skin was reported to express a carbohydrate antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) HECA452 (2Picker L.J. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Warnock R.A. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1991; 349: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 3Shimizu Y. Shaw S. Graber N. Gopal T.V. Horgan K.J. van Seventer G.A. Newman W. Nature. 1991; 349: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Based on the enrichment of this antigen on skin-located T cells, it was termed cutaneous lymphocyte antigen. The mAb HECA452 was shown to block lymphocyte binding to E-selectin (20De Boer O.J. Horst E. Pals S.T. Bos J.D. Das P.K. Immunology. 1994; 81: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar, 21Berg E.L. Yoshino T.

The tetrasacharide moieties sialyl Lewis x (sLex) and its stereoisomer sialyl Lewis a (sLea) are recognized by HECA452. However, the exact nature of the carbohydrate epitope that is recognized by this antibody on skin-located T cells is still unknown, since these cells are largely negative for sLex and sLea (21Berg E.L.

The Selectins: Initiators of Leukocyte Endothelial Adhesion. 3. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1997: 143-177Google Scholar). It is also still unknown which glycoproteins are the carriers of the interesting HECA452 carbohydrate epitope. In this study, we have analyzed the glycoprotein ligands of E- and P-selectin on the mouse T cell clone 4G3 after antigen-specific activation. We found that PSGL-1 is the major ligand that could be affinity-isolated from these cells with E- and P-selectin-IgG. The E-selectin-binding form of PSGL-1 carried the carbohydrate epitope HECA452, while binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin was independent of this epitope. Furthermore, PSGL-1 was the major glycoprotein on activated cells modified by this carbohydrate structure.

The fusion proteins P-selectin-IgG, E-selectin-IgG, and VE-cadherin-IgG have been produced as described elsewhere (26Hahne M. Jäger U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugated antibodies and streptavidin were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Adherent 4G3 cells were harvested by cooling the plate for 10 min to 4 °C followed by gentle pipetting. Cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml selectin-IgG chimera, 10 μg/ml rabbit antibodies, or 50 μg/ml purified mouse IgM mAb in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum and 0.04% azide or with rat hybridoma supernatant for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-human IgG, FITC-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG, FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgM, or FITC-labeled goat anti-rat IgG and IgM, respectively. Analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) FACSCalibur with CellQuest analysis software. Assays were basically performed as described (32Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using detergent-extracted 4G3 cells and 3′-sialyllactosamine as acceptor oligosaccharide. To obtain values solely due to fucosylation of acceptor substrate, total counts of the control (without acceptor substrate) were subtracted from total counts of samples with acceptor. The activity of the fucosyltransferase-containing cell extract was calculated as pmol/min/mg. Adhesion assays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates coated with 5 μg/ml selectin-IgG chimera or human IgG in Hanks' balanced salt solution (18Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 5 × 105 cells/well were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C under mild rotating conditions (80 rpm). Plates were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma), and evaluated by computer-aided image analysis with the NIH Image 1.55 software (17Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R. Hamann A. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, cells were preincubated with 5-fold concentrated supernatant for 30 min on ice and washed once before the addition to the microtiter plates. Cells were surface-biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (17Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R. Hamann A. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 18Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll). Filters were analyzed for biotinylated proteins with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dianova) and the ECL system (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Alternatively, nonlabeled cells were subjected to immunoprecipitations, and precipitated antigens were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total cell lysates (5 × 106 cells/lane) or affinity-isolated material was separated by electrophoresis on 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry blotting (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked with 4% defatted milk powder (Saliter, Oberguenzburg, Germany) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated with 10 μg/ml antibodies in 4% milk powder/TBS or with hybridoma supernatant. Blots were washed with 4% milk powder/TBS and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 4% milk powder/TBS. After washing with TBS, blots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham). Alternatively, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody was used and detected with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI). 2 × 107 cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2). For depletion, half of the cell extract was incubated at 4 °C with 20 μg of antibody bound to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Incubations were repeated twice, and each round of incubation was for 8 h. Depletions were done with a mixture of affinity-purified anti-PSGL-1 antibodies from either antisera 703 and 002 or antisera 703 and 124. For negative control depletions, IgG from a nonimmune rabbit serum was used. Depleted lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed in immunoblots with mAb HECA452. The mouse CD8+ T cell clone 4G3 recognizes an ovalbumin epitope in combination with the major histocompatibility complex molecule Kb. 4G3 cells were restimulated every other week in an antigen-specific manner with EG7-OVA cells, which were derived by ovalbumin transfection of EL4 cells. The activation cycle peaks in an activation maximum after 4 days when cells are blasted, highly cytotoxic, and proliferate at maximal rates. The activation level gradually declines in the following 8 days to base-line levels before they have to be restimulated. Cells at day 12 represent the cells that are restimulated at day 0. At days 4, 8, and 12 after stimulation, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for binding of the mAb HECA452, affinity-purified rabbit antibodies (antiserum 124) against the N terminus of mouse PSGL-1, and the antibody-like selectin fusion proteins E-selectin-IgG and P-selectin-IgG. At 4 days after stimulation, cells strongly expressed the HECA452 epitope as well as ligands for E- and P-selectin (Fig. 1). In contrast, cells at days 8 and 12 showed strongly reduced binding for HECA452 as well as for E-selectin-IgG, while binding of P-selectin-IgG was unchanged. The mean fluorescence intensity for HECA452 decreased from 721 at day 4 to 76 at day 8 and 40 at day 12, and for E-selectin-IgG it decreased from 609 at day 4 to 10 at day 8. The expression level of PSGL-1 was similar on cells of all three activation states (mean fluorescence intensities of 921, 751, and 590 at days 4, 8, and 12, respectively). The observed slight decrease of the mean fluorescence intensity for PSGL-1 was probably due to a decrease of cell size at days 8 and 12. Binding of the mAb HECA452 to 4G3 cells at the three activation states was compared with the binding of three other mouse IgM antibodies against sLex. While the CSLEX-1 antibody did not show significant binding, the antibodies 2F3 and 2H5 stained cells at day 4 (Fig. 2). No staining with any of the antibodies was observed at days 8 and 12. These data indicate that the sLex-related HECA452 epitope is different from the CSLEX-1 epitope but similar to the sLex-related epitopes defined by 2F3 and 2H5. These data agree with published evidence that the CSLEX-1 epitope is absent in the mouse (30Sawada M. Takada A. Ohwaki I. Takahashi N. Tateno H. Sakamoto J. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Tamatani T. Suematsu M. Tezuka K. Hanzawa N. Tsuji T. Ishimura Y. Kannagi R. Toyoshima S. Homma M. Am. J.

Toyoshima S. Homma M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1282-H1287PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of sLex-like structures requires the expression of an α-(1,3/1,4)-fucosyltransferase activity. Therefore, we analyzed the expression level of such enzymes in in vitrofucosyltransferase assays using detergent extracts of 4G3 cells at days 4 and 8 and the acceptor oligosaccharide 3′-sialyllactosamine. Cells at day 4 expressed 6.6-fold higher enzyme levels (5.0 ± 1, 7 pmol/min/mg) than cells at day 8 (0.76 ± 0.05 pmol/min/mg). Cells at days 4 and 8 were analyzed in static cell adhesion assays in 96-well microtiter plates for their ability to bind to immobilized E- and P-selectin-IgG. Correlating with the expression of the HECA452 epitope (Fig. 1) only cells at day 4 bound to E-selectin-IgG, while cells at day 8 did not bind (Fig.3 A). This binding could be blocked by 80% (± 6.6%) when the cells were preincubated with the mAb HECA452, demonstrating the relevance of this carbohydrate modification as E-selectin ligand on 4G3 cells (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the binding to E-selectin, cells at day 4 bound with similar efficiency to P-selectin-IgG as cells at day 8 (Fig.3 A), indicating that the HECA452 epitope is not necessary for cell binding to P-selectin. The mAb HECA452 could partially inhibit the binding of cells at day 4 to P-selectin-IgG by 41% (± 10.8%), indicating either that this carbohydrate epitope is overlapping with the carbohydrate epitope necessary for binding to P-selectin or that the HECA452 epitope can be involved in P-selectin binding if it is expressed. Activated 4G3 cells were surface-labeled by biotinylation and subjected to immunoprecipitations with E-selectin-IgG, P-selectin-IgG, and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies 124 against the N terminus of mouse PSGL-1. E-selectin-IgG and P-selectin-IgG recognized bands of similar molecular mass as the 240-kDa dimeric form and the 140-kDa monomeric form of PSGL-1 on 4G3 cells at day 4 (Fig.4). Reprecipitation of the proteins precipitated by the antibody-like selectin fusion proteins revealed that they were identical with PSGL-1 (not shown). PSGL-1 from cells at day 8 could not be precipitated by E-selectin-IgG, but it was efficiently precipitated by P-selectin-IgG (Fig. 4); the same result was seen for cells at day 12 (not shown). These data indicate that PSGL-1 is the major glycoprotein ligand that can be affinity isolated by both selectins from these cells. Furthermore, these data reveal that PSGL-1 on cells of later activation states is not able to bind to E-selectin, while it has retained its ability to bind to P-selectin. Cell extracts of 4G3 cells at all three activation states were subjected to immunoprecipitations with affinity-purified antibodies 703 against the C terminus of PSGL-1, and precipitated material was analyzed in immunoblots with mAb HECA452. As shown in Fig.5, only PSGL-1 from cells at day 4 carried the HECA452 carbohydrate epitope, while PSGL-1 from cells at day 8 was only very faintly positive and PSGL-1 from cells at day 12 was negative for this epitope. In conjunction with the data of Fig. 4, these data indicate that PSGL-1 binds to E-selectin only when it expresses the HECA452 epitope, while the binding to P-selectin does not correlate with the expression of this carbohydrate epitope. In immunoblots of total cell extracts of 4G3 cells at day 4, mAb HECA452 reacted with one broad band at 140 kDa (Fig. 6 A), which appeared as a double band in some experiments. Similarly, the 140-kDa monomeric form of PSGL-1 appeared as a doublet, especially when the sample was intensively boiled before electrophoreses, as shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 6 B. To examine whether the HECA452-reactive band represents PSGL-1 or also represents other proteins, we depleted total cell extracts for PSGL-1 by three successive rounds of incubation with affinity-purified anti-PSGL-1 antibodies using a mixture of either antibodies 703 and 002 or of antibodies 703 and 124. Immunoblots of the residual proteins of the depleted extracts revealed that all of the HECA452-reactive material had been removed during PSGL-1 depletion (Fig. 7 A). The same blot was reprobed with the anti-PSGL-1 antibodies 703 to confirm complete depletion (Fig. 7 B). Thus, PSGL-1 is the major glycoprotein carrier of the HECA452 cells on highly activated 4G3 cells.Figure 7The HECA452-reactive glycoprotein can be completely removed with antibodies against PSGL-1. Detergent extracts of activated 4G3 cells at day 4 were depleted by three rounds of incubation with protein A-Sepharose loaded either with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against mouse PSGL-1 (αPSGL) or with control rabbit antibodies (Co). Residual proteins of depleted cell extracts were analyzed in immunoblots with mAb HECA452 (A) or antibodies against PSGL-1 (B). As a further negative control, cell lysis buffer that had been incubated with protein A-Sepharose loaded with rabbit IgG was electrophoresed on the same gel (lysis buffer), immunoblotted, and analyzed with mAb HECA452. Note that the HECA452-reactive cellular material was completely removed upon depletion with anti PSGL-1 antibodies. The blot that was used inA was reprobed in B. The depicted experiment represents one of four similar experiments.

We found that antigen-specific activation transiently stimulates expression of the E-selectin-binding carbohydrate epitope HECA452 on PSGL-1 and enables PSGL-1 to bind to E-selectin. In contrast, binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin was independent of this carbohydrate modification. Furthermore, PSGL-1, known to be the major ligand for P-selectin on most leukocytes, was the only ligand that could be affinity-isolated with E-selectin-IgG and was the major glycoprotein carrier of the HECA452 epitope in the cell. Our results suggest the following. First, the binding of PSGL-1 to E-selectin requires posttranslational modifications that are not necessary for the binding to P-selectin. Second, if the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen is indeed a glycoprotein, it is mainly represented by PSGL-1 on highly activated 4G3 cells. Binding of PSGL-1 to E-selectin has been reported before (8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1887-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In a detailed study it was shown that PSGL-1 requires core 2O-linked glycans that are sialylated and fucosylated to bind P- and E-selectin (19Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sulfation of tyrosine residues was only essential for the binding to P-selectin but not necessary for the binding to E-selectin (19Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These studies may suggest that fewer or less complex posttranslational modifications are necessary for the binding to E-selectin than for the binding to P-selectin. In agreement with this, more glycoprotein ligands have been described for E-selectin than for P-selectin (35Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7390-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 36Vestweber D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the criteria that define an E-selectin ligand would be somewhat less stringent than those that define a P-selectin ligand. Our results provide evidence for a different scenario, suggesting that the recognition motif of E-selectin is not necessarily simpler than that of P-selectin. We describe isoforms of PSGL-1 that carry all of the postranslational modifications necessary for the binding to P-selectin but that still lack necessary modifications for the binding to E-selectin. Thus, each of the two endothelial selectins requires structural elements for binding of PSGL-1 that are not required for the other selectin. Although our data do not provide direct evidence, it is likely that at least some of the modifications specifically necessary for the binding to E-selectin are represented by the carbohydrate epitope HECA452. A decisive step in the generation of the HECA452 epitope and the ligand structures recognized by E- and P-selectin is the expression of an α-(1,3/1,4)-fucosyltransferase. A central question arising from the current study is how the E-selectin and the P-selectin binding activities of PSGL-1 could be differentially regulated and what the structural differences between both recognition motifs are. Since we found a high activity of a fucosyltransferase in 4G3 cells at day 4 but low levels at day 8, a simple answer would be that the expression of the E-selectin binding activity (and the HECA452 epitope) might require higher levels of a fucosyltransferase than the expression of the P-selectin binding activity. The sLex/sLea-related HECA452 epitope might only be formed if a certain density of correctly modified carbohydrate side chains has been generated, while the ability to bind to P-selectin might already be generated if a lower density of similar carbohydrate motifs is expressed on the PSGL-1 polypeptide motif. In this way a quantitative difference of fucosylation could generate qualitative differences in the recognition motif. An alternative explanation for the differences between the E- and P-selectin recognition motifs would be that the E-selectin binding epitope might consist of further components in addition to fucosylated sialolactosamine. Indeed, the HECA452 epitope on 4G3 cells is different from sLex as it is defined by the mAb CSLEX-1, since highly activated 4G3 cells were negative for CSLEX-1. Whatever explanation might be correct, our results establish that the binding activity of PSGL-1 for P- and E-selectin can be independently regulated for each of the two selectins. It has been reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation of Jurkat cells and stimulation of human T lymphoblasts induce HECA452 and CSLEX-1 epitopes as well as E-selectin binding activity (37Knibbs R.N. Craig R.A. Natsuka S. Chang A. Cameron M. Lowe J.B. Stoolman L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which could be linked to the induction of FucTVII. Induction of the HECA452 epitope on human T cells was found upon stimulation with transforming growth factor-β1 and interleukin-2 (38Picker L.J. Treer J.R. Ferguson Darnell B. Collins P.A.

Another study described different human CD4+ T cell clones, which expressed different levels of the HECA452 epitope correlating with the ability of these cells to attach to E-selectin (41Rossiter H. van Reijsen F.

Kupper T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The current study is the first to show that the HECA452 epitope can be induced by antigen-specific activation and that this epitope can be expressed on mouse cells. The remarkable selectivity with which PSGL-1 was modified with the HECA452 epitope in 4G3 cells is reminiscent of what we described recently for another ligand of E-selectin, the E-selectin ligand-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In highly activated 4G3 cells, the level of ESL-1 was too low to be recognized with the mAb HECA452 in immunoblots (data not shown). The mechanism that allows us to selectively generate the HECA452 epitope on only very few glycoproteins will be of central importance in understanding the regulation of E-selectin ligand expression. The fact that PSGL-1 is the only glycoprotein ligand that could be isolated with E-selectin-IgG as affinity probe suggests that PSGL-1 represents a significant ligand for E-selectin. This is further supported by the finding that PSGL-1 is the major glycoprotein carrier of the HECA452 epitope, a carbohydrate structure that is likely to be involved in E-selectin binding. Unfortunately, no antibodies against mouse PSGL-1 are available that could specifically block the interaction between PSGL-1 and E-selectin. Therefore, direct evidence is still lacking that would allow us to determine to what extent the HECA452-modified isoform of PSGL-1 is involved in cell attachment to E-selectin. The best evidence that PSGL-1 can indeed mediate cell rolling on E-selectin was reported by Patel et al. (34Patel K.D. Moore K.L. Nollert M.U. McEver R.P. J. Cin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1887-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), who showed that the mAb PL1 against human PSGL-1 can inhibit rolling of HL60 cells and human neutrophils on E-selectin by about 70%. In agreement with these results, we found that PSGL-1 isolated from HL60 cells reacts with mAb HECA452 in immunoblots (data not shown). In summary, the current study suggests that PSGL-1 is a good candidate for an important presenter of functionally relevant HECA452 epitopes on highly activated T cells. In the future, it will be important to directly examine the role of PSGL-1 in leukocyte interactions with E-selectin. We thank Dr. Peter Walden for kindly providing the 4G3 and EG7-OVA cells."

One of the first intracellular steps required for skeletal muscle contraction is release of Ca2+ ions in the muscle cell, leading to a protein-protein interaction cascade and sliding of the thin and thick filaments past one another in the contractile or power stroke (for reviews see Refs. 1Tobacman L.S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium-saturated TnC binds to TnI relieving the inhibition of muscle contraction (Refs. 5Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar and 6Head J.F. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and references therein). The crystal structures of TnC revealed a dumbbell shaped molecule with two distinct domains joined by a helical linker (7Herzberg O. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 8Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendal W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1628-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TnC contains four EF-hand calcium binding motifs, two in each of the N- and C-terminal domains (9Leavis P.C. Rosenfeld S.S. Gergely J. Grabarek Z. Drabikowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5452-5459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal or regulatory domain of TnC (N-TnC) was devoid of calcium under the crystallization conditions and showed a “closed” structure. This domain was postulated to open upon calcium binding in the Herzberg-Moult-James model for calcium-saturated conformation of TnC exposing nonpolar residues and creating a hydrophobic pocket (10Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opening of the regulatory domain in response to calcium binding was demonstrated by the NMR solution structures of the calcium-saturated N-terminal domain and whole TnC molecules (11Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Comparison of these structures demonstrated that isolation of the N-terminal domain does not significantly alter the effects of Ca2+ binding. Interestingly, calcium-saturated cardiac N-TnC remains in the closed conformation (13Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol.

Although there have been several studies investigating the interaction of TnC and TnI, no high resolution three-dimensional structures of TnI or the TnC·TnI complex are available (3Farah C.S.

We know that TnI binds TnC and actin and inhibits the actomyosin ATPase in the absence of calcium. However, it was not known exactly which residues of TnI bind to TnC nor where this complex occurs on TnC. Mutation studies (23Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have suggested that the exposed TnC hydrophobic pockets are the site of TnC·TnI interaction. Interestingly the TnC·TnI complex formation was insensitive to calcium unless tropomyosin and other members of the troponin complex were present, although calcium was found to stabilize the isolated TnC·TnI complex (6Head J.F. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1726-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Farah et al. used deletion mutants to determine that TnC and TnI bind in an anti-parallel fashion (29Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In regards to TnI, Syska et al. showed that TnI bound actin, and they were the first to show that only a portion of TnI (specifically region 96–117) was needed for full inhibition of ATPase activity (5Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Subsequently, synthetic TnI peptides provided an attractive alternative to the use of highly insoluble whole TnI in studies of muscle protein interactions. Talbot and Hodges showed that the synthetic TnI peptide corresponding to region 96–116 behaved identically to the cyanogen bromide-cleaved fragment (26Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3720-3723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Talbot and Hodges also identified the TnIp peptide (TnI residues 104–115), which was the minimum length inhibitory peptide of TnI still regulated by TnC, and able to inhibit ATPase activity (30Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Campbell et al. solved the structures of the synthetic TnIp peptide while bound to intact skeletal and cardiac TnC using the transferred nuclear Overhauser effect technique (16Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Campbell A.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TnIp had an amphiphilic α-helical structure distorted around the central proline residues in both cases. Ngai et al. determined that the TnIp fragment cross-linked to the C-terminal domain of TnC and modeled the NMR-derived TnIp structure into the TnC crystal structure (17Ngai S.-M. Sönnichsen F.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2165-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently Tripet et al. have mapped a second TnC binding site on TnI and postulated that the region corresponding to residues 115–131 (TnI115–131) interacts with the N-terminal domain of TnC in the Ca2+-regulated hydrophobic pocket (19Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this paper the interaction of calcium-saturated N-TnC with TnI115–131 was explored with multinuclear, multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. We monitored15N-labeled N-TnC upon the addition of TnI115–131 to determine the stoichiometry of binding, dissociation constant of the complex, and location of chemical shifts induced in the N-TnC molecule. We have mapped those chemical shift changes onto the structure of Ca2+-bound N-TnC. Further we monitored the change in cross-peak line width to determine the reaction rate constants. These results provide direct evidence for TnI binding in the hydrophobic pocket of the regulatory domain and have implications for the kinetic competence of the complex with respect to muscle contraction. The cloning, expression, and purification of 50% deuterated, uniformly 15N-labeled N-TnC 2R. T. McKay, J. R. Pearlstone, S. M. Gagné, D. C. Corson, L. B. Smillie, and B. D. Sykes, manuscript in preparation. was done following the protocols described in Gagné et al. for nondeuterated N-TnC (32Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The synthetic N α-acetyl-TnI (115–131)-amide rabbit skeletal peptide was prepared as described previously (19Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and lyophilized repeatedly to remove residual organic solvents. The sequence was confirmed by amino acid analysis, and the mass was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Two NMR samples (500 μl) of [U-15N; 50% 2H]-N-TnC were prepared for titration with the TnI115–131 peptide differing only in the concentration of added KCl. The first sample (designated high salt) contained 100 mm KCl, whereas the second had no added KCl (low salt). The N-TnC was dissolved in a buffer containing 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 10 mm deuterated imidazole, with 0.1 mm2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as an internal reference. The only other salts were the slight amounts of HCl or NaOH necessary to put the pH level of the samples to 6.85. The concentrations of N-TnC and TnI115–131 were determined by amino acid analysis performed in triplicate. The initial concentration of the high salt sample was 1.54 ± 0.1 mm N-TnC, whereas the low salt sample was 1.36 ± 0.03 mm N-TnC. The concentrations of CaCl2 for the high and low salt samples were 6 and 5.4 mm, respectively. All experiments were conducted at 31 °C on a Varian Unity-600 spectrometer. The HSQC spectra of the high salt sample were acquired with a sweep width of 8000 Hz for 1H (512 complex t 2 points), and 1650.2 Hz for15N (128 complex t 1 points) with 64 transients/increment, whereas the low salt HSQC spectra were performed using a sweep width of 8000 Hz for 1H (512 complext 2 points) and 1800 Hz for 15N (128 complex t 1 points) with 28 transients/increment. Acquisition time was approximately 4.5 h/spectra. All experiments were processed using the software package NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program PIPP (34Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Data were zero filled int 2 to 1024 complex points. Thet 1 points were increased by linear prediction to 256 complex points and then zero filled to 512 complex points. Spectra were apodized using a shifted sine bell before Fourier transformation. TnI115–131was added in 5-μl aliquots to 500-μl N-TnC samples to final TnI115–131 to N-TnC ratios of 1.7:1 and 1.4:1 for the high and low salt samples, respectively. Two-dimensional HSQC (34Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 35Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) were acquired at TnI115–131 to N-TnC ratios of 0, 0.3, 0.7 1, 1.4, and 1.7 for the high salt sample and ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4 for the low salt sample. TnI115–131 was dissolved in the same stock buffer as N-TnC, and the pH of the NMR sample was checked after each addition. N-TnC backbone amide HSQC cross-peaks were followed during each point of the titration, and the total chemical shift change (Δδ) was determined as in Equation 1. Δδj=((δ15N)2+(Δδ1H)2)1/2Equation 1 where Δδ15 N and Δδ1 H are the 15N and 1H chemical shift changes for a particular backbone amide residue j. The total chemical shift change for the N-TnC molecule (ΔδTotal) is shown in Equation 2. ΔδTotal=∑j=1nΔδjEquation 2 The summation is over all residues that were followed (n). The dissociation constant (K d ) for the reaction, P+L⇄konkoffPLEquation 3 was determined from the ΔδTotal by an iterative nonlinear least squares analysis (25Slupsky C.M. Shaw G.S. Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Shaw G.S. Golden L.F. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5557-5562Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the program Xcrvfit (available at http://www.pence.ualberta.ca). In Equation 3, P is the free N-TnC protein, L is the free TnI115–131 peptide, and PL is the complex. The fit of the results also establishes the stoichiometry of the reaction. Two backbone amide cross-peaks were selected from the low salt titration spectra. They were selected because their shifts were parallel to the 1H NMR axis, and therefore traces through the cross-peaks demonstrated line shape changes and were not complicated by unresolved splittings in the 50% 2H N-TnC sample. Methionine 46 was chosen because it showed one of the largest Δδ of ∼130 Hz, whereas asparagine 52 was selected because it showed a smaller change of ∼30 Hz. The program Mathematica (37Wolfram S. The Mathematica Book. 3rd Ed. Wolfram Media/ Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996Google Scholar) was used to simulate the spectral line shapes for various values ofk off. Input parameters included the determinedK d, protein and ligand concentrations, free and bound chemical shifts, and free and bound line widths for each set of peaks, using the equations for the effect of site exchange on NMR spectra (38Sutherland I.O. Mooney E.F. Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 71-223Google Scholar). From these simulations the off rate for the TnI115–131 peptide in the TnI115–131·N-TnC complex was determined. The interaction of TnI115–131 with calcium-saturated N-TnC was studied using two-dimensional1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The TnI115–131 was unlabeled, whereas the N-TnC was uniformly15N-labeled, allowing for specific monitoring of the N-TnC component of the complex without interference from TnI signals. N-TnC was partially deuterated (50%) to reduce the line width of the observed cross-peaks. HSQC spectra show approximately 90 backbone amide and 6 Asn, Gln NH2 side chain cross-peaks that can be used to follow the titration in great detail. Each cross-peak responds to changes in the local environment of the atom, and this allows sensitive monitoring of each amino acid. Contour plots of an expanded region of the HSQC spectra taken during the titration are shown in Fig. 1(A and B) for the high salt and low salt samples, respectively. Some N-TnC amide resonances are not affected by the addition of TnI115–131 (e.g. Gly33and Asp36), whereas other resonances are significantly altered in either the 1H, 15N, or both dimensions (e.g. Met46, Gly50, and Met82). Virtually all amide resonances shift very similarly in both samples. To a first approximation (see detailed line shape analysis below) these spectra are in the NMR intermediate-fast exchange limit. Only a single resonance peak is observed for each amide whose position is the weighted average of the free and bound chemical shifts (Equation 4). δobs=Pfδf+Pbδb=(1−Pb)δf+PbδbEquation 4 where δobs is the observed chemical shift of the backbone amide cross-peak, P f andP b are the fraction free and fraction bound of N-TnC, respectively, and δf and δb are the chemical shifts for the free and bound species, respectively. A total of 77 N-TnC backbone amide nitrogen and hydrogen pairs were followed throughout the TnI115–131titration of the high salt sample. The NMR chemical shift change was calculated for each amide for each point in the titration, and individual Δδ values were summed yielding the ΔδTotal. Initial assignments of N-TnC backbone amide nitrogen and hydrogen atoms to be followed through the titration were taken from Gagné et al. (32Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Residues Ala1, Ser2, Met3, Ala25, Met28, Glu57, Phe78, and Leu79 were not followed throughout the titration due to rapid amide exchange or resonance overlap. Pro53 lacks a backbone amide hydrogen atom and thus does not show a cross-peak in the HSQC spectra. Thr4 resonated in a crowded region in the high salt sample and was therefore not included in the titration. Asp66 and Leu49 were not assigned in the original N-TnC NMR spectra. An attempt was made to assign these two residues in the TnI115–131·N-TnC complex and interpolate back to where the cross-peak originated from in the free N-TnC spectra. From ΔδTotal values acquired during the titration, a K d of 24 ± 4 μm was determined for a 1:1 binding complex (Fig.2 A). The low salt N-TnC titration was analyzed as described above, but a total of 78 peaks were followed. In the low salt sample Thr4 was isolated enough to follow through half the titration and did not shift upon TnI115–131 addition. AK d of 40 ± 23 for a 1:1 complex was obtained (Fig. 2 B). Because the titration did not go beyond a TnI115–131 to N-TnC ratio of 1.4, the fitting was repeated with the maximum shift held constant at 18.22 (the result of the high salt titration). A K d of 28 ± 4 for a 1:1 complex (Fig. 2 B, dashed line) was obtained. This assumption was considered reasonable because both samples had almost identical responses to binding of the peptide and the same backbone amide groups were followed throughout. The only exception is threonine 4, which was followed for the low salt sample; however, Thr4 did not alter the binding data because it does not shift during the titration. The completeness of the titration is evident because a majority of the peaks ceased chemical shift changes before the end of the titration. Closer inspection of individual HSQC NMR cross-peaks during the titration reveals differential broadening of resonances (for examples see Fig. 1, A and B, residue Gly50 (G50)), indicating exchange broadening. One-dimensional traces through the cross-peaks of N-TnC residues Met46 and Asn52 are shown in Fig. 3(A and E, respectively) to display the effect of exchange at various points during the addition of peptide. For Asn52, where the Δδ1 H was 30 Hz, the line shape only slightly broadens during the titration. On the other hand Met46, which has a Δδ1 H of 130 Hz, broadens substantially during the titration and then sharpens dramatically at the end. Different broadening is expected because the effect of chemical exchange on line width in the intermediate exchange limit has a dependence on the chemical shift difference between the free and bound species: ΔVex=PfPbτex(Δδi)2Equation 5 where Δνex is the observed line width,P f and P b are the populations of free and bound N-TnC, and τex is the exchange lifetime defined as (τfτb)/(τf + τb). The line widths of the free (Δνf) and bound (Δνb) N-TnC and the starting (δf) and final (δb) resonance positions were determined from the NMR spectra without TnI115–131 and at the highest TnI115–131 to N-TnC ratio used. The starting line width of the free N-TnC of 24 Hz (Fig. 3 A, right peak) sharpens to 20 Hz (Fig. 3 A, left peak) for the bound complex. This results because N-TnC transfers from a weak dimer to a tighter TnI·TnC complex (39Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Line shapes were simulated using the experimentally derived values for Δνf, Δνb, δf, δb,K d, and adjusting k off. The results of using k off rates of 350, 35, and 3500 s−1 were shown in Fig. 3 (B–D andF–H) for Met46 and Asn52, respectively. A k off of ∼3 × 102 s−1 (Fig. 3, B andF) provides the closest fit to the experimental data (Fig.3, A and E) for both residues. The binding site of TnI115–131 on N-TnC was mapped by following backbone amide chemical shift changes during the titration. The maximum Δδ was obtained for each residue at saturating TnI115–131 under both salt conditions and is presented in Fig. 4 (A andB). The average Δδ was 35 and 29 Hz for the high and low salt samples, respectively. A standard deviation of 38 and 27 Hz was calculated for the Δδ of the high salt and low salt samples, respectively. Values of Δδ greater than or approximately equal (within the digital resolution) to one standard deviation above the mean Δδ were considered to be statistically significant (Fig. 4,A and B, dotted line). In the high salt sample residues Ile19, Ala25, Phe26, Leu42, Val45, Met46, Met48, Leu49, Gly50, Gln51, Ile61, Val65, Met82, and Gln85 showed significant Δδ, whereas residues Ile19, Phe26, Phe29, Leu42, Val45, Met46, Gly50, Asp59, Ile61, Val65, Met81, Met82, and Gln85 changed significantly in the low salt sample. N-TnC resonances that show a significant change in chemical shift upon addition of TnI115–131 are shown in Fig.5. The structure used is that of Ca2+-saturated N-TnC (11Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). N-TnC residues that have a significant Δδ are shown in red and line the hydrophobic pocket. We have used HSQC NMR spectroscopy to show that the peptide TnI115–131 binds N-TnC with 1:1 stoichiometry under both high salt and low salt conditions, to measure the dissociation and off rate constants for the complex, and to demonstrate that binding occurs in the hydrophobic pocket of N-TnC (10Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The high resolution HSQC spectra provides a unique tool for monitoring each individual residue in the protein. This allows one to observe protein complex formation in solution without the potential hazards of introducing a chemical modification or sequence mutation in the protein, which are used to introduce a localized, single spectrographic probe. Interestingly, the high and low salt samples showed similar values forK d . A previous study had shown that salt concentrations played a part in TnI·TnC affinity chromatography (19Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Further, Van Eyk et al. showed the importance of basic residues in their TnIP·cardiac TnC affinity studies (40Van Eyk J.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9974-9981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and therefore high salt was expected to screen electrostatic interactions and decrease complex affinity (19Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 41Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, this was not observed. A possible explanation for the difference in results may be that high salt concentrations disrupt nonspecific interactions occurring in the affinity chromatography. Dimerization of N-TnC was a concern in affinity calculations because Slupsky et al. had shown previously that the dimerization interface occurred in the hydrophobic pocket of N-TnC (39Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we simulated binding curves with an increasing dimerization strength (data not shown). The first two simulations with dimerization dissociation constants (K dimer) of 100 and 10 mm indicated that K dimerin this range would be insufficient to affect calculated protein-peptide complex dissociation constants. For aK dimer of 1 mm, there was a slight reduction in the observed K d . For example an apparent K d of 22 μm would actually correlate to a K d of approximately 16 μm. Slupsky et al. showed aK dimer of approximately 1 mm at 30 °C for intact TnC, and our line shape analysis indicated an N-TnC dimerization dissociation for N-TnC of ∼3 mm. 3The K dimer was determined using the observed line width for both the TnI115–131·N-TnC complex and partially dimerized N-TnC molecule and assuming that the fully dimerized N-TnC would have a line width double that of the monomer. Therefore the reported K d values for the TnI115–131·N-TnC complex are probably closer to the lower experimental value reported. We used the chemical shift changes of the backbone amide resonances to demonstrate the position of the TnI peptide binding. This technique has been used to identify extremely specific and tight binding compounds for enzyme active sites (42Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). Cross-peaks that shifted more than one standard deviation from the mean chemical shift change were marked in Fig. 4 (A and B) and shown on the N-TnC structure in Fig. 5. These residues are predominantly hydrophobic and line the N-TnC hydrophobic pocket. These results agree with mutational studies that demonstrated that residues such as Met48 and Met46 were critical for proper regulation of muscle contraction (43Pearlstone J.R. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M.

Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition our results agree with cross-linking studies showing that the TnI·TnC interface consisted of the interactions between TnI residues 96–145 to whole TnC (22Kobayashi T. Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10946-10952Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Leszyk J. Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Collins J.H.

Acta. 1996; 1294: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More specifically TnIp was shown to cross-link to TnC residues 84–94 and either 60 or 61. The interaction of TnIp with the C-terminal domain of TnC (17Ngai S.-M. Sönnichsen F.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2165-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the interaction of TnI115–131 with N-TnC (19Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol.

FASEB J. 1995; 9(9): 755-767Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The lack of an extended spacer between the two TnI binding regions suggests a more compact bound TnC structure than indicated by low resolution neutron scattering experiments (14Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.-L.A. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Olah G.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A compact bound TnC structure would also agree with the homologous calmodulin (46Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 47Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). We determined off-rate constants from detailed line shape analysis of HSQC cross-peaks. The simulations of cross-peak traces (Fig. 3,B–D and F–G) show that one can easily distinguish between k off rates differing by a factor of ten. However, the precision is limited to approximately ± 100 s−1. Line shape was sensitive to bothk off and K d. A limitation of the line shape fitting procedure was the quality of the spectra obtained as traces through HSQC spectra. There are issues such as limiting spectral resolution and also the varying T2 during the intermediate sections of the titration, which leads to small differential intensities in the cross-peaks. The measured k off is fast enough to be kinetically competent for muscle contraction. For example, the contraction frequency of insect flight muscle can be as fast as 600–1000 Hz (50Baker J.R. The Academic American Encyclopedia, Version 8.0.3. Grolier, Inc., Danbry, CT1996Google Scholar). Interestingly, the k off for our complex is of the same order as the k off for calcium (Ref. 51Potter J.D. Johnson J.D. Cheung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. 2. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1982: 145-169Google Scholar and references therein), implying that the steps of calcium binding, opening of the hydrophobic pocket, and TnI binding all occur on similar time scales. This study offers a unique starting point for kinetic analysis of other troponin interactions. These values will be compared with future kinetic work on even larger TnC and/or TnI protein fragments and is only the beginning of fully dissecting the molecular kinetics of muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2061863527,"Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to study the biosynthesis of two different cholesteryl ester hydrolases by human and mouse macrophages. Oligonucleotide primers for bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase yielded positive reactions with RNA isolated from human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, the human monocytic THP-1 cells, and phorbol ester-induced THP-1 macrophages. In contrast, oligonucleotide primers for hormone-sensitive lipase yielded positive reactions only with RNA isolated from non-differentiated human THP-1 monocytic cells and peripheral blood monocytes, but not those obtained from differentiated THP-1 macrophages or monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, while human monocytes were capable of synthesizing both enzymes, human macrophages synthesized only bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase and not the hormone-sensitive lipase. The synthesis of bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase by human macrophages was confirmed by detection of bile salt-stimulated cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in conditioned media of differentiated THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. Moreover, incubating human macrophages with oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) or acetylated LDL increased bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase activity in the conditioned media of these cells. These results with human macrophages were contrasted with results of studies with mouse macrophages, which showed the presence of hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA but not the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase mRNA. Taken together, these results demonstrated species-specific differences in expression of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes in macrophages. The expression of bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase by human macrophages, in a process inducible by modified LDL, suggests a role of this protein in atherogenesis.

Taken together, these results demonstrated species-specific differences in expression of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes in macrophages. The expression of bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase by human macrophages, in a process inducible by modified LDL, suggests a role of this protein in atherogenesis. A major characteristic of atherosclerosis is the accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells in the arterial wall. The foam cells are derived mainly from macrophages that have endocytosed modified lipoproteins through the scavenger receptor-mediated pathways (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic lipid droplets are mostly cholesteryl esters, which exist in a dynamic equilibrium with unesterified cholesterol and undergo continues hydrolysis and re-esterification (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the presence of exogenous cholesterol acceptors such as high density lipoproteins, the equilibrium favors cholesteryl ester hydrolysis with a net efflux of cholesterol from cells. In such circumstances, very little amount of cholesterol is stored in the macrophages. However, in the absence of extracellular cholesterol acceptors, or when acceptor concentration is low, equilibrium of the cholesteryl ester cycle favors esterification and cholesteryl esters accumulate in the cytosol. Cholesteryl ester can also accumulate in macrophages due to different levels of the esterification and de-esterification enzymes. Macrophages with high neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity were shown to accumulate less cholesteryl ester in response to β-migrating very low density lipoproteins in comparison with macrophages with low cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activities (2Ishii I. Oka M. Katto N. Shirai K. Saito Y. Hirose S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This difference in intracellular cholesteryl ester metabolism has been suggested to play a role in dictating susceptibility to atherosclerosis (3Hakamata H. Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Sakamoto Y. Horiuchi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1860-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol at the expense of cholesteryl ester and in the absence of adequate supply of cholesterol acceptor may also lead to cell necrosis (4Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The lipid-rich debris of foam cell necrosis contributes directly to the lipid core of advanced atheroma (5Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R.B. Skepper J.N. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition to the neutral lipids derived from necrosis of macrophage foam cells, direct arterial deposition of LDL 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; bp, base pair(s); HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase. also contributes to the lipid core of the atherosclerotic plaque (6Smith E.B. Adv. Lipid Res. 1974; 12: 1-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mora R. Lupu S.N. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 67: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, cholesterol in LDL, as well as cholesterol stored as lipid droplets in macrophage foam cells, are mainly esterified cholesterol, whereas lipids in advanced atherosclerosis are mostly unesterified cholesterol (8Kruth H.S. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the cholesteryl esters are converted to free cholesterol in the extracellular matrix before cholesterol monohydrates crystallize in the atherosclerotic plaque. Despite the obvious significance of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes in atherogenesis, the identity of the cholesteryl ester hydrolase in macrophages and in the extracellular matrix remains obscure. Earlier studies demonstrated the activation of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate-stimulated murine macrophages (10Khoo J.C. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12659-12661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that the enzyme responsible for cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in macrophages is similar to the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) found in steroidogenic tissues (11Small C.A. Goodacre J.A. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, HSL mRNA was found to be present in mouse macrophages (12Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1969-1974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, HSL mRNA could not be demonstrated in human macrophages, even with the sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification technique (13Contreras J.A. Lasunción M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that another cholesterol ester hydrolase may be responsible for cholesteryl ester metabolism in human macrophages and arterial wall. An enzyme capable of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis is the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase (14Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although this protein is synthesized predominantly in the pancreas and lactating mammary glands in a form that is secreted from the cells (14Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a significant amount of intracellular enzyme was also detectable in cells expressing the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase mRNA (15Zolfaghari R. Glick J.M. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13532-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the recent observations that the pancreatic type of cholesterol esterase (the bile salt-stimulated lipase/cholesterol esterase) is present in human serum (16Brodt-Eppley J. White P. Jenkins S. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and that its serum activity may participate in lipoprotein remodeling (16Brodt-Eppley J. White P. Jenkins S. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), this study was undertaken to determine if the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase is expressed in macrophages. The human monocytic cell line THP-1, the HT29 intestinal cells, and the mouse macrophage line J774 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Tissue culture media and reagents were obtained from Fisher Chemical Co. (Cincinnati, OH). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). The C57/BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts (Indianapolis, IN). Reverse transcriptase andTaq DNA polymerase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The cholesteryl [14C]oleate was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. RNA Stat-60 was obtained from Tel-Test “B,” Inc. (Friendswood, TX). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was obtained from Sigma. Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter devices were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Other high quality reagents and chemicals were obtained from either Fisher or Sigma. Human LDL, d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml, was isolated by centrifugation for 18 h at 59,000 rpm in a Beckman 60 Ti rotor, washed by recentrifugation atd = 1.05 g/ml, and dialyzed against 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm EDTA before storing at 4 °C until use (18Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL was prepared by dialysis of the LDL stock solution against phosphate-buffered saline without EDTA, followed by incubation with 10 μm copper sulfate for 18 h at 37 °C (19Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Acetylation of LDL was carried out by sequential addition of acetic anhydride (20Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The modified lipoproteins were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis before use. Stock cultures of THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The HepG2 and HT29 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation of the THP-1 monocytic cells to macrophages was induced by plating 5 × 106 cells in 100-mm culture dishes with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 × 10−9m PMA. After a 24-h incubation period, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. For experiments, the THP-1 cells were incubated with RPMI 1640, in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml oxidized LDL, acetylated LDL, or normal human LDL. Human monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors using the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method (21Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). The separated mononuclear cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then plated in 75-cm2 flasks at a density of 1 × 107 cells/dish. Nonadherent cells were removed after 3 h of incubation, and fresh RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum was added to the adhering cell culture. Medium was changed every 3 days, and the cells were used as monocyte-derived macrophages after 9 days in culture. Phenotypic characterization of the cells revealed greater than 90% of the cells were macrophages. Mouse resident macrophages were harvested by lavage of peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6N mice or C3H/HeN mice with phosphate-buffered saline. The mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 107 cells/plate with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Total cellular RNA was prepared using the single-step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method with RNA-stat 60 (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Mouse pancreatic RNA was isolated using the same procedure as described previously for isolation of rat pancreatic RNA (23Brodt-Eppley J. Hui D.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One μg of the RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) primers. One-twentieth of the resulting cDNA in 1 μl was utilized for PCR amplification. The oligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer based on sequences derived from human pancreatic cholesterol esterase (24Hui D.Y.

Amplification reactions for human cholesterol esterase were carried out for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The extension time was increased to 10 min for the final cycle. The RT-PCR amplification with human hormone-sensitive lipase primers was carried out using an identical procedure, except the annealing reaction was performed at 62.5 °C. Amplification of mouse cholesterol esterase mRNA was carried out for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, increasing to 10 min of extension time for the final cycle. The PCR amplification for mouse HSL mRNA was performed exactly as described (12Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J.

An aliquot of each sample (usually 140 μl) was used to measure cholesterol esterase activity, based on the hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate in the presence of 33 mm cholate, as described previously (28Camulli E.A. Linke M.J. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The RNA isolated from THP-1 cells, PMA-treated THP-1, peripheral blood monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages were used for RT-PCR to study cholesterol esterase gene expression in human monocytes and macrophages. Since previous studies by other investigators have reported the presence of a cholesterol esterase-like pseudogene in the human genome that can be transcribed into mRNA (29Kumar B.V. Aleman-Gomez J.A. Colwell N. Lopez-Candales A. Bosner M.S. Spilburg C.A. Lowe M. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Lidberg U. Nilsson J. Stromberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerback S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and that the major difference between the authentic cholesterol esterase gene and the pseudogene is the deletion of exon 2 through exon 7 in the latter sequence, PCR amplification was performed initially with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sequences in exon 2 and exon 7 of the cholesterol esterase gene. An RT-PCR product of 579 bp was consistently observed with RNA isolated from non-differentiating THP-1 cells, PMA-induced THP-1 macrophages, human peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 A). The identity of the RT-PCR product as cholesterol esterase cDNA was further confirmed by hybridization of the amplified DNA with a cholesterol esterase cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 270–681 of human cholesterol esterase mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, a 555-bp RT-PCR product was also observed with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to exons 8 and 11 of the human cholesterol esterase gene (data not shown). This 555-bp amplification product also hybridized to a cholesterol esterase cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 681–1400 of the cholesterol esterase mRNA (data not shown). However, no RT-PCR product was observed when the reaction was performed in the absence of cellular RNA (Fig.1 A). The observation of similar RT-PCR products with RNA from human monocyte-derived macrophages and HepG2, a human hepatoma cell line that has been shown previously to synthesize the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase (31Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggested that human monocyte-macrophages are capable of synthesizing a cholesterol esterase that is similar to the enzyme in pancreas. The pancreatic type cholesterol esterase expressed in pancreas, liver, and lactating mammary glands is a secretory protein (32Rudd E.A. Brockman H.L. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1984: 185-204Google Scholar). Therefore, additional experiments were performed to determine if its synthesis in human macrophages also resulted in its secretion from the cells. Conditioned media from PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated for cholesterol esterase assay. The results showed the conditioned medium displayed significant bile salt-dependent cholesteryl [14C]oleate hydrolysis (Fig. 2). Cholesteryl [3H]oleate hydrolysis was not observed when the enzyme assay was performed with deoxycholate instead of cholate or in the absence of bile salt (data not shown). Cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in the conditioned medium was also reduced by approximately 70–75% when the assay was performed after immunoprecipitation with antibodies against rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase (33Huang Y. Hui D.Y J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6720-6725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter observations provided additional support to indicate that the cholesterol esterase secreted by human macrophages is similar, if not identical, to the pancreatic cholesterol esterase (14Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase activity in the conditioned media was increased 9–12-fold after incubating the monocyte-derived macrophages and PMA-treated THP-1 cells with oxidized LDL, compared with cells incubated without lipoproteins (Fig. 2). Acetylated LDL increased bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase secretion by these cells by approximately 10- and 6.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2,A and B). Normal LDL has no effect on bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase synthesis and secretion by PMA-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 2 A), but increased cholesterol esterase synthesis and secretion by monocyte-derived macrophages approximately 4-fold (Fig. 2 B). The latter observation may be related to the ability of the macrophage to catalyze LDL oxidation or due to differences between THP-1 cells and normal human macrophages. The RNA isolated from THP-1 cells, human monocytes, and macrophages were also used for RT-PCR with primers for HSL cDNA. A primer set that overlaps exons 1–6 of the HSL gene amplified a reaction product of 1296 bp using RNA isolated from non-differentiating THP-1 monocytes, human peripheral blood monocytes, and the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 (Fig. 3). The HT29 cells have been shown previously to display HSL mRNA (34Remaury A. Laurell H. Grober J. Reynisdottir S. Dauzats M. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, no signal was observed when amplification was performed with RNA isolated from PMA-activated THP-1 cells or from monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 3). The latter result was consistent with results reported by Contreras and Lasunción (13Contreras J.A. Lasunción M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing the absence of HSL mRNA in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Hormone-sensitive lipase has been reported to be present in mouse macrophages (11Small C.A. Goodacre J.A. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1969-1974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Contreras J.A. Lasunción M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential for expression of the pancreatic type cholesterol esterase in mouse macrophages has not been explored. Therefore, RNA was isolated from mouse peritoneal macrophages for RT-PCR amplification with cholesterol esterase or hormone-sensitive lipase oligonucleotide primers. Results showed the HSL primers amplified an expected 408-bp DNA using RNA isolated from either C57BL/6N or C3H/HeN mice (Fig.4 A). In contrast, mRNA for the pancreatic type cholesterol esterase could not be detected in macrophages obtained from either mouse strains, even by the sensitive RT-PCR procedure (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were observed regardless of whether the macrophages were incubated with or without oxidized LDL (Fig. 4). As a control, the primers used for mouse pancreatic cholesterol esterase were capable of amplifying a 377-bp cDNA using RNA from mouse pancreas as a template (Fig.4 B). Taken together, these results showed that mouse macrophages, in contrast to human macrophages, express HSL instead of the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase. The results presented in this report revealed striking differences between human and mouse macrophages in synthesis of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes. Consistent with results reported by other investigators, mouse peritoneal macrophages, but not human macrophages, express HSL (12Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1969-1974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Contreras J.A. Lasunción M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 443-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inability to detect HSL mRNA in human macrophages was not due to the assay conditions used nor the primers selected for RT-PCR. Using the identical procedure, HSL mRNA was detectable in non-differentiating THP-1 cells and in peripheral blood monocytes. Although the mechanism and the rationale for down-regulation of HSL expression after monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation still remain unknown, these results suggested the presence of another enzyme(s) in human macrophages responsible for hydrolysis of the stored cholesteryl esters in these cells. One cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzyme synthesized by human macrophages is identical to the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase, previously thought to be synthesized only in pancreas and in lactating mammary glands (35Rudd E.A. Mizuno N.K. Brockman H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on results of several studies. First, RT-PCR amplification of human macrophage RNA with two different sets of oligonucleotide primers, overlapping exons 2–7 and 8–11 of the human cholesterol esterase gene (24Hui D.Y. Kissel J.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgstrom B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lidberg U. Nilsson J. Stromberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerback S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that the products were derived from the authentic cholesterol esterase gene instead of the cholesterol esterase-like pseudogene (30Lidberg U. Nilsson J. Stromberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerback S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The results of the two PCR products encompassed the entire coding region of the mature human cholesterol esterase (24Hui D.Y. Kissel J.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgstrom B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase activity was also detected in conditioned medium of human macrophages. Thus, these results documented the ability of human macrophages to synthesize an enzymatically active and mature form of the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase. The macrophage enzyme is identical to the pancreatic protein and is significantly different from the 46-kDa variant protein found in tumor cells (36Roudani S. Pasqualini E. Margotat A. Gastaldi M. Sbarra V. Malezet-Desmoulin C. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar). These results are in striking contrast to results obtained with mouse macrophages, which we failed to show the presence of cholesterol esterase mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest species difference in expression of the cholesterol esterase. Whereas mouse macrophages synthesize HSL and not the pancreatic type cholesterol esterase, human macrophages appear to synthesize the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase instead of hormone-sensitive lipase. The identification of pancreatic type cholesterol esterase mRNA in human macrophages adds to a growing list of cell types that are capable of synthesizing this protein. Although the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase was originally discovered in the pancreas and in the pancreatic juice (37Hyun J. Kothari H. Herm E. Mortenson J. Treadwell C.R. Vahouny G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1937-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 103-113Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Lombardo D. Guy O. Figarella C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the cholesterol esterase was also found to be an abundant protein synthesized and secreted into the milk by lactating mammary glands of many species (39Lombardo D. Guy O. Figarella C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, this protein was found to be synthesized by the liver, including the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line (28Camulli E.A. Linke M.J. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1005: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Kissel J.A. Fontaine R.N. Turck C. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The mRNA for bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase was also present in human eosinophils (42Holtsberg F.W. Ozgur L.E. Garsetti D.E. Myers J. Egan R.W. Clark M.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase activity, which could be inhibited by antibodies specific for the pancreatic enzyme, was also reported to be present in human serum and in the aorta (16Brodt-Eppley J. White P. Jenkins S. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results suggested that bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase may have a systemic origin and participates in systemic lipid metabolism, in addition to its role for nutrient digestion and transport in the gastrointestinal tract (43Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Species differences in tissue expression of the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase gene have been reported previously (44Zolfaghari R. Harrison E.H. Han J.H. Rutter W.J. Fisher E.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). While the pancreas of all species examined to date were capable of cholesterol esterase biosynthesis, the bile salt-stimulated pancreatic type cholesterol esterase mRNA was present only in rabbit intestine and not the intestine of rat, human, or mouse (41Kissel J.A. Fontaine R.N. Turck C. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Zolfaghari R. Harrison E.H. Han J.H. Rutter W.J. Fisher E.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cholesterol esterase mRNA was reported to be present in some but not all rat liver tested (41Kissel J.A. Fontaine R.N. Turck C. Brockman H.L. Hui D.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Zolfaghari R. Harrison E.H. Han J.H. Rutter W.J. Fisher E.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and was absent in the rat hepatoma Fu5AH cells (15Zolfaghari R. Glick J.M. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13532-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cholesterol esterase mRNA was detectable in the HepG2 human hepatoma cells (Ref. 31Li F. Huang Y. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6657-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and current study). Lactating mammary glands from human, dog, cat, gorilla, goat, and mouse were reported to synthesize the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase (27Lidmer A.S. Kannius M. Lundberg L. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Genomics. 1995; 29: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, rat and cow mammary glands lack cholesterol esterase mRNA. Cholesterol esterase enzyme activity was also undetectable in rat, cow, and pig milk (40Hernell O. Blackberg L. J. Pediatr. 1994; 125: S56-S61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that human macrophages were capable of cholesterol esterase biosynthesis while mouse macrophages were lacking in the cholesterol esterase mRNA. These results suggest that the tissue-specific regulatory sequences in the cholesterol esterase gene may be quite different among various species. Comparison of the available 5′-flanking sequences of the rat (45Fontaine R.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7008-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), human (30Lidberg U. Nilsson J. Stromberg K. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Enerback S. Bjursell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and mouse (Refs. 27Lidmer A.S. Kannius M. Lundberg L. Bjursell G. Nilsson J. Genomics. 1995; 29: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 43Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, and data not shown) cholesterol esterase genes revealed significant differences in nucleotide sequences. However, direct expression studies with chimeric reporter gene constructs will be necessary to elucidate the factors involved with species differences in tissue-specific expression of the cholesterol esterase gene. The bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase synthesized by human macrophages is secreted from the cells; thereby, it is unlikely to play a role in intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Thus, the enzyme that participates in the futile cholesteryl ester cycle of human macrophages remains to be determined. A possible candidate is the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase recently identified in liver (46Ghosh S. Grogan W.M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Ghosh S. Grogan W.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The latter protein was shown to be activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (48Ghosh S. Grogan W.M. Lipids. 1989; 24: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and is unique from HSL and bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase (49Ghosh S. Mallonee D.H. Hylemon P.B. Grogan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whether this enzyme is present in macrophages of various species remains unknown. The physiological significance of bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase biosynthesis by human macrophages also remains speculative. Results showing the presence of the cholesterol esterase in human aorta (17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and its increased secretion by oxidized LDL-stimulated human macrophages (Fig. 3), suggested its possible role in atherogenesis. Previously, in an in vitro study, Shamir et al.(17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed the ability of the cholesterol esterase to hydrolyze lysophosphatidylcholine in oxidized LDL. Because lysophosphatidylcholine has been implicated as a contributing factor in atherosclerosis (50Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), the oxidized LDL-induced cholesterol esterase secretion by human macrophages may be a protective response against the atherogenic effects of the modified lipoproteins (17Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, it is equally possible that the bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase secreted by human macrophages may hydrolyze lipoprotein-associated cholesteryl esters and lipid-rich debris deposited on the arterial wall, thereby increasing cholesterol monohydrate formation and promotes atherosclerosis. Thus, advanced lesions with high free cholesterol content observed in human atheroma may be related to cholesterol esterase biosynthesis and secretion by the macrophages. In contrast, the relative resistance of the mouse to develop atherosclerosis, with only mild fatty streak lesions after feeding a high fat/high cholesterol diet, may be attributed to the inability of mouse macrophage to synthesize bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase and thus the absence of this protein in atheromatous lesions of the vessel wall. The potential role of cholesterol esterase in unesterified cholesterol formation in the arterial wall is also supported by our recent observation that the enzyme can be activated maximally with low circulating bile salt concentrations in the presence of heparin-like molecules, such as those present in the arterial wall. 2R.

Excessive local activation of this pathway may lead to airway inflammation, so we sought to selectively down-regulate the pathway using a dominant-negative strategy for inhibition of epithelial Stat1 in a primary culture airway epithelial cell model. Using a Stat1-deficient cell line, we demonstrated that transfection of wild-type Stat1 expression plasmid restored appropriate Stat1 expression and IFN-γ-dependent phosphorylation as well as consequent IFN-γ activation of cotransfected ICAM-1 promoter constructs and endogenous ICAM-1 gene expression. However, mutations of Stat1 at Tyr-701 (JAK kinase phosphorylation site), Glu-428/429 (putative DNA-binding site), His-713 (splice site resulting in Stat1β formation), or Ser-727 (MAP kinase phosphorylation site) all decreased Stat1 capacity to activate the ICAM-1 promoter. The Tyr-701 mutant (followed by the His-713 mutant) were most effective in disabling Stat1 function and in overcoming the activating effect of cotransfected wild-type Stat1 in this cell system thereby highlighting the effectiveness of blocking Stat1 homo- and hetero-dimerization. In experiments using primary culture human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTBECs) and each of the four Stat1 mutant plasmids, transfection with the Tyr-701 and His-713 mutants again most effectively inhibited IFN-γ activation of an ICAM-1 gene promoter construct. Then by transfecting hTBECs with wild-type or mutant Stat1 tagged with a Flag reporter sequence, we used dual immunofluorescence to show that hTBECs expressing the Tyr-701 or His-713 mutants were prevented from expressing endogenous ICAM-1 in response to IFN-γ treatment. The capacity of a specific Stat1 mutations to exert a potent dominant-negative effect on IFN-γ signal transduction provides for further definition of Stat1 structure function and a means for natural or engineered expression of mutant Stat1 to selectively down-regulate activity of this pathway in a cell type- or tissue-specific manner during immune and/or inflammatory responses.

Transcription factors generally contain at least two independent domains for DNA binding and for activation of transcription (1Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Removal of the transactivation domain has been shown in many cases to result in an inactive factor that can bind and displace wild-type protein thereby creating a dominant-negative action (2Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Targeting such a dominant-negative construct so that it is expressed in a specific tissue has been useful in understanding the function of specific transcription factors in different tissues. Accordingly, this strategy offers an advantage over complete deletion of the factor by homologous recombination with the endogenous gene if there is a goal of defining function in a specific tissue or cell type. In that context, we have determined that epithelial barrier tissue (and airway epithelial cells in particular) selectively activate a subset of immune response genes to mediate immunity and inflammation, and this activation is controlled by the Stat1 transcription factor (3Look D.C.

Thus, the present experiments were aimed at establishing a dominant-negative strategy for investigating the action of epithelial Stat1. In defining this strategy, it is noteworthy that STAT 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; hTBEC, human tracheobronchial epithelial cell; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IRE, IFN-γ response element; JAK, Janus family tyrosine kinase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RANTES, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; bp, base pair(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; hTBEC, human tracheobronchial epithelial cell; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IRE, IFN-γ response element; JAK, Janus family tyrosine kinase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RANTES, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; bp, base pair(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. family proteins are somewhat more complex than other transcription factors. The STAT proteins act as critical intermediates in cytokine-dependent gene activation based on their dual capacities for signal transduction (at the cell surface) and activation of transcription (in the nucleus) (5Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Signal transduction depends on programmed assembly of cytokine receptors, receptor-associated JAK kinases, and in some cases serine kinases, that recruit and activate specific STAT proteins (6Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S.

Phosphorylated/activated STATs then dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and direct transcription of specific target genes. In particular, the first member of the STAT family (designated Stat1) is critical for IFN-dependent gene activation (9Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). IFN-γ-dependent oligomerization of the IFN-γ receptor and consequent cross-phosphorylation of receptor-associated Jak1 and Jak2 kinases and the receptor α-chain leads to SH2-dependent recruitment of Stat1 (6Heim M.H.

Thus, the creation of a dominant-negative mutation for Stat1 is more challenging than for transcription factors with less complex function but also offers an opportunity for dissecting the relative importance of Stat1 modular function. In addition to analysis of Stat1 structure-function ex vivo, more recent studies of Stat1 biology in the genetically Stat1-deficient mouse indicate that Stat1 is required for IFN-dependent biologic responses, especially viral immunity (15Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 16Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C.F. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J.

However, as noted above, this approach does not allow for functional assessment of tissue-specific alterations in Stat1 activity. In the case of epithelial tissue, localized assessment is essential, because it appears that selective and localized activation of IFN-γ-driven Stat1-dependent gene expression in airway epithelial cells may be a feature of respiratory viral infection as well as inflammatory diseases such as asthma (17Holtzman M.J. Sampath D. Castro M. Look D.C. Jayaraman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18McWilliam A.S. Marsh A. Holt P.G. J.

Thus, the level of Stat1-dependent gene activation may critically control immune and inflammatory responses, and regulating the level of epithelial Stat1 activity may influence the type of host response. Accordingly, we sought a means to down-regulate the IFN-driven signal transduction pathway using a dominant-negative strategy for Stat1 in a relevant ex vivo system. We took advantage of Stat1 (and other STAT protein) structure-function relationships and a primary culture human airway epithelial cell model with a defined IFN-γ-dependent immune response gene (ICAM-1) to establish strategies for inhibition of Stat1 activity. We reasoned that mutations that may inactivate a potential Stat1 DNA-binding site at Glu-428 and Glu-429 (20Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), the Jak1/2 phosphorylation site at Tyr-701 (21Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), or the MAP kinase phosphorylation site at Ser-727 (14Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) or deletion of the putative Stat1 transactivation domain (the carboxyl-terminal 38 amino acids) (22Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) might each serve to generate a Stat1 protein that is nonfunctional (in a Stat1-deficient cell line) and may exert a dominant-negative action (in an epithelial cell model). To our knowledge, this represents the initial indication that loss of function may correlate with dominant-negative activity for Stat1 in a biologically relevant human cell model. The mutants should prove useful for regulating IFN-γ-driven gene expression in a tissue- or cell-specific manner and for further analyzing structure-function in the Stat1 pathway.

Darnell, Jr. Our expression vector for Stat1 was generated in four steps: (i) the Stat1 5′-UTR was removed from pSK-Stat1 by SacII/NcoI digestion, releasing the 5′-UTR plus sequence encoding Stat1 amino acids 1–27. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a SacII andEcoRI site at the upstream end and Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–27 including the adjacent downstream NcoI site was then inserted into SacII/NcoI-digested pSK-Stat1 generating pSK-Stat1–5UTR; (ii) the Stat1 3′-UTR was removed by modifying the Lex A containing expression plasmid pBXL3 (a gift from P. Broad, Zeneca Pharmaceutical, Cheshire, United Kingdom). A double-standed oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site at the downstream end and Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 743–750 including the adjacent upstream EcoRI site was inserted intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested pBXL3 generating pBXL3-Stat1(743–750); (iii) pSK-Stat1–5UTR was digested withEcoRI releasing Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–742, and this sequence was inserted into EcoRI-digested pBXL3-Stat1(743–750) generating pBXL3-Stat1; and (iv) the Lex A cDNA was removed by SacII/NcoI-digestion of pBXL3-Stat1 and insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing SacII, HindIII, and NcoI sites, the Lex A 5′-UTR, ApaI and SacII sites, and Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–27 including the adjacent downstream NcoI site generating pBX-Stat1 (in which the Stat1 coding sequence is driven by the SV40 early region). To insert the Stat1 coding sequence downstream to the more potent CMV promoter, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was modified by digestion with HindIII/XbaI and insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an upstreamHindIII overhang that destroyed the HindIII site,KpnI, SacII, EcoRV, BamHI,NotI, and BspEI sites, and a downstreamXbaI overhang that destroyed the XbaI site generating pcDNA3m. The Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–750 from pBX-Stat1 was released by SacII/BamHI digestion and this sequence was inserted intoSacII/BamHI-digested pcDNA3m generating pcDNA3m-Stat1. To add the 8 amino acid Flag sequence (25Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar) downstream to the Stat1-coding sequence, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing downstream BamHI and EcoRV sites, a stop codon, and sequence encoding the Flag peptide and Stat1 amino acids 743–750 including the adjacent upstream EcoRI site was inserted intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 generating pcDNA3m-Stat1/Flag. Selected mutations in the Stat1 coding sequence were created using the Stat1 cDNA as template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Thermus flavusDNA polymerase (Amersham Corp.) and a 55 °C annealing cycle. All PCR generated fragments were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide technique to verify sequence integrity (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). To mutate Stat1 at amino acids 428 and 429 (the putative DNA-binding site), an upstream primer encoding Stat1 sequence extending from the SphI site at the codon for amino acid 323 to 20 bp downstream and a downstream primer extending from theEspI site at the codon for amino acid 446 to 74 bp upstream (with the codons for amino acids 428 and 429 converted from glutamine to alanine) were used. The PCR product was inserted intoSphI/EspI-digested pSK-Stat1–5UTR generating pSK-Stat1–5UTR-Glu-428/9M. To insert this mutant Stat1 sequence downstream to the CMV promoter, pSK-Stat1–5UTR-Glu428/9M was digested with PflMI/SacII and the resulting Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1 to 472 with the mutations of amino acids 428 and 429 was inserted into PflMI/SacII-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 generating pcDNA3 m-Stat1-Glu428/9M. To add the 8 amino acid Flag sequence downstream to this mutant Stat1 coding sequence, pcDNA3m-Stat1-Glu428/9M was digested withKpnI/EcoRI releasing the Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–742 with the mutations of amino acids 428 and 429, and this sequence was inserted intoKpnI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1/Flag generating pcDNA3m-Stat1-Glu428/9M/Flag. To mutate Stat1 amino acid 701 (the Jak1/2 phosphorylation site), an upstream PCR primer encoding Stat1 sequence extending from theXmaI site at the codon for amino acid 606 to 20 bp downstream and a downstream primer extending from the XbaI site at the codon for amino acid 714 to 60 bp upstream (with the codon for amino acid 701 converted from tyrosine to phenylalanine) were used. The PCR product was inserted intoXmaI/XbaI-digested pSK-Stat1–5UTR generating pSK-Stat1–5UTR-Tyr-701M. pSK-Stat1–5UTR-Tyr-701M was then digested with PflMI/EcoRI, and the resulting Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 473 to 742 with mutation of Tyr701 was inserted into PflMI/EcoRI-digested pBX-Stat1 generating pBX-Stat1-Tyr-701M. To insert this mutant Stat1 sequence downstream to the CMV promoter, pBX-Stat1-Tyr-701M was digested withSacII/BamHI, and the resulting Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–750 with mutation of amino acid 701 was inserted into SacII/BamHI-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 generating pcDNA3m-Stat1-Tyr-701 M. The Flag sequence was inserted downstream to the mutant Stat1 sequence in pcDNA3m-Stat1-Tyr701M to generate pcDNA3m-Stat1-Tyr-701M/Flag in a manner identical to that used to generate pcDNA3m-Stat1/Flag. To delete Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 713 to 750 (generating Stat1β), an upstream primer encoding Stat1 sequence extending from the HindIII site at the codon for amino acid 524 to 20 bp downstream and a downstream primer containing aBamHI and HpaI site, a stop codon, and Stat1 sequence extending from the codon at amino acid 712 to 20 bp upstream were used. The PCR product was inserted intoHindIII/BamHI-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 to generate pcDNA3m-Stat1-His-713M. To add the Flag sequence downstream to this mutant Stat1 coding sequence, the identical upstream primer and a downstream primer containing a BamHI andHpaI site, a stop codon, the Flag sequence, and Stat1 sequence extending from amino acid 712 to 20 bp upstream were used. The PCR product was inserted intoHindIII/BamHI-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 to generate pcDNA3m-Stat1-His-713M/Flag. To mutate Stat1 at amino acid 727 (the MAPK phosphorylation site), an upstream primer encoding Stat1 sequence extending from theXbaI site at the codon for amino acid 714 to 55 bp downstream (with the codon for amino acid 727 converted from serine to alanine) and a downstream primer extending from the XbaI site in the multiple cloning site to 20 bp upstream were used. The PCR product was inserted into XbaI-digested pBX-Stat1 generating pBX-Stat1-Ser-727M. pBX-Stat1-Ser-727M was then digested withPflMI/Bsu36I, and the resulting Stat1 sequence encoding amino acids 473 to 728 with mutation of Ser-727 was inserted into PflMI/Bsu36I-digested pcDNA3m-Stat1 generating pcDNA3m-Stat1-Ser727M. The Flag sequence was inserted downstream to the mutant Stat1 sequence in pcDNA3m-Stat1-Ser-727M to generate pcDNA3m-Stat1-Ser727M/Flag as described above for pcDNA3m-Stat1-Glu-428/9M/Flag. Plasmid DNA for wild-type and each mutant Stat1 was purified by two successive centrifugations through cesium chloride and then used to transfect duplicate U3A or hTBEC monolayers at 60–80% confluency. Monolayers (in a 35-mm tissue culture plate) were treated with 2.0 ml of serum-free media containing 3 μg of DNA and 12 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16 h at 37 °C and then with 2 ml of complete media containing IFN-γ (10 or 100 units/ml) for 1 h (to assess phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of Stat1) or 18–48 h (to assess ICAM-1 level or luciferase reporter gene activity) at 37 °C. For cotransfection experiments, the levels of reporter and expression plasmids were titered to provide similar levels of basal promoter activity among experiments (1.5–2.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.05–1.5 μg of expression plasmid per 30-mm culture plate). The construction of the luciferase reporter plasmid with ICAM-1 gene sequence (−130 to −35) driving the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (pBH-130–35ICAM-1-luc) was described previously (3Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Controls for transfection efficiency were performed using cotransfection with plasmids containing RSV-CAT as described previously (3Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol.

In addition, multiple DNA transfections (at least three experiments done in duplicate) were performed for each experimental condition to define consistent results. To monitor expression of wild-type and mutant Stat1 constructs in transfected cells, the cellular proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Stat1 and anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs. Cell protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (28Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). For Stat1 immunoblotting, aliquots of cell protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were then washed, blocked with 5% dry milk, and incubated with anti-Stat1 or anti-Stat3 mAb (0.5 μg/ml). Primary antibody binding was detected using anti-mouse IgG1 horseradish peroxidase conjugate and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Specificity for Stat1 immunoblotting and equality of protein loading was demonstrated by re-blotting against anti-Stat3 mAb. To detect phosphorylated Stat1, 250 μg of cell protein was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of anti-Stat1 mAb conjugated to agarose beads. The resulting immune complex was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting against anti-phosphotyrosine mAb conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (0.2 μg/ml) and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. Reporter gene assays (for luciferase and CAT activities) were performed as described previously (3Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol.

For the luciferase assay, cell monolayers were washed and then lysed by addition of 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and a lysate volume corresponding to 75 μg of total protein was then added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP) in a luminometer cuvette. Luciferase activity was determined after addition of 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). All results are the average of duplicate samples and are representative of three experiments. hTBECs and U3A cells were grown to 80% confluency on 8-chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and then were transfected with 0.3 μg of wild-type or mutant Stat1 expression plasmids as described above. After treatment with or without IFN-γ for 18–48 h, cells were fixed in methanol, pretreated with 2% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C to block nonspecific Ig binding, and then treated with anti-Stat1 Ab 91T (1:900 v/v), anti-Flag mAb (1 μg/ml), biotin-conjugated anti-Flag mAb (1 μg/ml), or anti-ICAM-1 mAb 84H10 (0.2 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were rinsed and then were treated with FITC- or CY3-conjugated secondary Ab for 1 h at 25 °C. Slides were mounted and then photographed using an epifluorescence photomicrography system (model D-7082, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). To first determine the characteristics of wild-type and mutant Stat1 expression plasmids, we examined the behavior of transiently expressed Stat1 proteins in a Stat1-deficient cell line derived by somatic mutation from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (23Muller M.

In rat capillary endothelial (RCE) cells, serum stimulation increased expression of a single PKC isoenzyme, PKCθ, and its translocation to the periphery. Conditional overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of PKCθ markedly inhibited RCE proliferation, as well as closure of a “wound” by RCE migration and formation of capillary rings and tubules in vitro. PKCθ inhibition delayed the endothelial cell cycle at the G2/M phase and prevented formation of actin stress fibers and filopodia but not lamellipodia. The defect in cell morphology and wound closure in PKCθ-kn cells was reversed by overexpressing kinase-active PKCθ, indicating that these RCE functions depend upon PKCθ substrates. Thus, PKCθ is required for multiple processes essential for angiogenesis and wound repair, including endothelial mitosis, maintenance of a normal actin cytoskeleton, and formation of an enclosed tube.

Thus, PKCθ is required for multiple processes essential for angiogenesis and wound repair, including endothelial mitosis, maintenance of a normal actin cytoskeleton, and formation of an enclosed tube. Proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells are essential features of angiogenesis and wound repair (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jackson D. Volpert O.V. Bouck N. Linzer D.I. Science. 1994; 266: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both of these processes, as well as formation of a vessel tube, require tightly regulated changes in the endothelial actin cytoskeleton. Upon cell contact, proliferating endothelial cells become quiescent and develop a static actin cytoskeleton, a prominent feature of which is a peripheral actin band (3Coomber B.L. Gotlieb A.I.

When contact inhibition is released, such as occurs during vascular injury or following the matrix dissolution that accompanies angiogenesis, endothelial cells lose this peripheral actin band, reorganize the actin filaments, reenter the cell cycle, and proliferate. Structures that often develop in migrating fibroblasts include actin stress fibers, filopodia, and lamellipodia, or ruffling (5Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Although several growth factors, cytokines, and their receptors that are required or sufficient for endothelial migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis have been identified (10Coomber B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 194: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Fan T.-P.D. Jaggar R. Bicknell R. Trends Pharmacol.

Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), the intracellular messengers that mediate these processes are largely unrecognized.One group of mediators that are thought to participate in wound repair and angiogenesis are those in the protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C, RCE, rat capillary endothelial; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; kn, kinase-negative; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C, RCE, rat capillary endothelial; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; kn, kinase-negative; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum. family. In some experimental models, addition of phorbol esters, which activate several members of this family, promote endothelial proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, and inhibition of PKC with chemical inhibitors prevents growth and angiogenesis to at least some mitogens (13Daviet I.

Conversely, others have observed inhibitory effects on endothelial growth following activation of PKC, depending upon the experimental conditions (17Doctrow S.R. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Kosaka C. Sasaguri T. Ishida A. Ogata J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C170-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Part of the difficulty in determining the mechanism of either of these phenomena is that the available tools (chemical inhibitors, phorbol esters) inhibit or activate many of the individual gene products that comprise the PKC family; results using these methods reflect the activity of more than one, possibly competing, pathway. Each of these members are separate gene products that have distinct cofactors and substrates (19Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar) and subserve distinct intracellular functions (20Mochly-Rosen D.

In rat capillary endothelial cells (RCE), initial experiments revealed that stimulation with serum increased expression of PKCθ but did not change expression of the other phorbol ester-sensitive isoenzymes. Thus, the possibility that PKCθ might mediate one or more steps in endothelial migration and proliferation was suggested and further investigated in this study.RESULTSTo determine which of the known phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoenzymes were expressed in RCE cells, both cytosolic and membrane (particulate) fractions of both quiescent and serum-stimulated RCE cells were subjected to electrophoresis and blotted with antibodies specific to PKCα, -β, -δ, -ε, -η, and -θ isoenzymes, as well as PKCζ, an isoenzyme not responsive to phorbol ester. Of these isoenzymes, only PKCδ, -η, -θ, -ζ, and a small amount of α were detectable in either the cytosolic or particulate fraction of RCE, similar to our previous findings with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (15Kent K.C. Mii S. Harrington E.O. Chang J.D. Mallette S. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); serum stimulation for 36 h did not increase expression of α, η, or δ isoenzymes but did induce a severalfold increase in PKCθ at both the protein and the RNA levels (Fig.1). Thus, these results suggested the hypothesis that prevention of the action of PKCθ might alter endothelial proliferation induced by serum or phorbol esters.The PKCθ-kn Mutant Inhibits Native PKCθ Activity and Co-localizes with Activated PKCθ in RCE CellsTo test the above hypothesis, a constitutively active, kinase-negative mutation of PKCθ was constructed with a PKCθ cDNA (22Baier G.

In Western blotting with the PKCθ antibody, which would be expected to recognize either native or mutated PKCθ, cells transfected with PKCθ clones (PKCθ-ca or PKCθ-kn) expressed much more anti-PKCθ-reactive protein than did the control cells that expressed endogenous PKCθ only (Fig. 2 A). Only single bands at approximately 85 kDa were detected with this antibody. In a parallel Western blot obtained with the anti-Flag M2 antibody, only the cells transfected with the Flag epitope-tagged PKCθ mutants (PKCθ-ca and PKCθ-kn) were reactive, thus indicating the existence of cloned PKCθ (Fig. 2 B). Although there was some constitutive expression of the mutants in the clones tested, the expression significantly increased after the cells were induced with dexamethasone. Examination of PKC activity in immunoprecipitates of control RCE (expressing the vector only), PKCθ-kn cells, and constitutively active, kinase-active PKCθ (PKCθ-ca) revealed that the PKCθ mutant not only did not possess intrinsic PKC activity but also was able to inhibit most intrinsic PKCθ activity in a dominant-negative fashion (Fig. 3). As expected in the immunoprecipitant containing constitutively active PKCθ, as well as native PKCθ, a significant portion of the activity was independent of phospholipids (phosphatidylserine ). Removal of the transfected PKCθ using the Flag antibody (Fig. 3 B) revealed equal precipitations of native PKCθ in all samples. As was the case with protein expression, some enzymatic activity or inhibition was evident constitutively in the mutant-expressing clones and was significantly increased by dexamethasone. These experiments suggest that the PKCθ-kn inhibitor was effective in preventing the action of PKCθ in vitro.Figure 2Western blot analysis of RCE cells expressing cloned PKCθ. Cell lysates were obtained from the control (transfected with the vector only), PKCθ-ca, or two clones of PKCθ-kn RCE cell lines with or without induction with 25 nm dexamethasone (dx) for 24 h and assayed by immunoblot analysis with PKCθ antibody (A) and Flag antibody (B), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, Coomassie Blue staining, which demonstrates the amount of protein loaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3PKCθ kinase activity of control, PKCθ-ca, and two clones of PKCθ-kn RCE cells.

The constitutively active mutants (either −kn or −ca) were found to translocate to the surface membrane, similar to that seen with cellular activation, even in the absence of serum or cell-to-cell contact (Fig.4 D). Thus, the intracellular location of the PKCθ-kn mutant coincides with, and therefore could potentially inhibit, the activated form of PKCθ in intact cells.Figure 4Immunofluorescence micrographs of cells stained with anti-PKCθ antibody. Both control and PKCθ-kn RCE cells were cultured on glass coverslips in M199 medium with 15% FBS until they reached 50% confluence. After 2 days' serum withdrawal, cells were either stimulated with 15% FBS and 25 nmdexamethasone or maintained without stimulation. Cells then were labeled with an anti-PKCθ antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran-labeled second antibody after 12 h of FBS stimulation.

Statistical analysis revealed that RCE proliferation was neither inhibited nor significantly enhanced by PKCθ-ca. In contrast, the slope of the growth curves of the PKCθ-kn cells was significantly decreased compared with that of the control cells before reaching the plateau of the growth curve. These results showed that overexpression of the PKCθ-kn inhibitor markedly inhibited RCE growth, thus suggesting that PKCθ is required for serum-induced mitogenesis of capillary endothelium. Of note is that only slight inhibition was seen with PKCθ-kn before induction, suggesting that the inhibitor reached levels sufficiently high to alter the phenotype only after induction. To confirm that these findings resulted from the effect of the inhibitor on the substrates of the targeted protein, we transfected the PKCθ-kn cells with a PKCθ-ca cDNA to create the PKCθ-knR (reversal) RCE cell line and examined them to see whether the inhibitory effects would be reversed. The double transfected cells grew at a slower rate than did the control cells but significantly faster than PKCθ-kn cells. Since expression of PKCθ-ca did not exert a significant independent effect on RCE growth, these results suggest that competition with the inhibitor for the substrates caused this reversal and that PKCθ is required for normal RCE cell growth.Figure 5Alteration of cell proliferation in PKCθ-kn endothelial cells. Once the cultures reached 80% confluence, RCE cells were synchronized in serum-free M199 medium for 2 days and then were plated at 2 × 104 cells per 35-mm plate in M199 with 15% FBS, in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 25 nm dexamethasone. Cultures were treated with trypsin at intervals of 24 h, and the cells were counted with a Coulter counter. The experiments were repeated three times. The results are expressed as the mean (± S.D.) of three dishes for each time point.Open symbols, without dexamethasone induction; closed symbols, with 25 nm dexamethasone induction. *,p < 0.01 compared with PKCθ-kn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether inhibition of PKCθ was associated with reduced cell motility, we compared the ability of control, PKCθ-ca, and PKCθ-kn RCE to cover a 300-μm wound placed in a field of confluent cells of each culture. Impaired coverage of the defect by the PKCθ-kn RCE cells was evident by 10 h after wounding. Measurement of the time required to close the gap revealed complete obliteration of the wound in 20 h in the wild-type RCE cells and the PKCθ-ca cells, which did not differ significantly. In contrast, the PKCθ-kn RCE closed the wound much more slowly (Fig.6) and did not achieve full closure until 30 h after wounding. In the experiments shown, all RCE cells were incubated in the absence of serum so that proliferation did not contribute to coverage of the wound. The experiments were repeated in the presence of serum, and qualitatively similar results were obtained (data not shown).Figure 6Repair of a wounded monolayer of RCE cells. Control, PKCθ-ca, PKCθ-kn, and PKCθ-knR (PKCθ-kn cells transfected with the PKCθ-ca cDNA) cells were cultured on the glass coverslips in the presence of 25 nm dexamethasone until confluent, followed by withdrawal of serum from the media. The monolayer was wounded by scraping to a width of approximately 300 μm, and gaps between wound edges were measured under the microscope at 0, 10, and 20 h after wounding. The results are expressed as the mean (± S.D.) of four determinations of the distance that the cell line moved from the original wounding line at each time point. *,p < 0.01 compared with PKCθ-kn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that this effect resulted from inhibition of PKCθ, we also examined the PKCθ-knR (reversal) RCE cells, with the expectation that this product would compete with the PKCθ-kn inhibitor for substrates. The double transfected cells closed the wound significantly faster than did the PKCθ-kn cells, although not as fast as the control cells, indicating that the effect of PKCθ-kn was only partially blocked. Thus, these results suggest that the PKCθ participates in events necessary for wound closure, one of which is endothelial migration.Next, we asked whether expressing PKCθ-kn would also prevent formation of capillary structures in an in vitro model of angiogenesis in a three-dimensional gel containing either collagen or a basement membrane matrix. When cultured in a collagen gel, normal RCE and PKCθ-ca cells formed small rings resembling early capillaries in cross-section (Fig. 7, A andC) and occasional tube-like structures. PKCθ-kn cells, in contrast, formed very few capillary rings (Fig. 7, B andC). When cultured in a Matrigel plate, normal RCE and PKCθ-ca cells formed capillary tube-like structures (Fig.8 A), and the number of these tubules appeared to increased after induction of PKCθ-ca cells with dexamethasone (Fig. 8 C). The number of tube structures of PKCθ-kn cells appeared to be less than that of control RCE and PKCθ-ca cells, especially after induction with dexamethasone (Fig. 8,B and D). Therefore, in addition to inhibiting endothelial proliferation and migration, PKCθ-kn may retard formation of three-dimensional capillary structures, including rings and tubes.Figure 7Capillary ring formation of control and PKCθ-kn RCE cells on collagen plates. Cells were cultured on a 65% collagen gel in complete M199 medium with 25 nmdexamethasone over 10 days.

The score for capillary formation was determined by the mean (± S.D.) of the data derived from six fields in two different cultures of control or PKCθ-kn RCE cells. The capillary ring formation in PKCθ-kn cells was significantly reduced (p < 0.005, t test) as compared with that in control RCE cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Tube formation of RCE cells on Matrigel plates.

Cell cycle analysis revealed that the PKCθ-kn RCE cells demonstrated a delay at the G2/M phase (Fig.9 A–C), 32% of the cells accumulating in this phase, compared with 12% of control cells and 7% of the PKCθ-ca cells (data not shown), at 24 h following addition of serum after deprivation (Fig. 9 D). In contrast to these differences, the length of time required to complete G1 phase, as judged by the time of an increase in the percentage of cells in S phase following release from quiescence, was not significantly different in control RCE cells, the PKCθ-ca cells and PKCθ-kn cells (mean of 12 h in each case). Thus, these results suggest that the inhibition of cell proliferation in PKCθ-kn RCE is caused by a specific delay at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle; PKCθ is not required for progression through G1 and entry into S phase.Figure 9Cell cycle analysis.

Specific morphological differences were noted between subconfluent wild-type or control (vector-transfected) RCE cells and PKCθ-kn cells. The control cells showed a polar migratory shape, typical of capillary endothelial cells and were spread. The PKCθ-kn cells revealed an abnormally rounded shape and were mostly found in clusters or colonies. Because of this observation, and the role that overall PKC activation had been shown to play in maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial and other cell types (30Tang D.G. Diglio C.A. Honn K.V. Prostaglandins. 1993; 45: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we asked whether prevention of PKCθ activity would affect formation of filamentous actin structures. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that wild-type RCE developed prominent stress fibers composed of filamentous actin, with limited amounts of actin in a dense peripheral band (Fig. 10, A andB). Actin containing filopodia were also seen in the wild-type cells (Fig. 6 C and Fig. 10 A,small arrowheads) as well as in the PKCθ-ca RCE cells, which also demonstrated prominent actin stress fibers. In contrast, the PKCθ-kn RCE demonstrated a very prominent dense peripheral band of actin but had few of these stress fibers or filopodia (Fig. 10,C–F); instead, in the cytoplasm, actin appeared largely as small globules not organized into filaments. Cell ruffling (lamellipodia) around the edges of both control RCE and the cluster of PKCθ-kn cells (Fig. 10 C) was clearly identified, indicating that PKCθ is not a critical factor in this aspect of cytoskeletal function. In the PKCθ-knR cells (in which PKCθ-kn cells were transfected with a PKCθ-ca cDNA), F-actin arrangement and cell morphology regained the characteristics of those in the control RCE cells, suggesting further that PKCθ is involved in the formation of F-actin stress fibers (Fig. 10, G andH).Figure 10Fluorescence micrographs of control and PKCθ-kn cells stained for actin with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin.

Stromblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PKCθ-kn expression on adhesion of RCE to vitronectin. No impairment of adhesion of the endothelial cells to vitronectin was noted in the PKCθ-kn cells (data not shown), suggesting that this PKC isoenzyme may not participate in signaling events that are critical to the ability of integrin or other receptors to bind to an insoluble matrix.DISCUSSIONThis study reveals that PKCθ is a necessary component of the signal transduction pathway that leads to endothelial mitosis and formation of cytoskeletal structures by filamentous actin. These observations were made using a PKCθ-kn inhibitor designed by methods shown by others (26Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J.

The effectiveness of this inhibitor is suggested by the inhibition of PKCθ activity in the in vitro enzymatic assay. Furthermore, the fact that changes in endothelial cell function significantly increased upon expression of the mutated gene at higher levels, following induction in the same cells, indicated that the observed phenotype resulted from this inhibitor. That the PKCθ-kn inhibitor is specific for the substrates of PKCθ is suggested by the reversal of the phenotype by overexpression of PKCθ in the affected cells. Thus, although it is not ruled out that other isoenzymes or unrelated proteins can also interact with these unidentified substrates, it seems likely that the observed effect results from inhibition of phosphorylation of PKCθ substrates.The potential relevance of these observations to the understanding of the intracellular mechanisms that regulate angiogenesis and repair of a damaged"

First, we determined that the native molecular weight of purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is only large enough (M r 1,200,000) to contain one copy of each protein in the complex, including dystrophin. Using different approaches, we also demonstrated that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex significantly protected a fraction of actin filaments from disassembly, while individual recombinant actin binding fragments of dystrophin or calpain-digested dystrophin-glycoprotein complex had no effect on F-actin depolymerization. The protective effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on F-actin depolymerization saturated at a dystrophin:actin molar ratio of 0.04, corresponding to 1 dystrophin/25 actin monomers, which is highly consistent with the 1:24 stoichiometry of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin previously measured at equilibrium. However, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex did not bind G-actin or alter the kinetics or extent of actin polymerization. This excluded the possibility that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex inhibited actin depolymerization by capping the ends of actin filaments. It therefore appears that actin binding domains separated on the dystrophin molecule from each other by almost 1,200 amino acids act in concert to protect F-actin from depolymerization. Our data suggest that dystrophin stabilizes F-actin in vitro by binding alongside an actin filament and bridging actin monomers in a manner analogous to the actin side binding protein tropomyosin. It is noteworthy that we did not find any effect of skeletal muscle tropomyosin on dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin. This indicates that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and tropomyosin may simultaneously bind the same actin filament and identifies another feature that distinguishes dystrophin from the other proteins in the actin-cross-linking superfamily.

These studies suggest that the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is an essential functional unit that links the actin-based membrane cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix and may play a structural role in maintaining sarcolemmal membrane integrity during muscle contraction. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that the absence of, or abnormality in, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex renders muscle more susceptible to necrosis (10Campbell K.P.

Striated muscle dystrophin is predominantly expressed as a 427-kDa, four-domain protein with the first three domains exhibiting significant sequence homology with the cytoskeletal proteins α-actinin and spectrin (12Koenig M.

Based on its sequence homology with spectrin and α-actinin (12Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 13Matsudaira P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7851-7855Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), dystrophin was speculatively modeled as an antiparallel dimer that formed a hexagonal lattice by cross-linking different actin filaments through oppositely oriented amino-terminal actin binding domains. However, our recent characterization of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) indicated that this model for the interaction between intact dystrophin and F-actin may require substantial revision. First, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex bound to F-actin with a stoichiometry of 1 dystrophin/24 actin monomers and an average apparent K d for dystrophin of 0.5 μm. Second, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex failed to induce cross-linking of actin filaments into supermolecular networks or bundles. Third, we identified a novel actin binding site located near the middle of the dystrophin rod domain. Recombinant dystrophin fragments corresponding to this novel actin binding site and the original amino-terminal actin binding domain of dystrophin both bound F-actin but with significantly lower affinity than was observed with intact dystrophin in the glycoprotein complex. Fourth, we found that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex significantly slowed depolymerization of F-actin. These experimental findings led us to propose a model in which dystrophin binds alongside an actin filament via two or more low affinity binding sites distributed throughout its amino-terminal and rod domains (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Ervasti J.M. Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Froehner S.C. Bennett V.

The current study was designed to further test the actin side binding model for dystrophin by determining the oligomeric state of native dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and examining the mechanism by which dystrophin-glycoprotein complex protects actin filaments from depolymerization. Our results indicate that the native molecular weight of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is only large enough to contain one copy of each protein in the complex, including dystrophin. Using different approaches, we have also confirmed that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex significantly protects a fraction of actin filaments from depolymerization. The protective effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on F-actin depolymerization was dependent on the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex concentration and saturated at a dystrophin:actin ratio of 0.04, corresponding to 1 dystrophin/25 actin monomers. This result is highly consistent with the 1:24 stoichiometry of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin measured at equilibrium (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, recombinant proteins corresponding to the two identified actin binding domains of dystrophin failed to slow F-actin disassembly. We also studied actin polymerization in the absence and presence of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and found that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex neither binds G-actin nor alters the kinetics or extent of actin assembly. This excluded the possibility that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex protects F-actin from depolymerization by nucleating assembly or capping filament ends. Our results suggest that dystrophin stabilizes F-actin by laterally bridging actin monomers over relatively long stretches of a filament. Interestingly, we did not find any effect of skeletal muscle tropomyosin on dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin, which suggests that these proteins can simultaneously bind to an actin filament. Taken together, these results suggest that dystrophin exists as a monomer in the glycoprotein complex and binds alongside an actin filament with 0.5 μm affinity via two or more discrete low affinity binding sites distributed throughout its amino-terminal and rod-like domains. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was purified from KCl-washed rabbit skeletal muscle membranes solubilized with either 1% digitonin or 1% Triton X-100 (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Calpain-digested dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was prepared by incubation of 0.9 mg/ml dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with 0.06 mg/ml m-calpain (Sigma) at 25 °C for 60 min as described previously (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was terminated with the addition of E-64 (Sigma) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Recombinant dystrophin fragments DYS246 (amino acids 1–246) and DYS1416 (amino acids 1416–1880) were expressed and purified as described previously (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle using the method of Pardee and Spudich (17Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to MacLean-Fletcher and Pollard (18MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) following the procedures outlined by Bryan and Coluccio (19Bryan J. Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Actin concentration was determined by absorbance using E 290 = 0.65 cm2/mg (18MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The concentration of pyrene-G-actin and the pyrene:actin ratio were determined as described by Cooper et al. (20Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Pyrene-G-actin was stored at −80 °C and thawed in a water bath immediately before use. Spectrin was purified from low ionic strength extracts of rabbit erythrocyte ghosts according to Bennett (21Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Laminin-1 was the kind gift of Dr. Hynda Kleinman (National Institutes of Health). Bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I was purchased from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Rabbit skeletal muscle tropomyosin was generously provided by Dr. Marion Greaser (University of Wisconsin). Monoclonal antibody XIXC2 against dystrophin was the kind gift of Dr. Kevin Campbell (University of Iowa). Monoclonal antibody against α-sarcomeric actin was purchased from Sigma. For native molecular weight determination, 0.3–0.4 mg of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was loaded onto a 1 × 30-cm Superose 6 HR prepacked column or a 2.5 × 48.5-cm Sephacryl-500 column (Pharmacia). The Superose 6 HR column was eluted at 0.15 ml/min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.18 m NaCl, 0.1% digitonin, while the Sephacryl-500 column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.18 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The Stokes radius for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was determined from a calibration curve of the protein standards catalase (52.2 Å), ferritin (61 Å), thyroglobulin (85 Å) (all from Pharmacia), spectrin dimer (123 Å; Ref. 22Davis J.

The native molecular weight and frictional ratio of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was calculated (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys.

To assess whether dystrophin-glycoprotein complex interacted with G-actin, 1.5 ml of 0.26 mg/ml dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (0.3 μm dystrophin) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmNaN3, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% digitonin, 0.2 mm CaCl2was preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with 6 μm G-actin, loaded onto a 2.5 × 49-cm Sephacryl-400 column (Pharmacia), and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. F-actin was depolymerized by rapid dilution of actin filaments 3-fold to 2.5 μm in low salt buffer conditions (2.3 mm NaCl and 0.05 mmMgCl2). F-actin depolymerization was also induced by the addition of 5 μm deoxyribonuclease I in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1 mmATP, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% digitonin. After incubation for various times, the remaining F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and quantitated densitometrically from Coomassie Blue-stained gels loaded with equal volumes of supernatants and pellets (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Pyrenyl actin filaments assembled alone or in the presence of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex were induced to depolymerize by dilution to 0.3 μm in low salt buffer conditions (15 mm NaCl and 0.3 mm MgCl2). Polymerization of 2 μm pyrenyl G-actin preincubated alone or in the presence of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% digitonin, 0.2 mm CaCl2 was initiated by the addition of KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 0.1 mand 2 mm, respectively. The dystrophin:actin molar ratio was 1:5 in all experiments. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. While commonly modeled as an antiparallel dimer, the physical characterization of dystrophin has been severely hampered by its exceedingly low abundance in native tissues. Assuming that the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is minimally composed of 1 mol each of dystrophin (M r 427,000), α-dystroglycan (M r 156,000), dystrobrevin (M r 87,000), α-sarcoglycan (M r 50,000), α-dystroglycan (M r 43,000), β-sarcoglycan (M r 43,000), δ-sarcoglycan (M r 35,000), γ-sarcoglycan (M r 35,000), and 25-kDa dystrophin-associated protein (M r 25,000) and 2 mol of syntrophins (M r 59,000) predicts a complex with an aggregate molecular weight of 1,019,000. Assembly of dystrophin into dimers would therefore imply a native molecular weight of ∼2,000,000 for the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. To clarify this issue, we have estimated the native molecular weight of purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex using gel permeation chromatography. Regardless of the column or detergent used (see below), dystrophin-glycoprotein complex eluted as a single sharp peak. Based on a calibration curve of protein standards (Fig.1), the elution profile of purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex yielded a Stokes radius of 160 Å when chromatography was performed on a Sephacryl-500 column in buffer containing the detergent Triton X-100. A highly similar average Stokes radius of 157 Å was measured for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex applied to a Superose 6 HR column in buffer containing digitonin as detergent (not shown). Using these Stokes radius values and a previous measurement of its sedimentation coefficient (18 S) by sucrose density gradient sedimentation (1Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), the native molecular weight of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was calculated to be 1,200,000 with a frictional ratio of 2.3. Highly similar molecular weight values were obtained if the chromatography data were instead plotted as a function of the log molecular weight (not shown). These results were also highly consistent with the molecular weight obtained (1,350,000) by sedimentation equilibrium analysis of purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. 1C. W. Dornin and T. M. Laue, personal communication. Taken together, these data indicate that the native molecular weight of the purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is only large enough to contain one copy of dystrophin. We previously demonstrated that preequilibration of F-actin with dystrophin-glycoprotein complex significantly slowed the depolymerization of actin filaments induced by dilution into low salt buffer conditions (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For example, 80 min after dilution into buffer containing 2.3 mm NaCl and 0.05 mmMgCl2 (final concentrations), 11.3% of actin alone was recovered in the high speed pellet, while 25.6% of actin pelleted when preincubated with dystrophin-glycoprotein complex at a 1:5 (dystrophin:actin) molar ratio (Fig.2 A). Virtually all actin (97.5%) was retained in the high speed pellet if F-actin was diluted into buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 2 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 2 A). Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex also significantly protected pyrene labeled F-actin from depolymerization induced by rapid dilution into low salt buffer conditions (Fig. 3). Analysis over a wider time range (20 min to 20 h) indicated that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex significantly protected F-actin from disassembly for at least 4 h postdilution (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The protective effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on F-actin depolymerization was dependent on the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex concentration and saturated at a dystrophin:actin ratio of 0.04 corresponding to 1 dystrophin/25 actin monomers (Fig. 2 B). This result is highly consistent with the 1:24 stoichiometry of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex binding to F-actin measured at equilibrium (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and suggests that dystrophin binding to F-actin is responsible for the protective effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on actin depolymerization.Figure 3Effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on depolymerization of pyrene-labeled F-actin. 2 μm pyrene-labeled F-actin was preincubated in the absence (□) or presence of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (○) and was induced to depolymerize by rapid dilution into low salt buffer conditions. The decrease in pyrene fluorescence intensity was followed over time. The data are plotted as the percentage of fluorescence relative to the amount of fluorescence at time zero.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Micromolar concentrations of deoxyribonuclease I can also induce depolymerization of actin filaments (Fig.4 A), probably through the combined effects of monomer sequestration and destabilization of actin monomer binding to the filament pointed end (33Hitchcock S.E. Carisson L. Lindberg U. Cell. 1976; 7: 531-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Weber A. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4780-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although its effects on F-actin are complex, deoxyribonuclease I-driven depolymerization is advantageous (over the dilution method used above) in that it can be performed at constant actin and actin-binding protein concentrations under more physiological buffer conditions. Therefore, we were able to directly compare the effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with that of two recombinant actin binding fragments of dystrophin (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle tropomyosin on F-actin depolymerization induced by deoxyribonuclease I (Fig. 4 B). Both dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and tropomyosin significantly inhibited F-actin depolymerization induced by deoxyribonuclease I (Fig.4 B). 80 min after the addition of deoxyribonuclease I, 61.5 ± 3.9% of F-actin was recovered in the high speed pellet when preequilibrated with tropomyosin, while 40.9 ± 4.2% of F-actin pelleted in the presence of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, only 28 ± 3.3% of F-actin was recovered in the high speed pellet if depolymerized in the absence of tropomyosin or dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Fig. 4 B). The effects of tropomyosin and dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on actin depolymerization were not additive, since preincubation of F-actin with saturating concentrations of both tropomyosin and dystrophin-glycoprotein complex yielded a protective effect that was quantitatively indistinguishable from that observed in the presence of tropomyosin alone (Fig. 4 C). Neither dystrophin recombinant protein DYS246 nor DYS1416 had an effect on actin depolymerization when compared with F-actin alone (Fig. 4 B), even when both were present at molar ratios as high as 5:1 with respect to actin (not shown). These results suggested that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex stabilizes F-actin by the concerted effect of two or more actin binding sites distributed throughout its amino-terminal and rod-like domains. As a complementary approach, we examined the effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on actin depolymerization after limited proteolysis. Limited calpain digestion of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex yields a stable series of actin binding dystrophin fragments, while other components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex remain intact but no longer cosediment with F-actin (15Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The protective effect of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex on actin depolymerization was completely abolished upon digestion with calpain (Fig.5). These results suggest that an intact dystrophin molecule is necessary to protect actin filaments from depolymerization.Figure 5Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex fails to protect F-actin from depolymerization after limited calpain digestion. 6 μm F-actin in buffer containing 10 mm NaCl and 0.2 mm MgCl2 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the absence (control) or presence of calpain-digested (Calpain DGC) or intact dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), each present at a 1:10 molar ratio with respect to actin. The samples were rapidly diluted 3-fold into buffer without NaCl and MgCl2 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min beginning 220 min after dilution. The fraction of actin (% F-actin) remaining in the pellet was determined densitometrically from Coomassie Blue-stained gels loaded with equal volumes of supernatants and pellets. The data represent the average (± S.E.) of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An actin-binding protein that alters actin disassembly might also affect actin assembly. However, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex did not significantly affect the rate or extent of polymerization of pyrene-labeled actin at concentrations and molar ratios that inhibited depolymerization (Fig. 6). This result suggested that dystrophin-glycoprotein complex does not nucleate actin polymerization or alter the rate of filament elongation. As a further test of whether dystrophin-glycoprotein complex may nucleate actin polymerization, we incubated G-actin for 1 h"

The molecular mechanisms that enhance integrin function in stimulated hematopoietic cells are poorly understood. Phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic tail is a recently described but prevalent phenomenon, with unknown effects on αvβ3function. Here, we show that mutation of the β3cytoplasmic tail tyrosine 747 to phenylalanine (Y747F) prevents β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in two cell lines. Whereas this mutation has no effect on αvβ3-mediated adhesion in a cell with constitutive β3 function, it completely abolishes adhesion and clot retraction by a cell that requires stimulation for β3 function. Ligand-induced conformational change as detected by LIBS-1 antibody occurs normally in Y747F mutant αvβ3. Thus, tyrosine 747 of β3 is required for stimulation of αvβ3-mediated adhesion, probably due to its phosphorylation. Because the motif in β3 required for tyrosine phosphorylation is shared by several integrin β-chains, this may be a conserved mechanism for regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion.

Integrin receptors are plasma membrane heterodimers expressed on all nucleated cells, critical for development and normal homeostasis because of their essential role in mediating cell adhesion. In many cells, integrin-mediated adhesion is constitutive. However, in hematopoietic cells, integrin function is constitutively repressed, and integrin activity requires cell stimulation by chemokines, proteases, bacterial peptides, or other molecules found at sites of thrombosis or inflammation (7Carlos T.M.

The additional level of regulation imposed by the need for stimulation presumably confines leukocyte and platelet adhesion, and their attendant proinflammatory effects, to sites of perturbation of homeostasis such as trauma or infection. Importantly, the requirement for stimulation limits unwarranted damage to healthy tissue and intravascular thrombosis or inflammation. Few details are known about the mechanism for activation of integrin-mediated adhesion, either in terms of the signal transduction pathways leading to enhanced adhesion or the molecular interactions that mediate increased integrin function. One of the better studied models for integrin activation involves the β3 integrins (3Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J.

Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of β3 tyrosines at position 747 and/or 759 were introduced into the β3 cDNA by PCR mutagenesis. A PstI fragment of pIAP93 (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) containing the β3 CT was subcloned into pBSIIKS as a template for nested PCR. Two PCR reactions, using either the T3 primer with 5′-TGATGAGGAGTTTCCATATGAGCAGGGCGGCAAGGC-3′ or the T7 primer with 5′-GCCTTGCCGCCCTGCTCATATGGAAACTCCTCATCA-3′, were followed by a nested PCR using the two products as a template for a reaction with T7 and T3 oligonucleotides to introduce a silent NdeI restriction site at position 714 of β3. After recloning into pBSIIKS via PstI, the process was repeated using 5′-TCCTGCAATCCTGGCGCTAGCTGATAATGATCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGATCATTATCAGCTAGCGCCAGGATTGCAGGA-3′ to introduce a silentNheI site 3′ of the β3 termination codon. This product was cloned into pIAP93 via PstI digests yielding pBLY100, containing the complete coding sequence of β3with the silent introduction of NdeI and NheI restriction sites at amino acid position 714 of β3 and just 3′ of the termination codon, respectively. pBLY100 was used as the template for the introduction of Tyr → Phe mutations by nested PCR using oligonucleotides bridging the NdeI and NheI sites, 5′-CTTGCCGCCCTGCTCATATGGAAACTCCTC-3′ and 5′-AATCCTGGCGCTAGCTGATAATGATCTGAG-3′, respectively, with 5′-ACGTGGCCTCTTTAAACAGTGGGTTGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACAACCCACTGTTTAAAGAGGCCACGT-3′ for Y747F and with 5′-TATCATTAAGTGCCCCGGAACGTGATATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATATCACGTTCCGGGGCACTTAATGATA-3′ for Y759F.

Equivalently high β3-expressing cell populations were obtained by fluorescent cell sorting using mAb AP3 against β3 and are reported as the mean fluorescent index (MFI). Transfected receptor expression was unchanged by all experimental manipulations as assessed by flow cytometry using mAb AP3. The expression levels of transfected wild type and Tyr → Phe mutant β3 over the course of experimentation was monitored and is reported as the percentage of CD47 expression (mAb B6H12 reactivity, Ref. 1Blystone S.D.

CD47 expression in K562 and CS-1 was unchanged by β3 receptor expression or experimental manipulation. Monocyte-derived macrophages and human umbilical endothelial cells were prepared as described (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Platelets were prepared from fresh citrated whole blood (1:100, v/v, 17% sodium citrate) by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 15 min. Platelet-rich plasma was then centrifuged at 2600 rpm for 10 min and platelets resuspended in HBSS containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+(HBSS2+). LIBS-1 reactivity of β3-expressing K562 cells was determined exactly as described in the absence and presence of 20 ng/ml PMA, 0.2 mm Mn2+, or 2 mm GRGDSP peptide (4Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I.

Immunoprecipitation of β3 followed by phosphotyrosine Western blotting and reprobing for β3was performed exactly as described (5Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J.

For β3 immunoprecipitations from thrombin-treated platelets, 1.0 unit/ml α-thrombin was added to platelets suspended in HBSS2+ at 2.5 × 107/ml. After 1 min at 22 °C, platelets were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge and the platelet pellet was solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation exactly as described for K562 cells (5Blystone S.D.

For adhesion to tissue culture plastic, 1 × 106 K562 or CS-1 cells expressing wild type or Tyr → Phe mutant β3 with αv were placed in wells of 24-well dishes (Corning) in 1.0 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with or without PMA (20 ng/ml) or α-thrombin (1 unit/ml). After 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, wells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. The number of adherent cells per well was determined by averaging the visual count of five random fields per well using a 10-μm2 gridded eyepiece and extrapolated to the total surface area of the well. Alternatively, adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and the absorbance at 570 nm used to quantitate adhesion. Results were identical using both methods. Data are reported as the percent of added cells that adhered in 3 h and represent the mean ± S.D. of no fewer than eight determinations in triplicate. For adhesion to vitronectin, wells of 96-well plates (Immulon II, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml vitronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS, washed once with PBS, and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mg/ml casein in PBS. After one PBS wash, 1 × 105 K562 or CS-1 cells expressing wild type or mutant β3 with αv were placed in each well in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium without serum and with or without PMA (20 ng/ml) or PMA and mAb L230 to αv (20 μg/ml) or genistein (25 μg/ml). Adhesion was scored as above following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. Shown is the average ± S.D. of no fewer than six determinations performed in triplicate. 3 × 106 K562 cells expressing wild type or Tyr → Phe mutant β3 with αv in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added to 100 μl of fresh human plasma, which was depleted of fibronectin by gelatin affinity chromatography as described previously (6Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clotting was initiated by the addition of 1 unit of α-thrombin, and samples were incubated at 37 °C. Percent retraction was scored at 3 h by measuring the length of retracted clots in relation to clot length in the absence of cells by 100 − ([length of clot in the absence of cells]/[length of clot in the presence of cells] × 100). Shown is a representative experiment with average ± S.D. of a total of four separate experiments performed in duplicate. To determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in integrin activation, we examined the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in cells with either activable or constitutively active integrins. β3phosphorylation was detected under base-line conditions in human endothelial cells, which have constitutively active β3integrins, and was induced by Mn2+ in monocyte-derived macrophages and by Mn2+ or thrombin in human platelets (Fig. 1 B). These platelet data confirm previous reports (5Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Whereas Law et al. (21Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) found that visualizing β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets required denaturing conditions during solubilization, this was not the case in the present study. This difference is potentially due to the extent to which platelet aggregation is allowed to proceed. Treatment of macrophages or platelets with agents such as thrombin induces β3-mediated adhesion or aggregation. Thus, in primary cells, the extent of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the functional state of the integrin. The CS-1 and K562 cell lines were transfected with wild type or mutant constructs of β3 in which the tyrosines at positions 747 (Y747F), 759 (Y759F), or both (Y747,759F) were mutated to phenylalanine. Expression levels of mutant β3 cDNAs with endogenous hamster αv in CS-1 (CSβ3) or with co-transfected human αv in K562 cells (Kαvβ3) was equivalent to wild type αvβ3 (Figs. 1 C and 3). No transfectant expressed any other αv integrin or αIIbβ3 (Ref. 1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and data not shown). In both K562 and CS-1, the Y747F mutation abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 (Fig. 1 C), showing that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 absolutely depended on this tyrosine in both cell lines. In cells expressing wild type β3, tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 in CS-1 cells (Fig. 1 C) was constitutive, whereas phosphorylation of β3 in K562 was induced by Mn2+ or adhesion to αvβ3 ligand (5Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Like endothelial cells, CS-1 cells exhibited constitutive β3-mediated adhesion, whereas K562 cells did not (see below). Thus, in these transfectants as well as in primary cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of β3correlated with adhesive phenotype. This finding suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 CT might be required for β3 integrin function. To determine the function of β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we assessed the effect of tyrosine mutations in β3 on αvβ3-dependent adhesion. K562 or CS-1 cells expressing αvβ3 or β3 mutants were incubated in tissue culture wells containing 10% serum with or without PMA or thrombin to enhance integrin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 2,A and B). CS-1 cells exhibited strong constitutive β3-dependent adhesion, which was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to αv (L230, data not shown) and β3 (7G2, data not shown) and unaffected by thrombin (1 unit/ml) or PMA (20 ng/ml). This constitutive adhesion was unaffected by mutation of the β3 CT tyrosines to phenylalanines (Fig. 2 A), as reported previously (3Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Damsky C. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Ylanne J. Huuskonen J. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Virtanen I. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9550-9557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, Kαvβ3 showed significant adhesion only after initiation of inside-out signaling by PMA or thrombin. Importantly, PMA- and thrombin-stimulated adhesion of Kαvβ3 required a tyrosine residue at position 747 because neither Kαvβ3Y747F nor Kαvβ3Y747,759F adhered following stimulation (Fig. 2 B). However, the Y759F mutation, which does not affect tyrosine phosphorylation in K562, had no effect on stimulated αvβ3-dependent adhesion. Thus, Tyr-747 is required for both β3 tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulated αvβ3-mediated adhesion in K562 cells. Similar results were obtained when adhesion to vitronectin was examined in the absence of serum (Fig. 2, C and D). αvβ3-dependent adhesion of CS-1 cells to vitronectin was constitutive and not altered by PMA or mutation of β3 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (Fig.2 C), whereas adhesion of Kαvβ3to vitronectin required both exogenous stimulation and Tyr-747 (Fig.2 D). Adhesion to vitronectin by both CS-β3cells with or without PMA, and Kαvβ3 after inside-out signaling was inhibited by mAb L230 to αv(Fig. 2, C and D) and mAb 7G2 against β3 (data not shown). In both CS-1 and K562 cells, maximal adhesion was accompanied by cell spreading (data not shown). To ensure that minor differences in receptor expression were not responsible for differences in adhesion seen in Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y747F, we assessed cell adhesion over a range of receptor expression. In K562 populations, where wild type αvβ3 expression was only 56 ± 8% of αvβ3Y747F expression, the dependence upon the tyrosine at position 747 for stimulated adhesion (PMA, 20 ng/ml) was retained (Kαvβ3 adhesion to Vn 82 ± 11% versus 11 ± 7% for Kαvβ3Y747F). In a cell population in which expression of αvβ3Y759F was 43 ± 9% of αvβ3Y747F, adhesion of Kαvβ3Y759F (65 ± 6%) was enhanced almost 6-fold over αvβ3Y747F (11 ± 7%) in the presence of PMA. Adhesion and spreading of all K562 transfectants on fibronectin via α5β1 (in the presence of 5.0 μg/ml 7G2 antibody against β3) was equivalent (data not shown). However, the enhanced adhesion to fibronectin seen with αvβ3 expression in K562 (1Blystone S.D. Graham I.L. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which is further increased by PMA treatment, was dependent on Tyr-747, because the Y747F mutation abolished 95% of the αvβ3-dependent PMA-stimulated adhesion. Treatment of Kαvβ3 with PMA or thrombin in the absence of αvβ3 ligand failed to induce β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells in suspension (data not shown). This is in agreement with the report of Law et al. (21Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) that β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets required ligand binding. Clot retraction is an activable β3 integrin function in platelets that is thought to be required for normal wound healing. To determine the role of β3 CT tyrosines in clot retraction, we assessed the ability of K562 cells expressing wild type or tyrosine mutant β3 to retract thrombin-generated fibrin clots. In this assay, thrombin has the dual function of initiating both clot formation and inside-out signaling in K562 cells. As seen in Fig.2 E, only K562 cells expressing αvβ3 with a tyrosine at position 747 were able to retract a fibrin clot. Clot retraction by Kαvβ3 and Kαvβ3Y759F was inhibited completely by mAb L230 at 20 μg/ml (data not shown). These data demonstrate that Tyr-747 is required for the activation of αvβ3 in K562, a myeloid cell line. Because the mutation of Tyr-747 to phenylalanine is conservative in many respects except phosphorylation, these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 is necessary for activation of adhesion in these cells. Accordingly, adhesion of αvβ3-expressing K562 to vitronectin was inhibited completely by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (25 μg/ml, Fig. 2 D). Whereas genistein inhibition is not solely selective for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation, its inhibition of adhesion is consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation of Tyr-747. In contrast, incubation of either cell type with 2 mm sodium pervanadate led to an accumulation of phosphotyrosine in wild type β3 but did not induce cell adhesion in β3-transfected K562 or alter cell adhesion in transfected CS-1 (data not shown). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation in the β3 cytoplasmic tail is probably necessary but is not sufficient to induce adhesion in K562. Integrins undergo changes in physical conformation, which result in the exposure of cryptic structural sites in their extracellular domain (4Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For β3 in platelets, thrombin stimulation enhances the binding of mAb PAC-1 to a neoepitope. RGD peptide ligation of αvβ3 results in the exposure of a ligand-induced binding site, which is recognized by the mAb LIBS-1. The β3 CT can influence the generation of LIBS, as demonstrated by the S752P mutation of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (11Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Ylänne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutation of the tyrosines in the β3 cytoplasmic tail of αvβ3 did not affect the ability of RGD ligand to bind αvβ3 and induce LIBS-1 reactivity in either CS-1 cells (data not shown) or K562 cells (Fig.3). Thus, the Y747F mutation that prevented K562 cell adhesion to ligand-coated surfaces in response to inside-out signaling did not prevent induction of the αvβ3 conformational change recognized by LIBS-1. Without ligand, neither PMA (Fig. 3) nor thrombin (data not shown) could induce LIBS-1 binding, supporting the hypothesis that their mechanism of action does not involve induction of this conformational change in the integrin (25Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These data extend a model of β3 integrin activation in hematopoietic cells. Ligand binding by integrins can induce both a conformational change in the integrin and also phosphorylation of Tyr-747. However, neither the conformation change nor the tyrosine phosphorylation are sufficient to permit adhesion and spreading in hematopoietic cells. Rather, tyrosine-phosphorylated integrin is the necessary substrate for inside-out signaling to induce adhesion and spreading. The fact that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for K562 adhesion, where β3 function is regulated, but not CS-1 adhesion, where β3 function is constitutive, suggests that the hematopoietic β3 integrin activation cascade rather than adhesion itself requires tyrosine phosphorylation. A requirement for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the response to activation signals but not for the process of adhesion and spreading supports a model in which integrin activation is actively suppressed in unstimulated hematopoietic cells (26Kucik D.F.

N-Myristoylated proteins are therefore found associated with a variety of organelles with the myristate moiety required for such diverse functions as specific protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, ligand-induced protein conformational changes, and/or correct subcellular targeting. This protein modification occurs almost exclusively cotranslationally within synthesis of the first 100 amino acids and is catalyzed by the enzyme myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) 1The abbreviations used are: NMT,N-myristoyltransferase; ORF, open reading frame; hNMT, human NMT; bNMT, bovine brain NMT; TLCK,l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; pAb, polyclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; 5′-RACE, rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; mAb, monoclonal antibody; yNMT, yeast NMT.

Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals NMT to be distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of yeast and mammalian cells (16Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

This finding plus evidence that N-myristoylation occurs on nascent polypeptides bound to free polyribosomes establish that NMT is physically localized and functionally active in the cell cytoplasm (14Deichaite I. Casson L.P. Ling H.P. Resh M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Garber E.A. Hanafusa H.

However, no evidence has been offered identifying a more specific subcytosolic localization. Protein N-myristoylation appears to be a tightly regulated reaction involving the coordinated participation of several different enzymes/proteins (e.g. N-methionylaminopeptidase, fatty acid synthetase, long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, acyl-CoA-binding proteins, etc.), access of NMT to pools of myristoyl-CoA, and the timelyN-myristoylation of nascent polypeptide substrates to avoid potential interfering reactions (e.g. N-acetylation and polypeptide folding) (14Deichaite I.

Glover C.J. Hartman K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability of NMT to function in such a process implies the existence of mechanisms designed to ensure targeting of the enzyme to the appropriate protein synthesis machinery, possibly involving interactions with other cooperating components that facilitate the recognition and efficient N-myristoylation of the rapidly growing polypeptide substrates. However, no information is available regarding mechanisms regulating either the specific association of NMT with the cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery (i.e. ribosomes, ribosome-associated factors, etc.) or even its direct participation during protein synthesis. Both are presumably required for NMT to accomplish the cotranslationalN-myristoylation of proteins in mammalian cells. Previous observations have raised questions as to whether NMT functions as a monomer or as part of a larger protein synthetic complex (23King M.J. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is also not clear if NMT functions in vivo as a soluble enzyme (or complex) or whether it acts in close association with insoluble subcellular structures (17McIlhinney R.A. McGlone K. Exp.

For example, NMT activity is prepared as a soluble monomer from extracts of human erythroleukemia cells (29Kishore N.S. Wood D.C. Mehta P.P. Wade A.C. Lu T. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

The ready extraction of most of the NMT activity from insoluble pellets obtained from yeast, rat brain, and bovine brain with one or two sequential washes of low ionic strength buffers prompted the comparison of NMT with loosely bound peripheral membrane proteins (31Glover C.J. Goddard C. Felsted R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas itsin vitro activation by various organic solvents prompted suggestions that it behaved as an integral membrane protein (25Boutin J.A.

Also unresolved is whether NMT subunit sizes ranging from 48 to 67 kDa (26Boutin J.A. Ferry G. Ernould A. Maes P. Remond G. Vincent M. Eur. J.

A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (i.e. predicting a ≈48-kDa enzyme) and/or to ORFs comparable to the alternative in-frame start site(s) found −183 and −186 nucleotides upstream of the assigned hNMT gene (i.e. predicting a ≈55-kDa enzyme). Immunoblotting with anti-hNMT antibodies has identified a ≈60-kDa polypeptide as the predominant NMT subunit in bovine brain and human HeLa cells (17McIlhinney R.A. McGlone K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also identified were smaller immuno-cross-reacting forms (i.e. 46–57 kDa) which apparently resulted from postextraction proteolysis of the NH2 terminus of the ≈60-kDa bNMT subunit. A close relationship was also observed between NH2-terminal proteolysis and the conversion of high molecular mass forms of native bNMT (i.e. ≈120 and ≈400 kDa) into a fully active ≈50-kDa enzyme. This latter correlation suggested that the NH2-terminal domain of native bNMT, although dispensable for catalytic activity, may have in vivo regulatory functions related to subunit multimerization and/or NMT interaction(s) with other cellular proteins (24Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A catalytically active 46-kDa NMT has also been purified fromDrosophila which apparently results from NH2-terminal proteolysis of a larger precursor (37Ntwasa M. Egerton M. Gay N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show a specific association of hNMT with the ribosomal subcellular fractions from human lymphoblastic leukemia (i.e. CEM and MOLT-4) and human cervical carcinoma (i.e. HeLa) cells. We also use HeLa cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged recombinant hNMTs (i.e. ≈60 and ≈50 kDa) corresponding to the two possible ORFs found in the hNMT gene (36Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that the recombinant ≈60-kDa polypeptide translated from the larger ORF is similar in size to native hNMT and is localized to the ribosomal fraction, whereas the substantially smaller ≈50-kDa recombinant polypeptide is found primarily in the cytosolic fraction. Also shown is a preferential binding of recombinant ≈60-kDa FLAG-NMT to isolated CEM ribosomes. Our experiments thus provide in vivo and in vitro subcellular targeting and recombinant protein expression data indicating that the native ≈60-kDa hNMT is translated from a start site up-stream from the previously assigned hNMT gene and that the additional NH2-terminal residues included in the larger polypeptide are involved in the specific targeting of hNMT to the ribosomal subcellular fraction. Cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Gaithersburg, MD) and included CEM (ATCC CCL 119) and MOLT-4 (ATCC CRL 1582) cells that were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and HeLa (ATCC CCL 2) cells that were cultured in minimal essential medium with 2 mmglutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Mid-log CEM or MOLT-4 cells (1–3 × 108) exhibiting a viability >95% by trypan blue dye exclusion were harvested and washed once with Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4, by centrifugation at 480 ×g for 10 min at room temperature. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. The washed cell pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of isoosmotic homogenization buffer A (i.e. 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25m sucrose and proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (i.e. 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm TLCK, 4 μm leupeptin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 110 μm PMSF, 140 μm TPCK, and 1 μm pepstatin A)) or isoionic homogenization buffer B (i.e. 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m KCl and the proteolytic enzyme inhibitors described above). Cells were disrupted with 25–35 passes of a tight pestle in a glass Dounce homogenizer until >90% of cells were broken as determined by trypan blue exclusion. One 530-cm2plate of HeLa cells (≈90% confluent) was washed twice with Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubated on ice in 7 ml of homogenization buffer A (without sucrose) for 20 min. Cells were scraped from the plates directly into the Dounce homogenizer, and powdered sucrose was added to a final concentration of 0.25m. The cells were then subjected to 25 passes in the tight Dounce homogenizer, resulting in >90% of the cells being disrupted as monitored by trypan blue dye exclusion. Subcellular fractionation of CEM, MOLT-4, and HeLa cells was accomplished by sequential differential centrifugation (38Zwerner R.K. Wise K.S. Acton R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using an SS-34 rotor in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge (NEN Life Science Products) yielding pellets of nondisrupted cells and cell nuclei (480 × g ave for 20 min), mitochondria (4,000 × g ave for 20 min), and microsomes (20,000 × g ave for 30 min) followed by centrifugation of the microsomal supernatant fraction at ≥ 100,000 × g ave for 90 min using a Ti 50 rotor in a L5–50 Beckman ultracentrifuge and yielding the ribosomal pellet and supernatant cytosolic fractions. Each pellet was washed once by resuspension in the original homogenization buffer, recentrifuged under the respective conditions, and finally resuspended in the same buffer. Assays for NMT and organelle marker enzymes were performed on freshly prepared subcellular fractions as described below. NMT was also visualized by immunoblotting proportional aliquots from each subcellular fraction with an affinity-purified anti-peptide hNMT pAb (24Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Constant velocity isokinetic gradients (5 ml) were prepared from 15% and 32% sucrose solutions in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm KCl and the proteolytic inhibitors described above (39Steensgaard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The volumes of sucrose solutions and the centrifugation times were calculated for eukaryotic ribosomes (density ≈1.4 g/ml) (40van der Zeijst B.A.M. Bloemers H.P.J. Fasman G.D. 3rd ed. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 1. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1975: 426-517Google Scholar). The physical setup for gradient formation was as described previously (41Noll H. Nature. 1967; 215: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,42Bharucha A.D. Ven Murthy M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The postmicrosomal supernatant fraction (1 ml) from a CEM cell homogenate was layered onto the preformed gradient and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the tube was punctured at the bottom with an ISCO Tube Piercer (Lincoln, NE), and fractions were collected at 0.5 ml/min from the top of the gradient by displacement with a 55% sucrose solution. Fractions (0.25 ml) from the gradient were assayed for NMT activity, measured for absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm, and sucrose concentrations were determined with a refractometer. cDNAs for hNMTs corresponding to either one or the other of the two possible ORFs in the hNMT gene (36Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were obtained by pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) polymerase chain reaction amplification of a reverse transcribed cDNA library derived from human cerebral brain mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the following synthetic nucleotide primers: GCGCGCGCAATTCATGATGGAAGGGAACGGGAAACG (i.e. ≈60-kDa hNMT) or GCGCGCGCAAGATCTTTATTGTAGCACCAGTCCAACCTT (i.e. ≈50-kDa hNMT) with 5′-EcoRI restriction sites as the sense primers and GCGCGCGCAGATCTTTATTGTAGCACCAGTCCAACCTT with a 5′-BglII restriction sequence as the common antisense primer. The resulting cDNAs were cloned into the pFLAG-2 bacterial expression plasmid (Kodak-IBI, New Haven, CT) to yield constructs expressing amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged hNMTs of ≈60 and ≈50 kDa, respectively (i.e. pFLAG-2-hNMTs). Inserts from the pFLAG-2 constructs were subsequently digested with HindIII andBglII and cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 eukaryotic expression vector (Kodak-IBI) yielding constructs expressing similar amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged hNMTs (i.e.pFLAG-CMV-2-hNMTs). Insert sense and antisense strands were sequenced using dye primers or dye terminators and AmpliTaq FS with an Applied Biosystems Inc. Autosequencer. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts predicted the same amino acid sequence as reported previously except for a glutamine residue instead of a histidine at residue −4 from the originally published methionine start site (36Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This glutamine for histidine substitution was in agreement with the GenBank entry (accession no. M86707) for myristoyl-CoA:proteinN-myristoyltransferase submitted by the original authors and was confirmed by sequence analysis of a cDNA clone obtained by 5′-RACE analysis described below. HeLa cells were seeded at 300,000 cells/100-mm tissue culture plate. After ≈24 h, 80% confluent monolayers were washed twice with Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 200 mg/liter CaCl2. Cells were transfected essentially as suggested by the manufacturer with 16 μg of the pFLAG-CMV-2-hNMT plasmid DNA and 70 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 12 ml of the Opti-MEM/100-mm plate. After 6 h at 37 °C, the DNA and liposome-containing medium was removed, and 12 ml of fresh minimal essential medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin was added. After 24 h, the plates were rinsed twice in Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4. 500 μl of homogenization buffer A (without sucrose) was added, and plates were left on ice for 20 min. Cells were subsequently scraped from the plates, powdered sucrose was added to 0.25 m, the cells subjected to 25 passes through a “tight” Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenate processed by differential centrifugation as described above except that the postmicrosomal supernatant fraction was centrifuged for 30 min at 230,000 × g using a 100.1 rotor in a Beckman TL 100 ultracentrifuge. Escherichia coli (strain BL-21/DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) transformed according to the manufacturer's recommendations with pFLAG-2-hNMT plasmids containing inserts corresponding to one or the other of the two hNMT gene ORFs were cultured in LB broth supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C with shaking until theA 600 reached about 0.4, treated with 500 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the shaking continued for 3 h. Recombinant proteins were extracted from bacteria by a procedure similar to that recommended by the plasmid manufacturer. Except where noted, all of the following operations were carried out at 4 °C. Bacteria from 100 ml of medium were sedimented by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 10 °C and broken in lysis buffer (i.e. 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme) at 12,000 p.s.i. using a French press at room temperature. Immediately after extraction the lysis mixture was supplemented with 0.1 volume of a 10 × concentrated extraction solution (i.e. 2.0 mNaCl, 0.1 m CaCl2, 0.1 mMgCl2, 50 μg/ml ovomucoid protease inhibitor, 167 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 300 μg/ml TLCK, 17 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 210 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 420 μg/ml TPCK, and 6 μg/ml pepstatin A) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h in an SS-34 rotor. Recombinant proteins were purified by applying the clarified supernatant solution to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (2.5 × 16 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 17 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 167 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 300 μg/ml TLCK, and 50 μg/ml sodium azide followed by washing the column with the same buffer. The flow-through from the Q-Sepharose column was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA), applied to a 5-ml anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column (Kodak-IBI) equilibrated in Tris-HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1.7 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and allowed to mix end-over-end for 25 min at room temperature. The settled gel was then washed with equilibration buffer at room temperature untilA 280 reached background, and the recombinant FLAG-NMT was eluted with equilibration buffer containing 120 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The FLAG-NMT was reequilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and 50 μg/ml sodium azide by repetitive (3 ×) concentration to <1 ml and redilution with 10 ml of reequilibration buffer by ultrafiltration using a YM-10 membrane (Amicon) and finally concentrated with a Centricon 10 (Amicon).

https://openalex.org/W2040357332,"We have cloned a novel protein kinase from human cerebellum and named it LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase). The LZK cDNA encoded a 966-amino acid polypeptide that contains a kinase catalytic domain and double leucine/isoleucine zippers separated by a short spacer region. The amino acid sequence of the kinase catalytic domain was a hybrid between those in serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases, indicating that LZK belongs to the subfamily of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family. The kinase catalytic domain of LZK was most similar to DLK (Holtzman, L. B., Merritt, S.E., and Fan, G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30808–30817), MUK (Hirai, S., Izawa, M., Osada, S., Spyrou, G., and Ohno, S. (1996)Oncogene 12, 641–650), and ZPK (Reddy, U. R., and Presure, D. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 202, 613–620), which belong to the same subfamily of the MLK family. However, besides the kinase catalytic domain and double leucine/isoleucine zippers, there was no significant homology with known proteins. The recombinant LZK autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP and divalent cations, and exhibited serine/threonine kinase catalytic activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that LZK is expressed most strongly in the pancreas, with a pattern that differs from other MLKs. Expression of LZK in COS7 cells induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of JNK-1, indicating the association of LZK in the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. The expressed LZK was detected primarily in the membrane fraction, suggesting that LZK interacts with other cellular components in vivo. We have cloned a novel protein kinase from human cerebellum and named it LZK (leucine zipper-bearing kinase). The LZK cDNA encoded a 966-amino acid polypeptide that contains a kinase catalytic domain and double leucine/isoleucine zippers separated by a short spacer region. The amino acid sequence of the kinase catalytic domain was a hybrid between those in serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases, indicating that LZK belongs to the subfamily of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family. The kinase catalytic domain of LZK was most similar to DLK (Holtzman, L. B., Merritt, S.E., and Fan, G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30808–30817), MUK (Hirai, S., Izawa, M., Osada, S., Spyrou, G., and Ohno, S. (1996)Oncogene 12, 641–650), and ZPK (Reddy, U. R., and Presure, D. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 202, 613–620), which belong to the same subfamily of the MLK family.

Protein kinases play critical roles in the regulation of many cellular processes (1Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), such as the transmission of signals from growth factor (2Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

The protein kinases can be divided into two groups based on their sequence similarities and their specificity for the acceptor amino acid (1Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar, 9Hanks S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 369-383Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most protein kinases phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine, although protein kinases that modify histidine have been found. However, a small number of dual-specificity kinases can phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (10Linberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), although they are structurally related to the serine/threonine-specific group. Protein kinases can also be grouped as receptor protein kinases and non-receptor protein kinases. Receptor protein kinases have an intracellular catalytic domain, transmembrane region, and extracellular ligand-binding domain. Protein kinases share, besides the protein kinase catalytic domain, some structural features reflecting their particular roles in protein-protein interactions. For example, the SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology domain; MLK, mixed-lineage kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNKK, JNK kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); MEKK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; LZK, leucine zipper-bearing kinase; MUK, MAPK-upstream kinase; DLK, dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase; ZPK, leucine zipper protein kinase. domains are found not only in tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases but also in receptor-type and non-receptor protein kinases (11Koch C.A.

Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence is found in some protein kinases (13Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, many new closely related intracellular kinases have been identified. One of these groups, mixed lineage kinases (MLKs), contains a unique double leucine/isoleucine zipper (14Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). MLK has a characteristic kinase catalytic domain with a sequence hybrid between those in serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. These kinases include MLK1 (15Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. deKretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 231: 701-710Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), MLK2 (16Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Simson R.L. J.

Of these, DLK/ZPK/MUK are considered a secondary subfamily of MLK because of their characteristic sequences. However, little is known about the overall biochemical features and functional roles of MLKs. We examined the cloning, expression, and preliminary characteristics of the novel intracellular protein kinase. The LZK cDNA encoded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 135–150 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE. Sequence analysis revealed that LZK belongs to the MLK family, containing the kinase catalytic domain and leucine/isoleucine zippers. However, LZK had no other strong homologies with any known proteins. The recombinant LZK protein exhibited serine/threonine protein kinase activities in vitro. Expression of LZK in COS7 cells induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of JNK-1, suggesting the association of LZK in the JNK/SAPK pathway. A 826-bp rat cDNA clone with unknown functions, which had been isolated by screening of theλZAP rat brain cDNA library with an antibody raised against a soluble fraction of rat brain, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primer DNA labeling kit (TaKaRa), and the radiolabeled cDNA was used as a probe to screen approximately 5 × 105 plaques of a human cerebellum cDNA library (CLONTECH). Hybridization was carried out in the buffer consisting of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5% skim milk, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA at 42 °C. Filters were washed at 65 °C in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS sequentially. Three unique clones were isolated and restriction mapped. The longest clone was subcloned into the plasmid vector Bluescript SK, sequenced along both strands over the entire length using a Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequence kit and an ABI 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Multiple human tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized to radiolabeled human LZK cDNA fragment (corresponding to nucleotides 1895–3174), which had been amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primer method. Hybridization was performed as described above for cDNA screening. The filter was finally washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, and analyzed by BAS 2000 image analyzer. To ensure the integrity and the quantity of RNA per lane, the blot was rehybridized to radiolabeled β-actin cDNA. The cDNA fragment encoding the LZK open reading frame was engineered with XbaI restriction sites, and the product was amplified by long and accurate (LA)-polymerase chain reaction (oligonucleotides: 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGCCAACTTTCAGGAGCACCTGAGCTGCTCCT-3′; 5′-GCTCTAGATCATTACCAGGTAGCAGAGCTGTAGTGTTTATTGGT-3′). The digested fragment and a double-strand oligonucleotide linker (oligonucleotides: 5′- AGCTTCCACCATGAGAGGATCGCACCACCATCATCACCACT-3′; 5′-CTAGAGTGGTGATGATGGTGGTGCGATCCTCTCATGGTGGA-3′) were inserted into the cytomegalovirus promotor-based eukaryotic expression vector pCDM8, which had been double-digested with HindIII andXbaI. The linker presented above was engineered withHindIII (5′) and XbaI (3′) restriction sites, and contained the typical Kozak's consensus sequence and coding sequence for the “MRGSHis6” epitope (Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6). The MRGSHis6 tag was inserted into the amino terminus of the LZK coding sequence. The construct was sequenced to confirm Taq polymerase fidelity and maintenance of the appropriate reading frame. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kanamycin. Cells (2 × 106) plated onto a 10-cm tissue culture dish were grown overnight and transiently transfected with 10 μg of the eukaryotic expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by adding 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The lysate was sonicated on ice and then centrifuged for 20 min at 105,000 ×g at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of anti-MRGSHis6 antibody (QIAGEN) and 40 μl of anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose (Sigma) (50% v/v) were added to the supernatant of the cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed five times in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). For cell fractionation study, the cells were homogenized in the lysis buffer without Triton X-100, and the homogenate was centrifuged as above. For immunoblot analysis, 20 μl of cell lysate or the immunoprecipitates were separated under reducing conditions on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.5) containing 3% nonfat dry milk, followed by incubation with the MRGSHis6 antibody or the rabbit anti-LZK immune serum diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20, and then probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies. Blots were developed using the chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and subjected to autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated MRGSHis6-LZK protein was washed four times with kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 30 μmATP and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) for 30 min at 30 °C, then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane and then analyzed using a BAS 2000 image analyzer. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described by Zheng and Guan (25Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the in vitro kinase assay, the radioactive band of 135–150 kDa was excised from the PVDF membrane. The strip was incubated in 1 ml of 6m HCl at 105 °C for 2 h. After removing of the strip, the sample was dried in a SpeedVac, then washed and dried twice in 1 ml of H2O. The resulting amino acids were separated on a cellulose plate by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and radioactivity was detected by a BAS 2000 image analyzer. Cells (2 × 106) were transiently transfected with the expression vector harboring epitope-tagged LZK. After 48 h, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and then lysedin situ with 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer. For control experiment, cells were stimulated by UV radiation (100 J/m2). After 1 h, they were used for the experiment. Cell lysate (20 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred on to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by soaking in TBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk, incubated with diluted anti-c-Jun antibodies (0.1 μg/ml in TBS containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20), and subsequently with appropriately diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The resulting membrane was developed using the chemiluminescent reagent and subjected to autoradiography. Cells (2 × 106) were transiently transfected with the expression vector harboring epitope-tagged LZK. After 48 h, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmNaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After removal of insoluble materials by ultracentrifugation, 2 μg of anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) (10% v/v) were added to the supernatant of the cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed four times in buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and subsequently washed four times in buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm DTT. The immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of the same buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and 2.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun. Reactions were terminated by addition of the Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by using a BAS 2000 image analyzer. A 826-bp rat cDNA fragment with unknown function was used as a probe to screen a human cerebellum cDNA library. Three independent clones were isolated, and their inserts were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the longest insert is shown in Fig.1. The cDNA extends over 3450 nucleotide bases and contains 272 bp of 5′-untranslated nucleotides, a continuous open reading frame of 2898 bp, and 399 bp of 3′-untranslated nucleotides. The putative initiation codon was assigned at nucleotide 273. This methionine codon is located within a sequence context favorable for the Kozak's rule and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon beginning at base 234. Within the 3′-untranslated region, putative polyadenylation signals are found at 3318 bp (AATAA), at 3354 bp (AATAA), at 3370 bp (AATTAA), and at 3517 bp (AATAA) upstream from the poly(A) tract. The longest open reading frame of the cDNA encodes a putative polypeptide of 966 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 108 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis revealed that the protein contains no obvious signal sequence or transmembrane domain (data not shown). Comparison of the sequence with other known proteins revealed that the protein can be divided into several structural domains: a kinase catalytic domain, a double leucine/isoleucine zipper separated by a short spacer region, and an acidic domain at its carboxyl-terminal end (Fig. 2). Because of this characteristic amino acid sequence, the novel protein was designated as H-LZK (human leucine zipper-bearing kinase).Figure 2Schematic representation of human LZK primary structure. The numbers above the diagram represent amino acid residue number and delineate boundaries of indicated domains (motifs). The kinase domain (stippled box), leucine/isoleucine zipper domains (striped box), and the SSEEEEGEVDSEVE sequence (slash) are shown. Between two leucine/isoleucine zippers, there is a spacer region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinase catalytic domain extends 249 amino acids from amino acids 166 through 414 (Fig. 3). All 11 subdomains (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar), which are typical and common motifs in protein kinases, were conserved in the LZK kinase catalytic domain. This kinase catalytic domain had both features of serine/threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases. Thus, Trp344-Glu345 and Pro352-Tyr353 in subdomain IX and Trp319 (GTVAWMAPE) in subdomain VIII are characteristic for tyrosine kinases. However, Lys281(HRDLKSPN) in subdomain VIb and Thr316(GTVAWMAPE) in subdomain VIII are strong indicators of serine/threonine specificity, and Trp319-Met320(GTVAWMAPE) is often found in Raf family proteins (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). Following the kinase catalytic domain, LZK contained two heptad repeats of nonaromatic hydrophobic amino acids separated by a 25-amino acid spacer. By Chou and Fasman analysis (32Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar), this amino acid sequence formed an α-helix structure, indicating that these regions of LZK are composed of two leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs (Figs. 2 and 3), which may promote homo- or heterodimerization of proteins through hydrophobic interactions. As shown in Fig. 4, hydrophobic residues are conserved at the d position in zipper 1 and 2, forming a hydrophobic stripe on the face of the helix. Except for the d position, these regions are comparatively rich in charged amino acids. In particular, position b(EETE) and position f (KSRR) in zipper 1, and positiong (IRRK) in position 2 were primarily composed of negatively or positively charged amino acids, suggesting that they are involved in intra- or intermolecular electrostatic interactions (33Landgraf W. Hofman F. Pelton J.T. Huggins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9387-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The regions containing the kinase catalytic domain and leucine zipper domain of this protein have 86.4% and 86.4% identity, respectively, to previously reported proteins DLK (dualleucine zipper-bearing kinase) (21Holtzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ZPK (leucine zipper protein kinase) (22Reddy U.R. Presure D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). In addition, the sequence of this region was homologous to MLK1 (15Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. deKretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 231: 701-710Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), MLK2 (16Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Simson R.L. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 458-460Google Scholar, 17Kato M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar), and MLK3 (18Ezoe K. Lee S.-T. Strunk K. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 935-938PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1745-1750PubMed Google Scholar) by 40.2%, 40.4%, and 39.5%, respectively (Figs. 3 and5), suggesting that LZK, together with DLK/ZPK, belongs to the MLK (mixed lineagekinase) family, although no strong similarity was found outside this region. However, in contrast to the other of MLKs, which have a SH3 domain at their amino-terminal ends, LZK (as well as DLK/ZPK) did not contain such a structure (Fig. 5). In addition, LZK and DLK/ZPK have a single invariant Glu at 7 amino acid residues downstream from the invariant Lys in subdomain II, but this is not the case with ordinary MLKs. This Glu residue is believed to play an important role in stabilizing ATP in the ATP-binding site from the crystallographic study (35Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowakski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These results suggest that LZK, together with DLK and ZPK, belongs to the secondary subgroup of MLK. In addition, LZK and DLK/ZPK share a unique sequence, Ser-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Gly-Glu-Val-Asp-Ser-Glu-Val-Glu (Ser815–Glu828 in LZK) (Figs. 5 and6). However, the glycine/proline-rich region present in DLK/ZPK at the carboxyl- and amino-terminal ends was not detected in LZK (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the sequence of the LZK kinase catalytic domain is 94.6% identical with that of a partial putative serine/threonine protein kinase (36Schultz S.J. Nigg E.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 821-830PubMed Google Scholar), implying that these proteins are identical or closely related (Fig. 3).Figure 6The amino acid sequence SSEEEEGEVDSEVE were commonly conserved in the carboxyl-terminal domain of LZK and ZPK/DLK/MUK. Besides the regions of kinase catalytic domain and leucine/isoleucine zippers, LZK does not show strong similarity with other protein kinases of the MLK family (see the text). However, the short amino acid sequence SSEEEEGEVDSEVE is completely conserved in the carboxyl-terminal domain of LZK and DLK/ZPK. The amino acid numbers are indicated on the left side of the sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of LZK mRNA was examined by Northern blotting mRNA from several human tissues. The probe used for this analysis was corresponded to nucleotides 1895–3174 (See Fig. 1). Three bands at about >9.5, 8.7, and 6.5 kb were found with pancreas mRNA at the highest level. These bands were also markedly detected in the brain, liver, and placenta, and no positive signal was detected in the heart, lung, skeletal muscle or kidney (Fig.7 A). The expression levels of these three transcripts varied among the tissues. The 8.7-kb band was detected only in mRNA from pancreas. Similarly, the >9.5-kb band was detected only with pancreas and brain. After initial probing with LZK cDNA, the blot was rehybridized with β-actin cDNA to confirm the integrity of the RNA from different tissues (Fig.7 B). To facilitate the detection and immunoprecipitation of the LZK, MRGSHis6epitope was incorporated at the amino terminus of LZK (see “Experimental Procedures”). The epitope-tagged full-length LZK cDNA was incorporated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDM8, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into COS 7 cells. Upon immunoblot analysis of LZK transfectants following the SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, a protein with a molecular mass of 135–150 kDa, which is in good agreement with the predicted mass of the epitope-tagged LZK, was detected, while no band was detected for the non-transfectant (Fig. 8 A). In addition, a protein of 135–150 kDa was specifically immunoprecipitated with a MRGSHis6 antibody from the lysate of the transfectant (data not shown). To study the subcellular localization of LZK, COS7 cells expressing LZK were homogenized in the absence of detergent. The homogenate was fractionated into the soluble and the membrane fractions, and the respective fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and followed by immunoblot analysis. Strong immunoreactive bands were detected in the membrane fraction, while only weak bands were found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that LZK protein binds to some membrane components probably through interaction with some other cellular components such as lipid and/or anchor protein. To confirm that LZK is an active protein kinase, MRGSHis6antibody immunoprecipitates of the LZK transfectants were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Na3VO4 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor), and then the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by transfer onto PVDF membranes. Upon autoradiography, immunoprecipitates from the transfectants revealed radioactive bands of 135–150 and 50 kDa, but no detectable bands in non-transfectants (Fig.9 B). The radioactive band of 50 kDa comigrated with the band of heavy chain of IgG, indicating that LZK not only autophosphorylated itself but also phosphorylated heavy chain of IgG. The radioactive 135–150-kDa band of LZK from the in vitrokinase assay was excised and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis. The resulting materials were separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis on a cellulose plate (25Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by autoradiography and comparison to ninhydrin-stained phosphoamino acid standards revealed only phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (Fig. 9 C), indicating that LZK has a serine/threonine kinase activity. However, the present experiment cannot completely exclude the possibility that LZK has a tyrosine kinase activity. Recent studies show that some MLKs activate JNK pathway (23Hirai S. Izawa M. Osada S. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). JNK pathway is believed to be predominantly activated by cellular stresses such as UV radiation, inflammatory cytokines, and osmotic shock (28Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 29Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar), which results in the activation of transcriptional factors such as c-Jun and ATF2 (30Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar,31Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequence of LZK showed high homology to DLK/MUK, which were known to activate JNK pathway, we tested whether or not LZK activates the phosphorylation of c-Jun. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector harboring an epitope-tagged LZK, after which the mobility delay of endogenous c-Jun was monitored by immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Jun antibodies. As shown in Fig. 10, expression of LZK induced the mobility delay of c-Jun as much as was observed with UV radiation. Because the mobility delay is caused by the phosphorylation of c-Jun, these results suggested that expressed LZK activates the endogenous JNK pathway (28Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Then to confirm that the phosphorylation of c-Jun observed was really caused by activation of JNK, endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate and JNK1 activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay using soluble glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as substrate. As shown in Fig. 11, expression of LZK elevated the JNK1 kinase activity. The extent of JNK1 activation by expression of LZK was comparable to that caused by UV radiation. These results taken together indicated that LZK can effectively activate JNK pathway.Figure 11Activation of JNK-1 by LZK. Endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells and incubated with glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The reaction was stopped by the addition of the Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by using the BAS 2000 image analyzer. The data shown in the upper panelwere quantified and are shown in the graph. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments and are expressed as JNK1 relative activity (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the cDNA cloning, expression, and characteristics of a novel protein kinase, which is expressed in a spatially regulated fashion in adult human tissues. This protein kinase contains a kinase catalytic domain, followed by two leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs, which are separated by a short spacer region. We designated this protein kinase as LZK. The LZK cDNA encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 135–150 kDa, and has serine/threonine kinase activity. LZK is most similar to DLK and ZPK. DLK was identified by Holzman (21Holtzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a novel protein kinase with a unique kinase catalytic domain, the expression of which is regulated spatially and developmentally. ZPK is cloned and identified as a novel putative protein kinase, which is up-regulated in retinoic acid-treated NT2 cells (22Reddy U.R. Presure D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When the region containing the kinase catalytic domain and the leucine/isoleucine zipper domain of LZK was aligned to DLK and ZPK, homology was 86.4% and 86.4%, respectively, with no insertion and/or deletion. Like DLK and ZPK, LZK had invariant Glu at the specific location 7 amino acids downstream from invariant Lys in subdomain II. From crystallographic study and structure-function analysis of other protein kinases, the invariant Glu in subdomain III and invariant Lys in subdomain II are believed to play an important role in stabilizing ATP in the ATP-binding site. The amino acid sequence WMAPE in subdomain VIII is often found in Raf family protein kinases, suggesting that LZK has a MAPKKK-related activity. It is interesting to note that Hirai et al. (23Hirai S. Izawa M. Osada S. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar) recently identified MUK, which corresponds to rat homologue of DLK (mouse) and/or ZPK (human), as a MAPKKK-related protein kinase such as c-Raf and MAPK/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK) (37Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). They showed that MUK phosphorylates and activates JNKK in vivo and in vitro. JNKK (38Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 249: 1266-1272Google Scholar) can be phosphorylated and activated by the MAPKKK-related kinase, MEKK (40Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 41Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 42Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). MUK-transfected cells induced hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun, suggesting that MUK can regulate the JNK/SAPK pathway in vivo. The induction of JNK was also observed in a truncated MUK consisting of the kinase catalytic domain and leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs, the amino acid sequence of which was 86.4% identical to that of LZK. As might be expected from this high homology with MUK, LZK was in fact shown to induce phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of JNK1, indicating that LZK stimulates the JNK/SAPK pathway. The extent of JNK1 activation by LZK expression was comparable to that caused by UV radiation. Considering the efficiency and cytotoxicity of the transfection procedure, it seems reasonable to speculate that LZK directly phosphorylates and activates the main components of JNK pathway, such as JNKK and MEKK in vivo. When expressed in COS7, LZK was present in both cytosol and membrane fractions. Because LZK contains no obvious signal sequence or transmembrane domain, LZK should first be synthesized in cytosol and then translocated to membranes. It has been thought that subcellular compartmentalization is crucial in providing specificity in the regulation and function of protein kinases (43Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 448-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Some protein kinases were targeted in a given compartment in the cell, and following various stimulations, they translocated to new sites within the cell, where they associated with anchor proteins, regulated by other protein and/or lipid, to gain access to their physiological substrates. Mata et al. (44Mata M. Merrit S.E. Fan G. Yu G.G. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16888-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) recently reported that DLK also exists in both cytosolic and membrane-bound form. They showed that each form of DLK has different biochemical characteristics. The membrane-bound form of DLK is not phosphorylated and forms high molecular complexes, and the cytosolic form of DLK is phosphorylated and exists as monomers. Since LZK, unlike other related protein kinases, does not contain a SH3 domain or a proline-rich region that is a presumed SH3-binding motif, it remains to be clarified what kind of interaction induces the translocation of LZK and regulates the functions of LZK. Recently, MLK-3 was shown to interact specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rac and Cdc42 (45Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), which regulates the JNK signaling pathway leading to the c-Jun post-transcriptional activation (46Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 47Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Considering that structurally related MUK activated the JNK pathway, LZK might be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways under the regulation of a small GTP-binding protein. However, to clarify the mechanism which might regulate the function of LZK, further studies must be done on the biochemical difference between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of LZK and the signals regulating the compartmentalization of LZK.

These genes were determined to be novel and highly related. The deduced amino acid sequences indicated that both were membrane proteins having two identical histidine-rich motifs. The predicted proteins, while not ABC transporters, are homologous to a widely distributed family of transition metal transporters present in all kingdoms. Subcellular fractionation and fluorescence microscopy localized these gene products to mitochondria. Based on this result we term these genesMitochondrial Fe Transporters (MFT). Cells with disruptions in both genes show a growth defect on low iron medium, suggesting that these genes have redundant function and can affect cytosolic iron levels. Measurement of mitochondrial iron in cells grown in iron-rich medium overexpressing MFT1 or MFT2show a 2–5-fold increase in iron compared with mitochondria from control cells. These results suggest that the mitochondria may act as a reservoir for iron that can be mobilized and used for cytosolic purposes.

In the past few years, enormous strides have been made in understanding the mechanisms that mediate iron accumulation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genes for both high (1Askwith C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) iron transport systems and their regulators (4Yamaguchi-Juai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Embo J. 1995; 14: 1231-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have been identified. While these studies have resulted in characterization of plasma membrane iron transport at the molecular level, much less is known about intracellular iron transport. Iron is distributed among different intracellular compartments: the vacuole in which iron may be stored, the mitochondria where the terminal steps of heme biosynthesis occurs, and the cytosol where many iron-utilizing enzymes are located. To date, little is known about the molecules or transporters responsible for intracellular iron movement. We previously identified the yeast gene ERG25 by a screen that, selected for mutants, showed poor growth on low iron medium (5Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a methyl sterol oxidase that was deduced to be an oxo-diiron-containing enzyme based on its sequence and the observation that the mammalian methyl sterol oxidase requires iron for activity. This enzyme is responsible for an oxygen-mediated dimethylation of 4,4′-dimethyl zymosterol, an intermediate in yeast and mammalian sterol biosynthesis (6Bard M. Bruner D.A. Pierson C.A. Lees N.D. Bierman B. Frye C. Koegel C. Barbuch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mutant erg25 allele, termedfet6-2, has a missense mutation that appears to affect the ability of the protein to bind iron; the protein has normal activity in iron-replete medium but is nonfunctional in low iron medium. We screened for genes that when overexpressed could rescue thefet6-2 mutant phenotype of poor growth on low iron medium. We report here the identification and characteristics of two homologous genes that suppress the mutant phenotype. We determined that the products of these genes affected the mutant protein indirectly by increasing cytosolic iron concentration. Subcellular fractionation studies localized the gene products to mitochondria and hence, we refer to them as Mitochondria Iron (Fe)Transporters(MFT). Disruption of either gene alone or in concert, however, did not affect viability or mitochondrial function. Disruption of both genes resulted in decreased growth in iron-limited medium. Incubation of cells that overexpress either gene in high iron medium resulted in an increase in mitochondrial iron. These genes appear to be members of an ancient and widely distributed family of transition metal transporters that function as transition metal resistance genes. Our data suggest that the MFT genes are involved with mitochondria iron movement and that the mitochondria may act as a reservoir for iron. The yeast strains employed in this study were derived from DY150 and DY1457 as described previously (7Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P. Li L. Kaplan S. Sipe D. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The isolation and phenotype of thefet6-2 strain is described in Li and Kaplan (5Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in YPD (1.0% yeast extract, 0.2% peptone, 2.0% glucose), or in YPD made iron-limited by the addition of banthophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS) 1The abbreviations used are: BPS, banthophenanthroline sulfonate; YPD; yeast peptone dextrose; SNG, streptonigrin; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (1Askwith C. DeSilva D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or in LIM medium, a synthetic medium that has defined concentrations of iron or other transition metals (8Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts and a membrane preparation were obtained as described previously (5Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Iron transport and ferrireductase activity was assayed as described in Eide et al. (8Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy sequencing method using Sequenase from U. S. Biochemical Corp. and the Applied Biosystems automated sequenator. The primers were universal M13 primers and primers prepared using previously obtained sequencing data. Both strands were sequenced. DNA transformations of E. coli and S. cerevisiae were performed by standard procedures (9Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar, 10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments were isolated using Wizard Minipreps (Promega). The shuttle vector pTF63 was derived from YEplac195 and contained the Bluescript II polylinker (11Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The Sau3A genomic library used in the complementation studies was described previously (5Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and was the gift of Drs. D. Stillman and W. Ming. The high copy genomic library was transformed into fet6-2 and colonies were isolated that complemented the growth defect on low iron medium. Plasmids were isolated and analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis. Two different complementing plasmids were sequenced using M13 primers. One plasmid (p20) contained a 3410-base pair segment of chromosome XIII, while the other plasmid (p21) contained a 9094-base pair region of chromosome XVI. The only ORF that was identified on the p20 fragment was YMR177W. A number of different ORFs were present on the p21 plasmid. An ORF YPL224C was shown to be responsible for the complementation of fet6-2 was proven by isolating the ORF using a HindIII site on the 5′ end of the ORF and the polymerase chain reaction and primers on the 3′ end of the ORF. The isolated ORF was subcloned into pTF63 and was shown to complement the low iron growth phenotype of fet6-2. A double fusion PCR technique (12Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used for construction ofΔMFT1::URA3 andΔMFT2::HIS2. The primers for amplification of the 5′ end of ΔMFT1 were: 5′-GCC CTG TAT AAA GAT CGT TC-3′ and 5′-GTC GTG ACT GGG AAA ACC CTG GCG TTG TAG TCT CGT ATC GTG CC-3′. The primers for amplification of the 3′ end of ΔMFT1 were: 5′-TCC TGT GTG AAA TTG TTA TCC GCT TCC ACG CTA CCT AGA GAT AG-3′ and 5′-GAG TAT TCG TAT GGT CGT GC-3′. The primers for amplification of the 5′ end of ΔMFT2 were: 5′-CTA TCA AGC AAT TCG GTT CC-3′ and 5′-GTC GTG ACT GGG AAA ACC CTG GCG TCT GCT GTA CGT TCA GTG AC-3′. The primers for amplification of the 3′ end of ΔMFT2 were: 5′-TCC TGT GTG AAA TTG TTA TCC GCT TCT TAT CCT CAC TGA AGG AG-3′ and 5′-CAT CAA CAA ACT CGA CGT CC-3′. The URA3 gene was used as the selectable marker for the ΔMFT1 disruptant while theHIS3 gene was used as the selectable marker for theΔMFT2 disruptant (12Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions for the 5′ end and 3′-end-flanking sequences of two gene deletions were: 0.5 mm primer mixture, 3 mm Mg, denaturing at 94 °C, annealing at 50 °C, elongating at 70 °C, 20 s for 35 cycles in Idaho Technology Air Thermo-Cycler. The PCR conditions for the first fusion of the upstream fragment to the marker and the second fusion to the downstream fragment were performed in Perkin Elmer PCR machine at conditions of denaturing 94 °C, 40 s, annealing 60 °C, 40 s, elongating 72 °C, 3 min, for 35 cycles. The purified double fusion PCR products were transformed into a wild-type diploid strain DY1640. After sporulation and dissection, spores containing the disruption were selected either by growth on Ura− or His− media. Correct integration was tested by colony PCR and Southern blotting. Both MFT1p and MFT2p were epitope-tagged with MYC at their carboxyl terminus using the polymerase chain reaction. For MFT1p, an 180-base pair fragment that encompassed a unique Bsu36I restriction site to the 3′ end of the gene was amplified using two primers: 5′-CGT TAC TGT CCT CAG GAC CGA ATT TAC GCG-3′ and 5′-AAG GAA AAA AGC GGC CGC TTA ATT CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC CAT AAT ATG AGT ATT CGT ATG GTC-3′. The 3′ primer included a MYC epitope. For MFT2p, two primers were used to make a fragment which included a BclI site and a MYC epitope at the 3′ end of the ORF. The primers were: 5′-GGC TTG TAG TGT CAG GTT TGA TCA TAA AAA CAG GTG GAC-3′ and 5′-AAG GAA AAA AGC GGC CGC TTA ATT CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC CAT ATG TTT ATG GGT GTG AGT ATC GGC-3′. The PCR conditions were the same as described above using the Idaho Technology thermal cycler. Each construct was ligated into its cleavage site in the 3′-terminus of the plasmid. The plasmids were tested for their ability to complement the low iron growth defect offet6-2. The GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of MFT1p and MFT2p as described by Niedenthal et al. (13Niedenthal R.K Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A full gene sequence ofMFT1 was made by the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the MET promoter containing plasmid pGFP-C-FUS at theXbaI and HindIII sites. The primers were: 5′-TGC TCT AGA TAT ATA TTA TTG CAT CAC ACA AAC ATC GCT-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT AAT ATG AGT ATT CGT ATG GTC-3′. The conditions for the polymerase chain reaction were as described above for Perkin Elmer machine. The plasmid containing the MFT1-GFP fusion construct was transformed into fet6-2 and could complement the low iron growth defect. Mitochondrial isolation was performed as described by Glick and Pons (14Glick B.S. Pons L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells transformed with pTf63(MFT1 Myc) were grown in CM-ura-glycerol-ethanol medium to an A 600 of 3.0. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed and spheroplasts were obtained using oxalyticase digestion. The spheroplasts were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and a crude mitochondrial fraction isolated by centrifugation. The mitochondrial fraction was loaded to the top of a 15% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 59,000 × g for 27 min in a Ti75 rotor. For Western analysis, samples of yeast or fractions from the Percoll gradient were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the nitrocellulose was blocked overnight at 4 °C by the addition of 5.0% non-fat dry milk dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 8.0). The blots were incubated with the primary antibody for 20 min at 37 °C, washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were washed and developed using the ECL procedure (Amersham Life Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were treated with endoglycosidase H according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Cells in log phase were harvested and reincubated in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 30 °C and then resuspended in fixative buffer that contained 4.0% paraformaldehyde (pH 6.5) overnight at 30 °C. The fixed cells were then washed and treated with 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmEDTA, 1.0% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min and then incubated with 1 mg/ml oxalyticase. The cells were permeabilized by the addition of 2.0% SDS in 1.2 m sorbitol for 2 min, washed in sorbitol buffer, and then allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine treated coverslips for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with 0.5% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with a 1:500 monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody for 10 h. The coverslips were washed and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were visualized using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a Zeiss 100× oil immersion objective. Images (512 × 512) were acquired using a Photometrics cooled CCD camera and a Macintosh workstation running OncorImage 3-D cytometry software. A multidye filter set was used in which excitation filters of 575 nm (Texas Red) were selected from a computer-controlled filter wheel in conjunction with a multi-wavelength emitter and dichroic filter set (640 nm; XF56 set from Omega Optical). Out-of-focus blur was removed by adjacent plane fast Fourier deconvolution using the inverse of the modulation transfer function of the microscope. Adjacent planes were taken at 0.5-μm intervals under control of the OncorImage software package. Prior to deconvolution, all images were corrected for background and flatfield. Images were then scaled to 256 levels of gray before output to a film recorder. Incubation offet6-2, an erg25 mutant, in low iron medium results in defective sterol synthesis leading to a marked growth deficit (5Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To isolate extragenic suppressors, fet6-2 was transformed with a high copy yeast genomic library and colonies that demonstrated enhanced growth on low iron medium were isolated. After screening 20,000 colonies, a plasmid was isolated (p20) that allowed partial complementation of the fet6-2 growth defect on iron limited medium (Fig. 1). The gene responsible for the low iron growth enhancement was identified by subcloning as ORF YMR177W. This gene when placed in a multicopy plasmid, could by itself suppress the low iron growth deficit offet6-2. The gene, however, when placed in a centromeric plasmid was unable to rescue the low iron growth phenotype. Using the same library a different plasmid (p21) was isolated that also complemented the low iron growth phenotype of fet6-2. Subcloning determined that the responsible ORF, YPL224C, when expressed from a multicopy but not a single copy plasmid, suppressed thefet6-2 low iron growth defect. Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of these two genes revealed that they are highly homologous (52% identity and 75% similarity) and novel (Fig. 2). They appear to encode membrane proteins with six putative transmembrane domains. The sequences show no identifiable leader or endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Prosite analysis of either protein suggests that the amino terminus could be a mitochondrial targeting sequence. There is, at best, one potential N-glycosylation site. A feature of interest is two conserved histidine-rich clusters found in both proteins. In particular, the sequence HTHSHXHTHXH strongly suggests a metal binding motif. These genes show extensive homology to other genes identified as transition metal transporters, particularly for zinc, cadmium, or cobalt. These genes are found in diverse species, including bacteria, yeast, and mammals. These transporters have been localized to different organelles; mitochondria, endosomes, and plasma membrane (Fig.3). For example Cot1p, which is involved in cobalt resistance in yeast is mitochondrial (17Conklin J.A. McMaster M.R. Culbertson D.C. Kung Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mammalian zinc transporters, ZNT2 and ZNT3, are located in endosomes or synaptosomes, respectively (18Palmiter R.D.

Western blot analysis of cells transformed with the Myc-epitope marked YMR177W carried on a centromeric plasmid did not reveal any specific band. A similar analysis, however, on cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing the Myc-tagged gene showed a specific band migrating at a molecular mass of 56 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When the presence of the Myc-epitope is taken into consideration, the observed molecular mass is the same as that predicted from the deduced sequence. Treatment of samples with endoglycosidase H had no effect on size of the protein, indicating that the protein does not contain any N-linked carbohydrate. The Myc-tagged YMR177W was quantitatively recovered in a 10,000 ×g membrane pellet, as expected from the presence of hydrophobic domains in the deduced sequence. To further define the location of the protein a low speed supernatant (800 ×g) from homogenized cells was applied to a Percoll density gradient. Fractions were collected and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blots were probed using specific antibodies to defined membrane proteins. Most of the epitope-marked protein was found in the same fractions that were enriched for mitochondria as defined by the presence of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein porin. These fractions were depleted of endoplasmic reticulum (Erg25p), plasma membrane (Fet3p), and vacuoles (Cpyp) (Fig.4). To further confirm the location of YMR177W, cells transformed with a high copy plasmid encoding a GFP-tagged fusion protein was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The protein is localized to mitochondria as its distribution is identical to that of the mitochondrial protein porin (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained using cells transformed with YMR177W containing a carboxyl-terminal Myc-tag, in which the localization was examined by indirect immunofluorescence (data not shown). A YPL224C fusion protein containing a carboxyl-terminal Myc-tag was also localized to the mitochondria (Fig.6). Based on their localization to mitochondria and their homology to transition metal transporters, we have termed these genes M itochondrial Iron (Fe) Transporter in which YMR177W isMFT1 and YPL224C is MFT2Figure 5Fluorescent localization of YMR177W (MFT1)- green fluorescent protein to mitochondria.Wild type cells (DY150) were transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing a fusion construct of YMR177W with a carboxyl-tagged GFP.

We considered that they could exert this effect by either being involved in the direct insertion of iron into this oxo-diiron protein, or by increasing the cytosolic concentration of iron and, thereby, indirectly providing more iron to the defective methyl sterol oxidase. Since these gene products are localized to mitochondria, we hypothesize that their effect onfet6-2 is indirect and results from an increase in cytosolic iron concentration. Several experiments indicate that the latter hypothesis is correct. Cells containing a deletion in either MFT1 orMFT2 show no growth defect on either low or high iron medium. Cells with both genes deleted show a growth defect on low iron-medium. Growth on low iron-medium is absolutely dependent on theFET3/FTR1 oxidase/permease high affinity iron transport system (1Askwith C. DeSilva D.M. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 71: 1552-1557Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Measurement of the activity of this transport system in both wild type, deletion strains, and overexpressors, revealed no alteration in the rate of iron transport (data not shown). This result suggests that the effect of MFT1 and MFT2 are not exerted at the level of plasma membrane transport but at intracellular iron metabolism. To confirm this conclusion, wild type, deletion and overexpressor strains were grown in iron-free media, making cell growth solely dependent on intracellular iron stores. In this medium, the double deletion strain (ΔMFT1, ΔMFT2−) grew to a lower saturation density than wild type cells, which did not grow as well as cells overexpressing MFT1 (Fig.7) or MFT2 (data not shown). This result suggests that overexpression of MFT1p increases cytosolic iron by accessing internal pools. Previously, we used the iron dependent toxicity of SNG to select cells that had defects in iron transport (7Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P. Li L. Kaplan S. Sipe D. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). SNG is an aminoquinone antibiotic that diffuses into cells and is reduced. Reduced SNG in the presence of ferrous iron and oxygen generates toxic hydroxyl radicals. Thus, cell viability in the presence of SNG can be used as an assay for cytosolic iron concentration. When grown on low iron medium,ΔMFT1, ΔMFT2 cells were more resistant to SNG than wild type cells, which were more resistant than cells overexpressing MFT1 (Fig. 8). There was no difference in SNG sensitivity when cells were grown on YPD, a moderate to high iron containing medium (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of MFT genes can affect intracellular iron concentration. Incubation of either overexpressors or the double deletion strain in media containing either increased or decreased levels of copper, manganese, zinc, or cobalt, did not show any growth effect different from wild type cells. This result suggests that the MFT genes may be specific for iron transport. Many of the members of the extended gene family to which MFT1/MFT2 belongs were identified as metal resistance genes. Expression of these genes confer resistance to the specific transition metals by either transporting them out of cells or into the lumen of intracellular vesicles. Consequently, the action of these genes permits cells to grow in supernormal levels of transition metals. To determine if MFT1 or MFT2 functioned in a similar manner, cells were incubated in supernormal levels of iron, and both whole cell and mitochondrial iron concentration determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Table I). Cells that overexpressed either gene showed a higher accumulation of iron than wild type cells. Further, this increased iron could be quantitatively accounted for by an increase in mitochondrial iron. Incubation of cells in increased concentrations of either cobalt, zinc, or manganese did not result in either increased cellular or mitochondrial levels of these transition metals.Table IMFT1 and MFT2 affect mitochondrial iron accumulationStrain1-aWT, wild type.Whole cell ironMitochondrial ironnmol Fe/mg proteinWT/vector2.04 ± 0.085.38 ± 1.52WT/MFT15.41 ± 0.0433.99 ± 2.53WT/MFT25.35 ± 0.0925.43 ± 0.50Cells were grown to OD 3.0 in CM-Ura/glycerol/ethanol medium with 250 μm FeSO4.

For whole cell iron measurement, cells were washed twice in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, washed once in water, and analyzed for iron content through atomic absorption spectrophotometer. For mitochondrial iron, subcellular fractionation was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Purified mitochondrial proteins were washed and dissolved in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were measured by BCA. We identified two different genes, MFT1 andMFT2, which when overexpressed were capable of partially overcoming the growth defect attributed to a mutation in an endoplasmic reticulum iron-binding enzyme, methyl sterol oxidase. We believe that the iron binding site of Erg25p is in the cytosol and hence is sensitive to cytosolic iron. Overexpression of these two gene products in cells grown in low iron medium did not increase plasma membrane iron transport. Rather, the data suggest that overexpression increased cytosolic iron as a result of mobilization of iron from mitochondrial pools. In the absence of any exogenous iron, cells transformed with multicopy plasmids containing either MFT1 or MFT2grew longer than control cells, and were more susceptible to the iron mediated toxicity of SNG. Conversely, cells in which both genes were deleted were more SNG resistant than control cells and showed a lowered rate and degree of growth in iron free media. The fact that cells grew longer in iron free media supports the view that the effect of these genes is not on plasma membrane iron transport but on redistribution of iron from intracellular compartments. Based on subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence bothMFT1 and MFT2 encode mitochondrial membrane proteins. The major caveat to these studies is that overexpression is required to detect the tagged proteins and that overexpression may lead to mislocalization. In this instance that concern is lessened for two reasons. First, the protein is exclusively localized to a single organelle. Second, to our knowledge there is no evidence from published studies that overexpressed mitochondrial proteins are missorted to other organelles. The MFT genes show amino acid homology to a gene family that encode transition metal transporters. All family members have six potential transmembrane domains and are not members of the ABC family. While a number of these proteins are simply anonymous open reading frames, many have definable functions or are associated with phenotypes. For example COT1, a yeast gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein, was identified through a screen that selected for genes that when overexpressed conferred resistance to increased Co (17Conklin J.A. McMaster M.R. Culbertson D.C. Kung Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The yeast ZRC1 gene that confers resistance to cadmium and zinc (21Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) is also a member of this family. Similarly,czcd was identified as a gene on a plasmid that conferred resistance to cadmium, zinc, and cobalt in the bacteriaAlcaligenes eutrophus (20Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This gene has homology to genes found in E. coli and other bacteria, and with lower degrees of homology, to genes in the Archea. Other homologous genes include endosomal or synaptosomal zinc transporters present in mammalian cells (18Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 19Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Based on their location, as well as, direct physiological studies it is suggested that these proteins may be H+/metal co-transporters (20Nies D.H. Nies A. Chu L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Proteins located in either the bacterial membrane (Czcd) or mitochondrial membrane (Cot1p, MFT1p, MFT2p) may also utilize a pH gradient for transport activity (22Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2707-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the mammalian zinc transporters, ZNT2 and ZNT3, are located in subcellular organelles which also may be acidic (18Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 19Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Each one of these proteins contains a histidine-rich sequence. The exact sequence is different for each of the family members, although the histidine rich region in MFT1 and MFT2 are extremely similar to each other. The role of this sequence is unknown. Two likely hypotheses are that this sequence is required to bind metals prior to transport or that it is a metal binding domain responsible for regulating the activity of these transporters. That the MFT genes act as “metal resistance” genes is suggested by the observation that when cells expressing these genes were placed in high iron medium iron was accumulated above that seen in control cells. The ability to accumulate metal is also seen in yeast overexpressing the COT1 gene that mediates cobalt resistance (17Conklin J.A. McMaster M.R. Culbertson D.C. Kung Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In cells that overexpress MFT1 or MFT2, the increased cellular iron is located within the mitochondria. The fact that the double deletion strain can grow well on both glycolytic and respiratory substrates indicates that under normal physiological conditions these genes are not responsible for the delivery of iron to either ferrochelatase or mitochondrial iron binding proteins. The action of the MFT genes allows cells to utilize iron when cells grown in high iron are placed in iron-restricted medium. Based on this observation, we surmise that mitochondrial iron can be utilized for purposes other than heme biosynthesis. This line of reasoning suggests that mitochondria can act as a reservoir for iron. Iron, particularly in the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates, can be toxic. Indeed, the mitochondria is the major source of reactive oxygen intermediates. Cells overexpressing MFT1 orMFT2 are perfectly capable of growth on respiratory substrates, suggesting that the stored iron is not toxic. Conditions exist, however, in which mitochondrial iron accumulation can lead to toxicity. This has recently been demonstrated in cells bearing a deletion in the YFH1 gene, a gene that is homologous to the mammalian gene Frataxin (23Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Defects in Frataxin are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, a lethal disease. Cells with a defectiveYFH1 gene also accumulate iron in mitochondria. Such cells show a respiratory defect and an increased sensitivity to H2O2. The observation that cells with overexpressed MFT genes in high iron conditions also accumulate mitochondrial iron suggest that iron accumulation per se need not be toxic. These observations suggest that strains overexpressing MFT1/MFT2 or carrying a deletion inYFH1 may accumulate iron into different mitochondrial subcompartments or that YFH1 may affect the conditions in which mitochondrial iron is stored. Additionally, the amount of iron found in mitochondria in Δyfh1 (10×) is much greater than in MFT1/MFT2 overexpressors (2–5×). This may suggest that toxicity is defined by the absolute magnitude of mitochondrial iron accumulation. Experiments are in progress to distinguish between these hypotheses. The family of genes described here fit the characteristics of the cation facilitator family described by Paulsen and Saier (Paulsen, I. T., and Saier, M. H. (1997) J. Membr. Biol. 156, 99–103)."

The ability to remove altered bases from DNA is central to cellular protection against DNA damage by cytotoxic drugs. Removal can be effected by excision repair, which may involve the replacement of relatively long or short stretches of DNA or by direct reversal of the damage. An example of the former is provided by the excision of cisplatin-DNA adducts by the long-patch nucleotide excision repair pathway. Loss of the nucleotide excision repair pathway in the genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with sensitivity to cisplatin (for review see Ref. 1Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in situ demethylation of DNA O 6-methylguanine (O 6-meGua) 1The abbreviations used are:O 6-meGua,O 6-methylguanine; MGMT,O 6-meGua-DNA methyltransferase; MNU,N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; (k)bp, (kilo)base pair(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. by the O 6-meGua-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) provides an example of the latter strategy, and loss of MGMT expression in the Mex− (or Mer−) phenotype confers sensitivity to methylating agents. This selective sensitivity of Mex− cells directly implicates persistent DNAO 6-meGua lesions in cell death following exposure to methylating agents (for review see Ref. 2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6119-6129PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative to DNA lesion removal, tolerance mechanisms also provide escape from cytotoxic DNA damage. One known mechanism of DNA damage tolerance in human cells is loss of DNA mismatch repair. The DNA mismatch correction pathway normally corrects replication errors and prevents recombinational exchanges between nonidentical DNA sequences (for review see Ref. 3Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The usual substrates for mismatch correction are mispaired or unpaired normal DNA bases. There is increasing evidence that mismatch repair proteins play a significant part in processing diverse types of drug-induced DNA lesions (for review see Ref. 4Karran P. Bignami M. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mismatch repair interacts with DNA damage includingO 6-meGua, 6-thioguanine, and as yet undefined alterations introduced by cisplatin and doxorubicin. It contributes directly to the cytotoxicity of these lesions, and mismatch repair-competent cells may be sensitive to their lethal effects, although other mediators of cell death such as the p53 and p21 proteins are sometimes important for cytotoxic manifestations (5Anthoney D.A.

The phenomenon of cellular resistance acquired through mismatch repair defects is known as tolerance because the DNA lesions persist but, in the absence of mismatch repair, they are not processed into lethal intermediates and are unable to exert their potential cytotoxic effects. Resistance to these kinds of drugs is a significant therapeutic problem, and DNA damage tolerance may be of clinical importance. The association of the human cancer syndrome Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) with defective DNA mismatch repair has provided the genetic framework by which to define the human pathway (11Fishel R.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which bind to the mismatched DNA segment. The hMutSα heterodimer is composed of hMSH2 and hMSH6/GTBP. In the hMutSβ complex, hMSH2 is partnered by hMSH3. The α and β recognition factors have different, but partly overlapping, specificities for mismatch binding that depend on the mismatch itself and perhaps also on the context in which it appears (21Palombo F. Iaccarino I. Nakajima E. Ikejima M. Shimada T. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). hMutSα preferentially recognizes single-base mispairs (transition/transversion intermediates) and single-base loops (frameshift intermediates) that arise by DNA slippage during replication of tracts of repeated mononucleotides. The preferred substrates of hMutSβ are two to four base loops. Although this simple model is compatible with much of the experimental evidence, the properties of the only reported hMSH3-defective human cell line suggest that mismatch recognition by the α and β complexes may be governed by more complex factors than these simple numerical rules (19Risinger J.I. Umar A. Boyd J. Berchuck A. Kunkel T.A. Barrett J.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After recognition of the mismatch, a second heterodimer, hMutLα, is recruited (17Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This complex comprises the hMLH1 and hPMS2 proteins and probably serves to assemble the components necessary for the excision of the mismatched DNA segment. Deficiencies in the both the hMutSα and hMutLα complexes have been found in drug-resistant cells (reviewed in Ref. 22Karran P. Hampson R. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 69-85PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the relative frequencies of defective hMutSα and hMutLα complexes in tolerance to a methylating agent, we isolated and characterized a number of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-resistant variants of the Raji cell line. We evaluated two different protocols that were designed to mimic different therapeutic regimes. In the first, cells were exposed to a single high dose of the methylating agent. The second involved chronic exposure to escalating MNU doses. Several methylation-tolerant clones were isolated using both treatment regimes. Three independent clones had acquired MNU resistance through reexpression of their silent MGMT gene. We examined several phenotypic characteristics and defined the mismatch repair defect in a number of the remaining methylation-tolerant clones. These defects included hMutLα but were predominantly in hMutSα, most likely hMSH6/GTBP. In several resistant clones, a demonstrable defect in mismatch repair was not accompanied by a detectable mutator phenotype. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma except where stated otherwise. Formamide (Fluka) was deionized with AG501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad). Recrystallized MNU was a gift from Dr. Peter Swann, Department of Biochemistry, University College London, UK. Antibodies against hMLH1 and hPMS2 were obtained from Pharmingen and against hMSH2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The TK−,Mex−Raji cell line is routinely maintained in our laboratory. At the start of this study, three cultures of Raji cells were expanded from a small inoculum (100 cells), and a single clone was isolated from each population by dilution and seeding into 96-well plates. These three clones were used to generate MNU-resistant derivatives. The LoVo, DLD-1 and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines were obtained from C. Dixon, Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund and cultured as described previously (23Branch P. Hampson R. Karran P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2304-2309PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple cultures of exponentially growing cells, 106–107 cells in 10 ml RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were treated with 500 μm MNU. After a period of 28 days of culture to allow the outgrowth of survivors, surviving cells were cloned by single cell plating in 96-well plates. Chronically treated cells received 0.01 mm MNU. When exponential growth resumed, they were treated with 0.02 mmMNU. The procedure was repeated using successive treatments with 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.1, 0.32, and 0.5 mm MNU. Clones were isolated by single-cell plating. A single representative of each treated culture was chosen for further characterization. O 6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity in cell extracts was measured using heat-depurinated [3H]MNU-treated DNA as described previously (23Branch P. Hampson R. Karran P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2304-2309PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis was performed on subclones derived from each resistant clone. Colonies that had undergone approximately 20 cell doublings were lysed in situin 96-well plates, and aliquots were removed for PCR. Dinucleotide repeat microsatellites were amplified using fluorescent-labeled primers. Lengths were determined on an ABI automatic DNA sequencer as described previously (23Branch P. Hampson R. Karran P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2304-2309PubMed Google Scholar). Four loci were analyzed: D10S197, D11S904, D13S175, and D17S941. Mononucleotide repeat microsatellites, Bat25, Bat26, and Bat40 were amplified, separated on sequencing gels, and analyzed by Southern blotting using one of the radiolabeled PCR primers as a probe. Cultures (25 for each clone tested) were initiated using small (100 cell) inocula and expanded to ∼106 cells, which were distributed in 96-well plates (approximately 104 cells/well) in medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml 6-thioguanine. After 28 days, the frequency of positive wells containing 6-thioguanine-resistant cells was determined. Mutation rates were calculated from the equation, M = −lnP o · C −1 · ln 2, where P o is the number of cultures without mutant clones, and C is the total number of cells placed in selection. In some cases, mutation frequencies were estimated by plating growing cultures in 96-well plates under the same selective conditions. Cell extracts were prepared as described (24Karran P. Macpherson P. Ceccotti S. Dogliotti E. Griffin S. Bignami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15878-15886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSVori methylated with 0.48 mm MNU for 30 min at 37 °C was incubated with extract in the presence of [α-32P]dATP, and incorporation of radioactivity into material adhering to DE81 paper (Whatman) was determined as described (24Karran P. Macpherson P. Ceccotti S. Dogliotti E. Griffin S. Bignami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15878-15886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of cell extracts and details of the bandshift assay for mismatch binding have been described previously (25Stephenson C. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21177-21182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates were 34-mer-duplex oligonucleotides containing a single GT mispair (25Stephenson C. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21177-21182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an unpaired CA dinucleotide (duplex C in Ref. 26Aquilina G. Hess P. Branch P. MacGeoch C. Casciano I. Karran P. Bignami M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The substrate for in vitro mismatch correction was constructed from molecules derived by subcloning a 211-bp PvuI/PstI fragment of the previously described HK7 M13 (27Varlet I. Radman M. Brooks P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7883-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) into the pBK-CMV phagemid (Stratagene). The inserted region contained the heteroduplex cassette sequence that can be used to generate specific mismatches within restriction endonuclease sites that are diagnostic for strand-specific mismatch correction. For the experiments described in this paper, C-containing viral strands were purified by standard techniques (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Closed circular duplexes that contained T in the complementary position were purified by banding on CsCl gradients. After ethanol precipitation, duplex circular DNA was linearized by digestion with NdeI. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, linear DNA (150–250 μg) was mixed with a 2-fold excess of single-stranded DNA, and the mixture was adjusted to 50% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, in a total volume of 2–3 ml. The mixture was dialyzed sequentially against 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 2 h; 50% formamide, 200 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 2 h; 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA for 2 h; and finally against 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, for 2 h. Nicked circular molecules were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The purified 4470-bp molecules contain a unique CT mispair that inactivates an MluI restriction site. The mispaired T is 580-bp 5′ of a single nick (see Fig. 1). Small amounts of reannealed matched linear molecules were present in all preparations. These and their MluI digestion products could be easily resolved from the diagnostic products and did not detectably affect the correction assay. Cell extracts were prepared from 1–5 × 109 cells as described previously (24Karran P. Macpherson P. Ceccotti S. Dogliotti E. Griffin S. Bignami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15878-15886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mismatch correction was assayed in 25 μl of 30 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm each dNTP, 4 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase (rabbit muscle-type I), 90 ng of DNA substrate, and up to 200 μg of cell extract. Mixtures were incubated for 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% SDS. Samples were freed of protein by proteinase K digestion (1 mg/ml, 15 min) followed by phenol extraction. DNA was ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in buffer, and digested withMluI, which is diagnostic for removal of the mismatch. Digestion products were separated on 0.8% agarose gels in 40 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA buffer containing ethidium bromide and visualized under short wavelength ultraviolet light. The mismatched substrate is shown schematically in Fig. 1. An MluI site is located at position 463, and digestion of the uncorrected substrate generated unit-length linear 4470-bp molecules. Digestion of molecules that have undergone nick-directed correction (TC to GC) to generate the second MluI site produces two fragments of 3.9 kbp and 567 bp (see Fig. 4, fragments A and D). Digestion of the small amount of contaminating matched linear molecules generated during the annealing reaction produces traces of fragments of 3.3 and 1.17 kbp (see Fig. 4, fragments B and C) that are resolved from the products of mismatch correction. Thus, digestion withMluI of DNA recovered after incubation with repair-proficient cell extracts generated a mixture of unit-length linear molecules and fragments A–D. The smaller fragments (C and D) were not generally visible. In the products recovered from repair-defective extracts, only unit-length linear DNA was visible together with a small amount of fragmentB from contaminating linear molecules. Thus, the presence of fragment A (3.9 kbp) that is resolved from unit-length 4.47-kbp molecules, is diagnostic for mismatch correction. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from parental Raji cells and RajiF12 variant and used to generate hMSH2 cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach/Taunus, Germany). PCR was used to amplify the hMSH2 cDNA in five overlapping fragments. The following primers, designed to introduce BamHI andEcoRI recognition sequences, were used: fragment 1, CGGGATCCCAACCAGGAGGTGAGGAGG and CGGAATTCCTGGCCATCAACTGCGGACAT; fragment 2, CGGGATCCAGATCTTCTTCTGGTTCGTC and CGGAATTCGCCAACAATAATTTCTGTG; fragment 3, CGGGATCCTGGATAAGAACAGAATAGAGG and CGGGATCCCCACAATGGACACTTCTGC; fragment 4, CGGGATCCCACCTGTTCCATATGTACG and CGGAATTCAAAATGGGTTGCAAACATGC; fragment 5, CGGGATCCGTGATAGTACTCATGGCCC and CGGAATTCGACAATAGCTTATCAATATTACC. The sequences of the primers used to amplify fragments 2, 3, 4, and 5 were taken from Ref. 29Leach F.S. Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Jen J. Parsons R. Peltomäki P. Sistonen P.

The PCR reactions were carried out in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 250 μm each dNTP, 0.15 μm each primer, and 10 units/μl AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). 30 cycles of 93 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 3 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min were performed. Fragments were purified from agarose gels and ligated into M13mp18 or M13mp19 vectors (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). After bacterial transformation, individual clones were sequenced using M13 sequencing primer. Exons 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 were individually amplified by a two-step PCR procedure using nested primers (30Kolodner R.D. Hall N.R. Lipford J. Kane M.F. Rao M.R.S. Morrison P. Wirth L. Finan P.J. Burn J. Chapman P. Earabino C. Merchant E. Bishop D.T. Genomics. 1994; 24: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). First step amplifications were performed in 25 μl containing 75 ng of genomic DNA under the conditions described above. Two μl of the PCR products were used as templates in further rounds of amplification in 100-μl reaction volumes using biotinylated primers. In this case, the annealing step was carried out at 65 °C. Biotin-labeled single-stranded DNA was recovered by binding to magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal A. S., Oslo, Norway) and sequenced. The cell extracts (50 μg) that were used in mismatch correction assays and prestained low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were denatured and separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad) using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) at room temperature. The membrane was blocked by immersion at room temperature for 1 h in TBS-Tween (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80) containing 5% skimmed powdered milk. The blocked filter was incubated with purified mouse anti-hPMS2 (1 μg/ml), anti-hMLH1 (1 μg/ml), or hMSH2 (0.1 μg/ml) in TBS/Tween plus 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing several times with TBS-Tween, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBS-Tween plus 3% bovine serum albumin was added for 30 min. After several washes with TBS-Tween, the filter was developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham International). Membranes were stripped for reprobing by immersion in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 30 min at 50 °C. Eighteen individual cultures of the Mex− Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji were treated with MNU. Nine cultures received a single treatment with 0.5 mmMNU that resulted in an estimated survival of 10−7. The remainder were treated with an initial dose of 0.01 mm; surviving cells were allowed to recover and were retreated with 0.02 mm MNU. This regime of repeated treatments was continued with escalating doses up to a maximum of 0.5 mm. Individual colonies were isolated from each treated culture by cloning in 96-well plates. To ensure independence, only one MNU-resistant clone from each culture was characterized. Fifteen clones were analyzed further. Fourteen clones exhibited an increase in MNU resistance of at least 30-fold as measured by the drug concentration required to arrest cell growth. Proliferation of the parental Raji cells was inhibited by treatment with 0.01 mm MNU (Fig.2). Following treatment, these sensitive cells underwent one cell division during the first 24 h, but thereafter there was no further increase in cell number. In contrast, clones isolated after acute or chronic MNU treatment withstood exposure to ≥0.3 mm MNU and continued to proliferate at rates closely similar to that of the untreated cells. Two examples are shown in Fig. 2. The extent of MNU resistance in the isolated clones was comparable to that previously reported for the methylation-tolerant RajiF12 cells (6Branch P. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Nature. 1993; 362: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The effect of higher MNU concentrations was not systematically evaluated for all of the clones, but some, for example Raji10, were resistant up to at least 1 mm MNU. In all, 14 of 15 clones, 8 from acute exposure and 6 from chronic exposure to escalating drug doses, exhibited resistance to 0.3 mm MNU. The clones isolated after acute treatment were given a single number designation: Raji 3, Raji 7, etc. Those derived by chronic exposure were numbered Raji 101, Raji 102, etc. One clone, Raji 107, was not significantly more resistant to MNU than Raji and was not characterized in detail, although it served as a control in some experiments. The RajiF12 cell line, isolated following chronic MNU treatment, has been described previously (6Branch P. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Nature. 1993; 362: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Resistance to the unrelated DNA cross-linking agent, mitomycin C, was not significantly increased (<2-fold) in any of the the MNU-resistant clones (data not shown). This indicates that the loss of MNU sensitivity in these cells is not a consequence of a generalized resistance to DNA damaging agents arising, for example, through loss of a common apoptosis pathway. We investigated MGMT expression, microsatellite stability, and spontaneous mutation at the HPRT locus in the resistant clones. These properties together with mismatch binding by cell extracts, were used to assign the resistant clones to five different but overlapping phenotypes. The ability to carry out mismatch correction and to process DNA O 6-meGua in vitro were also analyzed. The findings are summarized in TableI. Complementation with extracts prepared from colorectal carcinoma cells and Western blot analysis was used to define defective mismatch repair functions in the resistant clones.Table ISummary of properties of MNU-resistant clonesPhenotype12345Mex statusMex+ 1-aSignificant changes in phenotype are shown in bold type.Mex−Mex−Mex−Mex−(A) n repeatsStableUnstableUnstableStableStable(CA) n repeatsStableUnstableStableStableStableRelative HPRT mutation rate1-bHPRT mutation rates in Raji 10, Raji 102, Raji 103, RajiF12, and the parental Raji cell line were determined by fluctuation analysis.

Open table in a new tab The TK−variant Raji cells are Mex− and cell extracts containing undetectable levels of MGMT (<0.05 units/mg of protein). In contrast, extracts of three of the resistant cell lines, Raji 101, Raji 105, and Raji 106, contained approximately 0.3 units of MGMT/mg of protein. The colorectal carcinoma cell line LoVo included for comparison was also Mex+ and expressed 0.7 units of MGMT/mg of protein. These values lie in the normal range for Mex+ cell lines, including the Mex+ Raji variant (TableII). The remaining clones isolated by the escalating dose regime and all of the clones derived by acute treatment did not contain detectable MGMT activity (Table II and data not shown). Raji 101 and Raji 106 did not exhibit microsatellite instability at either (A)n or (CA)n repeats (TableIII). The HPRT− mutation frequency in cultures of these three clones was comparable to that of the parental Raji cells, consistent with the absence of a mutator phenotype. Bandshift assays with cell extracts indicated that all were proficient in the recognition of a GT mismatch and a two-base loop in the standard substrates (Table I, data not shown; see Fig. 6).

Here we have isolated and characterized the gene encoding chicken neurofascin. Comparison of genomic sequences with cDNA sequences provides the structure and localization of intron/exon boundaries and indicates that neurofascin isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. The neurofascin gene is composed of 33 exons distributed over 72 kilobases. Each of the six immunoglobulin- and five fibronectin-type III-like domains is encoded by two exons. While introns between domains are of phase 1, others are of phase 0, 1, or 2. Alternative splicing of neurofascin is developmentally regulated as shown by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, plasmid libraries from long range polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA of neurofascin were used to examine and quantify the distribution of alternatively spliced exons in individual neurofascin molecules. We found 50 different neurofascin isoforms at different developmental stages and revealed the existence of one major “early” in comparison with multiple “late” neurofascin isoforms.

As a result, signals might be transduced that regulate the outgrowth behavior of neural growth cones (5Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell.

The relevance of the L1-related proteins on the development of the nervous system is exemplified by the finding that mutations in the human L1 gene cause the related mental retardation diseases X-linked hydrocephalus, MASA syndrome (mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and adducted thumbs), and spastic paraplegia type I (SPG1; Refs.7Fransen E.

For example, in the retino-tectal system, neurofascin is localized on outgrowing axons of retinal ganglion cells and in the tectobulbar tract of the optic tectum, indicating that it may participate in the development of nerve fiber tracts (9Rathjen F.G.

The intracellular segment of neurofascin as well as those of other members of the L1 subgroup interact with the cytoskeleton component ankyrin (14Davis J.Q. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dubreuil R.R.

From the NH2 to the COOH terminus, the L1 members contain a set of six immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains followed by five fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like repeats as extracellular domains that are linked to a cytoplasmic segment of about 110 amino acid residues by a transmembrane domain (2Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Prot. Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1108PubMed Google Scholar, 17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, neurofascin contains a segment located at the COOH terminus of the fourth FNIII-like repeat, which mainly consists of proline, alanine, and threonine, termed PAT domain, which has not been detected in other members of the L1 subfamily. Chick neurofascin is translated from an mRNA of about 8.5 kb derived from a single gene (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of neurofascin is the expression of several isoforms that may be generated by alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. The alternative stretches comprise four small segments located in the vicinity of the NH2 terminus, between the second and third Ig-like domain, at the junction between the Ig-like domains and the FNIII-like repeats, and in the cytoplasmic domain. Two larger differentially expressed sequences represent the third FNIII-like repeat and the PAT domain, which have been shown to be expressed late in the development and in the adult brain suggesting that these domains may be involved in the maintenance of cellular structures of the nervous system. Currently, only the genes of the axonal IgSF members NCAM, L1, chick F11, and axonin-1 have been characterized in detail (19Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R.

In this report, we have isolated the chick neurofascin gene to determine the exon/intron organization. This analysis also led to the identification of a fifth FNIII-like domain within chick neurofascin which has not been detected in our previously described cDNA sequence. To analyze the distribution of alternatively spliced exons within individual neurofascin mRNA molecules, we examined a collection of 138 independent cDNA clones from two developmental stages. The identification of multiple neurofascin isoforms at different developmental stages might be a first step toward understanding the role of neurofascin diversity in the regulation of axonal growth and maintenance of cellular structures in the adult nervous system. A lambda EMBL-3 genomic chicken liver library (CLONTECH) was screened under high stringency conditions using digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes generated according to the manufacturer instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). The genomic DNA inserts of all isolated λ phages were cleaved with SalI and cloned into pBluescript KS+ phagemids (Stratagene) for sequencing. Since the obtained clones did not cover the complete coding region of neurofascin, a bidirectional genomic walk consisting of several steps was carried out using 2,340,000 EMBL-3 phages and, additionally, 1,100,000 colonies of a pWE15 genomic chicken liver cosmid library (CLONTECH). Restriction mapping was performed by single and double digests with restriction endonucleases and hybridization of terminal oligonucleotides on blots of partial restriction endonuclease digests (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA in pBluescript KS+ was sequenced by the chain termination method of Sangeret al. (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with [35S]dATP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) or the AutoRead sequencing kit with either fluorescein-coupled dATP or primers in an A.L.F.-sequencer (Pharmacia) for radioactive or nonradioactive labeling, respectively. Sequence data were analyzed using the GCG program package (University of Wisconsin) and compared with the cDNA sequence and the restriction map of the gene. Total RNA of chicken brain of embryonic days E6, E8, E10, E12, E14, E16, and E18 and adult brain or liver was isolated using the guanidinium method (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). For standard PCR, first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexameric primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase from the You-Prime cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer instructions with 9 μg of total RNA. After synthesis of the first strand, the reaction was diluted 1:10 in Tris-EDTA buffer and heated to 95 °C for 2 min to inactivate the enzyme. For long range PCR (see below), first strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA of E6 and E16 embryonic brain using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a specific neurofascin antisense primer derived from exon 33 (nucleotides 3761–3744, 5′-TCC TGT TGC TTT ATC GTG-3′). The RNA strand was removed by RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) after reverse transcription. Standard PCR (32Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13369) Google Scholar) was performed using 0.5 unit of Goldstar Polymerase (Eurogentec) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The temperature profile was 95 °C, 20 s (plus 3 min in the first cycle); annealing temperature was (see below) 30 s and 72 °C, 60 s for 32 cycles followed by 72 °C, 5 min and cooling down to 4 °C in the last cycle. The primer pairs and annealing temperatures applied for amplification of specific exons are listed in the following: exon 3 (5′-GAT CGC ATT CGC TCT GTG-3′, pos 144–164, and 5′-TCC TTC ACA GAC TGC TTG-3′, pos 260–243), 49 °C; exon 8 (5′-GCA ATG CAC GCT TCC ACT TCA-3′; pos 749–769, and 5′-ACG GGG CAG CCT TCA CTC TCA-3′; pos 1174–1154), 59 °C; exon 17 (5′-CGG TCT GAC AAT ATA TGG-3′, pos 1887–1904, and 5′-ACG ATG TAG TCT GTG ATG-3′, pos 2141–2124), 47 °C; exons 22 and 23 (5′-GAC ACG TCG TCT GGA AC-3′, pos 2507–2523, and 5′-CCC GTT TTG GAT CCG TT-3′, pos 3086–3070), 47 °C; exons 26–29 (5′-CGC GCT ATC GAT TCT TCC TG-3′, pos 3155–3174, and 5′-GTA TTT CCC TCC TCT GCT CCT CTT-3′, pos 3609–3586), 60 °C; exon 32 (5′-GAT GAG CAC CTG AAT CCT-3′, pos 3628–3645, and 5′-TCC TGT TGC TTT ATC GTG-3′, pos 3761–3744), 47 °C. PCR of the very small exons 3 and 32 were performed using primers that were radioactively labeled with [γ32P]ATP (Amersham) using a standard protocol. Amplification products were extracted with phenol, precipitated, and separated by denaturing PAA electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Long range PCR (33Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) was used to amplify nearly full-length cDNA. The template was 1 μl of the specifically primed first strand cDNA (see above) of E6 or E16 embryonic chicken brain using primers 5′-CCA CCT CAT CAG CGC CAT TGA AGT-3′, pos 168–191, on exon 2 and 5′-CTG GCT GTT GGG CAG TGG TTT GTT-3′, pos 3729–3706, on exon 32. Long range PCRs were performed using a hot start triggered with Ampliwax-100 and rTth XL polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Temperature profile was 94 °C, 30 s (preceeded by 93 °C, 4.5 min in the first cycle); 60 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 6 min (followed by 72 °C, 10 min in the last of 32 cycles). PCR products were cloned into pBluescript vector as described in (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Plasmid DNA of verified clones was heat denaturated, dot blotted on nylon membranes (Amersham Life Science, Inc.), and hybridized with oligonucleotides specific for alternatively spliced exons. An oligonucleotide of the constitutively spliced exon 21 served as a control. Previously, a genomic Southern hybridization using neurofascin cDNA as a probe indicated that there is only a single neurofascin gene in the chicken (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To establish the organization of the neurofascin gene, a chick EMBL-3 library was screened with three nonoverlapping cDNA fragments covering all portions of the neurofascin open reading frame. Missing parts of the neurofascin gene were obtained by a genomic walking procedure of the EMBL-3 library and of a chicken genomic cosmid library. All clones were mapped with respect to the occurrence of EcoRI, BamHI, andNotI cleavage sites and further characterized by Southern blot hybridization and sequencing of exons and their respective exon/intron boundaries. An oligonucleotide derived from the 5′-end of the neurofascin cDNA was used to identify the 3′-end of untranslated exon 1. The resulting clones contained all known coding sequences of neurofascin and in addition about 42 kb upstream of the 3′-end of the untranslated exon 1 and about 10 kb at the 3′-end downstream of the translational stop codon. Comparison with cDNA sequences (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) revealed the structure of the neurofascin gene as shown in Fig. 1. The neurofascin gene is composed of 33 exons that are spread over 72 kb. Exon 1 contains exclusively untranslated sequences of the 5′-end of the neurofascin mRNA, and exon 2 includes untranslated sequences (71 bp), the translational initiation codon, sequences that code for the signal peptide, as well as the NH2 terminus of the mature polypeptide (six amino acid residues). Exons 1 and 2 are separated by an unusually long intron of 29 kb in length. A large first intron is a feature that is also found within the related chick NCAM (38 kb within a gene of 85 kb in length), chick axonin-1 (≈15/40 kb) and chick F11 (more than 10/100 kb) (22Colwell G. Li B. Forrest D. Brackenbury R. Genomics. 1992; 14: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Plagge A. Brümmendorf T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Giger R.J. Vogt L. Zuellig R.A. Rader C. Henehan-Beatty A. Wolfer D.P. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain resides on exon 30, and the cytoplasmic domain is located on three exons 31 to 33. The latter includes the neurofascin amber codon at the end of the reading frame and 3′-untranslated sequences. It cannot formally be excluded that additional untranslated exons at the 5′- or 3′-region exist although we consider this to be unlikely. The consensus sequences of splice donor and splice acceptor sites are in line with the respective exon/intron boundaries of neurofascin (Ref. 36Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholarand Table I). Introns between individual domains are always phase 1 introns, which insert after the first base of a given codon. In contrast, introns within individual domains are of phase 0, 1, or 2 (Table I). As found for other neural members of the IgSF, such as L1, NCAM, F11, and axonin-1, the Ig-like domains and the five FNIII-like repeats are encoded by two exons.Table IIntron-exon organization of the chicken neurofascin geneDomainExon← DonorIntron length→ AcceptorAmino acidNo.length1ND...GTGGgtaagcgg...≈29000...tttgtgtgttttgcagCTG...Untranslated2165...GATTgtaagttc...≈1700...actttggaaataacagCAA...S-er318...GAATgtaagtgc...292...gtcatttgctttgcagTGC...L-euIg I4106...CCACgtaagtgc...235...tttgccatccttacagCTT...Th-rIg I5197...TCCAgtgagtaa...717...gtgattctcatggcagGAT...A-rgIg II6123...AGCTgtgagttg...207...gcctctttccctgcagCCA...S-erIg II7171...ACCAgtaagtgt...≈1700...cttttgtttattgcagAGA...L-ys851...AGTGgtgagtca...≈3300...ttcctgctgatcttagCCC...A-laIg III9112...GAGTgtacgtac...577...ccttccctctccttagACC...Va-lIg III10185...AAGGgtacgtca...129...tttgtgtttcttaaagCTG...A-laIg IV11132...GAAGgtgagcca...261...ctttcttattttgaagGTT...G-lyIg IV12144...CTGGgtaggtga...≈500...cctttgatgcttgcagATG...A-spIg V13112...GATGgtaaggag...95...ctttgatggctgtgagGTT...Tr-pIg V14167...AAAGgtaggagc...389...ttggggtgttttgcagACC...A-spIg VI15148...ACAGgtctgtga...643...ctttcatccctttaagGAT...Ar-gIg VI16125...CTAGgtaaagct...495...atgtcttaccttgcagCAA...A-la1736...AAAGgtaatcat...≈1200...attccttgaacaccagAGC...G-luFN A18102...ACAGgtcagggc...110...tccatcctcccctcagACT...A-spFN A19198...GCACgtgagtag...≈1200...ccaatgtgaatttcagGAC...A-rgFN B2071...GACGgtgagttc...567...gttttgccccgttcagCCT...Thr-ProFN B21223...GATTgtgagtat...698...gtccccaaacacccagATC...T-yrFN C22116...CAGAgtgagcaa...1054...tgcgtgtttcttgaagGCC...Arg-AlaFN C23205...GGAGgtacgtgt...≈1300...ccatcctcctcccaagTGC...V-alFN D24123...GCCTgtacgttc...502...tgcctttcctccccagTTA...P-heFN D25174...GAAGgtgagtgc...≈1600...gcgctgccctctgaagCCA...A-laPAT2615...CCAGgtaccgta...≈5800...cctttccctctgccagCCT...A-laPAT27225...CTGGgtactgag...≈2200...ctaacctatccaccagCCA...A-laFN E28117...ACCAgtaagcat...1282...ggtttctgtttctcagGTA...S-erFN E29156...TCAGgtgagcgg...≈4000...tccattttcctcccagTTA...A-laTransmembrane30132...CCAGgtaagagg...467...atgtgtttgcttacagTGC...V-alCytoplasmic3170...ACAGgtatgctc...≈2800...cacatggaccatgaagGTC...Ar-gCytoplasmic3212...AAAGgtaggacc...≈2600...tctgtctgtctaccagCGA...Se-r(33)NDConsensus-ACAGGT¯AGAGT­­......-TCTTTC­T­CTCTT­CAG¯—The nucleotide sequences around 3′- and 5′-splice sites of the neurofascin gene are shown.

The amino acid positions of the domain boundaries are given at the right. The lengths of the exons and introns are given in bp (ND = not determined). Since neurofascin belongs to the L1 subgroup of the IgSF, we compared the location of individual introns between human L1 and chick neurofascin (26Rosenthal A. Coutelle O. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 64: 185Google Scholar).2 The positions of introns relative to the coding sequence are identical for neurofascin and human L1 except for minor differences at the NH2 terminus, in the sixth Ig-like and the fifth FNIII-like repeat, and the sequence stretches (exons 8, 17, 26, and 27) that have no counterparts in L1 (not shown). In addition to sequence similarity and overall domain composition, the conservation of intron locations is, therefore, another feature that indicates that the L1 family members may be derived from the duplication of a common ancestor. All sequences that are differentially expressed in independent neurofascin cDNA clones were found to be located on separate exons (Fig. 1). Our previous characterization of neurofascin by cDNA cloning (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) led to the identification of four FNIII-like repeats and six Ig-related domains within the neurofascin polypeptide. In this study, however, RT-PCR amplification (also see below) with an upstream primer within the fourth FNIII-like repeat (exon 25) and a downstream primer residing 5′ of the transmembrane domain (exon 30) yielded additional bands with a size larger than the fragments expected to encode the PAT domain. Sequence analysis of these bands revealed that, in addition to the four FNIII-like repeats, a fifth FNIII-like domain located between the PAT domain and the transmembrane segment exists. As for all other coding regions, the sequence of the fifth FNIII-like repeat was also confirmed on the genomic level (FNE (E) in Fig. 1). As found for all other FNIII-like repeats, the fifth FNIII-like repeat is encoded by two exons, 28 and 29. This domain is 91 amino acid residues in length, and conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues were found at characteristic positions (Fig. 2). Rat neurofascin was described previously as containing only four FNIII-like repeats (14Davis J.Q. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); however, our own assessment of the rat neurofascin cDNA sequence identifies a fifth FNIII-like repeat also within rat neurofascin (Fig.2; also see Ref. 2Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. Prot. Profile. 1995; 2: 963-1108PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the overall domain structure between rat and chick neurofascin in the FNIII-like region is conserved. Comparison with other members of the L1-subgroup within the IgSF reveals that the fifth FNIII-like repeat of neurofascin is most closely related to the fifth FNIII-like domain of the L1 members (Fig.2). These domains show 50.0% identity at the amino acid and 62.7% identity at the nucleotide level. In contrast to all other FNIII-like domains of neurofascin, the fifth FNIII-like repeat is either expressed as a half or as a complete domain (see below). In a previous communication, domain boundaries between individual neurofascin domains were defined by comparison with other L1-like protein sequences (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we refine these positions on the basis of exon boundaries (Table I), which might define the domain boundaries more accurately and which is also supported by a key residue analysis of L1 (37Bateman A. Jouet M. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Kenwrick S. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6050-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Most important, at the junction between the fourth FNIII-like repeat and the PAT domain, there is a sequence of five amino acid residues (ATPTP) that was originally assigned to the fourth FNIII-like repeat as it was not found to be alternatively spliced in conjunction with the PAT domain (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this report, we found by Southern blot analysis using a specific oligonucleotide probe and subsequent sequencing of genomic DNA that these five amino acid residues are encoded by a separate exon, 26 (data not shown). On the basis of the occurrence of the characteristic amino acid residues of the PAT domain, this sequence will be now considered to be part of the PAT domain that appears to be encoded by two exons like all other extracellular neurofascin domains albeit the lengths of the two exons are very asymmetric (15 to 225 base pairs). We have previously shown by Northern blot analysis that the third FNIII-like repeat and the PAT domain are mainly expressed late in embryonic development (17Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we subjected all alternatively spliced sequences (exons 3, 8, 17, 22, 23, 26 to 29, and exon 32) to a PCR analysis in which flanking primers were applied to amplify fragments either with or without an alternatively spliced sequence from randomly primed cDNA derived from chick brain. This analysis provides information about the temporal expression pattern of individual alternatively spliced exons. As control, amplifications were performed in the presence of liver cDNA or without cDNA which did not result in amplification products (not shown). All PCR products were verified either by Southern blot analysis or sequencing. Primers flanking the cDNA sequences of exon 3 amplify a band of 117 bp in the presence of exon 3"

Following gel purification, amino acid sequencing revealed the 45-kDa TAT-binding polypeptide to be cytokeratin 18 (CK18). The presence of CK18 on the surface of intact rat hepatoma cells was demonstrated by binding of125I-anti-CK18 antibodies. Anti-CK18 antibodies reduced the binding and internalization of 125I-TAT by rat hepatoma cells. Immunocytochemical analysis, to determine the location of CK18 in vivo, revealed a periportal gradient of CK18 staining; with hepatocytes around the portal triads demonstrating striking pericellular staining. In addition, anti-CK18 IgG associated with perfused livers to a significantly greater extent than preimmune IgG. Taken together, these data provide evidence that CK18 is found on the extracellular surface of hepatocytes and could play a role in TAT removal. Finally, these data, in conjunction with recent reports of CK8 (Hembrough, T. A., Li, L., and Gonias, S. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25684–25691) and CK1 cell membrane surface expression (Schmaier, A. H. (1997) Thromb.

Hemostasis 78, 101–107), indicate a novel role for these proteins as putative cellular receptors or cofactors to cellular receptors. The generation and regulation of thrombin is of central importance in the maintenance of hemostasis (1Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Antithrombin, the main physiological regulator of thrombin, is a 60-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and found in plasma at a concentration of 2–5 μm (2Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the regulation of thrombin by antithrombin is demonstrated by the fact that individuals with inherited antithrombin deficiency have an increased tendency to develop thrombosis (3Blajchman M.A. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F.F. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2159-2171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I. Blajchman M.A. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 355-377Google Scholar) The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin is catalyzed by heparin and related naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans. This property of heparin accounts for its widespread clinical use as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic agent (5Hirsh J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Antithrombin is a member of the protein superfamily known as theserine proteinase inhibitors orserpins (6Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 95: 866-871Google Scholar). The serpin family includes both inhibitory proteins, which inhibit their cognate proteases, and proteins with no known inhibitory function. In addition to antithrombin, the inhibitory serpins include: α-AC, 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: α-AC, α1-antichymotrypsin; α-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PPACK,d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-chloromethylketone; CK1, CK8, and CK18, cytokeratins 1, 8, and 18; HCII, heparin cofactor II; IF, intermediate filament; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-I and PAI-II, plasminogen activator inhibitors I and II; PN-1, protease nexin 1; SEC, serpin-enzyme complexes; SECR, SEC receptor; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complexes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.α2-antiplasmin, α-PI, HCII, PAI-I, PAI-II, and PN-1 (7Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The inhibitory serpins are suicide inhibitors which inhibit serine proteinases through the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric covalent serpin-enzyme complex (SEC), which renders both serpin and enzyme non-functional. Such complex formation results in a conformational change in the serpin moiety, that exposes residues believed to be responsible for SEC binding to putative hepatic receptors, and which consequently effect their removal from the circulation (8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Plasma elimination studies in experimental animals have demonstrated that SECs are removed much more rapidly than the corresponding native or cleaved serpin (reviewed in Refs. 8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 9Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Toronto, Ontario, Canada1996: 161-167Google Scholar). Such studies in mice, employing 125I-labeled SECs in competition with large excesses of non-radiolabeled SECs, suggest the presence of two distinct liver receptors for their removal. These putative receptors have been designated serpin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. Serpin receptor 1 appears to be responsible for the removal of SECs composed of the serpins antithrombin, α-PI, α-AC, or HCII, while serpin receptor 2 appears to be responsible for the removal of α2-antiplasmin-enzyme complexes (8Pizzo S.V. Am. J. Med. 1990; 87: 10S-14SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A hepatic receptor with binding characteristics similar to that of serpin receptor 1 has been identified on HepG2 cells, monocytes, and neutrophils and has been designated SECR (10Perlmutter D.H.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide of α-PI, putatively exposed upon complex formation and conserved throughout the serpins, was found to comprise the minimal necessary residues for binding to the SECR (13Joslin G. Fallon R.J. Bullock J. Adams S.P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11282-11288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of this pentapeptide to a hepatoma plasma cell membrane protein has been reported to result in the formation of an adduct of ≈78 kDa, although neither the cloning nor the purification of this membrane protein has yet been reported (14Joslin G. Krause J.E. Hershey A.D. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21897-21902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) has also been demonstrated to bind a number of different SECs, including TAT (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (16Conese M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have also been reported to bind different SECs. In this study, we provide evidence that CK18 may also represent a TAT receptor, or a cofactor to such a receptor.Cytokeratins are members of the IF family of proteins that are found primarily in epithelial tissues (21Moll R. Franek W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 22Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IFs interact to form filamentous cytoplasmic networks that run from the surface of the nucleus to the plasma membrane (23Okanoue T. Ohta M. Fushiki S. Ou O. Kachi K. Okuno T. Takino T. S. French S.W. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24French S.W. Kawahara H. Katsuma Y. Ohta M. Swierenga S.H.H. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1989; 2: 17-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All IFs are composed of a central α-helical rod domain which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (reviewed in Refs. 25Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 729-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). At least 30 different cytokeratin proteins have been identified in epithelial tissues and carcinomas, and these are grouped into two main types: type I, which are acidic; and type II, which are neutral to basic proteins. Unlike other IF proteins, cytokeratins are obligate heteropolymers, requiring the presence of both type I and type II proteins to form filaments (28Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Zimmerman S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 547-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Within each type of cytokeratin there is high homology in the α-helical rod domains, but with notable diversity in the head and tail domains. Despite the diversity in these domains, all cytokeratins form morphologically similar filaments, implying the primary importance of the α-helical domains in filament formation. The sequence heterogeneity in the head and tail domains, along with the diversity of tissue expression, indicates that individual cytokeratins have specialized functions within cells in addition to the ability to form filaments (26Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 729-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar).Recently, the view that cytokeratins and other intracellular proteins are confined solely to the cytosol has been challenged. Within the last 5 years, a number of investigators have provided evidence that various intracellular proteins are expressed also on the surface of cells and function as receptors for different plasma ligands. For example, cell surface actin has been reported to bind Factor Va, angiogenin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and lipoprotein(a) (29Furmiak-Kazmierczak E. Nesheim M.E. Cote G.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Moroianu J.W. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); annexin II to plasminogen (33Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9708-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Relevant to this present report, CK8 has been reported to be a receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and recently CK1 has been demonstrated to be an endothelial cell receptor for high molecular weight kininogen (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present study, data are provided from biochemical, cell culture, immunocytochemical, and liver perfusion studies which support the identification of CK18 as a TAT-binding protein on the hepatocyte surface.DISCUSSIONThe present studies were undertaken to identify the putative receptor(s) responsible for removal of TAT complexes from the circulation. During the course of these studies CK18 was identified as a TAT-binding protein associated with the plasma membranes of hepatocytes. This conclusion was based on the following observations: 1) TAT-binding protein from rabbit liver plasma membranes has high sequence homology to human CK18; 2) TAT-binding protein has a similar electrophoretic mobility to CK18; and 3) the insolubility of the TAT-binding protein in various detergents, a physical property of most IF proteins. The potential physiological relevance of TAT interaction with CK18 is suggested by: 1) the inhibition of 125I-TAT binding to cultured hepatoma cells by anti-CK18 antibodies; 2) the ability of anti-CK18 antibodies to inhibit 125I-TAT internalization; 3) immunolocalization of CK18 on the surface of hepatoma cells in culture; and 4) the specific association, in perfusion experiments, of anti-CK18 antibodies with livers.Our findings are difficult to reconcile with an exclusive intracellular localization of CK18. Moreover, CK8 has been detected on the cell surface of primary hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, and human breast carcinoma cells (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 46Donald P.J. Cardiff R.D. He D. Kendall K. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1991; 105: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, CK1 also has been demonstrated recently to be present on the cell surface of endothelial cells (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cell surface localization for cytokeratins is also supported by surface labeling studies of cultured carcinoma cells (47Godfroid E. Geuskens M. Dupressoir T. Parent I. Szpirer C. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 595-607PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the cell surface localization of predominantly intracellular proteins is not unprecedented, as shown by the detection of α-actin on the surface of calf and human endothelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (30Moroianu J.W. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3815-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Dudani A.K. Ganz P. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 95: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The interaction of serpin-enzyme complexes with four other cell surface membrane proteins has previously been reported; these include LRP, gp330, uPA receptor, and SECR. Of these TAT specifically has been reported to interact with LRP and SECR (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present study, the affinity of TAT for hepatic-binding sites appears to be low (ranging from 100 to >500 nm). However, this is not dissimilar to other studies which indicate low affinity TAT binding to SECR (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as purified LRP (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Specific TAT binding to monocytoid cells had a K d ≈ 80 nm(48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), while TAT binding to HepG2 cells was found to have aK d ≈ 247 nm (49Fair D.S. Plow E.F. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the use of the SECR-binding pentapeptide did not inhibit125I-TAT binding to rabbit liver plasma membranes while a 20-fold molar excess of cold TAT inhibited binding by ≈50%. In other studies, similar molar excesses of TAT were found to reduce the SECR-binding pentapeptide, α-PI-elastase, and TAT binding to HepG2 cells to a similar degree (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although SECR and LRP have both been reported to interact with TAT, there is evidence to suggest that TAT also interacts with other proteins. Thus, Takeya et al. (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TAT bound to a receptor distinct from the SECR. Similar to the findings of this present study, the SECR-binding pentapeptide did not inhibit TAT, or α-AC-cathepsin G complex binding to cells (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 50Chen M. Conn K.-J. Festoff B.W. Neurology. 1993; 43: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, alterations in the SECR-binding pentapeptide consensus sequence for HCII have been shown to have no effect on HCII-thrombin complex binding to HepG2 cells (51Maekawa H. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18604-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Despite its low affinity for TAT, LRP has been shown to be the vehicle for TAT internalization in vivo in rats (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, although LRP has been shown to be involved in the internalization of TAT and other SEC, other proteins are very likely the initial binding sites for such complexes. In addition to TAT having low apparent affinity for LRP, its binding to purified LRP appears very slow (an 18-h incubation was used in binding experiments) (15Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This slow binding is not in keeping with the known very rapid removal rate for TAT in vivo. Moreover, some investigators have found no evidence for TAT binding to purified LRP (48Takeya H. Hamada T. Kume M. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recently a PN-1 peptide was found to be a potent inhibitor of PN-1-thrombin internalization by LRP, but this peptide was found not to inhibit PN-1-thrombin binding to the cell surface; supporting the possibility that TAT could bind to a receptor protein other than LRP (52Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This scenario is not unprecedented as uPA-PAI and uPA-PN-1 complexes have been shown to bind to the uPA receptor before being internalized through interaction with LRP (16Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Is there evidence to link CK18 and LRP? CK8 and CK18 have been reported to be found in a complex with the uPA receptor and protein kinase C in the plasma membranes of WISH cells (53Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Additionally, an unidentified plasma membrane glycoprotein of 85 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated from a variety of epithelial cell lines with CK18 (54Chou C.-F. Riopel C.L. Omary M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This unidentified protein could represent the β subunit of LRP, as it had similar biochemical traits. Finally, although the histochemical experiments do not provide direct evidence of CK18 cell surface expression in vivo, they provide an intriguing coincidental pattern of expression with that seen for LRP, in that LRP is also preferentially expressed in hepatocytes proximal to the portal triads (55Voorschuur A.H. Kuiper J. Neelissen J.A.M. Boers W. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that CK18 may be the initial TAT-binding protein on hepatocytes, leading to subsequent interaction with LRP.High sequence homology in the rod domains of intermediate filaments indicate the necessity of these regions for the formation of filaments, yet the high sequence divergence of the head and tail regions would seem to indicate the possibility of functional differences between the different cytokeratins unrelated to their cytoskeletal role. Recently, the COOH-terminal domain of CK8 has been demonstrated to be expressed on the surface of breast mammary carcinoma cells and to be necessary for plasminogen binding (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CK8 has been demonstrated to augment the tissue-plasminogen activator activation of plasminogen on the cell surface and in the media of cultured breast mammary carcinoma cells (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 56Hembrough T.A. Kralovich K.K. Li L. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the transfection of mouse L fibroblasts with CK8 and CK18 resulted in their increased migration and invasion of matrigel (57Chu Y.-W. Runyan R.B. Oshima R.G. Hendrix M.J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4261-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This novel functional role for cytokeratins is probably mediated by their acting as cell surface receptors (35Hembrough T.A. Vasudevan J. Allieta M.M. Glass II, W.F. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1071-1082PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).At this time the true role for CK18 in TAT removal from the circulation is unclear. However, in this study we provide evidence for the biochemical interaction between TAT and CK18 as well as the presence of CK18 on the surface of cultured hepatic cells and hepatocytes in liver perfusion experiments. These data thus support the hypothesis that cytokeratins may represent cellular receptors at the hepatocyte cell surface. CK18 may thus be involved in the interaction of TAT, as well as other SECs, with hepatocytes. Such interactions are likely mediated by the variable head and tail domains of cytokeratins as has recently been demonstrated for CK8 for plasminogen binding (36Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and CK1 for high molecular weight kininogen (37Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Along with the growing body of evidence for surface expression of intracellular proteins, our data indicate potentially new and physiologically relevant roles for cytokeratins as putative cellular receptors, and/or as cofactors of cellular receptors. The generation and regulation of thrombin is of central importance in the maintenance of hemostasis (1Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Antithrombin, the main physiological regulator of thrombin, is a 60-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and found in plasma at a concentration of 2–5 μm (2Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6490-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the regulation of thrombin by antithrombin is demonstrated by the fact that individuals with inherited antithrombin deficiency have an increased tendency to develop thrombosis (3Blajchman M.A. Austin R.C.

The serpin family includes both inhibitory proteins, which inhibit their cognate proteases, and proteins with no known inhibitory function.

Although FAK does not have SH2 or SH3 domains, it is associated to many proteins, some of which bind to FAK phosphorylated on tyrosine via their own SH2 domains (1Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr.

The first step appears to be the autophosphorylation of Tyr-397 which allows the binding of the SH2 domains of Src (6Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), Fyn (7Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Src-family kinases results in the phosphorylation of neighboring proteins and at least 5 residues in FAK itself (9Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of some of these residues leads to the recruitment of Grb2 and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (10Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). The importance of FAK is attested by the embryonic lethality of the knock out of its gene (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). FAK is thought to have various functions ranging from the regulation of focal adhesions turnover to the prevention of anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by the detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix (12Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).FAK is highly expressed in the nervous tissue during development, a period at which it is enriched in neuronal growth cones (13Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Stevens G.R. Zhang C. Berg M.M. Lambert M.P. Barber K. Cantallops I.

Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the brain of adult rats, FAK is expressed at higher levels than in most other tissues, especially in neurons of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (13Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brain, the major form of FAK is a splice variant termed FAK+, which contains a 3-amino acid insertion (Pro-Trp-Arg) at position 904 (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In rat hippocampal slices, FAK+ phosphorylation is strongly stimulated by several neurotransmitters, including glutamate (19Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and acetylcholine, 2P. Derkinderen, J. C. Sicilians, M. Toutant, and J.-A.

Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidic acid.2 The sensitivity of FAK+ phosphorylation to neurotransmitters suggests that FAK+ transduces information generated by neuronal activity into phosphorylation of proteins, possibly resulting in changes in ion channel properties, cytoskeletal organization, or gene expression. Thus, FAK may be critical for the suggested role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in synaptic plasticity (20O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 21Boxall A.R. Lancaster B. Garthwaite J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that FAK phosphorylation is decreased in Fyn knock out mice (16Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) which display anomalous hippocampal development and long term potentiation (20O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G.N.

A. 1997; 94: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).As an approach to better understand the function of FAK in neurons, we have examined the biochemical properties of this kinase in rat brain. We show that the slightly larger size of FAK in brain as compared with other tissues, can be accounted for by the presence of additional exons surrounding the autophosphorylated tyrosine. The presence of two of these exons resulted in an increased autophosphorylation activity.DISCUSSIONThis study underlines the complexity of FAK structure and processing. Although it appears to be coded by a single gene, a number of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms generate multiple isoforms of FAK mRNA and protein. Two different polyadenylation sites and two different 5′ ends were found in rat, corresponding to those described in chick and mouse, respectively (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A very short alternative exon, coding for 3 amino acids defining FAK+, is found in rat, mouse (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), human (28Whitney G.S. Chan P.-Y. Blake J. Cosand W.L. Neubauer M.G. Aruffo A. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Xenopus(26Hens M.D. DeSimone D.W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A short form of FAK, called FAK-related non-kinase has been described in chick (29Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and may also exist in human (30André E. Becker-André M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that 3 additional exons can be found in rat and mouse FAK, corresponding to the region of the protein which surrounds the autophosphorylation site, at the junction between the amino-terminal and the catalytic domains of FAK. At least two of these exons (boxes 6 and 7) have been highly conserved during evolution, since they exist also in Xenopus (26Hens M.D. DeSimone D.W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Assuming that all these variations of FAK mRNAs occur independently from the others, at least 512 different mRNAs coding for 64 different forms of full-length FAK protein could exist. This calculation does not take into account the short gene product FAK-related non-kinase and the possible additional exons which have been reported in human cDNAs (30André E. Becker-André M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that not all combinations are expressed at significant levels, the wealth of potential isoforms, many of which, and perhaps all, have been highly conserved during evolution, provide a mechanism by which FAK expression and properties could be finely tuned.It is noteworthy that exons which give rise to changes in the coding sequence (FAK+, boxes 28, 6, and 7) are all highly expressed in the nervous tissue. This may be linked to the preferential inclusion of small exons which has been suggested to occur during mRNA splicing in brain (31Black D.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 795-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, among the other tissues examined only testis contained high amounts of FAK+ (data not shown) and box 7 (this study). An important consequence of the existence of isoforms with differences in the coding region, is that they may provide neuronal FAK with specific properties. We found that FAK and FAK+ were indistinguishable concerning their amount of tyrosine phosphorylation, their autophosphorylation, and their interactions with Src and Fyn. This is perhaps not surprising since the Pro-Trp-Arg insertion of FAK+ is located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, at a distance in the primary sequence from the kinase domain and the autophosphorylation site. In contrast, we found that the presence of boxes 6 and 7 which are located on either side of the autophosphorylated tyrosine, affected dramatically the tyrosine phosphorylation in cells and in immune precipitates. Using a site- and phosphorylation-specific antibody, we could show that the increased phosphorylation of FAK+6,7 could be accounted for, at least in part, by an increased phosphorylation of Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site. Boxes 6 and 7 were always found associated in striatal cDNAs and we do not know whether one, or the other, or the combination of the two is responsible for the observed effect. On the other hand, the presence of box 28, located amino-terminal of box 6, did not alter the autophosphorylation rate.Work from several laboratories has shown that autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 is a critical aspect of its regulation and function, since it is responsible for the binding of Src family kinases (6Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 7Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, although in vitro FAK is able to phosphorylate several proteins, including paxillin and p130 cas, these are also substrates for Src which may be responsible for their phosphorylation in cells (see Refs. 4Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar and5Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that FAK may function as an adaptor regulated by autophosphorylation, rather than as a protein kinase active on different substrates. Thus, an increased ability to autophosphorylate, provided by alternative splicing, could have important functional consequences. For instance, it could increase the phosphorylation of FAK in cells which express FAK6,7 in response to integrin engagement or stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. It may thus play a role in the high responsiveness of FAK in hippocampus to neurotransmitters or lipid messengers (18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our studies of FAK isoforms gave important negative results concerning their interactions with Src family kinases. The presence of insertions did not alter the interaction of FAK with these kinases, at least in transfected COS 7 cells. Moreover we did not observe a preferential association of any of the isoforms of FAK with c-Src, n-Src, or Fyn.One possible functional consequence of increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is suggested by knock out experiments which have revealed that FAK is more important for the turnover of focal adhesions than for their formation (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Interestingly, growth cones of neurons in culture do not have real focal adhesions, but display smaller structures, termed point contacts, which may be related to the high mobility of neuritic extensions (32Arregui C.O. Carbonetto S. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6967-6977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether the isoforms of FAK with a higher capacity to autophosphorylate are associated with these adhesion structures, which may have a high reversibility. It is striking that point contacts are also observed in transformed cells in which they may be related to an increased mobility or invasiveness (32Arregui C.O. Carbonetto S. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6967-6977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since a high degree of FAK expression in malignant cells may be related to their invasiveness or their ability to create metastasis (33Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1996; 1287: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that the expression of splice variants of FAK in such cells could have important consequences on these characteristics.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). The importance of FAK is attested by the embryonic lethality of the knock out of its gene (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). FAK is thought to have various functions ranging from the regulation of focal adhesions turnover to the prevention of anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by the detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix (12Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). FAK is highly expressed in the nervous tissue during development, a period at which it is enriched in neuronal growth cones (13Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Stevens G.R. Zhang C. Berg M.M. Lambert M.P. Barber K. Cantallops I. Routtenberg A. Klein W.L. J. Neurosci.

In the brain of adult rats, FAK is expressed at higher levels than in most other tissues, especially in neurons of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (13Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brain, the major form of FAK is a splice variant termed FAK+, which contains a 3-amino acid insertion (Pro-Trp-Arg) at position 904 (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In rat hippocampal slices, FAK+ phosphorylation is strongly stimulated by several neurotransmitters, including glutamate (19Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and acetylcholine, 2P. Derkinderen, J. C. Sicilians, M. Toutant, and J.-A.

Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidic acid.2 The sensitivity of FAK+ phosphorylation to neurotransmitters suggests that FAK+ transduces information generated by neuronal activity into phosphorylation of proteins, possibly resulting in changes in ion channel properties, cytoskeletal organization, or gene expression. Thus, FAK may be critical for the suggested role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in synaptic plasticity (20O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 21Boxall A.R. Lancaster B. Garthwaite J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 805-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that FAK phosphorylation is decreased in Fyn knock out mice (16Grant S.G.N. Karl K.A. Kiebler M.A. Kandel E.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) which display anomalous hippocampal development and long term potentiation (20O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 22Kojima N. Wang J. Mansuy I.M. Grant S.G.N. Mayford M. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As an approach to better understand the function of FAK in neurons, we have examined the biochemical properties of this kinase in rat brain. We show that the slightly larger size of FAK in brain as compared with other tissues, can be accounted for by the presence of additional exons surrounding the autophosphorylated tyrosine. The presence of two of these exons resulted in an increased autophosphorylation activity. DISCUSSIONThis study underlines the complexity of FAK structure and processing. Although it appears to be coded by a single gene, a number of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms generate multiple isoforms of FAK mRNA and protein. Two different polyadenylation sites and two different 5′ ends were found in rat, corresponding to those described in chick and mouse, respectively (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A very short alternative exon, coding for 3 amino acids defining FAK+, is found in rat, mouse (17Burgaya F. Girault J.-A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), human (28Whitney G.S. Chan P.-Y. Blake J. Cosand W.L. Neubauer M.G. Aruffo A. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Xenopus(26Hens M.D. DeSimone D.W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A short form of FAK, called FAK-related non-kinase has been described in chick (29Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and may also exist in human (30André E. Becker-André M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that 3 additional exons can be found in rat and mouse FAK, corresponding to the region of the protein which surrounds the autophosphorylation site, at the junction between the amino-terminal and the catalytic domains of FAK. At least two of these exons (boxes 6 and 7) have been highly conserved during evolution, since they exist also in Xenopus (26Hens M.D. DeSimone D.W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Assuming that all these variations of FAK mRNAs occur independently from the others, at least 512 different mRNAs coding for 64 different forms of full-length FAK protein could exist. This calculation does not take into account the short gene product FAK-related non-kinase and the possible additional exons which have been reported in human cDNAs (30André E. Becker-André M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that not all combinations are expressed at significant levels, the wealth of potential isoforms, many of which, and perhaps all, have been highly conserved during evolution, provide a mechanism by which FAK expression and properties could be finely tuned.It is noteworthy that exons which give rise to changes in the coding sequence (FAK+, boxes 28, 6, and 7) are all highly expressed in the nervous tissue. This may be linked to the preferential inclusion of small exons which has been suggested to occur during mRNA splicing in brain (31Black D.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 795-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, among the other tissues examined only testis contained high amounts of FAK+ (data not shown) and box 7 (this study). An important consequence of the existence of isoforms with differences in the coding region, is that they may provide neuronal FAK with specific properties. We found that FAK and FAK+ were indistinguishable concerning their amount of tyrosine phosphorylation, their autophosphorylation, and their interactions with Src and Fyn. This is perhaps not surprising since the Pro-Trp-Arg insertion of FAK+ is located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, at a distance in the primary sequence from the kinase domain and the autophosphorylation site. In contrast, we found that the presence of boxes 6 and 7 which are located on either side of the autophosphorylated tyrosine, affected dramatically the tyrosine phosphorylation in cells and in immune precipitates. Using a site- and phosphorylation-specific antibody, we could show that the increased phosphorylation of FAK+6,7 could be accounted for, at least in part, by an increased phosphorylation of Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site. Boxes 6 and 7 were always found associated in striatal cDNAs and we do not know whether one, or the other, or the combination of the two is responsible for the observed effect. On the other hand, the presence of box 28, located amino-terminal of box 6, did not alter the autophosphorylation rate.Work from several laboratories has shown that autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 is a critical aspect of its regulation and function, since it is responsible for the binding of Src family kinases (6Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 7Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, although in vitro FAK is able to phosphorylate several proteins, including paxillin and p130 cas, these are also substrates for Src which may be responsible for their phosphorylation in cells (see Refs. 4Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar and5Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that FAK may function as an adaptor regulated by autophosphorylation, rather than as a protein kinase active on different substrates. Thus, an increased ability to autophosphorylate, provided by alternative splicing, could have important functional consequences. For instance, it could increase the phosphorylation of FAK in cells which express FAK6,7 in response to integrin engagement or stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. It may thus play a role in the high responsiveness of FAK in hippocampus to neurotransmitters or lipid messengers (18Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. De Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our studies of FAK isoforms gave important negative results concerning their interactions with Src family kinases. The presence of insertions did not alter the interaction of FAK with these kinases, at least in transfected COS 7 cells. Moreover we did not observe a preferential association of any of the isoforms of FAK with c-Src, n-Src, or Fyn.One possible functional consequence of increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is suggested by knock out experiments which have revealed that FAK is more important for the turnover of focal adhesions than for their formation (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Interestingly, growth cones of neurons in culture do not have real focal adhesions, but display smaller structures, termed point contacts, which may be related to the high mobility of neuritic extensions (32Arregui C.O. Carbonetto S. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6967-6977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether the isoforms of FAK with a higher capacity to autophosphorylate are associated with these adhesion structures, which may have a high reversibility. It is striking that point contacts are also observed in transformed cells in which they may be related to an increased mobility or invasiveness (32Arregui C.O. Carbonetto S. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6967-6977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since a high degree of FAK expression in malignant cells may be related to their invasiveness or their ability to create metastasis (33Malik R.K. Parsons J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1996; 1287: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that the expression of splice variants of FAK in such cells could have important consequences on these characteristics.

Not only may some PKC isoforms be active and others not for a given response, but the actions of different isoforms may even be antagonistic. In NIH 3T3 cells, for example, PKCδ arrests cell growth whereas PKCε stimulates it. To probe the contribution of the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKC isozymes to isozyme-specific responses, we prepared chimeras between the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε. These chimeras, which preserve the overall structure of the native PKC enzymes, were stably expressed in mouse fibroblasts. A major objective was to characterize the growth properties of the cells that overexpress the various PKC constructs. Our data demonstrate that both the regulatory and the catalytic domains play roles in cell proliferation. The regulatory domain of PKCε enhanced cell growth in the absence or presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and, in the presence of PMA, all chimeras with the PKCε regulatory domain also gave rise to colonies in soft agar; the role of the catalytic domain of PKCε was evident in the PMA-treated cells that overexpressed the PKC chimera containing the δ regulatory and the ε catalytic domains (PKCδ/ε). The important contribution of the PKCε catalytic domain to the growth of PKCδ/ε-expressing cells was also evident in terms of a significantly increased saturation density in the presence of PMA, their formation of foci upon PMA treatment, and the induction of anchorage-independent growth. Aside from the growth-promoting effect of PKCε, we have shown that most chimeras with PKCα and -δ regulatory domains inhibit cell growth. These results underscore the complex contributions of the regulatory and catalytic domains to the overall behavior of PKC.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The complexity of the PKC pathway is clearly shown by the fact that PKC represents at least 11 isozymes with different patterns of tissue expression, subcellular localization and cofactor requirements as well as functional diversity (3Ohno S. Akita Y. Hata A. Osada S. Kubo K. Konno Y. Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Saido T. Kuroki T. Suzuki K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Liyanage M. Frith D. Livneh E. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In all cases, the PKC isozymes consist of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain has serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity. In the “classical” (α, βI, βII, γ) and “novel” (δ, ε, η, θ) PKC isozymes, the regulatory domain is thought to inhibit this catalytic activity through a so-called pseudosubstrate region near its N terminus. Adjacent to this pseudosubstrate region is a pair of highly conserved zinc finger structures, which represent the phorbol ester binding domain and which contribute to the interaction with an essential cofactor, anionic phospholipid (5Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator, and its ultrapotent analogs, the phorbol esters, act as hydrophobic switches upon binding (6Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H.

Not only do the various isozymes show considerable diversity in their structures and regulatory properties, but they have been shown to exhibit different biological effects (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 8Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PKCα and -ε were shown to inhibit phospholipase C activity (9Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCβ and -ε were proven to link the mast cell high affinity receptor for IgE to the expression of c-fos and c-jun (10Razin E. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7722-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKCδ and -α participate in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced myeloid differentiation in 32D cells (11Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to the current study, PKCδ and -ε have been shown by several groups to be involved in arresting or stimulating cell growth, respectively. PKCδ was shown to decrease cell growth, reduce cell density at confluence and not to permit anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (12Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to cause growth arrest in G2/M phase of the cell cycle in Chinese hamster ovary cells (13Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that, in rat fibroblasts that overexpress the c-srcproto-oncogene, the tumor-promoting effect of phorbol esters is due to depletion of PKCδ, further supporting its tumor suppressor function (14Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PKCε leads to increased cell growth, increased cell density at confluence, and induction of anchorage-independent growth in NIH 3T3 and rat fibroblasts (12Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol.

Overexpression of PKCε in these cells also renders them tumorigenic in nude mice (12Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). Against this background, it is crucial to emphasize that the effect of PKC isozymes is greatly influenced by the host cell; PKCδ enhances tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells and may thus promote tumor progression in that system (16.Kiley, S., Goodnough, M., Clark, K., Welch, D., and Jaken, S. (1997)Abstracts of the 88th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, San Diego, CA, April 12–16, 1997 (Abst. 2500).Google Scholar). This cell type-specific function also holds for the PKCα and -βII isotypes, which play distinct roles in the transduction of proliferative and differentiating signals in K-562 erythroleukemia cells; PKCα inhibits whereas PKCβII promotes cell growth (17Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using the R6 rat embryo fibroblast cell line (18Borner C. Ueffing M. Jaken S. Parker P.J. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 78-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PKCα, like PKCδ, enhances the growth rate of breast cancer cells making them display a more aggressive neoplastic phenotype (19Ways D.K. Kukoly C.A. deVente J. Hooker J.L. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Fletcher D.J. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The fact that PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε cause opposite effects in stimulating and inhibiting cell growth makes them attractive targets for antitumor drug development. To probe the contribution of the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKC isozymes to isozyme-specific responses, we prepared reciprocal chimeras between the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε, combined at the highly conserved hinge region. We describe here the effects caused by overexpression of these chimeric enzymes on cell growth of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We found that both the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKC contributed to the isotype-specific effects on cell growth. Protein kinase C chimeras were generated by swapping the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε. The construction of the chimeric proteins is detailed elsewhere (20Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the regulatory and the catalytic domains of PKCα, -δ, and -ε were amplified separately by polymerase chain reaction employing high fidelity thermostable Vent™ DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). To avoid mutations, in addition to using high fidelity enzymes, we kept the number of polymerase chain reaction cycles low (eight cycles). Into the inner primers we introduced a unique restriction site (SpeI) for subsequent cloning steps. Using the pGEM-T vector as a shuttle vector, we amplified the different PKC domains separately by transforming them into bacteria, then subcloning the regulatory domains into the vectors that contained the catalytic domains usingSpeI and MluI restriction enzymes. An important advantage of this approach is that we could reconstruct the wild type PKCα, -δ, and -ε using the same inserts as for the chimeras providing us with wild type controls constructed the same way as the chimeras. The chimeras along with the wild type PKC isozymes were subcloned into an epitope tagging mammalian expression vector described in detail by Olah et al. (21Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The XhoI andMluI sites ensure unidirectionality, and the vector attaches to the end of the proteins a C-terminal 12-amino acid tag, originally derived from the C-terminal sequence of PKCε. Our constructs were sequenced by Paragon Biotech Inc. (Baltimore, MD) to verify that no mutations had been introduced. The chimeras were designated as PKCx/y, where x and y refer to the regulatory and the catalytic domains, respectively. Thus, PKCα/δ, for example, refers to the chimera between the α regulatory domain and the δ catalytic domain. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD), and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (complete DMEM). The cells were transfected with either the empty vector or the different PKC expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were subsequently grown in selection medium containing 750 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 12–18 days in selection medium, single colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for the presence of different PKC chimeras by Western blot analysis. Where indicated, cells were treated with 30 nm PMA (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) every other day for the duration of the experiment; likewise, where indicated, PDGF (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to a 100 ng/ml final concentration after overnight serum starvation. The cells were harvested into 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm leupeptin and lysed by sonication. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S solution in 5% acetic acid (Sigma) for determining the protein content of individual lanes. The protein staining was found to be linear up to 30 μg of protein/lane. The Ponceau S staining was removed by several washes of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4); the membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently immunostained with antibodies generated against the C terminus (PKCδ amino acids 662–673) of PKCδ (Research & Diagnostics Antibodies, Berkeley, CA), the C terminus of PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 726–737 of PKCε (Life Technologies, Inc.). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham). 104 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates in triplicate in complete DMEM in the presence or absence of 30 nm PMA (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) and increasing concentrations (0.1 nm-1000 nm) of the catalytic site-directed PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) (LC Laboratories). Fresh medium was added every other day, and cells in triplicate wells were harvested every second day by trypsinization and counted in a Coulter counter. To determine the average doubling time, cells were plated the same way, but cells were trypsinized and counted every 24 h for 7 consecutive days. The average doubling time was calculated by using the 24-h time point as the starting point to avoid artifacts due to the initial lag period after plating (12Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the maximal cell density, cells were grown in 12-well plates to confluence and kept postconfluent for 3 additional days with daily medium changes. Cells were counted as described above. 105 cells were resuspended in complete DMEM containing 0.4% Noble agar (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 30 nm PMA and were overlaid above a layer of 0.6% Noble agar in complete DMEM. The cells were fed every fifth day by overlaying the agar with 2 ml of complete medium containing the appropriate amount of PMA. The presence or absence of colonies was scored after 14 days. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that overexpressed the PKC chimeras were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped from a 60-mm dish into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EGTA. After mixing, the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and preabsorbed with 25 μl of Protein A/G-Sepharose (50%) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 10 min; the samples were then spun at 4 °C for 3 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatants were taken for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by rotating the samples overnight with 30 μl of Protein A/G-Sepharose (50%) and 4 μg/ml anti-PKCε antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C. The samples were spun at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 min and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate. The pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Before SDS-PAGE, samples were centrifuged again as described above and the entire supernatants were subjected to Western blotting and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (monoclonal IgG2bk) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-PKCε antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.). We constructed reciprocal chimeras from N-terminal and C-terminal halves of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε to study the relative contributions of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of these isozymes. We chose the first part of the highly conserved C3 region for the exchange, since the function of this region is well known and the sequence is identical in all the different isozymes (23Mischak H. Bodenteich A. Kolch W. Goodnight J. Hofer F. Mushinski J.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 7925-7931Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We engineered the constructs in a way that allowed us to make wild type PKC isozymes the same way as the chimeric constructs, thus providing us with proper positive controls. Having the PKCε tag on our chimeras allowed better detection in Western blotting and a good epitope for immunoprecipitation. First, we determined whether our isozymes can be stably expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. For this purpose, cells were stably transfected with “wild type” PKCα/α, -δ/δ, -ε/ε and the chimeras PKCα/δ, -α/ε, -δ/α, -δ/ε, -ε/α, and -ε/δ (Fig.1). To assess the level of protein production, total cellular protein was collected from five individual antibiotic resistant clones of cells that overexpressed each isozyme and also from five vector-only control cell lines, and they were examined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-PKCα antibodies or polyclonal anti-PKCδ or anti-PKCε antibodies. The antibodies recognized the two previously described PKCε-specific bands at 90 and 93 kDa (15Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar) of the overexpressed PKCε. As we have described (20Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), PKCα/ε and PKCδ/ε chimeras also showed double bands on Western blots, suggesting that the PKCε catalytic domain underwent posttranslational phosphorylation similar to the wild type. At the same time, PKCε/δ and -ε/α chimeras showed a single band on Western blots, suggesting that this posttranslational modification of PKCε occurs only on the catalytic domain. These data are consistent with the PKC chimeras being expressed and processed in a fashion similar to the parental PKC isoforms. To establish that the overexpressed PKC chimeras were functionally intact, i.e. display kinase activity and bind phorbol ester, we assayed in vitro kinase activity and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding on partially purified cell lysates. All overexpresser cells exhibited increased phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding and kinase activity as compared with the control cells transfected with the empty vector, as reported elsewhere (20Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The localization and translocation patterns of the various chimeras are reported separately (20Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All the chimeras are found predominantly in the soluble fraction, and they all translocate upon PMA treatment. PMA-induced translocation and targeting of the enzymes are influenced by the catalytic domain as well as by the regulatory domain (20Acs P. Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A major objective was to characterize the growth properties of the cells that overexpressed the various PKC constructs. Consistent with previous reports (12Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.M. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our cells that overexpressed PKCα/α and PKCδ/δ proliferated significantly more slowly than the control cells, whereas cells that overexpressed PKCε/ε had a significantly higher rate of growth. Table I shows the values for the doubling time both in the presence and absence of PMA (n = 3 experiments). In the absence of PMA chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCα grew significantly more slowly than the control cells (cells transfected with the empty vector), whereas those that contained the regulatory domain of PKCε had a higher growth rate. It is important to note, however, that the catalytic domain also influenced the growth behavior of the chimeras. Thus, cells that expressed PKCα/ε grew fastest of those that expressed PKCα/y chimeras and, reciprocally, cells that expressed PKCε/α grew most slowly of the PKCε/ychimeras. Treatment with 30 nm PMA enhanced the difference between cells expressing the different isozymes. This is evident both upon microscopic examination (Fig. 2) and from growth curves (Fig. 3). This concentration of PMA activates PKC but does not cause down-regulation of the enzyme, as revealed by Western blotting (data not shown). The doubling times of the cells that overexpressed chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCε were shorter than that of the control cells (demonstrated in Fig. 3 A). We obtained similar data by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into these cells with and without PMA treatment (data not shown). The effects of the chimeras on cell density at confluence were most evident in the presence of PMA (Table I). Cells expressing PKCε/ε and -δ/ε chimeras grew to the highest cell density, with the former achieving nearly twice the saturation density of the control. At the same time cells expressing PKCε/α and -ε/δ chimeras saturated at levels closer to the control cells (demonstrated in Fig.3 B). Overexpression of all three chimeras that contained the PKCε regulatory domain as well as the PKCδ/ε chimera enabled the cells to grow and form colonies in soft agar. We observed this anchorage-independent growth only in the presence of 30 nmPMA (Table I).Table IProliferation characteristics of NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress PKC constructsDoubling timeSaturation densityGrowth in soft agar−PMA+PMA−PMA+PMA−PMA+PMAh× 10 5∼coloniesControl19.8 ± 1.225.4 ± 0.812.4 ± 0.411.2 ± 0.800PKCα/α26.2 ± 2.0*42.7 ± 2.8**10.1 ± 1.24.1 ± 0.6**00PKCα/δ28.5 ± 1.6*40.8 ± 5.2*11.3 ± 0.74.3 ± 0.8**00PKCα/ε25.5 ± 3.234.9 ± 4.712.2 ± 1.27.3 ± 1.2*00PKCδ/α26.4 ± 2.3*37.6 ± 3.1*11.8 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.5*00PKCδ/δ25.4 ± 1.839.4 ± 2.8**12.2 ± 0.47.0 ± 0.6**00PKCδ/ε21.3 ± 2.323.6 ± 1.412.8 ± 1.314.7 ± 1.40250PKCε/α18.1 ± 1.422.2 ± 1.812.6 ± 0.610.3 ± 1.80210PKCε/δ16.8 ± 1.121.8 ± 0.9*12.4 ± 0.812.9 ± 1.10300PKCε/ε14.6 ± 1.0*18.1 ± 1.4**12.8 ± 0.620.1 ± 1.4**0520Control (only bearing the empty vector) NIH 3T3 cells and overexpressers were treated with 30 nm PMA, and the doubling time and the maximal cell number at saturation were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments with six determinations of the values in each experiment.

To confirm that the growth alterations observed in these cells were due to the presence of overexpressed PKC isozymes, we examined the effect of an inhibitor of PKC catalytic activity, GF 109203X. Administering increasing concentrations of GF 109203X, we could reverse the effect of the overexpressed proteins in the presence of PMA, consistent with the central role of PKC in these processes (Fig.4). Furthermore, cells that overexpressed PKCε/ε and the PKCδ/ε chimera formed dense foci and were not contact inhibited. This effect was also blocked by GF 109203X (data not shown). PKCδ has been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with PDGF (25Li W. Yu J. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which domain is involved in this process, we starved the PKC-overexpressing cells overnight and then treated them with 100 ng/ml PDGF. After immunoprecipitation and Western blotting we probed the membranes with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PKCδ/δ, PKCδ/α, and PKCδ/ε were tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.5), whereas PKCα/α, -ε/ε, -ε/δ, and -α/δ were not (data not shown). This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ upon PDGF treatment occurred exclusively when the PKCδ regulatory domain is present, and it is independent of the catalytic domain. The protein kinase C molecule consists of two functional domains; an N-terminal regulatory domain that binds phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol and, in the case of the classic isozymes, calcium; and a C-terminal catalytic domain that contains the catalytic center of the enzyme (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 8Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Individual domains of protein kinase C or mutants that are truncated or deleted have been used to examine the functions of different regions of PKC (26Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol."

This T4-encoded nuclease is sufficient for phage DNA synthesis because wild type T4 does not require host enzymes for processing of RNA primers (2Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Escherichia coli polymerase I and RNase HI can substitute to some extent if T4 RNase H is deleted, but replication is slower and less accurate in the absence of the T4 enzyme (2Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The 5′- to 3′-nuclease of T4 RNase H degrades both RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes, releasing short oligonucleotide products from the 5′-end. In the accompanying paper (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) we have shown that T4 RNase H continues to degrade double-stranded DNA until it reaches 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end. Although T4 RNase H by itself is a nonprocessive exonuclease, the rate and processivity of the nuclease reaction are increased by the T4 gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. At the T4 DNA replication fork, single-stranded DNA is covered with the gene 32 protein; hence, T4 RNase H must be acting as a processive exonuclease, removing the RNA primer and some adjacent DNA. Our recent results indicate that this nuclease performs only one round of processive degradation during each lagging strand cycle, removing 10–50 nucleotides before polymerase elongates the next Okazaki fragment creating a nick sealed by ligase. 1M. Bhagwat and N. J. Nossal, in preparation. 1M. Bhagwat and N. J. Nossal, in preparation.T4 RNase H also has a flap endonuclease activity, which cuts preferentially near the junction of the single- and double-stranded DNA of the flap or fork structures removing the 5′-single-stranded tail (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This endonuclease activity of T4 RNase H is inhibited by the gene 32 protein. The rates of the 5′- to 3′-nuclease and flap endonuclease reactions are similar. However, in the absence of Mg2+ions, T4 RNase H binds 100 times better to flap and fork structures than to double-stranded or nicked DNA (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).T4 RNase H is a member of the RAD2 family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication and repair nucleases (Fig.1 A). Like T4 RNase H, many of these enzymes are 5′-nucleases that remove primers initiating lagging strand fragments. These include the bacteriophage T5 D15 and T7 gene 6 exonucleases, the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease domains of DNA polymerases from bacteria such as E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and Thermus aquatics(Taq), and the eukaryotic nucleases such as murine FEN 2The abbreviations used are: FEN, flapendonuclease; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. 2The abbreviations used are: FEN, flapendonuclease; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride.-1 and human RAD2 analog (also called MF-1 or FEN-1) (for review, see Ref. 4Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All of these 5′- to 3′-nucleases degrade DNA·DNA and RNA·DNA duplexes to short oligonucleotide products. Many of these proteins have also been shown to possess a flap endonuclease activity (5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 6Lyamichev V.

Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These 5′-nucleases have sequence similarity to the larger repair proteins such as human XPG (bottom sequence, Fig. 1 A). In this figure, the highly conserved residues are marked in red, and the moderately conserved residues are marked in green. Sequence alignments for additional members of this family can be found in Ref. 4Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar.The crystal structure of T4 RNase H, in the absence of DNA, has been solved (4Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B, left panel). The proposed active site (Fig. 1 B, right panel) contains 2 Mg2+ ions separated by approximately 7 Å and a number of conserved amino acids. The first Mg2+ ion (Mg2+-1) is coordinated directly to Asp132 and through water molecules to Asp19, Asp71, and Asp155. The second Mg2+ ion (Mg2+-2) is coordinated through water molecules to Asp157, Asp200, and Tyr86. The hydroxyl side chain of Tyr86 as well as that of Ser153, which is near Asp19, are involved in the hydrogen bonding network surrounding the Mg2+ ions. The crystal structure shows a disordered region from residues 89 to 97, containing a number of positively charged residues. It has been proposed that this region is involved in DNA binding (4Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Two different mechanisms have been proposed for E. coliRNase H, which also acts on RNA·DNA duplexes: a one-metal mechanism based on that for DNase I (8Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katyanagi K. Morikawa K. Miyashiro H. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11535-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and a two-metal mechanism based on that for the 3′- to 5′-exonuclease of polymerase I (10Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In the one-metal mechanism, an active site acidic amino acid acts as a nucleophile and abstracts a proton from a water molecule to create a hydroxyl ion that attacks the phosphodiester bond. The pentavalent species formed during the transition state is stabilized by the Mg2+ ion. In the two-metal mechanism, one of the bound Mg2+ ions promotes the formation of the hydroxyl ion that attacks the scissile phosphodiester bond. The second Mg2+ion serves to stabilize the oxyanion leaving group and also to stabilize the pentavalent species formed during the transition state. In 3′- to 5′-exonuclease of polymerase I, the divalent metal ions are 3.9 Å apart (11Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). T4 RNase H does contain two Mg2+ ions, but they are separated by 7 Å, which is far apart for the two-metal mechanism. However, the crystal structure was solved in the absence of DNA, and it is possible that when DNA is bound, there may be a substantial rearrangement bringing the ions closer.What is the mechanism of the nuclease activity of T4 RNase H? To address this question, we have made three kinds of mutants of T4 RNase H based on the possible roles of the amino acid residues (Fig.1 B): mutants of the acidic residues surrounding the Mg2+ ions, mutants of the residues with hydroxyl side chains that are involved in the hydrogen bonding network, and mutants of the residues that may be involved in DNA binding. In this paper, we report the effects of these mutations on the exonuclease activity, the flap endonuclease activity, and on binding to DNA. The implications of these results on the possible roles of the two Mg2+ ions and the active site residues are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless otherwise indicated, the materials and methods are those described in the accompanying paper (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Site-directed MutagenesisThe mutants D71N, K87A, Y86F, and R90A were prepared by the overlap extension method (12Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid pNN2202 (encoding the wild type T4 RNase H) (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by pfu DNA polymerase from the PshAI site to the NsiI site using two end primers, GGATGAAGATTACAAAGAAGGAATCTGC and CCCATTTCTTATGCATCGGAGACCATTGC, and two complementary mutagenic primers (mutant codon in bold), D71N (CTGTGTATTAATAACGCGAAATCT and CAGATTTCGCGTTATTAATACACAG), K87A (CGCTTATTATTATGCTAAAAACCGTGGAAAAGCAC and GTGCTTTTCCACGGTTTTTAGCATAATAATAAGCG), Y86F (CGCTTATTATTTTAAGAAAAACCGTGG and CCACGGTTTTTCTTAAAATAATAAGCG), R90A (CGCTTATTATTATAAGAAAAACGCTGGAAAAGCACGAG and CTCGTGCTTTTCCAGCGTTTTTCTTATAATAATAAGCG).Each amplification reaction was carried out using 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation phase at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified products were purified from an agarose gel using the Qiaquick kit (QIAGEN). The final amplified product was cut with PshAI andNsiI and then ligated into pNN2202 that had been cut with the same enzymes. The DNA was transformed into E. coliMV1190 (13Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar), and the entire amplified DNA was sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 to confirm the mutation and to make sure that no other mistakes were introduced by the pfu DNA polymerase.The D132N and S153A mutants were prepared by cutting the plasmid pNN2202 with HindIII and BsaBI or withBsaBI and NsiI, respectively, and inserting the oligonucleotides containing the respective mutation. The mutant sequences were confirmed by sequencing the DNA between the appropriate sites.The mutants D19N, D155N, D157N, D200A, and D200N were made from pVC1109 (wild type T4 RNase H (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) single-stranded DNA by the Kunkel method (14Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar), modified by using the T4 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins in addition to T4 DNA polymerase to copy the single-stranded DNA template. Mutants were identified by sequencing using Sequenase 2.0.Purification of the Mutant ProteinsAll of the plasmids, except the one with D71N mutation, were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) for expression of the mutant T4 RNase H proteins, as described for the wild type protein (16Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the plasmid with D71N mutation could not be transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, the D71N mutant protein was purified fromE. coli MV1190 carrying the appropriate plasmid by infecting with M13mGP1–2, encoding T7 RNA polymerase, as described (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mutant proteins except D155N and D200A were expressed well and were soluble. There was enough soluble protein to purify the D155N but not the D200A mutant protein. The mutant proteins were partially purified using Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose resin. All purification steps were performed at 4–8 °C. The cell paste from 100 ml of culture was suspended in 5 or 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm AEBSF). The cell extract was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was then diluted with 2 volumes of PC buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm AEBSF). Phosphocellulose resin (2 ml, 1:1 suspension), equilibrated in PC buffer, was added, and the mixture was rotated slowly for 1 h to allow binding of T4 RNase H to the resin. The resin was collected by centrifugation, and loosely bound proteins were removed by washing the resin with PC buffer containing 50 mm KCl. The resin was then transferred to a small column and washed successively with PC buffer (1 ml) containing 0.1m KCl, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.5 m KCl. T4 RNase H was eluted in the 0.3 m KCl and 0.5 mKCl fractions. The purity of the proteins was checked using a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex), stained with Coomassie Blue. The concentrations of the proteins for the assay were estimated by comparison of the band intensities of mutant proteins with those of the known concentrations of highly purified wild type T4 RNase H protein, visually or using the dv1 program and a Desktop Plus scanner from PDI, Inc.Nuclease ActivityThe 5′- to 3′-nuclease activity was assayed at 30 °C using a DNA 34-mer annealed to M13 single-stranded DNA, and the flap endonuclease activity was assayed using a synthetic oligonucleotide flap DNA structure, as described in the accompanying paper (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To study the effect of temperature on the activity, degradation of the 34-mer·M13 was measured at room temperature and at 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C for 1 min. To study the stability of the wild type and the mutant proteins, the proteins were diluted as described (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and incubated at 45 °C for 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 min. The nuclease reaction mixture containing the 34-mer·M13 substrate was preincubated at 45 °C for 2 min. The reaction of the preincubated protein with the preincubated substrate was performed at 45 °C for 1 min. The products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide and 7 m urea (19:1) gels and exposed to XAR or BMR film. The films were scanned and the products quantitated using the dv1 program from PDI, Inc.DNA BindingBinding of the flap DNA structure by the wild type and mutant proteins was measured with a gel mobility shift assay, as described (3Bhagwat M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo determine the amino acids important for the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond by T4 RNase H, we selected residues for mutation based on the crystal structure of T4 RNase H (4Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and its sequence similarity to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleases (Fig.1 A). As indicated in the Introduction, the proposed active site contains two Mg2+ ions surrounded by a number of conserved acidic amino acids (Mg2+-1: Asp19, Asp71, Asp132, and Asp155; Mg2+-2: Asp157 and Asp200). We mutated each one of these aspartates individually to aspargine and in addition, Asp200 to alanine. We also mutated two residues with hydroxyl side chains, Tyr86 and Ser153, to phenylalanine and alanine, respectively. In addition, we made mutants of residues close to (K87A) or within (R90A) the disordered region to study the possible roles of these amino acids in binding to DNA.Purification of Mutant T4 RNase HWe partially purified all of the mutant proteins and characterized the effects of each mutation on the nuclease activities of T4 RNase H and on its binding to DNA. The mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and the proteins expressed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” They were partially purified by chromatography on phosphocellulose. The 0.5m KCl step elution fraction, which contained fewer contaminating proteins than the 0.3 m KCl fraction, was used for the nuclease and DNA binding assays. Fig.2 is an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of fractions of the Y86F and K87A mutant proteins. Similar purification was achieved with all other mutant proteins (data not shown). The activities of the partially purified wild type and mutant T4 RNase H were compared with corresponding fractions from cells with the vector plasmid and with highly purified wild type protein. The partially purified wild type enzyme showed activity similar to that of homogeneous T4 RNase H, except for some contaminating 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity (see Fig.4).Figure 2Partial purification of wild type and representative mutant T4 RNase H proteins.

T4 RNase H cuts this flap DNA preferentially near the junction of single- and double-stranded DNA giving predominantly 19-mer and 21-mer products. Smaller products resulting from the contaminating 3′- to 5′-exonuclease in the partially purified proteins are evident at longer times and with higher enzyme concentrations. The approximate protein concentrations for Arepresented by triangles were: wild type, 30 and 3 nm; D19N, 7 and 0.7 nm; D155N, 3.5 and 0.35 nm; D157N, 30, 5, and 0.5 nm; and D200N, 15, 5, and 0.5 nm. In other experiments, the D19N and D155N mutant proteins showed no flap endonuclease activity at a concentration of 35 nm (data not shown). The protein concentrations inB were approximately 40 and 4 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Exonuclease Activity of the Mutant ProteinsT4 RNase H cuts double-stranded DNA from the 5′-end and releases short oligonucleotides until it reaches 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end (3Bhagwat M.

Fig.3 shows the products of the reactions of the wild type and mutant T4 RNase H proteins with the 5′-end-labeled 34-mer annealed to M13 circular DNA. This assay shows the size of the short oligonucleotide products released at the first cut from the 5′-end. The mutants D19N, D155N, D71N, K87A, and D132N lost their nuclease activity; D200N and Y86F had activity equal to or close to that of the wild type; and D157N, R90A, and S153A had reduced activity. Because all of these mutants (except K87A) retained flap DNA binding activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme (see Fig. 5), it is likely that they are properly folded.Figure 3Exonuclease activity of the wild type and mutant T4 RNase H. The substrate (5′-end-labeled 34-mer DNA annealed to M13, 1 nm) was treated with wild type or mutant T4 RNase H proteins at 30 °C for the indicated time periods. The approximate concentrations of the proteins, represented bylarge and small rectangles, respectively, were 35 and 7 nm in the left and the middle panels. In the right panel, the large andsmall rectangles represent protein concentrations of approximately 35 and 3.5 nm, respectively.

The reactions were loaded on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Novex).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the D200N mutant protein maintained the exonuclease activity, the size distribution of its products differed from that of the wild type enzyme. Wild type T4 RNase H released dinucleotides and trinucleotides as the major products in about equal amounts at 30 °C, whereas the D157N and D200N mutant proteins released more dinucleotides than trinucleotides under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 3).Flap Endonuclease Activity of the Mutant ProteinsFig.4 shows the products of the reactions of the wild type and the mutants of T4 RNase H with the flap substrate. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to construct this flap substrate are described in the accompanying paper (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Highly purified wild type T4 RNase H cuts the flap substrate near the junction of the single- and double-stranded DNA, releasing the 19-mer and 21-mer oligonucleotides as the major products (3Bhagwat M. Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28523-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of contaminating 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity in the partially purified proteins, the 19-mer and 21-mer oligonucleotide products were partially degraded at higher protein concentrations and at longer time periods. The effects of most of the mutations on the flap endonuclease activity were similar to those on the exonuclease activity. The mutants D19N, D155N, K87A, D132N, and D71N lost their flap endonuclease activity; D200N and Y86F had activity close to or equal to that of the wild type; and D157N, R90A, and S153A have reduced activity (data for S153A not shown). However, relative to the wild type protein, D157N mutant protein retained more flap endonuclease than exonuclease activity.Binding of the Mutant Proteins to the Flap SubstrateWe used a gel mobility shift assay to study the effects of the mutations on binding to the flap substrate. Because T4 RNase H requires Mg2+ for its activity, the binding studies were performed in the absence of Mg2+ to prevent degradation of the DNA substrate. Fig. 5 shows the mobility shift caused by the binding of wild type, Y86F, R90A, and K87A to the flap substrate. The binding of K87A mutant protein was reduced by approximately 50% compared with that of wild type, and the binding of R90A was reduced slightly. All other mutant proteins had DNA binding affinity similar to that of wild type T4 RNase H (data for remaining mutant proteins not shown).Effect of Temperature on the Exonuclease Activities of the Mutant ProteinsThe mutants of the residues coordinated directly or through water molecules to Mg2+-1 completely lost their nuclease activities (D19N, D71N, D132N, and D155N) but still bound to flap DNA. Hence, Mg2+-1 has a catalytic role. In contrast, the mutants of the residues surrounding Mg2+-2 either maintained their activity (D200N and Y86F) or had reduced activity (D157N). To determine whether mutations in residues surrounding Mg2+-2 changed the stability of the enzyme, we first compared the exonuclease activity of the active mutant protein D200N with that of the wild type at various temperatures (Fig.6). The activity of the pure wild type enzyme increased 10 times, and that of D200N increased about 2 times as the reaction temperature was increased from room temperature to 45 °C. Partially purified wild type enzyme showed a similar increase in activity (data not shown). For the wild type and the D200N mutant proteins, the ratio of the trinucleotides to dinucleotides released increased with increasing temperature.Figure 6The size distribution of the oligonucleotide products is different for wild type and D200N mutant T4 RNase H.The substrate, 5′-end-labeled 34-mer DNA annealed to M13 (1 nm) was reacted with pure wild type T4 RNase H and partially purified D200N mutant protein at various temperatures for 1 min. The products were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gels. The ratio of trinucleotide to dinucleotide products and the ratio of total products (trinucleotides plus dinucleotides) at the indicated temperature to that at 25 °C are listed below eachlane. Similar results were obtained for the partially purified wild type protein (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further, we incubated both the wild type and the mutant proteins at 45 °C in the absence of the DNA substrate for various time periods, followed by a 1-min reaction at 45 °C. The results indicate that the D200N and D157N mutant proteins were not more thermolabile than the pure wild type T4 RNase H protein (Fig. 7) or the partially purified wild type T4 RNase H protein (data not shown).Figure 7The D157N and D200N mutant proteins are not thermolabile compared with the wild type (WT) protein.T4 RNase H (mutant or highly purified wild type) was diluted and preincubated at 45 °C for various time periods.

The preincubated enzymes were reacted with the preincubated reaction mixtures at 45 °C for 1 min. Only the products of the reactions are displayed. The concentration of the D157N mutant protein was approximately 100 times that of the wild type (1.4 nm) because of the reduced activity of the mutant protein. Similar results were ob"

Binding sites for both collagen and echovirus 1 have been mapped to the I domain within the α2 subunit of the VLA-2 α2β1 heterodimer. Although murine VLA-2 interacts with collagen, it does not bind virus. We have used isolated human-murine chimeric I domains expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli to identify two groups of amino acids, 199–201 and 212–216, independently involved in virus attachment. These residues are distinct from the metal ion-dependent adhesion site previously demonstrated to be essential for VLA-2 interactions with collagen. Mutations in three metal ion-dependent adhesion site residues that abolish adhesion to collagen had no effect on virus binding. These results confirm that different sites within the I domain are responsible for VLA-2 interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and with viral ligands.

We have used isolated human-murine chimeric I domains expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli to identify two groups of amino acids, 199–201 and 212–216, independently involved in virus attachment. These residues are distinct from the metal ion-dependent adhesion site previously demonstrated to be essential for VLA-2 interactions with collagen. Mutations in three metal ion-dependent adhesion site residues that abolish adhesion to collagen had no effect on virus binding. These results confirm that different sites within the I domain are responsible for VLA-2 interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and with viral ligands. The integrin VLA-2 1The abbreviations used are: VLA, very late antigen; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CR3, complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18, αMβ2, or Mac-1); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAbs, monoclonal antibodies. (CD49b/CD29) mediates cell interactions with the extracellular matrix proteins collagen and laminin (1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human VLA-2 is also the receptor for the human pathogen echovirus 1 (2Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). VLA-2 is a heterodimer composed of a 150-kDa α2 and a 130-kDa β1 subunit (1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the α2 subunit, the 200-amino acid I (“inserted”) domain has sequence similarity to the I or A domains of such proteins as von Willebrand factor, complement proteins, cartilage matrix protein, and certain other integrins (3Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding sites for both collagen and echovirus 1 have been mapped within the I domain (amino acids 140–349) of the human α2 subunit (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies that block VLA-2 interactions with collagen and/or echovirus recognize epitopes within the I domain, between amino acids 173 and 259, suggesting that sites required for interactions with both ligands reside within this portion of the molecule (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both echovirus 1 (6King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and collagen (7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bind to the isolated human VLA-2 I domain expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Other results suggest that the binding sites for collagen and virus, while both contained within the I domain, are not identical. Although some monoclonal antibodies block VLA-2 interaction with both collagen and virus, others inhibit binding to one ligand or the other (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a variety of evidence indicates that interactions with collagen and echovirus 1 are regulated by different mechanisms. In contrast to collagen binding to VLA-2, echovirus 1 interactions do not discriminate between functional forms of the receptor, and are not enhanced by activating antibodies or phorbol esters (9Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas VLA-2 interaction with collagen is magnesium-dependent, echovirus 1 attachment occurs in the absence of divalent cations (9Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of three aspartate or threonine residues within the VLA-2 I domain (Asp151, Thr221, and Asp254) abolishes cell adhesion to collagen (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations at similar positions within the I domain (called by some investigators the A domain) of the β2 integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18) ablate binding to CR3 ligands and to divalent cations (10Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11Kamata T. Wright R. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12531-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the CR3 I domain shows that these residues serve to coordinate a magnesium ion, and form what has been termed the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar); a similar metal-binding site is evident in the crystal structure of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18) I domain (13Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A MIDAS motif, consisting of a DXSXS sequence (whereX represents any amino acid) plus noncontiguous threonine and aspartate residues, is present in a number of other I or A domains (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Because VLA-2 interactions with echovirus 1 are relatively cation-independent, it is not clear whether the VLA-2 MIDAS is essential for virus binding. Although both human and murine VLA-2 bind collagen, only human VLA-2 mediates echovirus 1 attachment and infection (1Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W.

Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Experiments with human-murine chimeras have shown that specific virus attachment to human VLA-2 depends on the human α2 subunit, and on the human I domain (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S.

Stubdal H. Modlin J. Finberg R.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified sites within the I domain, distinct from the MIDAS residues involved in collagen adhesion, responsible for specific echovirus 1 attachment to human VLA-2. A 650-base pair fragment encoding the I domain (amino acids 140–349) was amplified from a murine α2 cDNA clone (15Edelman J.M. Chan B.M.C. Uniyal S. Onodera H. Wang D.Z. Damjanovich L. Latzer D.B. Finberg R. Bergelson J.M. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), using polymerase chain reaction primers that introduced BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, and inserted into the pGEX-KT GST expression vector (17Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Chimeric I domain DNA fragments were created using splice-overlap extension polymerase chain reaction techniques (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a modification designed to amplify only products containing mutations introduced in the first reaction (18Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The sequence of each subcloned polymerase chain reaction product was verified using an automated Applied Biosystems sequencer. One additional human-murine chimeric I domain, combining human amino acids 140–218 and murine amino acids 219–349, was prepared using aPpuMI restriction site present in both murine and human cDNAs. GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose essentially as described (6King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CR3 I domain-GST fusion protein was provided by P. Rieu and M. A. Arnaout (10Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The D151A, T221A, and D254A mutant I domain-GST fusion proteins have been described (7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled echovirus 1, prepared as described (2Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C.

Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. Beads or cell monolayers were washed to removed unbound virus and dissolved for liquid scintillation counting. Additional aliquots of fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and run on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels to confirm equal protein loading (not shown). A chimeric murine α2 construct with human amino acids at positions 199–216 was prepared in the expression vector pFNeo (19Hahn W.C. Menzin E. Saito T. Germain R.N. Bierer B.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected by electroporation (280 V, 960 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser), and selected first in media containing 0.5 mg/ml geneticin, and then for α2 expression by panning two times on collagen-coated plastic dishes as described (15Edelman J.M.

Surface expression of wild-type human α2, and of human α2 with the D151A, T221A, and D254A mutations, was detected by indirect immunofluorescent flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody HAS-4 (20Tenchini M.L.

Chan B.M.C. Uniyal S. Onodera H. Wang D.Z. Damjanovich L. Latzer D.B. Finberg R. Bergelson J.M. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and experiments with human-murine chimeras have indicated that the human I domain is essential for virus binding (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this species selectivity depends on sequences within the I domain itself, we measured virus attachment to the isolated murine and human I domains, produced as GST fusion proteins (Fig.1). GST alone and a CR3 I domain-GST fusion protein were used as negative controls. As previously observed, virus bound to the human I domain (6King S.L. Cunningham J.A. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3237-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no virus bound to the murine I domain, despite its 83% amino acid identity (15Edelman J.M. Chan B.M.C. Uniyal S. Onodera H. Wang D.Z. Damjanovich L. Latzer D.B. Finberg R. Bergelson J.M. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to the human protein. These results indicate that selective virus attachment to human VLA-2 depends on sequence differences between the human and murine I domains. To localize the essential sequences we constructed a series of chimeric I domains in which the human and murine sequences were interchanged (Figs. 2 and3) and tested their capacity to bind virus (Fig. 3).Figure 3Virus attachment to human-murine chimeras. The human VLA-2 I domain is represented by thewhite bar at the top of the figure. The murine VLA-2 I domain is represented by the black bar at thebottom of the figure. Positions of nonconserved amino acids are indicated by short vertical marks on top of the white bar. A, replacement of human sequences. Human sequence segments replaced by murine amino acids are represented by theblack bars. The reference number for each chimera is indicated in parentheses to the left of each bar.

Chimera reference numbers and binding results are shown as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first studied a series of chimeras in which small regions within the human I domain were replaced by murine sequences (chimeras 1–9) (Fig.3 A). A structural model, based on the crystal structure of the CR3 I domain (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), was used to choose clusters of amino acids for replacement that were contained within putative α helices, loops, or β strands. No small sequence replacement abolished virus binding to the human I domain, indicating that the critical sequence differences between human and murine I domains were not confined to any single small region. Replacement of the entire carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the human I domain (chimera 10) had no effect on virus binding. However, replacement of the amino-terminal portion of the human I domain (chimera 11) reduced binding to background levels. Two chimeras involving small sequence replacements, chimeras 4 and 5, in which amino acids 199–201 and 205–216 were replaced, respectively, showed somewhat reduced capacity to bind virus (less than 80% of wild-type). An additional chimeric protein (chimera 12), in which amino acids 199–216 were all replaced by murine sequences, bound little or no virus, indicating that this region of the I domain was critical for virus attachment. In a reciprocal experiment, replacement of murine by human amino acids 199–216 (Fig. 3 B, chimera 13), converted the murine I domain into a protein capable of binding virus (100% of wild-type). To confirm the results obtained with I domain fusion proteins, human amino acids 199–216 were introduced into the murine α2 subunit (1250 amino acids), and expressed on the surface of CHO cells in association with endogenous β1. Chimeric murine α2 containing human amino acids 199–216 was recognized by the anti-human α2 mAb 5E8, but not by anti-α2 mAbs 12F1, Gi9, or HAS-4 in flow cytometry experiments (TableI). Although, as previously reported (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,15Edelman J.M. Chan B.M.C. Uniyal S. Onodera H. Wang D.Z. Damjanovich L. Latzer D.B. Finberg R. Bergelson J.M. Cell Adhesion and Commun. 1994; 2: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), no virus bound to CHO cells expressing murine α2 itself, virus bound at high levels to the VLA-2 chimera containing human amino acids 199–216 (Fig. 4). Thus, the results obtained with chimeric I domain fusion proteins were consistent with those obtained with chimeric VLA-2 expressed on the cell surface.Table IReactivity of anti-α2 monoclonal antibodies with transfected CHO cellsmAbSpecificityHumanMurine199–216MockHAS-4Human α289<1<125E8Human I domain70<160<112F1Human I domain90<11<1Gi9Human I domain75<16<1AA10Human I domain82<11<1HMα2Murine α2<163<11MOPC 195Negative control4<111A19-3Negative control<1<1<11Flow cytometry was used to detect reactivity of various anti-α2 monoclonal antibodies with stable CHO cell transfectants expressing human α2 (human), murine α2 (murine), or chimeric murine α2 containing human amino acids 199–216 (199–216), as well as mock-transfected CHO cells (mock). The percentage of positive cells is shown. Open table in a new tab Flow cytometry was used to detect reactivity of various anti-α2 monoclonal antibodies with stable CHO cell transfectants expressing human α2 (human), murine α2 (murine), or chimeric murine α2 containing human amino acids 199–216 (199–216), as well as mock-transfected CHO cells (mock). The percentage of positive cells is shown. One interpretation of the results obtained with chimeras 4, 5, and 12, was that echovirus 1 makes two separate contacts with the human I domain, one involving amino acids 199–201, and the other involving amino acids 205–216. Contact at either of these sites might be sufficient for stable virus binding, which, as observed for chimeras 4 and 5, could not be ablated by replacement of either site individually. To test this we produced additional chimeras in which, at each site, murine sequences were replaced by human sequences (Fig.3 B). Introduction of human amino acids 199–201 (chimera 14) converted the nonfunctional murine I domain into a virus-binding protein (96% of wild-type binding), indicating that these amino acids, independent of other specific human amino acids, could support virus attachment. Similarly, replacement of murine amino acids 205–216 (chimera 15) was sufficient to produce virus binding at 82% of wild-type levels. Virus binding to amino acids 205–216 was further dissected using two additional chimeric I domain constructs, containing human amino acids 205–208 and 212–216 separately in the murine protein. Chimera 16, with human residues 212–216, bound echovirus at levels close to the wild-type human I domain (74%), but chimera 17, with human residues 205–208 alone, did not bind virus. These results confirm that the presence of human sequences at either of two sites, one involving residues 199–201, and the other involving residues 212–216, is sufficient for virus binding to occur, and suggest that virus attachment involves independent contacts with each of these sites. VLA-2 interactions with collagen are strictly dependent on divalent cations, and mutations in residues defining the MIDAS abolish adhesion to collagen. In contrast, virus attachment to VLA-2 occurs in the absence of divalent cations. MIDAS residues are conserved between human and murine VLA-2, and cannot be responsible for selective virus attachment to the human, as opposed to the murine, I domain. To determine whether the MIDAS residues are dispensable for virus attachment, we measured virus binding to VLA-2 mutants expressed on CHO cells, in which the MIDAS residues Asp151, Thr221, and Asp254 were replaced by alanine. Each of these mutations abolishes cell adhesion to collagen (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D151A, T221A, and D254A mutations did not inhibit echovirus 1 binding to the transfected CHO cells (Fig.5 A). Virus binding to the mutant cell lines was directly proportional to α2 surface expression as determined by flow cytometry. Mutations at Asp254 and Thr221 (but not Asp151) were previously shown to inhibit binding of I domain fusion proteins to collagen (7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, mutation of the same MIDAS residues had no effect on echovirus 1 binding to isolated I domain-GST fusion proteins (Fig.5 B). These results distinguish further between the I domain sites required for interaction with collagen and with virus (Fig.6).Figure 6Location of residues critical for virus binding to the VLA-2 I domain. Two representations of the VLA-2 I domain structure are shown (32Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol.

In the experiments reported here, human-murine chimeric I domains were used to identify sequences responsible for selective virus attachment to the human, as opposed to the murine, I domain. These sequences are distinct from the MIDAS residues essential for interactions with collagen, which we have now shown to be dispensable for virus binding. Two regions within the human I domain have been identified as critical for echovirus 1 binding. Amino acids 199–201 and 212–216 appear to interact independently with virus; either site is sufficient for virus to bind, and both must be replaced by murine sequences to abolish virus binding. Although these results do not exclude the possibility that amino acids conserved between the human and mouse contact virus, such residues cannot contribute to the species-specificity of the echovirus-VLA-2 interaction. We have also examined echovirus 1 binding to 36 additional CHO cell lines (previously described in Ref. 7Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which single conserved amino acids were replaced by alanine. Although α2 surface expression of these alanine scanning mutants was highly variable, and could not permit the detection of small alterations in virus binding, no single mutation in a conserved amino acid was found to abolish virus binding to VLA-2. 2J. Bergelson, T. Kamata, N. St. John, J. Cunningham, S. King, and Y. Takada, unpublished results. Conversely, because both murine and human VLA-2 bind collagen, it is unlikely that the divergent sequences involved in virus attachment are essential for VLA-2 interactions with collagen. Three separate mutations within the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the human VLA-2 I domain, D151A, T221A, and D254A, were studied for their effects on echovirus 1 attachment. Each of these mutations prevents collagen binding to VLA-2 (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kamata T. Takada Y. J.

This finding supports previous suggestions (4Bergelson J.M. St. John N.F. Kawaguchi S. Pasqualini R. Berdichevsky F. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W.

Several ligand-I domain interactions require an intact MIDAS and may also involve residues on a surface surrounding the MIDAS (24Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the magnesium ion bound by the I domain MIDAS may participate in ligand binding by coordinating an acidic residue from a ligand molecule (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Echovirus 1 binding to the human VLA-2 I domain is unique in that it does not require divalent cations (9Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is not disrupted by mutations in the MIDAS. The recently determined crystal structure of the human VLA-2 I domain (Ref. 32Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and Fig. 6) reveals that residues 199–201 and 212–216 lie in two loops: between strand C and helix 3, and between helix 3 and helix 4. As expected, the critical residues are exposed on the surface of the I domain and are accessible for attachment to virus. The residues lie on one face of the domain, a fairly flat surface at one edge of the central β-sheet, which also comprises residues from helix 3, strand C, and helix 4. This may represent a viral attachment surface, since our results do not rule out a role for other residues lying on this surface that are conserved in murine and human VLA-2. We also note that this surface does not change its structure in the two conformations of the CR3 I domain (28Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), consistent with the insensitivity of virus attachment to activation state (9Bergelson J.M. Chan B.M.C. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The viral attachment surface is distinct from the MIDAS surface of the molecule, which lies at the COOH-terminal end of the β-sheet. The two surfaces touch near tyrosine 216, and it is noteworthy that mAb 5E8, which recognizes an epitope that includes tyrosine 216 (29Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar), blocks VLA-2 interactions with both virus and collagen (5Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work on the CR3 I domain suggests that a third surface (the lower surface of the domain at the N-terminal end of the β-sheet) is involved in regulation of ligand binding affinity (30Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This surface is also distinct from the viral attachment surface, although the two may touch at the loop preceding helix 3. The crystal structure of echovirus 1 3M. Wien, D. Filman, J. Cunningham, J. Bergelson, and J. Hogle, manuscript in preparation. has also been determined, and is remarkable for depressions on the virus surface at both the 5-fold and 2-fold symmetry axes, either of which may be the site for receptor attachment, and either of which could accommodate insertion of the VLA-2 I domain. It is likely that the essential receptor residues identified here make contacts with viral residues lining one of the surface depressions. Further structural studies, involving the use of both cryoelectron microscopy and x-ray crystallographic techniques, will be required to map these interactions in detail. We thank E.

To gain insights into the molecular events that govern this heart-restricted expression, we isolated the chickenGATA-6 gene and used several approaches to screen for associated control regions. Our analysis of two chickenGATA-6/lacZ constructs in transgenic mouse embryos was particularly revealing. One GATA-6/lacZ construct, which has 1.5 kilobase pairs of upstream sequences along with the promoter and first intron, was expressed exclusively in the atrioventricular canal region of the heart. This expression pattern is novel and appears to mark specialized myocardial cells that induce underlying endocardial cells to initiate valve formation. The other GATA-6/lacZconstruct, which has an additional 7.7 kilobase pairs of upstream sequences, was expressed in the ventricle and outflow tract in addition to the atrioventricular canal. The failure of these GATA-6control regions to function as enhancers in transfected cardiac myocyte cultures underscores the importance of using transgenic approaches to elucidate transcriptional controls that function in the developing heart. Although the endogenous GATA-6 gene is expressed throughout the heart, our results indicate that this is effected in a heart region-specific manner.

Although commitment to the cardiogenic lineage and the events that precede cardiac myocyte differentiation are still poorly understood at the transcriptional level, major advances have recently been made in understanding the roles that various growth factors serve in this context. In particular, members of the transforming growth factor-β family of growth factors have been shown to effect the specification of precardiac mesoderm, whereas members of the fibroblast growth factor family of growth factors have been shown to regulate the subsequent proliferation and differentiation of these committed cells (1Lough J. Barron M. Brogley M. Sugi Y. Bolender D.L. Zhu X. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The genes that are regulated in direct response to these extracellular signals and the transcription factors that mediate these programming events within the cardiogenic lineage have not yet been elucidated. The transcriptional controls that function within terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes have been analyzed in much greater detail owing to the relative ease of obtaining material for study. Transient transfection and direct muscle injection assays have been used to map control regions for many cardiac genes (for review, see Refs. 3Lyons G.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 4Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Science. 1996; 272: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and some of these control regions have also been shown to direct heart-restricted expression in transgenic mice. Several of these control regions derive from genes that are expressed in a heart region-specific manner, and in general, the respective control regions have been found to function in a similar manner in transgenic animals. Examples include the ventricular control region from the mouse ventricular MLC-2v gene (5Ross R.S. Navankasattusas S. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1799-1809PubMed Google Scholar) and the atrial control region from the quail atrial slow MyHC3 gene (6Wang G.F. Nikovits W. Schleinitz M. Stockdale F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19836-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since many cardiac genes are also expressed in skeletal muscle, it is perhaps not surprising that several of the aforementioned cardiac control regions were found to contain motifs similar to those found within skeletal muscle control regions (e.g. CArG, MCAT, MEF2, and E-box). These control regions do not necessarily direct dual heart and skeletal muscle expression, however, and the factors that bind to these motifs are not necessarily the same in both types of striated muscle. For example, four basic helix-loop-helix factors (i.e. MyoD, MRF4, Myf-5, and myogenin) are expressed in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac muscle (7Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Conversely, GATA motifs are commonly found in cardiac control regions, and three GATA factors (i.e. GATA-4/5/6) that bind to these sites are expressed in the heart, but not in skeletal muscle (8Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell.

Several additional heart-restricted transcription factors have been identified by other means. For example, degenerate polymerase chain reaction and low stringency screens were used to isolate clones for vertebrate Nkx2.5 factors (15Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 16Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Lints T.J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Similar screens were used to isolate clones for two related basic helix-loop-helix factors, dHAND and eHAND (20Cross J.C.

Science. 1995; 270: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), that are expressed in the developing heart. A factor (CMF1) has been reported to be transiently expressed in the developing heart (24Litvin J. Montgomery M.O. Goldhamer D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Bader D.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Wei Y. Bader D. Litvin J. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2779-2789PubMed Google Scholar), and a member of the MEF2 family, MEF2C, has also been shown to be expressed early in the cardiogenic lineage (26Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how the genes for these heart-restricted transcription factors are themselves regulated over the course of heart development. While members of the transforming growth factor-β family of growth factors have been shown to induce Nkx2.5 andGATA-4 gene expression in some regions of non-precardiogenic mesoderm, it is not known if these responses are direct or indirect (2Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Similarly, although it is known from gene knockout mice that Nkx2.5 is required to induce eHAND gene expression, this regulation is not understood in molecular terms (15Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In this study, we undertook to screen for control regions associated with the chicken GATA-6 gene, which is expressed in early cardiogenic mesoderm as well as during subsequent stages of heart development (10Jiang Y. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). GATA-6 is a zinc finger transcription factor that, along with the related GATA-4 (27Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 28Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) and GATA-5 factors, has been implicated in effecting cardiac myocyte differentiation and heart morphogenesis. Although the endogenous GATA-6 gene is expressed throughout the developing heart, our results unexpectedly reveal that this expression is attributable to several distinct control regions that function in different regions of the developing heart. Moreover, one of these control regions directs a unique pattern of expression in transgenic mouse embryos: in particular, to myocardial cells of the atrioventricular (AV) 1The abbreviations used are: AV, atrioventricular; 5′-RACE, rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; HS, hypersensitive. canal. Whereas this and a more distal GATA-6 control region function in transgenic mouse embryos, neither functions as an enhancer in transfected cardiac myocyte cultures. These GATA-6 control regions are thus distinct from previously described cardiac control regions in several respects. A previously described chicken GATA-6 cDNA probe (12Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to isolate three chicken GATA-6 genomic clones from a chicken genomic phage library. Standard protocols were used to purify and map these clones (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments that hybridized to this GATA-6 cDNA probe were cloned into the pBluescript II KS+/− plasmid (Stratagene), and the exonic regions were sequenced using primers directed against various portions of the GATA-6 cDNA sequence. These sequences, as well as the others described below, were determined on both strands using Sequenase reagents (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using a FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Primer extension reactions were carried out according to a standard protocol (30Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar) using an antisense primer directed against the 33–57-nucleotide segment of the published chicken GATA-6 cDNA sequence (12Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This primer, which is marked with an arrow in Fig. 2 (A and C), was annealed at 55 °C to 5-μg aliquots of poly(A)+ mRNA. 5′-RACE reactions were performed using a 5′-AmpliFINDER kit (CLONTECH) and the primer described in the previous paragraph. The resultant polymerase chain reaction products were cloned directly into the pCRII vector with a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using SP6 and T7 primers. The promoterless p/CAT plasmid was made by deleting the BglII-HindIII (simple TATA box) fragment from the pTATA/CAT plasmid (31Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and replacing this with anXbaI (linker) site. Four restriction fragments that include the GATA-6 promoter were cloned (with XbaI linkers) into the newly engineered XbaI site of p/CAT to yield the pGATA-6/CAT plasmids shown in lines 1–4 of Fig. 3 A. An antisense primer from the CAT gene was used as a sequencing primer to confirm that these fragments were oriented correctly so as to allow them to function as promoters for the downstream CAT gene. A NotI site was inserted into the distal end of the polylinker of the promoterless lacZ vector pPD46.21 (32Goldhamer D.J. Faerman A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 1992; 256: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by replacing the HindIII-PstI fragment with a synthetic HindIII-PstI fragment that has aNotI site introduced between the SphI andPstI sites. (This modified vector (pPD46.21.NotI) also has a NotI site downstream of the lacZ gene; thus, derivative test fragments (for transgenic assays; see below) were released by simply digesting with NotI.) The derivativeGATA-6/lacZ plasmids shown in Fig. 5 were made using stepwise approaches. First, the +19/+807BamHI-SmaI fragment that spans the first intron and includes parts of the first and second exons of theGATA-6 gene was cloned into the polylinker of pPD46.21.NotI. Second, the −1467/+19SacI-BamHI fragment was inserted (as aBamHI fragment with linkers) into the BamHI site to yield p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ (see line 1 of Fig. 5). The plasmids depicted in lines 5–8 of Fig. 5 were made by inserting distal fragments into the PstI polylinker site in p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ. Similarly, the plasmids shown on lines 4 and 9–12 of Fig. 5 were made by cloning fragments into the XbaI polylinker site of p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ (using XbaI linkers as needed). The plasmid p(−3.0/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ (seeline 2 of Fig. 5) was made by cloning the −3.0 kb/+19 bpBamHI fragment into the BamHI site of the pGATA-6/lacZ plasmid that contains the +19/+807BamHI-SmaI fragment (described above). Last, the plasmid p(−4.1/+1.0)GATA-6/lacZ (see line 3 of Fig. 5) was made by cloning the −4.1/+1.0NcoI-NotI fragment (with XbaI linkers) into the XbaI site of the pPD46.21.NotI vector. Primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes were prepared using a slight modification of an established protocol (33Davis D.L. Doten I.C. Barald K.F. Axelrod D. Burch J.B.E. Anti. Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1996; 6: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 34DeHaan R.L. Dev. Biol. 1967; 16: 216-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricles were dissected from embryonic day 7 chick hearts and serially digested at 37 °C with fresh aliquots of 0.05% trypsin in calcium- and magnesium-free saline. After each 5-min digestion cycle, the sample was vortexed gently, hearts were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatants from the first two cycles contained mostly cardiac fibroblasts; these cells were collected into fibroblast growth medium (M199 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% tryptose phosphate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/kanamycin (PSK) antibiotics) and then passed through a 75-mm nylon cell strainer, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same medium. These cells were passaged three to four times (in T75 flasks; splitting 1:3 each time) in the same medium before being used for transfection assays (see below). The supernatants from the next five cycles contained mostly cardiac myocytes; after inactivating the trypsin (with M199 medium, 5% heat-inactivated FBS, and 1% PSK), the cells were passed through a 75-mm nylon cell strainer, centrifuged, and resuspended in M199 medium and 1% PSK. Cardiac myocytes preferentially attached to six-well culture plates within 3 h; these adherent cells were maintained in M199 medium and 1% PSK for 12–18 h before being used for transfection assays (see below). These cardiac myocytes displayed spontaneous contractile activity in culture. COS-7 cells, which were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and 1% PSK. Chicken LMH hepatoma cells (35Kawaguchi T. Nomura K. Hirayama Y. Kitagawa T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4460-4464PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Waymouth's medium, 10% FBS, and 1% PSK as originally described. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following volumes of LipofectAMINE per number of cells were found to be optimal for transfection assays and hence were used for the experiments described in this report: cardiac myocytes, 4.5 μl/1 × 106 cells; cardiac fibroblasts, 4.0 μl/5 × 105 cells; LMH cells, 5.5 μl/4 × 105 cells; and COS-7 cells, 4.0 μl/3 × 105 cells. The molar amounts of reporter plasmids were held constant for each experiment; differences in the weight amounts of DNA were adjusted (to a total of 2.0 μg) with a generic plasmid (pBluescript II KS+/−). When CAT test plasmids were used, 0.3 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) was used as an internal control. When lacZ test plasmids were used, 0.2 μg of pGL3-control (Promega) served as the internal control. Cells were exposed to the transfection mixture for 6 h. For cardiac fibroblasts, LMH cells, and COS-7 cells, the respective growth media (described above) were switched at this time. Cardiac myocytes were initially switched to M199 medium plus 2% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% PSK and were subsequently (12 h later) switched to M199 medium plus 1% PSK. Transfected cells were harvested and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) after 48 h. Aliquots (2–10 μl) of cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) using a Promega luciferase assay system kit. Aliquots (20–50 μl) of cell extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity in 96-well plates using a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system kit (Promega); data were quantified at 420 nm with a Rainbow Reader (SLT Labinstruments). For CAT test constructs, after β-galactosidase assay, the rest of each extract was heated for 10 min at 65 °C; CAT activities for these samples were assayed with14C using a standard chromatographic method. The CAT activity was measured within the linear range in each case. DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites were identified over the GATA-6 gene region using an established protocol (36Burch J.B.E. Weintraub H. Cell. 1983; 33: 65-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Chick heart and brain nuclei were prepared from day 12 embryos and digested with 0.1–1.0 μg/μl DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C. The DNA samples were isolated, digested withKpnI or HindIII and EcoRI, Southern-blotted, and probed with a random primer-labeled −3.0/−2.7HindIII-KpnI fragment. The p(−9.2/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ plasmid and the p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ plasmid (see lines 4 and1 of Fig. 5) were derived from the promoterlesslacZ vector pPD46.21.NotI as described above. These GATA-6/lacZ inserts were isolated free of plasmid sequences by NotI digestion followed by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The inserts were purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.); serially extracted with phenol (three times), phenol/chloroform, and chloroform; and then precipitated with ethanol. The inserts were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes from the inbred strain FVB/N. Eggs that survived injection were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant females of strain ICR. Embryos were isolated at approximately day 11 and then fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity (37Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 373-375Google Scholar). Transgenic embryos were photographed intact as well as after being embedded and sagittal-sectioned (38$$Google Scholar). We previously isolated a chicken GATA-6 cDNA clone (12Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the present study, we used this probe to isolate three overlapping chickenGATA-6 genomic clones. An analysis of these genomic clones revealed five GATA-6 coding exons (denoted E2–E6) (Fig.1 A) that are each flanked by consensus splice sites (Fig. 1 B). Based on the results of a polymerase chain reaction analysis of genomic DNA (data not shown), we infer that the remainder of the GATA-6 open reading frame (which was not included in any of our genomic clones) is encoded by a single exon (denoted E7) (Fig. 1 A). The 5′-end of the chicken GATA-6 gene was mapped using primer extension and 5′-RACE assays. The GATA-6-specific antisense primer for these assays was directed against a unique sequence from what proved to be the second exon (E2) of this gene (Fig.2, A and C). This primer yielded a 118-nucleotide cDNA product from stomach and liver (but not brain) mRNAs (Fig. 2 B), in qualitative accord with our previous Northern blot analysis, which revealed that theGATA-6 gene is expressed in the heart and various tissues that derive from gut endoderm (12Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B.E. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This primer yielded a 5′-RACE cDNA product of the same size (Fig. 2 C). A comparison of this 5′-RACE cDNA product and the corresponding genomic sequence revealed that the GATA-6 gene has a 43-bp noncoding first exon (E1) located ∼0.6 kb upstream of E2. The intron between E1 and E2 is flanked by consensus splice sites as expected (Fig.1 B). The structure of the GATA-6 gene (Fig. 1 A) is very similar to that of the recently reported GATA-5 gene (39MacNeill C. Ayres B. Laverriere A.C. Burch J.B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8396-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, whereas the GATA-5 gene has two alternative noncoding first exons, the GATA-6 gene appears to have a unique noncoding first exon. The −123/+19SacII-BamHI region of the chickenGATA-6 gene (Fig. 1 C) has several features that are typical of a promoter. For example, 1) the transcriptional start site (position +1) maps to a purine embedded within a pyrimidine-rich tract; 2) an AT-rich motif (albeit not a consensus TATA box) maps to the −30/−20 region; and 3) consensus binding sites for several transcription factors can be found upstream of −30, although we do not yet know which of these sites are significant. To confirm that the −123/+19 region of the GATA-6 gene can function as a promoter and to begin to evaluate whether additional regulatory sequences might reside farther upstream of the promoter or in the first intron, four overlapping GATA-6 genomic fragments (Fig. 3 A,lines 1–4) were cloned into the promoterless p/CAT plasmid and assayed for their ability to direct transient expression in four different cell types. Three of these cell types (cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and LMH hepatoma cells) express the endogenousGATA-6 gene (data not shown), whereas the fourth cell type (COS-7 cells) does not express any endogenous GATA genes (13Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected as an internal control for each triplicate assay. The results of these transfection assays are summarized in Fig.3 B. As expected, the p/CAT (promoterless) plasmid directed little or no transient expression, whereas the pCAT control plasmid directed high levels of expression in each cell type (comparelines 5 and 6). The core −123/+19GATA-6 promoter functioned in cardiac myocytes, and although less active in cardiac fibroblasts and LMH cells, these signals were clearly above the background levels of the promoterless p/CAT plasmid (compare lines 4 and 5). In COS-7 cells, theGATA-6 promoter plasmid was only 3-fold more active than the promoterless p/CAT plasmid. The addition of progressively more distal sequences as well as intronic sequences to the core GATA-6 promoter plasmid increased transient expression to various extents in the four cell types assayed (Fig. 3 B, compare lines 1–4). These results suggest that the core GATA-6 promoter is flanked by several distinct positive control regions. However, since the effect of any given nonpromotor fragment was rather modest (particularly in cardiac myocytes), we did not attempt to resolve the respective control regions further using this approach. The results of the preceding transient expression assays suggest that 1) the core GATA-6 promoter preferentially functions in cardiac myocytes; 2) a positive control region(s) maps within the first intron; and 3) at least two positive control regions map upstream of the minimal promoter. To begin to evaluate whether these (or more distal) control regions might regulate the endogenousGATA-6 gene in the heart, we exploited the fact that functional control regions are usually marked at the chromatin level by DNase I HS sites (40Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The probing strategy that we used to survey the GATA-6 gene region for HS sites is outlined in Fig.4 A. As indicated by the results shown in Fig. 4 C, it is clear that HS sites mark the promoter and first intron (HS-2 and HS-3, respectively) in the heart, where the GATA-6 gene is expressed, but not in the brain, where the GATA-6 gene is silent. These results provide further support for a transcriptional control region(s) within the first intron of the GATA-6 gene; however, we cannot rule out that the activity of this region in transfection assays (Fig.3 B) is effected at a post-transcriptional level. The results of the HS site analysis presented in Fig. 4 B also suggest that another control region(s) may reside ∼6 kb upstream of the gene since this region is marked by a HS site (HS-1) in the heart, but not in the brain. To determine whether the distal and/or intronic HS sites mark classical enhancers, the respectiveGATA-6 genomic fragments were inserted downstream of the CAT gene in the pCAT promoter plasmid, which contains the SV40 promoter, and transfected into cardiac myocytes. Neither of these fragments displayed enhancer activity in this assay (data not shown). We next addressed whether the GATA-6 gene might be flanked by distal control regions that function only in combination with the homologous GATA-6 promoter and/or other proximal control regions. Overlapping fragments that collectively span the −9.2/−1.5 region were thus cloned into the parental p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ plasmid, which includes several positive control regions in addition to the core GATA-6promoter (Fig. 3 B), and assayed in transfected cardiac myocyte cultures. The results of these transient expression assays are summarized in Fig. 5. Once again, we found no evidence for a classical enhancer associated with this gene. On the other hand, these results do suggest that a negative element lies within the −3.0/−1.5 region since each of the three reporter plasmids that harbor this region displays 2-fold lower expression than the parental plasmid (compare lines 2–4with line 1). This fragment also reduced expression 2-fold when assayed in the context of the heterologous pCAT control plasmid (data not shown). Although transient expression assays have been used to detect a plethora of transcriptional control regions, negative results must be interpreted with caution. In particular, control regions that escape detection in transfection assays can sometimes be shown to function in transgenic assays (for example, see Ref. 41Zhong W. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7276-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we undertook to test whether a 10-kb fragment that spans the GATA-6 promoter and first intron as well as all three of the documented HS sites could function in transgenic mouse embryos. Since lacZ reporter plasmids can be assayed in transgenic mice, the p(−9.2/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ plasmid that we previously constructed (Fig. 5, line 4) was well suited for our purposes. As evidenced by the results shown in Fig.6, this plasmid directed heart-restricted expression in both of the transgenic mouse embryos we obtained. In one embryo (panel A), the transgene was expressed only in the heart, whereas in the other embryo (panel E), the transgene was expressed at a few small sites in addition to the heart. A sagittal section of the former embryo is shown in panel B; a more detailed view of the heart region is shown in panel C. Note that intense staining is seen in the myocardial layer of the ventricle (v) and in the proximal region of the outflow tract (ot). In contrast, expression of the transgene was more sporadic in the atrium (a). A parasagittal section through the same embryo (panel D) shows that the transgene is also expressed in the myocardial layer of the atrioventricular canal (av) that lies between the primitive atrium and ventricle. In light of the failure of transient expression assays to provide evidence for a distal control region associated with the GATA-6 gene, it was of interest to determine if distal sequences contributed to the heart-restricted expression of the p(−9.2/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZtransgene. The p(−1.5/+0.8)GATA-6/lacZ plasmid (Fig. 5,line 1) was suited to resolve this issue and was used accordingly. Remarkably, all three of the resultant transgenic mouse embryos expressed this truncated transgene in a similar highly restricted manner (Fig. 7). In particular, as shown in panels A–C, expression of this transgene was confined in each case to a small region of the heart (assayed around embryonic day 11). Sagittal sections of the hearts of these transgenic embryos (panels D–F) revealed that expression was restricted in each case to myocardial cells that are confined to the atrioventricular canal and thus overlie the endocardial cushion. Since avian, amphibian, and mammalian species display similar tissue-restricted patterns of GATA-6 gene expression, we anticipated that the chicken GATA-6 gene region might contain tissue-restricted control regions that are sufficiently well conserved to function in transgenic mice. Indeed, we obtained evidence for two such control regions within a 10-kb chicken GATA-6genomic fragment. However, these two control regions did not function in two different tissues, as might have been expected considering the rather complex pattern of endogenous GATA-6 expression, but rather in two different regions of one organ (heart) that expresses the endogenous GATA-6 gene. The chicken GATA-6 distal control region(s) was found to be required for expression in the ventricle and outflow tract segments of the heart in transgenic mouse embryos. The expression pattern of theGATA-6/lacZ transgene that includes this distal control region is similar to the transgenic pattern dictated by theHF-1 control region from the mouse MLC-2v gene (5Ross R.S. Navankasattusas S. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1799-1809PubMed Google Scholar). Since the latter control region contains a critical MEF2 site, one might also expect to find an MEF2 site within the GATA-6distal control region. These control regions are distinct in other respects, however, and may use different means to effect similar expression patterns. For example, the inactivity of theGATA-6 control region in transfection assays stands in contrast to the MLC-2v control region. Also, theGATA-6 control region is located far upstream of the gene, whereas the HF-1 control region lies within theMLC-2v promoter. The chicken GATA-6 proximal control region(s) was found to direct a unique expression pattern in transgenic mouse embryos. In particular, the truncated GATA-6/lacZ transgene was only expressed in myocardial cells that reside within the AV canal. These cells are known to play a special role in heart development; namely, they induce the underlying endocardial cells to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (42Eisenberg L.M. Markwald R.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 43Huang J.X. Potts J.D. Vincent E.B. Weeks D.L. Runyan R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This transition serves to restructure the endocardial cushion and to initiate valve formation. Although several endogenous genes are known to be preferentially expressed in AV myocardial cells (44Chan-Thomas P.S. Thompson R.P. Robert B. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 45Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 46Zhang H. Bradley A. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2977-2986PubMed Google Scholar), it is not known how any of these genes are regulated at the molecular level. We presume that theGATA-6/lacZ transgene is regulated in response to the same signal(s) that regulates these endogenous genes. However, since two of the latter genes (BMP-2 and BMP-4) encode growth factors that can induce the expression of another GATA gene (GATA-4) earlier in the general cardiogenic program (2Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B.E. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), it is possible that these growth factors function in an autocrine manner to regulate the GATA-6/lacZ transgene in these specialized AV myocardial cells. In any event, it should be possible to resolve how this precise heart region-specific control is achieved at the molecular level since the relevant control region(s) must lie within a 2.3-kbGATA-6 genomic fragment. This is a topic of great biomedical relevance since valve abnormalities are a major cause of congenital birth defects. Whereas the larger GATA-6 genomic fragment directed robust expression in the primitive ventricle, this fragment functioned poorly in the primitive atrium. The ability of the endogenousGATA-6 gene to be expressed throughout the primitive heart may thus require other control regions that reside outside the 10-kb segment assayed in this study. Alternatively, the poor expression of this transgene in the atrium may be related to the use of a heterologous (chick/mouse) transgenic assay. The basis for the lack of transgene expression in other tissues (such as gut) that express the endogenous GATA-6 gene is similarly ambiguous. Whereas homologous (mouse/mouse) transgenic assays may resolve some of these uncertainties, there is obviously no guarantee that the relevant control regions will lie within a fragment of comparable (10 kb) size. Indeed, a much larger (20 kb) fragment that spans the promoter for the heart-restricted chicken GATA-5 gene failed to direct heart-restricted expression in transgenic mouse embry-os. 2C. MacNeill and J. B. E. Burch, unpublished result. Thus, despite the fact that the GATA-4/5/6 genes display similar expression patterns, the spatial arrangements of the respective control regions may be quite distinct. In contrast to numerous heart-restricted control regions that have been reported in the literature (5Ross R.S. Navankasattusas S. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1799-1809PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang G.F. Nikovits W. Schleinitz M. Stockdale F.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 174: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the GATA-6 distal control region(s) does not appear to function in transfection assays. Several possible explanations can be advanced to account for why this control region might function in ventricular myocytes of transgenic mice, but not in transfected ventricular myocytes. For example, the control region may effect a change in methylation (49Grieshammer U. McGrew M.J. Rosenthal N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2245-2253PubMed Google Scholar) or alter the organization of a chromatin domain (50Martin D.I. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the control region may only function during a particular stage of development (51Lew D. Brady H. Klausing K. Yaginuma K. Theill L.E. Stauber C. Karin M. Mellon P.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Future studies will be directed at evaluating these possibilities. The present results also underscore the question of whether transgenic assays will be required to find evidence for control regions associated with other heart-restricted transcription factor genes. We do not know if the GATA-6 proximal control region, which directs AV canal-specific expression in transgenic mice, can function in transfection assays. This is a difficult issue to address since AV myocardial cells would have to be isolated in reasonable quantities, and the transcriptional milieu that is unique to these cells would have to remain stable in culture. Whereas efforts to analyze these specialized myocardial cells have been hampered by the lack of a unique molecular marker, it may be possible to circumvent this technical limitation by creating lines of transgenic mice that express markers of interest under the control of the GATA-6 proximal control region. This line of investigation is currently in progress.

https://openalex.org/W1968507274,"The DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE heat shock proteins ofEscherichia coli constitute the prototype DnaK chaperone machine. Various studies have shown that these three proteins work synergistically in a diverse array of biological functions, including protein folding and disaggregation, proteolysis, and transport across biological membranes. We have overexpressed and purified the mitochondrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae DnaJ homologue, Mdj1pΔ55, which lacks the mitochondrial presequence, and studied its biochemical properties in well defined in vitro systems. We find that Mdj1pΔ55 interacts with DnaK as judged both by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as stimulation of DnaK's weak ATPase activity in the presence of GrpE. In addition, Mdj1pΔ55 not only interacts with denatured firefly luciferase on its own, but also enables DnaK to bind to it in an ATP-dependent mode. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays we can demonstrate the presence of a stable Mdj1pΔ55-luciferase-DnaK complex. However, in contrast to DnaJ, Mdj1pΔ55 does not appear to interact well with certain seemingly folded proteins, such as the ς32 heat shock transcription factor or the λP DNA replication protein. Finally, Mdj1pΔ55 can substitute perfectly well for DnaJ in the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase by the DnaK chaperone machine. These studies demonstrate that Mdj1pΔ55 has conserved most of DnaJ's known biological properties, thus supporting an analogous functional role in yeast mitochondria.

Members of the Hsp70 family are molecular chaperones found in all bacteria, as well as in all eukaryotic subcellular compartments, and share the common characteristic of binding polypeptides in their extended conformation (reviewed in Ref. 1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli DnaK protein, the prototype Hsp70 bacterial homologue, has been extensively studied and shown to be involved in many cellular processes, such as protein folding and disaggregation, protein degradation, translocation of proteins across membranes, initiation of bacteriophage λ DNA replication, and heat shock regulation (reviewed in Ref. 2Georgopoulos C.

In all these reactions the activity of DnaK appears to be highly regulated by two “cohort” proteins, DnaJ and GrpE. DnaJ is a bona fide chaperone on its own right and mediates the efficient binding of DnaK to substrates in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas GrpE is required to subsquently dissociate the complex, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor. The recent identification of the mitochondrial DnaK (mt-Hsp70/Ssc1p; Ref. 3Miao B. Davis J.E. Craig E.A. J. Mol.

Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) suggested the existence of a chaperone machine in mitochondria analogous to that of the E. coli DnaK chaperone machine. The Ssc1p and Mge1p proteins have been both characterized as essential components of the translocation of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix (9Kang P.J. Craig E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Schneider H.-C. Westermann B. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Ssc1p has been shown to bind to and help transport preproteins into the matrix, in a dynamic complex with Tim44p and Mge1p (6Rassow J. Maarse A.C. Krainer E. Kubrich M. Muller H. Meijer M. Craig E.A.

Tim44p is a peripheral membrane protein which recruits Ssc1p at the proper position for protein import while Mge1p is a nucleotide release factor required to modulate the nucleotide-dependent stability of Ssc1p-Tim44p complex. Recently, Mge1p was shown to form a stable complex with Ssc1p via a loop structure located on the surface of Ssc1p's ATPase domain (3Miao B. Davis J.E. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously showed that Mge1p could interact with DnaK and substitute for E. coli GrpE functions both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a functional conservation of these two proteins (14Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike Ssc1p and Mge1p, Mdj1p is not essential for yeast growth and is particularly dispensable for protein import (8Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, Mdj1p plays an important role for newly translocated and mitochondrially synthesized proteins by preventing their subsequent aggregation (16Westermann B. Gaume B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1996; 16: 7063-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdj1p cooperates with Ssc1p and Mge1p to promote protein folding and degradation of misfolded proteins by the Pim1p protease (8Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mdj1p contains three of the characteristic domain structures found in DnaJ. This comprises the extreme N-terminal part, representing the “J-domain,” which makes the primary contact with DnaK (17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol.

Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 22Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, by analogy to DnaJ, it has been proposed that Mdj1p is required to stimulate both the ATP hydrolysis of Ssc1p, and to guide unfolded substrates to Ssc1p. Recently, we showed that Mdj1pΔ55, a recombinant protein lacking its mitochondrial presequence (1–55 amino acids) could partially suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an E. coli dnaJ mutant (15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we purified Mdj1pΔ55 and investigated whether it could replace DnaJ in a luciferase refolding assay in vitro. Our results indicate that Mdj1pΔ55 can specifically interact with denatured firefly luciferase, and subsequently stimulate DnaK to ensure efficient luciferase refolding. However, we found that Mdj1pΔ55 has lower affinity for seemingly native proteins, since, in contrast to DnaJ, Mdj1pΔ55 does not interact at all with the λP replication protein and poorly with the ς32 heat shock transcription factor. The previously describedE. coli OD259 (MC4100dnaJ::Tn10ΔcbpA::kanr Δara 714araD139) (15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for the purification of Mdj1pΔ55. A culture of 6 liters of OD259 strain containing plasmid pOD50 was grown with aeration at 30 °C in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to anA 595 nm of 1.0. At that time the inducer arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% and the culture was grown for an additional 2 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and the pellet (≈18 g) resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) sucrose) and lysed in the presence of 10 mmDTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DDT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 10 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 45 min on ice. During the last 15 min, Brij 58 was added to a final concentration of 0.6%. The cells were subsequently sonicated for 3 min (30-s on/off bursts, power 60%, Sonifier cell disruptor B-30) and cells debris was removed by centrifugation in a Beckman angle 35 rotor at 28,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was directly applied onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 cm × 12 cm), previously equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 5 mm DTT, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins recovered in the void volume were dialyzed overnight against buffer C (40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1 m KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Brij 58) at 4 °C. The dialysate was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 cm × 6 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer C. The column was subsequently washed with buffer C containing 140 mm potassium phosphate, and the proteins were eluted with buffer C containing 500 mmpotassium phosphate. To avoid precipitation, the eluted proteins were slowly diluted with 3 volumes of 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Brij 58, and loaded onto a P11 phosphocellulose column (1.5 cm × 7 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer D (40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.2 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Brij 58). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.8 m KCl in buffer D. The fractions that were enriched in Mdj1pΔ55 protein were pooled and loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia K16/66) previously equilibrated with buffer E (40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.4 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Brij 58). Fractions containing highly purified Mdj1pΔ55 protein were concentrated onto an hydroxylapatite column (0.5 × 0.5 cm). Proteins were eluted with 0.5m potassium phosphate and purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer F (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.4 mKCl, 15% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.001% Brij 58) and stored at −80 °C. DnaJ, DnaK, ς32, and λP proteins were purified according to Zylicz et al. (24Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

The ATPase activity was performed in 20 μl of buffer G (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT) and measured as previously described (14Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed ATP was quantified by a PhosphorImager. The ELISA technique used for detection of protein-protein interactions has been previously described in detail (29Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Each given value represents an average of three independent determinations. Briefly, the first protein was incubated at 0.5 μg/well for 1 h in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline onto 96-well microtiter plates. The wells were then washed and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA. The second protein was then added in buffer H (25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.2% BSA), incubated for 30 min at room temperature and cross-linked with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Complex formation was estimated by the anti-second protein antibody, as described previously (29Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prior to use, firefly luciferase was denatured in buffer I (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 6 m guanidinium/HCl, and 5 mm DTT) for 30 min at room temperature. Firefly luciferase at 25 μm was denatured in buffer I for 30 min at room temperature. The denatured firefly luciferase was then diluted 100-fold in buffer J (25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmMg2+-acetate) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and various chaperones, as indicated. Aggregation of firefly luciferase was determined by light scattering at 320 nm using an Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer in a thermostabilized cuvette at 30 °C. Subsequently, protein samples (400 μl) were centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes for 20 min at 4 °C and soluble proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). Precipitated proteins were separated by means of SDS-PAGE and the amount of firefly luciferase was quantified by densitometry. The renaturation of guanidinium-denatured firefly luciferase (250 nm) was carried out at 25 °C in 100 μl of buffer K (30 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 7 mmMg2+-acetate) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and various chaperones, as indicated, essentially as previously described (14Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The refolding luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Luciferase Assay System (E1500) followed by liquid scintillation counting. Guanidinium-denatured firefly luciferase was preincubated in 300 μl of buffer K containing 1 mm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence of various chaperones, as indicated. The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes for 10 min at 4 °C and soluble proteins were aliquoted into two tubes for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Two μl of polyclonal DnaK or firefly luciferase antibodies were added to each series of Eppendorf tubes, respectively, and incubated for 1 h on ice. Fifty μl of a 1:1 (v/v) Pansorbin in buffer L (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.3, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) was added, and following an additional 30-min incubation on ice, Pansorbin was washed three times with buffer L and once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3. Protein complexes associated with Pansorbin were detected following separation by SDS-PAGE and appropriate Western blot analyses. To purify the mature form of Mdj1p fromE. coli, we used a previously described plasmid construct (pOD50; Ref. 15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which carries the Mdj1p gene lacking its mitochondrial leader presequence (1–55 amino acids) and fused to the arabinose-inducible promoter of a pBAD vector. The pOD50 plasmid was introduced into a dnaJ-deleled strain (OD259) to prevent potential contamination with endogenous DnaJ. Mdj1pΔ55 was induced by the addition of 0.2% l-arabinose (final concentration) and purified to homogeneity according to the protocol described under “Materials and Methods.” As judged by SDS-PAGE, purified Mdj1pΔ55 protein migrates as a 50-kDa protein, consistent with its predicted molecular mass (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of the purified Mdj1pΔ55 and DnaJ, using αMdj1p and αDnaJ antibodies revealed the absence of cross-reactivity and confirmed the identity of the recombinantly produced proteins (data not shown). Previously, DnaJ has been shown to form dimers, either by means of glycerol gradient centrifugation or gel filtration (24Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Mdj1pΔ55 behaves similarly to DnaJ in solution, we attempted to analyze the quaternary structure of Mdj1pΔ55 by gel filtration. This experiment failed to estimate the accurate molecular weight of Mdj1pΔ55, primarily because the protein eluted in a very broad peak, even at low concentrations and/or in the presence of detergent. However, Mdj1pΔ55 likely forms dimers, as DnaJ does, since it sediments slightly ahead of DnaK (66,000 Da monomer) during glycerol gradient centrifugation (results not shown). Previous structure-function analyses of DnaJ had demonstrated that the N-terminal region of amino acids 1–108, which includes the J-domain and the G/F-rich motif, was by itself sufficient to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK (17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The structure of these two domains were subsequently determined by NMR and shown to consist of an extremely hydrophobic core involving side chains of four α helices for the J-domain and a flexible structure for the G/F-rich region which is poorly ordered in solution (19Szyperski T. Pellacchia M. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11343-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Pellacchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Most likely, the structure of the J-domain is conserved in all DnaJ-like proteins, judging by their high amino sequence homology to each other. Recently, we showed that Mdj1pΔ55 could partially suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an E. coli dnaJ mutant (OD259) and demonstrated that the J-domain of Mdj1p could be exchanged with that of DnaJ and substitute for all known functions of the wild type DnaJ protein that we tested (15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This includes growth at non-permissive temperatures, suppression of the block on bacteriophage λ growth, and down-regulation of the ς32-dependent heat shock response. DnaJ is known to stimulate up to 50-fold the ATPase activity of DnaK in the presence of GrpE (28Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In analogy with this, Mdj1pΔ55 could also stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, albeit at a reduced efficiency compared with DnaJ (Fig. 2). This result is in good agreement with that obtained by Horst et al. (30Horst M. Oppliger W. Rospert S. Schönfeld H.J. Schatz G. Azem A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) where a difference of only 2–3-fold was found between mitochondrially-purified Mdj1p and DnaJ. To further delineate the interaction of Mdj1pΔ55 with DnaK, we tested the formation of this complex by the sensitive ELISA immunodetection technique (Fig. 3). To do this, we first bound DnaJ or Mdj1pΔ55 to the wells of microtiter plates and, following extensive washing and blocking procedures, added increasing amounts of DnaK. It was previously shown that under these conditions ATP hydrolysis is required for the formation of an efficient DnaK-DnaJ complex (29Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As expected, Mdj1p and DnaJ were only detected in a complex with DnaK in the presence of ATP, while very little complex was detected in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ATPγS, a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue. Surprisingly, we found that Mdj1pΔ55 binds more efficiently to DnaK than DnaJ does (see “Discussion”). DnaJ has been previously shown to participate with DnaK and GrpE in the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase in vitro (31Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 32Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). During this process, DnaJ can act alone to bind to and prevent the aggregation of unfolded firefly luciferase. In the presence of ATP and DnaK, denatured firefly luciferase is further stabilized in a complex containing luciferase, DnaK and DnaJ. The addition of GrpE allows the refolding of firefly luciferase by the efficient disruption of the complex and the recycling of the DnaK and DnaJ chaperones. In a recent study, Westermann et al. (16Westermann B. Gaume B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1996; 16: 7063-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrated an important role of Mdj1p in the prevention of heat-induced firefly luciferase aggregation, indicating that Mdj1p can interact with unfolded firefly luciferase. To demonstrate a direct interaction between Mdj1pΔ55 and unfolded luciferase in vitro, firefly luciferase was denatured in 6 mguanidinium-HCl and its interaction with Mdj1pΔ55 was tested using the sensitive ELISA technique. As shown in Fig.4, Mdj1pΔ55 specifically interacts with denatured firefly luciferase, to an extent comparable to that of DnaJ, suggesting that the ability to bind to unfolded polypeptide proteins has been conserved between these two homologues. Because the formation of a stable complex between denatured firefly luciferase, DnaJ and DnaK is likely an essential step in the refolding of firefly luciferase, we tested whether Mdj1pΔ55 can replace DnaJ in modulating the interaction between denatured firefly luciferase and DnaK. The light scattering experiments, shown in Fig. 5 A, reveal that Mdj1pΔ55 retards the aggregation of denatured firefly luciferase and works cooperatively with DnaK to prevent firefly luciferase aggregation in the presence of ATP. These results were subsequently confirmed by quantifying the levels of soluble firefly luciferase for each reaction (Fig. 5 B). It turned out that in the absence of chaperones approximately 5% of the firefly luciferase was recovered in a soluble form, whereas approximately 80% soluble firefly luciferase was recovered in the presence of either DnaK and DnaJ or DnaK and Mdj1pΔ55. Finally, because we found that the complex containing Mdj1pΔ55 is less stable than that containing DnaJ over a longer period of time (results not shown), we investigated the formation of such complexes by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As expected, a very weak complex was detected between DnaK and denatured firefly luciferase alone, while the addition of either DnaJ or Mdj1pΔ55 allowed the quantitative co-immunoprecipitation of DnaK with denatured firefly luciferase in the presence of ATP (Fig.6). Taken together, our results demonstrate the capacity of Mdj1pΔ55 to stabilize the denatured firefly luciferase-DnaK complex, thus preventing denatured firefly luciferase aggregation.Figure 6Co-immunoprecipitation of DnaK and denatured firefly luciferase in the presence of DnaJ or Mdj1pΔ55.Guanidinium-denatured luciferase (250 nm) and DnaK (250 nm) were preincubated in various reaction mixtures containing 1 mm ATP and DnaJ (250 nm) or Mdj1pΔ55 (250 nm) as indicated. A, denatured luciferase that was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-DnaK antibodies was visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-luciferase antibodies.B, DnaK that was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-luciferase antibodies was visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-DnaK antibodies. Denatured luciferase is abbreviated as “D. Lucif.” on figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that Mdj1pΔ55 can form a stable complex with denatured firefly luciferase and DnaK suggested that Mdj1pΔ55 may be also capable of assisting DnaK in the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase. To investigate this, guanidinium-denatured firefly luciferase was added to a solution containing DnaK and Mdj1pΔ55, at a molar ratio of 1:5:2 (protomers), in the presence of ATP. The firefly luciferase activity was determined following the subsequent addition of GrpE. As seen in Fig.7, Mdj1pΔ55 is capable of assisting DnaK in the reactivation of firefly luciferase to the same extent as DnaJ. In this reaction, the mitochondrial GrpE (Mge1p) was also efficient for firefly luciferase refolding when used instead of GrpE (result not shown), indicating a functional conservation in the ability of these two yeast homologues to stimulate the activity of the heterologous DnaK protein in protein folding reactions. The E. coli DnaK chaperone machine is involved in the regulation of the E. coli heat shock response and bacteriophage λ DNA replication through an association of the ς32 heat shock factor and the λP replication protein, respectively. Subsequent experiments have shown that the ς32 heat shock factor binds more efficiently to DnaJ than it does to DnaK, whereas λP binds more efficiently to DnaK than DnaJ (29Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We tested whether Mdj1pΔ55 could interact with these two seemingly native protein substrates to the same extent as does DnaJ. The interactions of Mdj1pΔ55 or DnaJ with these two substrates were monitored using the ELISA technique described above. It turned out that Mdj1pΔ55 did not interact at all with λP and extremely poorly with ς32 (Fig. 8). These results indicate that, assuming that Mdj1pΔ55 and DnaJ have conserved to a large extent the ability to interact with denatured polypeptide, DnaJ may have evolved further to interact with certain seemingly native proteins, such as the ς32 heat shock factor and the λP replication protein. It has been proposed that protein folding in E. coli is likely mediated by the successive actions of the two DnaK and GroEL chaperone machines (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 34Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In this process the DnaK and DnaJ chaperones are the first to bind to newly synthesized proteins. Then, GrpE is required to release the bound polypeptide substrate, thus recycling DnaK. The released polypeptide can either fold on its own or may necessitate interactions with either the GroEL/GroES chaperone machine or potentially another chaperone(s). The recent identification of all homologues of the DnaK and GroEL chaperone machine members in the mitochondrial matrix of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has suggested an analogous protein folding pathway in this eukaryotic organelle as well (35Langer T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 53-83Google Scholar, 36Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Schmitt M. Langer T. Neupert W. Schwarz E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The binding and release of denatured polypeptides to DnaK is tightly regulated by the DnaJ and GrpE proteins which jointly stimulate its ATPase activity by at least 50-fold (28Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the yeast GrpE homologue (Mge1p) could substitute for its bacterial homologue in vivo and in vitro and that the J-domain of Mdj1p could replace the J-domain of DnaJ, thus ensuring high levels of DnaK activity (14Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that not only Mdj1pΔ55 can functionally interact with DnaK, but interestingly, DnaK can form a more stable complex with Mdj1pΔ55 than it does with DnaJ. It was previously shown that the J-domain of DnaJ is absolutely essential for its interaction with DnaK, and is specifically required for the stimulation of the ATPase activity of the DnaK chaperone (17Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspect that the J-domain of Mdj1p may possess a higher affinity for DnaK than that of DnaJ. In agreement with this, we have shown by genetic means that a chimeric protein consisting of the J-domain of Mdj1pΔ55 fused to the rest of DnaJ acts as “super-DnaJ” protein, capable of substituting for all of DnaJs functions in an E. coli cell, albeit at much lower concentrations than DnaJ (15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with its DnaJ bacterial counterpart, various studies indicate that Mdj1p is a chaperone on its own right. For example, two recent studies reported that Mdj1p can significantly retard the heat-induced aggregation of luciferase and allow the binding of denatured luciferase to Ssc1p (16Westermann B. Gaume B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1996; 16: 7063-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Schmitt M. Langer T. Neupert W. Schwarz E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, in agreement with these findings, we showed that Mdj1pΔ55 cooperatively interacts with DnaK to prevent the aggregation of guanidinium-denatured firefly luciferase, as well as its subsequent refolding in the presence of GrpE. Clearly these results indicate that DnaJ and Mdj1pΔ55 have conserved the ability to functionally interact with denatured luciferase and DnaK. Nevertheless, we did find a strong difference in the behavior of DnaJ and Mdj1pΔ55 toward the ς32 heat shock factor and the λP replication protein, notably that Mdj1pΔ55 binds much less efficiently to these substrates. In this context, it is worth noting that denatured firefly luciferase and ς32 most likely bind with differential affinities to various sites on DnaJ, since the deletion of the Cys-rich region of DnaJ drastically reduces its interaction with unfolded luciferase, while its interaction with ς32 is largely unaffected (22Banecki B.

This finding strongly suggests a specificity of DnaJ toward its interactions with certain seemingly native proteins. Finally, the demonstrated poor interaction of Mdj1pΔ55 with ς32 explains our previous finding, namely that Mdj1pΔ55 cannot substitute for DnaJ in the down-regulation the heat shock response in E. coli (15Deloche O. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6066-6075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Elisabeth Schwarz for the kind gift of the cloned MDJ1 gene and G.

https://openalex.org/W1965325498,"Bacteriophage T4 RNase H is a 5′- to 3′-nuclease that has exonuclease activity on RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes and can remove the pentamer RNA primers made by the T4 primase-helicase (Hollingsworth, H. C., and Nossal, N. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1888–1897; Hobbs, L. J., and Nossal, N. G. (1996)J. Bacteriol. 178, 6772–6777). Here we show that this exonuclease degrades duplex DNA nonprocessively, releasing a single oligonucleotide (nucleotides 1–4) with each interaction with the substrate. Degradation continues nonprocessively until the enzyme stops 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the substrate. T4 gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein strongly stimulates the exonuclease activity of T4 RNase H, converting it into a processive nuclease that removes multiple short oligonucleotides with a combined length of 10–50 nucleotides each time it binds to the duplex substrate. 32 protein must bind on single-stranded DNA behind T4 RNase H for processive degradation. T4 RNase H also has a flap endonuclease activity that cuts preferentially on either side of the junction between single- and double-stranded DNA in flap and fork DNA structures. In contrast to the exonuclease, the endonuclease is inhibited completely by 32 protein binding to the single strand of the flap substrate. These results suggest an important role for T4 32 protein in controlling T4 RNase H degradation of RNA primers and adjacent DNA during each lagging strand cycle. Bacteriophage T4 RNase H is a 5′- to 3′-nuclease that has exonuclease activity on RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes and can remove the pentamer RNA primers made by the T4 primase-helicase (Hollingsworth, H. C., and Nossal, N. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1888–1897; Hobbs, L. J., and Nossal, N. G. (1996)J. Bacteriol. 178, 6772–6777). Here we show that this exonuclease degrades duplex DNA nonprocessively, releasing a single oligonucleotide (nucleotides 1–4) with each interaction with the substrate. Degradation continues nonprocessively until the enzyme stops 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the substrate. T4 gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein strongly stimulates the exonuclease activity of T4 RNase H, converting it into a processive nuclease that removes multiple short oligonucleotides with a combined length of 10–50 nucleotides each time it binds to the duplex substrate. 32 protein must bind on single-stranded DNA behind T4 RNase H for processive degradation.

In contrast to the exonuclease, the endonuclease is inhibited completely by 32 protein binding to the single strand of the flap substrate. These results suggest an important role for T4 32 protein in controlling T4 RNase H degradation of RNA primers and adjacent DNA during each lagging strand cycle. During the replication of duplex DNA, the synthesis of the discontinuous lagging strand fragments is initiated by short RNA primers that must subsequently be removed and replaced by DNA. In the bacteriophage T4 system, the pentamer RNA primers made by the T4 primase-helicase are removed by a phage-encoded enzyme with RNase H activity that has been called T4 RNase H (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of this nuclease showed that it also had 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity on double-stranded (ds) 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double- stranded. 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double- stranded. DNA, raising the possibility that some DNA adjacent to the RNA primers is removed from the lagging strand fragments. In this paper we show that interaction between T4 gene 32 protein and RNase H controls how much DNA is removed each time T4 RNase H binds to its substrate. T4 DNA replication is carried out by a multienzyme system in which T4 DNA polymerase (gene 43) is tethered to the template by the gene 45 clamp protein that has been loaded on the DNA by the gene 44/62 protein complex. The gene 32 single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein covers unwound DNA at the fork and increases the processivity of the lagging strand polymerase. The primase-helicase composed of the gene 61 primase and gene 41 helicase makes the RNA primers on the lagging strand and unwinds the duplex DNA ahead of the leading strand polymerase. The gene 59 helicase assembly protein facilitates the loading of the primase-helicase, especially on DNA covered with 32 protein. After removal of the primer and perhaps adjacent DNA by RNase H, lagging strand fragments are joined by DNA ligase (gene 30) (for review, see Ref. 2Nossal N.G. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar). The genes for these T4 DNA replication proteins were identified in early screens for T4 mutants with phenotypes of arrested, delayed, or no DNA synthesis (3Epstein R.H. Bolle A. Steinberg C.M. Kellenberger E. Boy de la Tour E. Chevalley R. Edgar R.S. Susman M. Denhardt G.H. Lielausis A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 375-392Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, T4 phage with a deletion within thernh gene encoding T4 RNase H can replicate in a wild typeEscherichia coli host (4Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the rnhmutant phage cannot replicate in a host with the polA12mutation, which disrupts coordination between the polymerase and 5′- to 3′-nuclease activities of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Wild type T4 phage production is not decreased by the polA12mutation and/or by mutations in E. coli RNase HI. Thus T4 RNase H is able to sustain the high rate of T4 DNA replication in the absence of the enzymes that can remove RNA primers in the uninfected host. Although these host enzymes can substitute for T4 RNase H, replication is slower and less accurate in the absence of the phage nuclease. T4 RNase H also plays a role in DNA repair and recombination. The rnh mutant T4 phage is more sensitive than the wild type to ultraviolet radiation and to 4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide, an aminoacridine inhibitor of T4 topoisomerase (5Woodworth D.L. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 RNase H has sequence similarity to other enzymes with a demonstrated role in removing RNA primers, including phage T7 gene 6 exonuclease, the 5′- to 3′-nuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and human FEN-1 (flap endonuclease; also called MF-1 or RAD2 analog). All of these enzymes have 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity on both RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes. In addition, most of the enzymes have a flap endonuclease activity that removes the 5′-ssDNA tail of flap or fork structures (6Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a large number of acidic amino acids that are highly conserved in this enzyme family are located in a cleft surrounding two Mg2+ ions in the proposed active site of the nuclease. (The sequence similarity and the structure of T4 RNase H are described in detail in Ref. 11Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C.

Our long range goals are to determine how primer removal by T4 RNase H is coordinated with other steps in lagging and leading strand synthesis and to understand what controls how much DNA is removed along with the RNA primer. In this paper, we show that T4 RNase H also has a flap endonuclease activity. We have characterized the exonuclease and flap nuclease activities of T4 RNase H alone and in conjunction with the T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein. We find that the exonuclease cuts duplex DNA from the 5′-end, releasing short oligonucleotide products until it reaches 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end. This exonuclease activity is nonprocessive but becomes processive in the presence of the gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein, removing short products with a combined length of 10–50 nucleotides in a single encounter with the DNA. Binding of 32 protein to the single strand of the flap prevents cleavage by the T4 RNase H endonuclease. Wild type T4 RNase H was purified to apparent homogeneity as described by Nossal et al. (13Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The T4 polymerase accessory proteins 44/62 and 45, and the T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein preparations used were those described in Hollingsworth and Nossal (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of wild type T4 DNA polymerase is described by Spacciapoli and Nossal (14Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 438-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 34-mer RNA and DNA (LH5), complementary to nucleotides 3493–3526 of M13mp19 viral ssDNA, and the 84-base DNA complementary to nucleotides 6197–6281 were made on an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer. The oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to the M13 DNA, and separated from ATP and free oligonucleotide on Sepharose CL-2B as described previously (15Venkatesan M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12435-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides annealed to M13 ssDNA were 3′-end labeled by the exonuclease− mutant of T4 DNA polymerase (D219A) (16Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 34-mer was extended to a 36-mer by the addition of 2[α-32P]dCMP and the 84-mer to an 86-mer with 2[α-32P]dTMP. The following oligonucleotides, used to make the flap, fork, and related substrates (see Fig. 2), were synthesized and reverse phase purified by Cruachem.

Complementary oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 m NaCl were heated to 100 °C for 3 min, 67 °C for 60 min, and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Unless otherwise indicated, reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 1.8 nm substrate, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 63 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Proteins were diluted in a solution containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, except that MgCl2 was omitted for enzymes used in reactions initiated by adding Mg2+ or in which Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+. The concentrations of T4 RNase H are indicated in the figure legends. When present, gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein was 1 μm. Unless otherwise indicated, reaction mixtures without T4 RNase H were incubated for 2 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was begun by the addition of the nuclease. Aliquots were taken at the times indicated, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of equal volumes of a solution of 83% (v/v) formamide, 0.01% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue, and 33 mm EDTA. Products were fractionated on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels (19:1) unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Gels were exposed to Kodak XAR or BMR film, and the films were scanned and band intensities determined using the dv1 program and scanner from PDI, Inc. A gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the binding of T4 RNase H to a variety of substrates. The DNA (2 nm flap, fork, nick, ss 34-mer, or ss 14-mer shown in Fig. 2 or the ds 34-mer formed from LH5 and its complement) was allowed to bind to the indicated concentration of T4 RNase H in 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 63 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C for 5 min. The reactions were then placed on ice, and 2 μl of 15% glycerol was added. The reactions were loaded on 6% DNA retardation gels in 1/2 × TBE (Novex) and electrophoresed for 40 min at a constant voltage of 100 V at 4 °C. The gels were dried on DE81 paper before autoradiography. The substrate was the 34-mer LH5 annealed to M13 circular ssDNA and 3′-end labeled by adding two [α-32P]dCMP. In the control reaction in the absence of competitor DNA, 1.4 nm T4 RNase H was incubated with 1.5 nm substrate for 2 min at 30 °C in the nuclease reaction mixture described above, except that magnesium acetate was omitted. The reaction was started by adding Mg2+ to 6.25 mm, and samples were taken at 0.25 and 2 min. In other reactions, competitor DNA (200 nm, φX174 ssDNA) was added as a trap to prevent the nuclease from rebinding to the substrate. The competitor DNA was added either at the same time as the labeled substrate or at the same time as the Mg2+ was added to begin the reaction or 0.25 min after the reaction had started. To study the processivity of the exonuclease activity in the presence of the T4 gene 32 protein, similar experiments were performed except that samples were taken at 0.5, 2, or 5 min, as indicated in the figure legends. In this case the substrate was the 84-mer annealed to M13mp19, 3′-end labeled by adding two [α-32P]dTMP. The competitor DNA was the fork described above, at a final concentration of 22.9 μm. T4 RNase H and 32 protein were present at 6.8 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Where indicated, the labeled substrate was cut within the M13 multicloning site bySmaI endonuclease (New England Biolabs), and the protein was removed by phenol extraction. Although T4 RNase H was originally purified on the basis of its RNase H activity, the enzyme also acts as a 5′- to 3′-nuclease on DNA·DNA duplexes (1Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have compared these two activities directly by using RNA and DNA 34-base oligonucleotides with the same sequence (Fig.1 A). When annealed to the complementary region of M13 viral ssDNA, the 5′-end-labeled RNA and DNA oligomers were degraded to short oligonucleotides, mainly monomers to tetramers (panels C and D). There was no detectable degradation of the free RNA and very little degradation of the free DNA 34-mer (panels A and B). T4 RNase H made the initial cut on the RNA and DNA 34-base oligonucleotides in a blunt end duplex at the same rate as on the duplexes formed by annealing the same oligonucleotides to the circular M13 DNA (Fig. 1 B). The products formed depended on both the sequence and whether the substrate was RNA or DNA. The products from the 34-mer DNA with the 5′-end sequence ACCAATCA (top strandin Fig. 1 B), annealed to M13 DNA (panel E) or its 34-mer complement (panel D) were mainly dimers and trimers. In contrast, the complementary DNA 34-mer (bottom strand) with the 5′-end sequence AATGATAA gave predominantly pentamers (panel C). Although there are clearly preferential cutting sites (see Fig. 4 A below), it is not yet clear how these are determined. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was also a difference in the size distribution of the products from the 5′-end of RNA and DNA with the same sequence (compare panels A with E, and B with D. Finally, the product size distribution changed with the reaction temperature. The ratio of tri- to dinucleotide products from the substrate shown in panel E(Fig. 1 B) increased from 1.0 at room temperature to 5.8 at 45 °C (see Fig. 6 in the accompanying paper (12Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)).Figure 6T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein converts T4 RNase H from a nonprocessive to a processive nuclease. A, T4 RNase H exonuclease is nonprocessive. The enzyme (1.4 nm) was incubated with substrate (1.5 nm 3′-end-labeled 36-mer annealed to M13 DNA) for 2 min at 30 °C in the absence of Mg2+, and the reaction was started by adding magnesium acetate to 6.25 mm. Unlabeled competitor DNA (200 nm circular ΦX174 ssDNA) was added either with the labeled substrate (lanes 3 and 4), with Mg2+ (lanes 5 and 6), or 0.25 min after the Mg2+ (lane 2). A control reaction without competitor is shown in lanes 7 and 8. T4 RNase H made only one cut, releasing a short oligonucleotide product before being trapped by the competitor DNA (compare lanes 5and 6 with lane 1, and lane 2 withlane 7). Products are displayed on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. B, T4 RNase H is processive in the presence of 32 protein. Processivity was determined by the protocol described in A, except that the substrate was the 3′-labeled 86-mer annealed to M13 DNA, described in Fig. 5. T4 RNase H (6.8 nm) was present alone (lanes 2–8) or with 1 μm32 protein (lanes 9–15). Unlabeled competitor fork DNA (see Fig. 2) was added at 22.9 μm either before Mg2+ (lanes 4, 5, 11, and12), with the Mg2+ added to start the reaction (lanes 6, 7, 13, and 14), or 0.5 min after the Mg2+ (lanes 8 and15). Control reactions without competitor DNA are inlanes 2, 3, 9, and 10. The products are displayed on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The positions of size markers are shown on the right. Comparison of lanes 13 and 14 indicates that the degradation of the 86-mer continued for more than 0.5 min after the addition of competitor in the reactions with 32 protein. The size of the residual 3′-labeled substrate shows that between 10 and 50 nucleotides had been removed from the 5′-end at the end of 2 min (lane 14). There was no further degradation between 2 and 5 min under these conditions (see Fig. 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) T4 RNase H cut a 20-base 5′-tail on flap DNA (Fig. 2, panel D) or fork DNA (panel E) at positions near the branch point, giving mainly products of 19 and 21 bases. In these experiments we used the same flap sequence used previously to characterize murine FEN-1 (6Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to compare directly these enzymes which, as indicated in the Introduction, are related in both function and amino acid sequence. In contrast to the T4 enzyme, murine FEN-1 cut this flap 100 times faster than the corresponding fork structure (6Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, calf thymus FEN-1 has been reported to cut fork structures with other sequences (18Murante R.S. Rumbaugh J.A. Barnes C.J. Norton J.R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under reaction conditions where the T4 nuclease cut a 34-base blunt end duplex (Fig. 1 B), it did not cut the shorter blunt end duplex made by a 16-base oligonucleotide in a partial hybrid (Fig. 2,panel A), nicked (panel B), or flap structure (panel C). It did cut short duplexes (14 bases) in which there was either a ss (panel G) or ds (panel F) extension behind the 5′-end, which presumably acted as an attachment site for the enzyme. However, at the very high enzyme and DNA concentrations used to prepare crystals, there was detectable degradation of a 16-base duplex (data not shown). A gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the binding of different types of substrates to T4 RNase H (Fig.3). We studied this binding in the absence of Mg2+ ions to prevent the degradation of DNA substrates. Under these conditions, there was significant binding to the fork and flap DNA at a T4 RNase H concentration of 5.6 nm (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, at a 100-fold higher enzyme concentration (560 nm) there was little binding to the ds (Fig. 3 A) or nicked (Fig. 3 B) DNA and no detectable binding to the ss 34-mer (Fig. 3 A) or 14-mer (Fig. 3 B). After removing a short oligonucleotide product from the 5′-end, T4 RNase H continued to remove other short products until it reached 8–11 nucleotides from the 3′-end (Fig.4 A). The enzyme stopped because the substrate was too short, not because it reached a refractory sequence. When 9 unlabeled nucleotides were added to the substrate by concurrent incubation with T4 DNA polymerase and 3 dNTPs, the label at the 3′-end of the original substrate became internal and was subsequently degraded to very short (1–4 bases) products (Fig.4 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). There was some mononucleotide formed by the 3′- to 5′-exonuclease of wild type T4 polymerase (lane 2), but the products of 2–4 bases were found only when both T4 RNase H and polymerase were present (lane 3). Similar T4 RNase H products were found when wild type T4 DNA polymerase was replaced by the exonuclease-defective (D219A) polymerase (lane 5). The rate of degradation of a 3′-end-labeled 86-mer by T4 RNase H was greatly increased by T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein (Fig.5). With 3′-labeled substrates, the stimulation by 32 protein was observed over a wide range of T4 RNase H concentrations, with either a hydroxyl or a phosphate group at the 5′-end (Fig. 5, left and center panels). Only the first product released can be observed when the substrate is 5′-end-labeled (right panel). Because T4 RNase H becomes processive in the presence of 32 protein (see below), there was an apparent inhibition by 32 protein when the 5′-labeled substrate (1 nm) was present at a higher concentration than T4 RNase H (Fig. 5, lanes 20 and 21). The nuclease, which remained bound for a longer time on its initial substrate in the presence of 32 protein, was not available to cut other DNA molecules. To determine whether T4 RNase H is a processive exonuclease, we used the 3′-end-labeled 36-mer annealed to M13 as the substrate and a 133-fold molar excess of φX174 circular ssDNA as a competitor to prevent the enzyme from rebinding to the substrate (Fig.6 A). The enzyme was incubated with the labeled substrate in the absence of Mg2+, and the reaction was started by adding Mg2+. In the absence of competitor, enzyme can bind repeatedly to the substrate, and there was extensive degradation within 2 min (lanes 7 and8). In the control reaction, where T4 RNase H was allowed to bind to the substrate in the presence of the cold competitor DNA and the reaction was started with Mg2+, there was almost no reaction (lanes 3 and 4). In the reaction in which competitor and Mg2+ were added simultaneously, products 1–4 bases shorter than the initial substrate were formed at the first time point of 0.25 min (lane 5), and there was no further degradation at 2 min (lane 6). Because T4 RNase H removed oligonucleotides of 1–4 bases with a single cut from the 5′-end of this substrate (Fig. 1), the limited degradation in the reaction shown in lanes 5 and 6 indicates that the enzyme made only one cut, fell off the DNA, and was then trapped by the cold competitor. When the reaction was allowed to proceed for 0.25 min before competitor was added, the products at 2 min (lane 2) were 1–4 bases shorter than those present at 0.25 min (lane 7). We conclude that T4 RNase H makes only a single cut each time it binds to the substrate. Similar experiments showed that T4 RNase H becomes much more processive in the presence of the gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein (Fig. 6 B). We used fork DNA as the cold competitor in these experiments because it bound tightly to T4 RNase H (see Fig.3 A). The control reactions in Figs. 6 B and7 indicated that the fork DNA effectively trapped unbound nuclease for a longer time than the circular ssDNA used as a competitor in Fig. 6 A. When T4 RNase H and gene 32 protein were allowed to bind to the 3′-end-labeled 86-mer·M13 substrate, and the reaction was started by the addition of Mg2+ and competitor fork DNA, nuclease that was already bound to the substrate continued to degrade it to shorter products (lanes 13 and 14, Fig. 6 B). This is in striking contrast to the reactions without 32 protein, in which the digestion in the presence of trap was terminated after a single 1–4-base oligonucleotide was removed (Fig. 6 A, lanes 5 and 6). Although there was no apparent degradation in reactions with T4 RNase H alone in Fig. 6 B (lanes 6 and 7), this gel would not have separated the 86-mer substrate from products that were only 1–4 bases shorter. When both T4 RNase H and 32 protein were present, most of the remaining 3′-labeled substrate was between 34 and 74 bases at 2 min (Fig. 6 B,lane 14), indicating that T4 RNase H removed 10–50 bases from the 5′-end during a single binding to the substrate. There was no further degradation between 2 and 5 min (Fig. 7, lanes 12and 13). The control reaction B (Fig. 6 B,lanes 11 and 12) confirmed that the fork DNA acted as an effective trap, blocking the exonuclease reaction when it was added before the Mg2+. The time course in the absence of competitor showed some products of intermediate size as well as the initial substrate and short limit products. It is likely that the nuclease remained bound to these intermediate sized products because those present at 0.5 min in the absence of competitor (lane 9) were degraded further to shorter products after competitor was added at 0.5 min, and the reaction then stopped at 2 min (lane 15). Thus 32 protein greatly increased the processivity of T4 RNase H but did not eliminate pausing by the nuclease at discrete positions on the substrate. 32 protein can bind both behind the 5′-end and ahead of the 3′-end of the duplex region of the substrate (Figs. 6 and 7). To determine whether it was necessary for 32 protein to bind behind the 5′-end of the duplex to stimulate T4 RNase H, we used a linear blunt end substrate made by cutting the 3′-labeled 86-mer annealed to M13 DNA with SmaI endonuclease (Fig. 7). When T4 RNase H and the fork DNA trap were added together, there was no processive degradation on this blunt end, 76-base partial duplex, (Fig. 7, compare the reaction containing T4 RNase H and 32 protein with the circular substrate (lanes 12 and 13) with that on the linear DNA substrates (lanes 26 and 27)). Note that 32 protein did stimulate degradation of the linear DNA in the absence of trap (lanes 22 and 23). In this case, nonprocessive degradation by T4 RNase H exposed a ss region behind the 5′-end of the remaining duplex, to which the 32 protein could then bind to stimulate the nuclease. In contrast to its stimulation of the 5′-exonuclease activity, 32 protein prevented T4 RNase H from cutting at the junction between the ssDNA and dsDNA in flap substrates. Fig.8 (lanes 6–9) shows that 32 protein completely inhibited the flap endonuclease activity on the substrate with a 20-base tail. A similar inhibition was observed with a flap with a 30-base tail (not shown). In these reactions, 32 protein was present at the same concentration (1 μm) which stimulated the exonuclease reaction (Figs. 6 and 7), but the ratio of 32 protein to ssDNA nucleotides in the flap substrate was much greater. However, when enough M13 ssDNA was added to this reaction to give the same ratio of 32 protein to ssDNA which had been used in the exonuclease reactions, the flap nuclease was still inhibited completely (not shown). T4 RNase H belongs to a family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5′-nucleases that are required to remove the RNA primers initiating lagging strand fragments during DNA replication (for review, see Refs.1Hollingsworth H.C.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mutation of the genes encoding these enzymes leads to defects in DNA repair as well as DNA replication (4Hobbs L.J. Nossal N.G. J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There is significant amino acid sequence similarity within this family, ranging from phage to humans. In T4 RNase H, the most highly conserved residues are clustered in a cleft surrounding two Mg2+ in the crystal structure of the enzyme (11Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The cleft is not quite large enough to hold an RNA·DNA or DNA·DNA duplex. The cleft may open in solution to hold the duplex. Alternatively, it may serve as a tunnel to hold the ss branch of the flap structures cut by this class of enzymes and as an exit path for the short oligonucleotide products of its 5′-nuclease activity on simple duplexes. Mutational analysis indicates that the residues surrounding the first Mg2+(Mg2+-1) in this structure are essential for catalytic activity (12Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This paper shows that T4 RNase H makes the first cut from the 5′-end of RNA·DNA and DNA·DNA duplexes at similar rates and that degradation continues until there is a limit oligonucleotide product of 8–11 bases, which is too short to form a stable duplex (Figs. 1 and 4). Our finding that the size of the oligonucleotides released from the 5′-end of the duplex depends on the sequence (Fig. 1) and increases with increasing reaction temperature (Fig. 6 in the accompanying paper (12Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) is consistent with the possibility that destabilizing the duplex allows more of the 5′-end of the strand to move into the cleft, past the catalytic site. In flap or fork structures with 5′-ended single strands of 20 bases, T4 RNase H cuts the phosphodiester bonds near the branch point to give 19- and 21-mer products (Fig. 2). Other 5′- to 3′-nucleases in this family, including E. coli DNA polymerase I, T5 D15 nuclease, and the eukaryotic FEN-1 proteins have been shown to cut at or near the branch point (7Harrington J.J.

Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The flap endonuclease activity of T4 RNase H is inhibited by 32 protein (Fig. 8). Thus 32 protein would be expected to protect flap DNA structures that may be generated during recombination (for review, see Ref. 24Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It is likely that some DNA adjacent to the RNA primers is removed during lagging strand processing because all of these enzymes can degrade both RNA·DNA and DNA· DNA duplexes. This would clearly improve the fidelity of eukaryotic replication, in which the inaccurate DNA polα polymerase-primase makes the RNA primer and extends it with a short stretch of DNA (for review, see Ref. 25Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In T4 DNA replication, the pentamer RNA primer made by the primase-helicase is extended by T4 DNA polymerase. Although this polymerase is extremely accurate in copying DNA templates (for review, see Ref. 26Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), it may make more errors as it begins elongating the RNA primer. Our finding that the T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein stimulates the 5′-nuclease of T4 RNase H by converting it to a processive enzyme (Fig.6) suggests a mechanism for controlling how much DNA is removed along with the RNA primers. 32 protein must be behind the RNase H on the 5′-end of the chain to stimulate the nuclease activity because there was no increased processivity on blunt end duplexes (Fig. 7). The ssDNA that is behind each lagging strand primer at the replication fork would be covered by 32 protein, whose concentration in the T4-infected cell is regulated to match the concentration of ssDNA (27Russel M. Gold L. Morrissett H. O'Farrell P.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7263-7270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.9). Thus, each time T4 RNase H binds to the end of the lagging strand fragment, it would cut processively, removing 10–50 nucleotides. In the presence of 32 protein, T4 RNase H bound repeatedly to a simple partial duplex, degrading it rapidly to a short chain of 8–11 bases (Fig. 5). However at the replication fork, a consideration of the different rates of polymerization and nuclease digestion suggests that the nuclease would be limited to single round of processive degradation on each lagging strand fragment. When T4 45 protein clamps T4 DNA polymerase on a ssDNA template covered with 32 protein, the polymerase copies the template at 200–300 nucleotides/s at 30 °C (for review, see Ref. 2Nossal N.G. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar). Thus, synthesis of a 2,000-base lagging strand fragment would take about 10 s. In contrast, on a partial hybrid covered with 32 protein, T4 RNase H took more than 30 s to remove 10–50 nucleotides before being released from the substrate, giving a rate of 1–2 nucleotides/s (Fig. 6). During this time T4 polymerase could completely copy the ssDNA between adjacent fragments, creating a nick that would be sealed by DNA ligase. Our recent studies of the interaction of T4 RNase H with other proteins in the T4 replication system are in agreement with this prediction of a single round of T4 RNase H digestion during each lagging strand cycle. We find that 10–50 nucleotides are removed from the downstream fragment before ligation either in model reactions on gapped DNA substrates with T4 RNase H, DNA polymerase, polymerase accessory proteins (gene 45 polymerase clamp and gene 44/62 clamp loader), 32 protein and DNA ligase, or during coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis by the complete T4 DNA replication system. 2M. Bhagwat and N. G. Nossal, in preparation. Inhibition of the flap endonuclease activity of T4 RNase H by 32 protein does not create problems for the T4 DNA replication system. Our recent studies2 show that there is little strand displacement synthesis on the lagging strand by wild type T4 DNA polymerase with the polymerase accessory proteins and 32 protein. Moreover, in similar reactions with the exonuclease-defective T4 DNA polymerase, in which there is more strand displacement synthesis, T4 RNase H is able to cut short flaps.

https://openalex.org/W2017075491,"We have used a set of bacteriophage λ andEscherichia coli replication proteins to establish rolling circle DNA replication in vitro to permit characterization of the functional properties of λ replication forks. We demonstrate that the λ replication fork assembly synthesizes leading strand DNA chains at a physiological rate of 650–750 nucleotides/s at 30 °C. This rate is identical to the fork movement rate we obtained using a minimal protein system, composed solely of E. coli DnaB helicase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that these two key bacterial replication proteins constitute the basic functional unit of a λ replication fork. A comparison of rolling circle DNA replication in the minimal and λ replication systems indicated that DNA synthesis proceeded for more extensive periods in the λ system and produced longer DNA chains, which averaged nearly 200 kilobases in length. The higher potency of the λ replication system is believed to result from its capacity to mediate efficient reloading of DnaB helicase onto rolling circle replication products, thereby permitting reinitiation of DNA chain elongation following spontaneous termination events. E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein and primase individually stimulated rolling circle DNA replication, but they apparently act indirectly by blocking accumulation of inhibitory free single-stranded DNA product. Finally, in the course of this work, we discovered thatE. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is itself capable of carrying out significant strand displacement DNA synthesis at about 50 nucleotides/s when it is supplemented with E. colisingle-stranded DNA-binding protein.

Investigations of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the initiation of bacteriophage λ DNA replication have been aided by the reconstitution of the initiation reaction with a defined set of purified λ and Escherichia coli proteins (1Mensa-Wilmot K.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that an ordered series of nucleoprotein structures are assembled at oriλ, the viral replication origin, and subsequently partially disassembled during the establishment of the apparatus responsible for replication fork propagation (2Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol.

McMacken R. Echols H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10719-10725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in the initiation pathway consists of the binding of multiple copies of the λ O protein to the viral origin and the subsequent self-assembly of this replication initiator into a nucleoprotein structure called the O-some (6Tsurimoto T. Matsubara K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1789-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Dodson M. Roberts J. McMacken R. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4678-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The O-some both localizes the origin and serves as the foundation for the assembly of more complex nucleoprotein structures. Simultaneously, in solution, several molecules of the λ P protein bind to the hexameric E. coli DnaB helicase, to form a P·DnaB complex (8Wickner S.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1979; 43: 303-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klein A. Lanka E. Schuster H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Mallory J.B. Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13297-13307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One or more molecules of this latter complex binds to the O-some, as a consequence of specific protein-protein interactions between O and P, to form a second stage nucleoprotein structure containing O, P, and DnaB. Protein-protein interactions within thisoriλ·O·P·DnaB structure prevent release and activation of the helicase activity of the DnaB molecule or molecules present in the complex (7Dodson M. Roberts J.

This protein turnover reaction results in the release of a portion of the bound P and DnaJ proteins, as well as the liberation of DnaB and activation of its intrinsic helicase activity (4Alfano C.

S. A. 1986; 83: 7638-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If theoriλ template DNA is sufficiently negatively supercoiled, the released DnaB is inserted between the two DNA strands, presumably at the A + T-rich region of oriλ (7Dodson M. Roberts J.

The transfer of DnaB helicase onto the DNA template completes the initiation phase of λ DNA replication and triggers a second series of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that culminate in assembly of the replication fork apparatus. The precise assembly pathway remains to be defined, but it is believed to include the following course of events. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); SSB, E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein; DNA pol IIIh, E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; RCR, rolling circle replication; TNC DNA, tailed, nicked circular DNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin. created by DnaB helicase action is stabilized by the binding of stoichiometric quantities of the E. coli single-stranded-DNA binding protein (SSB) (3Alfano C.

Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4190-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and subsequently synthesizes short RNA chains that serve as primers for synthesis of the leading and lagging DNA strands by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (DNA pol IIIh) (3Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10699-10708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15McMacken R. Ueda K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4190-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of λ DNA replication in vitro have demonstrated that detectable levels of O, P, and DnaK remain associated with the oriλ template DNA following the chaperone-mediated partial disassembly reactions that bring about initiation of λ DNA replication (4Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is still uncertain if one or more of these proteins is associated with the λ replication fork apparatus. Although none of the evidence available to date suggests a direct role for the λ O and P replication proteins or the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system in the propagation of replication forks during λ DNA replication (4Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there remains a possibility that one or more of these proteins that act during the initiation phase of the reaction have an auxiliary role during the fork movement phase. We wished, therefore, to characterize the properties of replication forks established by the λ O and P proteins for comparison to the behavior of replication forks established with E. colireplication proteins. To study replication fork assembly and movement, we adapted the rolling circle replication assay pioneered by Lechner and Richardson (18Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which a tailed, nicked circular (TNC) DNA molecule serves as the replication template. With this assay, we can take advantage of the capacity of the λ O and P proteins to mediate the transfer of DnaB helicase onto any ssDNA, even if the ssDNA is stoichiometrically coated with SSB (19LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3069-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20LeBowitz J.H. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A primary benefit of the rolling circle replication system for studies of the propagation of λ replication forks is that there are no topological constraints to encumber fork movement. This is in sharp contrast to the situation encountered with the standard oriλ plasmid replication assay, in which the rate of fork movement is probably limited by the rate at which topoisomerases relax the positive supercoils generated during replication of a covalently closed, circular template (21Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6877-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that the λ O and P replication proteins efficiently mediate the formation of robust replication fork assemblies. Such “λ replication forks” synthesize greater than 100 kb of DNA at rates approaching 750 nucleotides/s at 30 °C. This rate is indistinguishable from the rate of movement of replication forks established by a minimal two-protein system composed of DnaB helicase and DNA pol IIIh.

Biol. 1982; 162: 729-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), containing the λ origin of DNA replication, into the BamHI site of pEMBL130(+) such that the R (lower) strand of oriλ is inserted into the (+)-strand of the plasmid. M13mp19oriλL was constructed by cloning from pRLM85 a 0.8-kb PstI to SacI fragment, containing oriλ and the majority of the pEMBL130(+) polylinker sequence, into M13mp19 DNA that had been digested with both PstI and SacI, which removed most of the mp19 polylinker sequence. Phage M13K07 (27Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) was a gift of Drs. E. Hildebrand and L. Grossman of this department. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were constructed by automated solid phase synthesis by S. Morrow of this department and were used without further purification. Oligonucleotide RM34 is 5′-CGGACCTGCAGGCAT-3′; it is complementary to (+)-strand DNA at the position of the unique PstI site of M13mp19oriλL. Oligonucleotide RM35 is 5′-AATTCGAGCTCGATAT-3′; it is complementary to (+)-strand DNA at the position of the unique SacI site of M13mp19oriλL. PstI,SacI, KpnI, and BamHI restriction endonucleases and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. Calf intestine phosphatase, proteinase K, and DNase I were from Boehringer Mannheim. S1 nuclease was from Pharmacia. HomogeneousE. coli UvrD protein (15,000 units/mol) (28Runyon G.T. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17502-17512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Drs. Jaya Yodh and Randy Bryant of this department. Antibody directed against E. coli UvrD protein was graciously donated by Drs. Robert Lahue and Paul Modrich (Duke University). The β-subunit of the E. coli DNA pol IIIh was kindly provided by Dr. Mike O'Donnell (Rockefeller University). All λ and E. coli replication proteins used were estimated to be greater than 95% pure. Purification and specific activities of the λ O and P replication proteins and the E. coli DnaJ, DnaK, DnaG primase, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme proteins have been described previously (1Mensa-Wilmot K. Seaby R. Alfano C. Wold M.C. Gomes B. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2853-2861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some preparations of DNA pol IIIh (3 × 105 units/mg) were purified from SK6776 (uvrD) essentially as described (29McHenry C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6478-6484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III* was purified by a modification of the published protocol (30Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a procedure developed by Dr. M. O'Donnell (Rockefeller University).E. coli SSB (7 × 104 units/mg) was purified from strain RLM727 (HfrH/pRLM55) by a modification of the protocol of LeBowitz (25.LeBowitz, J. (1985) Biochemical Mechanisms of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage λ DNA Replication. Ph.D. dissertation, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.Google Scholar). Briefly, the blue dextran-Sepharose column was replaced by a ssDNA cellulose column prepared as described by Alberts (31Alberts B.M. Amodio F.J. Jenkins M. Gutmann E.D. Ferris F.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Approximately 57.5 mg of fraction II protein (>95% SSB) was diluted with buffer A (minus NaCl) to a conductivity equivalent to buffer A and applied at 3 column volumes/h to an ssDNA cellulose column (150 ml, 5.75 mg ssDNA/ml) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.25 m NaCl until the absorbance at 280 nm approached zero. Bound SSB was eluted with buffer A containing 2 m NaCl and purified further by chromatography on hydroxyapatite as described (25.LeBowitz, J. (1985) Biochemical Mechanisms of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage λ DNA Replication. Ph.D. dissertation, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.Google Scholar). E. coliGrpE protein (6.4 × 105 units/mg) was purified essentially as described by Zylicz et al. (32Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the strain used was C600dnaK103/pJK23 (23Lipinska B. King J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 15: 7545-7562Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E. coli DnaB protein was purified from 300 g of thermally induced RLM861 by a modification2 of the protocol of Ueda et al. (33Ueda K. McMacken R. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 261-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the 0.24 ammonium sulfate and two 0.20 ammonium sulfate backwashes of the 0–40% ammonium sulfate precipitate, the residual protein precipitate was resuspended in 18 ml of buffer A (fraction II, 27 ml, 1070 mg, 4.7 × 107units). A 4-ml portion of fraction II (160 mg of protein) was diluted 3-fold with buffer A and applied to a 75-ml ATP-Sepharose column that had been prepared by the technique of Lamed (34Lamed R. Levin Y. Oplatka A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the amount of adipic dihydrazide used as a linker ligand was reduced 10-fold to 0.9 g/100 ml. This modification resulted in lowered amounts of ATP covalently linked to the Sepharose matrix (typically 1 μmol of ATP/ml of gel matrix), a reduction that correlated with improved stability of DnaB protein eluted from the ATP affinity column. 3K. Stephens and R. McMacken, unpublished data. The ATP-Sepharose column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A, followed by 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm AMP. DnaB protein was subsequently eluted with buffer A with 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (fraction III, 11 mg, 2.3 × 106 units). Fraction III was applied to a 7-ml DEAE-Sephacel column that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 0.15m NaCl, followed by 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. DnaB was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl (fraction IV, 6 mg, 3.4 × 106 units). The plasmid pEMBL130(+) was propagated in the ssDNA form by superinfection of 71-18/pEMBL130(+) cells with the helper phage M13K07 by the method of Dente et al. (27Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). M13mp19oriλL was propagated in the E. colistrain 71-18; phage particles were isolated from the cell-free supernatant as described (35Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Phage DNA was isolated free of contaminating protein and RNA by using a modification of the plasmid isolation protocol of Birnboim and Doly (36Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). Phage prepared from a 1-liter culture of infected E. coli, as described above, were resuspended in 5 ml of TE buffer and denatured by the addition of 10 ml of a solution containing 0.2 m NaOH and 1% SDS. Contaminating protein and RNA was precipitated by the addition of 7.5 ml 3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8. Following centrifugation, the DNA remaining in the supernatant was precipitated by an equal volume of ethanol. The pEMBL130(+) ssDNA prepared by this technique is suitable for digestion with restriction enzymes. For some preparations of the tailed rolling circle DNA template, the circular single-stranded pEMBL130(+) plasmid DNA was isolated free of helper phage DNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The DNA mixture was diluted with high salt gradient buffer and layered onto an 11-ml 5–30% sucrose gradient prepared in high salt gradient buffer (each tube contained a 1-ml cushion of 50% sucrose). The DNA samples were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 16 h at 20 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom, and portions of each fraction were analyzed for the presence of DNA by neutral agarose gel electrophoresis. The fractions free of helper phage DNA were pooled, and the pEMBL130(+) DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The DNA sample (350 μg) was resuspended in 0.5 ml of TE buffer, adjusted to 0.1 m NaOH and applied to a 12-ml Bio-Gel A-15 m column that had been equilibrated with 0.1 mm Tris base. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and subsequently analyzed by neutral agarose gel electrophoresis. The fractions containing the peak of pEMBL130(+) ssDNA were pooled, neutralized by the addition of 119 volume of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8, and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in TE buffer, and the purified circular ssDNA was used for the preparation of tailed DNA circles. The ssDNA 800-nucleotide primer (800-mer) used to form the 5′-tail of the TNC DNA template and helicase substrate was prepared by digesting ssDNA at restriction sites made duplex by the presence of hybridized oligonucleotides. 500 μg of mp19oriλL ssDNA was suspended in 3.2 ml of core buffer and mixed with 42.3 μg of oligonucleotide RM34, 17.3 μg of oligonucleotide RM35,PstI (600 units), and SacI (800 units); the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The 800-mer was isolated free of linear M13mp19 DNA by neutral agarose gel electrophoresis and was recovered from the gel by electroelution using a Schleicher and Schuell Elutrap device. Some preparations of the 800-mer were treated with calf intestine phosphatase before purification by gel electrophoresis. This permits efficient end labeling of the linear strand of the helicase substrate/rolling circle DNA template by T4 polynucleotide kinase for preparation of a labeled size marker. Hybridization of the 800-mer to the pEMBL130(+) ssDNA (the 800-mer contains at its 3′ terminus a 42-nucleotide-long sequence that is complementary to the pEMBL130(+) polylinker) was accomplished by mixing 250 μg of circular ssDNA with 25 μg of the 800-mer in TE buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl in a final volume of 1.25 ml. The mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 min and then immediately supplemented with 1.37 mg of E. coli SSB and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. The final DNA concentration was 0.14 mg/ml and the molar ratio of pEMBL130(+) ssDNA to 800-mer was 2:1. The hybrid was diluted 7.67-fold into φX EDB containing 2.5 mm ATP, 13 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm spermidine chloride, 100 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 16 μg of DNA pol IIIh β-subunit, 81 μg of SSB, and 67,500 units of DNA polymerase III* (φX EDB replication mix). Some template batches were prepared using partially purified DNA pol IIIh ∼(2 × 105 units/mg; Ref. 29McHenry C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6478-6484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) instead of DNA polymerase III* and β-subunit. DNA synthesis was carried out during a 30-min incubation at 30 °C and was terminated by chilling the mixture to 0 °C. In some instances, radiolabeled TNC DNA template was prepared. On these occasions, the replication mixture contained [3H]dNTPs or [α-32P]dNTPs at approximately 100–200 cpm/pmol of dNTP. The TNC DNA product was concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon 30 device. Replication proteins and unreplicated pEMBL130(+) ssDNA were removed from the TNC DNA template by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The DNA sample was supplemented with SDS to 1% (w/v) and diluted with 0.25 volume of 5 × high salt gradient buffer. Portions were layered onto neutral 5–30% sucrose gradients and centrifuged and analyzed as described above. The fractions containing double-stranded DNA were pooled, and the TNC DNA product was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. For those instances in which helper phage DNA was first removed from pEMBL130(+) ssDNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation before synthesis of the TNC DNA template, a simplified protocol was used for synthesis and purification of the template. The 800-mer was mixed with pEMBL130(+) ssDNA at a molar ratio of 1.5 (800-mer:circle) and hybridized as described above. Once formed, the DNA hybrid was diluted into φX EDB replication mix as described above, except that the mix contained 100,000 units of DNA pol IIIh instead of DNA polymerase III* and β-subunit. The TNC DNA replication product prepared in this manner had negligible amounts of contaminating single-stranded DNA. The TNC DNA sample was incubated for 4 h at 55 °C with proteinase K (1 mg/ml in 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine) and extracted three times in succession with neutralized phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1). DNA product in the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer, and used directly as a substrate/template in rolling circle DNA replication assays. The reaction"
https://openalex.org/W2094350029,"Meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) are intermediates formed during the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa, factor Va, phospholipids, and Ca2+(prothrombinase). These intermediates are active toward synthetic peptide substrates but have limited ability to interact with platelets or macromolecular substrates such as fibrinogen. Meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) activate protein C, however, and may exert primarily an anticoagulant effect. In this study, we investigated the inhibition of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) by two glycosaminoglycan-dependent protease inhibitors, heparin cofactor II (HCII) and antithrombin (AT). Purified recombinant meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) were inhibited by HCII in the presence of dermatan sulfate with maximal second-order rate constants of 8 × 106m−1·min−1 and 1.8 × 107m−1·min−1, respectively, but were inhibited less than one-tenth as fast by AT in the presence of heparin. Similarly, the products of the prothrombinase reaction were inhibited in situ more effectively by HCII than by AT. When HCII and dermatan sulfate were present continuously during the prothrombinase reaction, meizothrombin was trapped as a sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complex with HCII and no amidolytic activity could be detected with a thrombin substrate. Our findings indicate that HCII is an effective inhibitor of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) and, therefore, might regulate the anticoagulant activity of these proteases.

Our findings indicate that HCII is an effective inhibitor of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) and, therefore, might regulate the anticoagulant activity of these proteases. Thrombin is a key enzyme in several biological processes, including blood coagulation, wound healing, and inflammation (1Coughlin S.R. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 270-277PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa converts human prothrombin to thrombin by cleavage of the peptide bonds following Arg-271 and Arg-320 (2Degen S.J.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The order in which these bonds are cleaved depends on assembly of the prothrombinase complex. In the presence of factor Xa and Ca2+, prothrombin is first cleaved after Arg-271, giving rise to fragment 1·2 and prethrombin 2 (3Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7782-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When factor Xa and its cofactor, factor Va, are assembled on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+, factor Xa first cleaves after Arg-320, giving rise to meizothrombin (4Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of the second factor Xa-sensitive bond in either prethrombin 2 or meizothrombin yields thrombin. Meizothrombin has been shown recently to be a major intermediate formed during coagulation of whole blood in vitro (6Bovill E.G. Tracy R.P. Hayes T.E. Jenny R.J. Bhushan F.H. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Meizothrombin retains the N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain of prothrombin, which enables it to bind to membrane phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+. Cleavage of the thrombin-sensitive peptide bond following Arg-155 in meizothrombin removes the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain and generates meizothrombin(desF1) (7Morita T. Iwanaga S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 303-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to prothrombin or prethrombin 2, meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) hydrolyze synthetic peptide substrates at rates comparable with that of thrombin (8Rosing J. Zwaal R.F.A. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4224-4228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8062-8067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) are much less active with respect to fibrinogen clotting, platelet activation, and activation of the thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (9Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10693-10701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stevens W.K. Côté H.C.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Neisheim M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); therefore, these intermediates have greatly reduced procoagulant and anti-fibrinolytic activity in comparison with thrombin. However, meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) both activate the anticoagulant zymogen protein C at about the same rate as thrombin in the presence of thrombomodulin, and meizothrombin activates protein C ∼6 times faster than thrombin when bound to phospholipids (11Côté H.C.F. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Hackeng T.M.

Thus, meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) may function primarily as anticoagulant proteases. Thrombin is inhibited by two plasma proteins, antithrombin (AT) 1The abbreviations used are: AT; antithrombin; HCII, heparin cofactor II; PPACK, Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone; STI, soybean trypsin inhibitor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine. and heparin cofactor II (HCII) (13Tollefsen D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3313-3334Google Scholar). These proteins are members of the serpin family and function as suicide substrate inhibitors (14Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Heparin increases the rate of inhibition of thrombin by either AT or HCII >1000-fold, whereas dermatan sulfate stimulates thrombin inhibition by HCII but not by AT (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin and dermatan sulfate stimulate HCII primarily by an allosteric mechanism that involves interaction of the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII with anion-binding exosite I of thrombin (16Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, heparin acts as a template to bring thrombin and AT into close approximation and thereby to increase the rate of inhibition (18Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The template mechanism requires binding of heparin to anion-binding exosite II of thrombin (19Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Gan Z.-R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of thrombin complexed with fragment 2 suggest that exosite II is occupied by the fragment 2 domain in meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) (21Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.-P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This structural model is consistent with the observation that meizothrombin is not inhibited rapidly by AT in the presence of heparin (11Côté H.C.F. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because exosite II is not involved in the inhibition of thrombin by HCII in the presence of dermatan sulfate (22Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HCII could potentially inhibit meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) better than AT. We now present evidence to support this hypothesis. Recombinant human meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified as described previously (23Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin, prothrombin, factor Va, factor Xa, and biotinylated Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK) were purchased from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). The prothrombin activator from Echis carinatus venom (Ecarin) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). HCII and AT were purified from human plasma and characterized as described previously (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine lung heparin was obtained from Upjohn (Kalamazoo, MI), porcine skin dermatan sulfate, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide from Boehringer Mannheim. Inhibition of recombinant meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) was studied in the presence of 9-fold molar excess of HCII or AT. The inhibitor, glycosaminoglycan, and enzyme were incubated at room temperature in 100 μl of TS/P buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4) containing 5 mmCaCl2. Some incubations also included 50 μmPC:PS vesicles (3:1) prepared as described elsewhere (24Wu Q. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7083-7088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped at various times by the addition of 500 μl of the chromogenic substrate tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (100 μm in TS/P buffer). The absorbance at 405 nm was recorded every 5 s for 100 s to determine the residual enzyme activity (E t). The pseudo first-order rate constant (k′) was determined by fitting the experimental data to the equation E t =E 0 e k′t, whereE 0 is the initial enzyme activity andE t is the activity at time = t. The second-order rate constant (k) was calculated from the equation k =k′/[I 0], where [I 0] is the initial inhibitor concentration. Prothrombin (0.2 μm) was incubated with 3 pm factor Xa, 0.6 nm factor Va, 50 μm PC:PS vesicles, and 5 mm CaCl2in TS/P buffer. The factor Xa was inhibited after 5 min by the addition of STI at a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml. HCII (105 nm) ± dermatan sulfate (50 μg/ml) or AT (105 nm) ± heparin (50 μg/ml) was added immediately thereafter. The reaction mixture was sampled at various times and assayed for amidolytic activity with tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Other samples were reacted with biotinylated PPACK (50 μm) as described by Bovillet al. (6Bovill E.G. Tracy R.P. Hayes T.E. Jenny R.J. Bhushan F.H. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The membrane was washed, probed with avidin linked to horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.), and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. Bands were quantified with a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Prothrombin (1.4 μm) was activated by prothrombinase (0.3 nm factor Xa, 5 nm factor Va, 10 μm PC:PS vesicles, and 5 mmCaCl2) in the presence of HCII (1.5 μm) and dermatan sulfate (50 μg/ml). Samples were withdrawn at various times, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Meizothrombin-HCII complexes were generated by incubating prothrombin (1 μm) with Ecarin (1 Ecarin unit/ml) (7Morita T. Iwanaga S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 303-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the presence of HCII (2 μm) and dermatan sulfate (100 μg/ml) in TS/P buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2. After a 1-h incubation, an equal volume of prothrombinase (0.3 nm factor Xa, 12 nm factor Va, 100 μm PC:PS vesicles, and 5 mmCaCl2) in TS/P buffer, or buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 only, was added. Samples were withdrawn at various times, subjected to 6.5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands were quantified by densitometry as described above. Native meizothrombin is stable only in the presence of a thrombin active site inhibitor. In the absence of an inhibitor, thrombin-sensitive peptide bonds after Arg-155 or Arg-284 can be cleaved to yield meizothrombin(desF1) or thrombin, 2This product is identical to the stable form of human thrombin (α-thrombin) that normally results from autolytic cleavage after Arg-284 in the A-chain. respectively (Fig.1). In the present study, recombinant prothrombin with modified cleavage sites for thrombin (R155A, R284A) and factor Xa (R271A) was used to generate a stable form of meizothrombin (23Côté H.C.F.

Similarly, a stable form of meizothrombin(desF1) was obtained from recombinant prothrombin (R271A, R284A). The enzymatic activities and calcium- and phospholipid-binding properties of recombinant meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) are similar to those of the native enzymes (10Stevens W.K.

Representative progress curves for inhibition of meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) are shown in Fig. 2. Glycosaminoglycans increased the rate of inhibition of both thrombin intermediates with either HCII or AT. Second-order rate constants for inhibition at various glycosaminoglycan concentrations are shown in Fig. 3. The rate constants for inhibition of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) by HCII reached maximum values of 8 × 106m−1·min−1 and 1.8 × 107m−1·min−1, respectively, in the presence of 50–200 μg/ml dermatan sulfate. AT inhibited meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) most rapidly in the presence of 6–40 μg/ml heparin, but the maximal second-order rate constants were less than one-tenth of those observed with HCII plus dermatan sulfate.Figure 3Dependence of the second-order rate constant on the concentration of glycosaminoglycan. Recombinant meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) was incubated with HCII plus dermatan sulfate (•) or with AT plus heparin (○) as in the experiment in Fig. 2.

HCII inhibits thrombin at about one-tenth the rate of AT in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan (17Sheehan J.P. Wu Q. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3639-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous work (11Côté H.C.F. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), AT inhibited thrombin more rapidly than meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) in the absence of heparin. Similarly, the basal rate of inhibition of thrombin by HCII was slightly more rapid than that of meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1). Dermatan sulfate increased the rate at which HCII inhibited meizothrombin by 380-fold, meizothrombin(desF1) by 1000-fold, and thrombin by ∼16,000-fold. Heparin had a similar effect. 3At higher heparin concentrations, the rate constants for inhibition of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) approached those observed in the presence of dermatan sulfate (data not shown). By contrast, heparin accelerated inhibition of meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) by AT only 4- to 11-fold. During prothrombin activation, meizothrombin remains bound to the phospholipid membrane by means of its γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain. However, addition of PC:PS vesicles and Ca2+ did not diminish the ability of HCII to inhibit recombinant meizothrombin in the presence of dermatan sulfate or heparin (Table I).Table ISecond-order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin intermediates by HCII and ATProteaseInhibitorGlycosaminoglycanNoneHeparinDermatan sulfatem −1 · min −1 (-fold increase)MeizothrombinHCII1.8 × 1042.9 × 106 (160)1-aThe -fold increase was calculated by dividing the rate determined in the presence of the glycosaminoglycan by the rate determined in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan for a given protease/inhibitor pair.6.9 × 106 (380)1-aThe -fold increase was calculated by dividing the rate determined in the presence of the glycosaminoglycan by the rate determined in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan for a given protease/inhibitor pair.HCII (+PCPS)1-bIncubations included 50 μm PC:PS vesicles.4.1 × 1061.3 × 107AT5.9 × 1046.3 × 105 (11)Meizothrombin(desF1)HCII1.8 × 1043.8 × 106 (210)1.8 × 107 (1,000)AT2.6 × 1051.1 × 106 (4)Thrombin1-cData from Sheehan et al.

Open table in a new tab Incubations were performed under pseudo first-order conditions, and rate constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In experiments with meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1), the glycosaminoglycan was present at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. In experiments with thrombin, the concentration of heparin was 10 unit/ml (∼67 μg/ml) with HCII and 1 unit/ml (∼7 μg/ml) with AT, and the concentration of dermatan sulfate was 100 μg/ml. To compare the ability of HCII and AT to inhibit the products of the prothrombinase complex in situ, prothrombin was activated by factor Xa in the presence of factor Va, PC:PS vesicles, and Ca2+. Under the conditions of this experiment, amidolytic activity determined with a thrombin substrate increased linearly up to 5 min, at which time <10% of the prothrombin was activated (Fig.4 A). The reaction products were monitored with biotinylated PPACK, which quantitatively labels the active sites of meizothrombin, meizothrombin(desF1), and thrombin (Fig.4 B) (6Bovill E.G. Tracy R.P. Hayes T.E. Jenny R.J. Bhushan F.H. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 5 min, the predominant products were thrombin (74%) and meizothrombin(desF1) (23%), but a small amount of meizothrombin (3%) was also detectable. In parallel experiments, STI was added at 5 min to inhibit the factor Xa. HCII and dermatan sulfate (or AT and heparin) were then added, and the amidolytic activity was followed over time (Fig. 4 A). In agreement with a previous study (26Schoen P. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11268-11274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of the amidolytic activity by AT plus heparin occurred in a biphasic manner, such that ∼56% of the activity was inhibited at the earliest time point and the remainder decayed with a second-order rate constant of 2.0 × 106m−1·min−1. In marked contrast, inhibition of the amidolytic activity by HCII either in the presence of dermatan sulfate or heparin was nearly complete at the earliest time point, which indicates that the reaction occurred with a rate constant >2.7 × 107m−1·min−1. In the absence of a glycosaminoglycan, the amidolytic activity was inhibited in a monophasic manner by AT, with a rate constant of 5.1 × 105m−1·min−1, whereas HCII inhibited the activity much more slowly. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, HCII and dermatan sulfate were present continuously during prothrombin activation by factor Xa, factor Va, PC:PS vesicles, and Ca2+. In contrast to the preceeding experiment (Fig. 4), no amidolytic activity was detected with tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide during the 20-min incubation (data not shown). The reaction mixture was sampled at various times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The gel shows that meizothrombin and thrombin were trapped as SDS-stable complexes with HCII. Notably, HCII-meizothrombin(desF1) complexes did not accumulate, which indicates that HCII prevented the proteolytic conversion of meizothrombin to meizothrombin(desF1). There are two possible origins of the thrombin-HCII complexes shown in Fig. 5. Either they resulted from cleavage of meizothrombin-HCII by factor Xa, or some of the meizothrombin was converted to thrombin before being inhibited by HCII. To determine if meizothrombin-HCII complexes can be cleaved by factor Xa, we used the prothrombin activator from E. carinatus venom, which cleaves only the bond after Arg-320 (see Fig. 1) (7Morita T. Iwanaga S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 303-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), to generate meizothrombin in the presence of HCII and dermatan sulfate. Under these conditions, >90% of the prothrombin was activated, and the resulting meizothrombin formed complexes with HCII. The complexes were then incubated for 0.5–120 min with factor Xa, factor Va, PC:PS vesicles, and Ca2+, and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). Progressive conversion of meizothrombin-HCII to thrombin-HCII was observed under non-reducing conditions (panel A, −DTT). Under reducing conditions (panel A, +DTT), the thrombin B-chain-HCII complex was observed as expected at all time points (the ∼35-kDa F1-F2 and ∼40-kDa F1-F2-A-chain polypeptides are not shown). Quantification of the complex bands indicated a t 1/2 of ∼20 min for meizothrombin-HCII in the presence of prothrombinase (Fig.6 B, circles). The complex was stable for at least 120 min in the absence of prothrombinase (Fig. 6 B,squares). The proposed mechanism by which HCII inhibits thrombin differs from that of AT as shown in Fig. 7 (for review, see Ref. 13Tollefsen D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3313-3334Google Scholar). HCII contains an N-terminal acidic domain that is similar in amino acid composition to the C-terminal portion of hirudin, which binds to anion-binding exosite I of thrombin (27Hortin G.L. Tollefsen D.M. Benutto B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13979-13982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton II, J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). When dermatan sulfate or heparin binds to HCII, the N-terminal acidic domain is thought to be displaced from the glycosaminoglycan-binding site and to become free to interact with thrombin (16Van Deerlin V.M.D. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ragg H. Ulshöfer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ragg H. Ulshöfer T. Gerewitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22386-22391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These initial interactions enable thrombin to attack the reactive site peptide bond of HCII more efficiently, leading to rapid formation of the stable HCII-thrombin complex. Thus, glycosaminoglycans accelerate the ability of HCII to inhibit thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that does not require binding of the glycosaminoglycan to thrombin (22Sheehan J.P. Tollefsen D.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32747-32751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, heparin catalyzes the thrombin-AT reaction by a template mechanism that requires binding of heparin to anion-binding exosite II of thrombin (19Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Gan Z.-R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the noncovalent complex of fragment 2 and thrombin determined by x-ray crystallography suggests that anion-binding exosite II is inaccessible in meizothrombin or meizothrombin(desF1) (21Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.-P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence also suggests that meizothrombin does not bind tightly to heparin (31Pieters J. Franssen J. Visch C. Lindhout T. Thromb. Res. 1987; 45: 573-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The inaccessibility of exosite II in meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) probably explains the failure of heparin to accelerate inhibition by AT significantly. In contrast, dermatan sulfate accelerates inhibition of these intermediates by HCII 380 to 1000-fold (Table I), and the maximum rate of inhibition of meizothrombin by HCII exceeds that of AT by more than 1 order of magnitude. Moreover, the rate is somewhat higher in the presence of phospholipid vesicles and Ca2+, which suggests that meizothrombin bound to physiologic membrane surfaces may be susceptible to inhibition by HCII. Despite the relatively rapid rate of inhibition of meizothrombin by HCII in comparison with AT, HCII inhibits thrombin ∼50 times faster than meizothrombin. This difference could be explained by conformational changes that occur in the active site when meizothrombin is converted to thrombin. Cleavage of meizothrombin at Arg-271 produces F1·2 and thrombin, which bind to each other with high affinity (K d ≈ 1 nm) and may remain associated, at least temporarily (32Myrmel K.H. Lundblad R.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,33Nesheim M.E. Abbott T. Jenny R. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1037-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1), the non-covalent F1·2-thrombin complex may resist inhibition by AT. To explore this possibility, we determined the kinetics of inhibition of the amidolytic activity generated at an early stage of the prothrombinase reaction, when the ratio of thrombin (or the non-covalent F1·2-thrombin complex) to meizothrombin(desF1) was ∼3:1 (Fig. 4). The results were in reasonable agreement with the kinetics of inhibition of purified thrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) summarized in Table I, if one assumes either that AT plus heparin inhibits F1·2-thrombin and thrombin at approximately the same rate or that F1·2-thrombin dissociates during the course of the experiment. This experiment also shows that meizothrombin(desF1) generated from native human prothrombin is inhibited more rapidly by HCII than by AT, in agreement with the results obtained with recombinant meizothrombin(desF1). When present during the prothrombinase reaction, HCII traps meizothrombin as SDS-stable meizothrombin-HCII complexes (Fig. 5). This observation indicates that factor Xa does not convert meizothrombin to thrombin instantaneously but that meizothrombin can persist in the prothrombinase complex long enough to interact with another macromolecule (i.e. HCII). Thrombin-HCII complexes are also observed in this type of experiment and may result, at least in part, from cleavage of the meizothrombin-HCII complex by prothrombinase as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Alternatively, some of the meizothrombin may be converted to thrombin before being inhibited by HCII. In this case, the resulting thrombin would appear to be inhibited by HCII fast enough to prevent the generation of meizothrombin(desF1) by cleavage of the thrombin-sensitive bond at Arg-155 and to prevent the appearance of thrombin amidolytic activity. The function of HCII in vivo remains unknown. Although administration of exogenous dermatan sulfate to experimental animals produces a potent antithrombotic effect by activation of HCII in the circulation (34Fernandez F. van Ryn J. Ofosu F.A. Hirsh J. Buchanan M.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1986; 64: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), humans with partial HCII deficiency do not appear to have an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic disease (35Andersson T.R. Larsen M.L. Handeland G.F. Abildgaard U. Scand. J. Haematol. 1986; 36: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Bertina R.M. van der Linden I.K. Engesser L. Muller H.P. Brommer E.J.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations support the hypothesis that HCII inhibits thrombin in the extravascular milieu (15Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it could modulate actions of thrombin in wound healing or inflammation. In the current study, we have demonstrated that the intermediates of prothrombin activation, meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1), can be inhibited rapidly by HCII in the presence of a glycosaminoglycan. Meizothrombin retains the N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain of prothrombin and, therefore, the ability to bind to phospholipid membranes; it is unknown whether this intermediate can dissociate from the prothrombinase complex, interact with thrombomodulin, and activate protein C under physiologic conditions. Nevertheless, our data indicate that meizothrombin in the prothrombinase complex is susceptible to rapid inhibition by HCII. Meizothrombin(desF1), which lacks the N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain, is perhaps more likely to diffuse away from the prothrombinase complex and activate protein C at a distant site. Under these circumstances, HCII could promote coagulation by inhibiting the activation of protein C by meizothrombin(desF1). The physiologic importance of the reactions described in this report could be established by demonstration of meizothrombin-HCII or meizothrombin(desF1)-HCII complexes in the circulation.

Pretreatment of human T-cells with micromolar concentrations of CAI causes a near complete inhibition of calcium-regulated mitogen-induced transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR). This inhibition is selective since other mitogen-activated gene regulatory elements, such as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, are not influenced by the drug. HIV LTR transcription inhibition is maximal at 1.0 μm CAI, requires a pretreatment interval of at least 8 h for optimum inhibition, and shows no acute interference with the growth properties of the cells. Moreover, the inhibition is rapidly reversible upon removal of the drug from the medium. Studies to identify enhancer elements within the HIV LTR that are functionally sensitive to low-dose long-term pretreatment with CAI indicate that the NF-κB-binding sites are among the major targets of drug action. In vitro DNA binding studies with nuclear extracts prepared from mitogen-induced T-cells stimulated in the presence of CAI indicate that the drug differentially influences the calcium-regulated downstream signal transduction pathways necessary for specific NF-κB DNA binding activity at the two κB sites within the HIV LTR. Studies with ionomycin and thapsigargin show that repression is specific for selected modes of inducible calcium entry and indicate that, in T-cells, a major mechanism of CAI action is to modulate calcium influx at a level that is proximal to the regulated release of calcium from intracellular stores. Measurement of calcium influx in CAI-treated cells reveals a dramatic and reversible inhibition of mitogen-induced calcium influx.

The modulatory region extends from residues −78 to −454 (relative to the start of transcription) and binds a variety of cellular proteins, including AP-1, chicken ovalbumin upstream factor, T-cell factor-1α, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and multiple members of the c-Rel-related transcription factors including NF-κB. Within the modulatory element, the most influential positive regulatory elements are the two tandemly repeated NF-κB elements located from residues −77 to −108. The region from residues −110 to −454 within the modulatory element has been often referred to as the negative regulatory element since large deletions in the intervening sequences often lead to up-regulation of viral production. The core element is required for both basal and activated transcriptional activity and binds chiefly to the transcription factors Sp1 and TFIID. Finally, the Tat-responsive element region is indispensable for the viral transactivator Tat function, and it binds both Tat and other host cell factors.HIV transcription is highly inducible in T-cells through signal transduction pathways that share significant overlap with those signaling events that are important for activated expression of T-cell lymphokines such as interleukin-2 (5Siekevitz M. Josephs S.F. Dukovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Haseltine W.A. Wong-Staal F. Sci. Am. 1988; 259: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consequently, many of the mitogenic agents that induce interleukin-2 production, by augmenting specific calcium- and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling events crucial for T-cell immune activation, also cause significant transcriptional activation of HIV LTR gene expression. These overlapping signal transduction requirements between T-cell lymphokine gene expression and HIV LTR transactivation forge an inextricable link between T-cell activation and inducible HIV gene expression. Although significant advances in our understanding of the control of interleukin-2 gene expression in T-cells have been made over the past few years, a detailed understanding of the precise mechanisms that govern mitogen-induced activation of the HIV LTR in T-cells remains obscure.This report describes the selective inhibition of mitogen-induced HIV LTR transactivation in transiently transfected Jurkat T-cells by low-dose treatment with carboxyamidotriazole (CAI). CAI reversibly inhibits HIV promoter activity by >90% at a concentration of 1 μm. This effect is highly selective at this low CAI concentration since the transactivation of other highly mitogen-inducible cis-elements, such as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE), is unaltered. Systematic comparison by transfection analysis of the activity of specific HIV cis-regulatory elements linked to heterologous promoters shows that CAI exerts it predominant influence on the region of the HIV LTR containing NF-κB regulatory elements. Assessment of the in vitro DNA binding activity present in nuclear extracts derived from mitogen-induced T-cells shows selective repression of NF-κB DNA binding by CAI pretreatment. Calcium influx measurements in Jurkat T-cells, in combination with the differential effects of CAI on receptor-independent inducers of calcium influx, show that CAI specifically and reversibly disrupts the signal transduction events that must occur proximally to the release of calcium from internal stores.DISCUSSIONCAI is a potent drug with antimetastatic, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic properties (43Kohn E.C. Alessandro R. Spoonster J. Wersto R.P. Liotta L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 44Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. Jacobs W. Holmes K.A. Day A. Freer R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence that >8 h of pretreatment of T-cells with 1 μm CAI causes a selective reversible inhibition of mitogen-dependent transactivation of the HIV LTR. Under these conditions, this inhibition occurs without altering the transactivation of other mitogen response gene regulatory elements such as the TRE. The region of the HIV LTR containing the κB enhancer element has been found to be the primary target through which CAI represses HIV LTR transactivation. This finding is further substantiated by the observation that nuclear factors that bind the HIV-κB elements are reduced in nuclear extracts from CAI-treated cells. Interestingly, 1 μm CAI repression of HIV LTR transactivation in Jurkat T-cells is highly dependent on the nature of the calcium-mobilizing mitogenic stimulation. PHA-dependent induction, where intracellular calcium is increased via signal transduction pathways involving extracellular ligation of T-cell surface receptors, such as CD3, is effectively inhibited by 1 μm CAI. In contrast, mitogenic agents that increase intracellular calcium through receptor-independent mechanisms, such as ionomycin and thapsigargin, are not inhibited by CAI. Finally, direct measurement of calcium influx in Jurkat T-cells shows potent and reversible inhibition of PHA-dependent increases in intracellular calcium. The calcium influx targeting by CAI is further highlighted by the observation that CAI inhibits both the appearance of NFAT DNA binding activity and transactivation in activated Jurkat T-cells.It is not clear why CAI requires an 8-h pretreatment interval to have full effect. This requirement could reflect simply the time required for the drug to gain full entry into the cell or interact with cell-surface molecules. The rapid reversibility of the effects of CAI (<15 min, the time required to change the cells into a drug-free medium) argues against a simple model based on slow diffusion through the lipid bilayer. CAI may show preferential affinity for calcium channels in the “open” conformation over the “closed” conformation, and the time requirement for inhibition may simply reflect the time required to bind to a stochastic distribution of open channels over the 8 h. In such a scenario, the rapid reversibility of the CAI inhibition could be due to a low affinity interaction (micromolar) between CAI and its target receptor or merely reflect very rapid dissociation and association rates for stochastically available binding sites. Because CAI has a high protein binding activity (45Holmes K.A. Chaffins S. Osborn B.L. Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the lengthy duration of pretreatment could reflect the time required for the drug to partition between the protein-rich culture medium and the cell surface. Still other interpretations include the possibility that CAI may be metabolized intracellularly to a freely and rapidly diffusible active product that accrues to threshold levels during the pretreatment period.A role for calcium in NF-κB regulation has been suggested by numerous recent studies (9Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Venkataraman L. Wang W. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang W. Tam W.F.

Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Frantz B. Nordby E.C. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C.V. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Several of these studies have indicated that individual Rel family members display differential requirements for calcium-dependent signaling (9Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Venkataraman L. Wang W. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The general consensus from these studies has been that c-Rel activity is much more strongly influenced by calcium signaling than is RelA (p65), whose calcium dependence is more variable. In fact, c-Rel has been shown previously to have activation characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of NFAT (47Venkataraman L. Burakoff S.J. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These characteristics include a requirement for activation by both phorbol ester and calcium-mobilizing agents and a susceptibility to repression by the immunophilin class of calcineurin inhibitors including FK506 and cyclosporin A. Our finding that the nuclear translocation of c-Rel is much more dramatically affected by CAI treatment than that of p65 is consistent with these previous observations. The differential sensitivity of p65 and c-Rel to calcium blockade is likely due to the fact that c-Rel induction is also controlled transcriptionally by multiple active NF-κB enhancer elements in its promoter (49Grumont R.J. Richardson I.B. Gaff C. Gerondakis S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 731-743PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, small IκB-mediated changes in the nuclear levels of p65 or c-Rel would be expected to actively impinge on c-Rel transcription, thus reducing the total amount of cellular c-Rel, as shown in Fig.6 B.Interestingly, pentoxifylline, a vasoactive anti-inflammatory drug, has also been shown to preferentially influence the induction of c-Rel over other Rel family members (46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This finding correlates well with the ability of pentoxifylline to inhibit transactivation of the HIV LTR (50Biswas D.K. Ahlers C.M. Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 31-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Biswas D.K. Ahlers C.M. Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11044-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, unlike pentoxifylline, CAI is also a very potent inhibitor of NFAT induction (Fig. 8 B). A simple and logical conclusion that can be drawn from the functional distinctions between the actions of these different classes of drugs is that pentoxifylline exerts its effect at a point in the calcium-dependent signaling pathway that is distal to the effects of the immunophilins, while the action of CAI occurs proximal to both pentoxifylline and FK506/CSA (i.e. at the level of calcium influx). Recent reports have implicated a role for NFAT in the transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR through the κB site (52Bassuk A.G. Anandappa R.T. Leiden J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3563-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a direct transcriptional role for NFAT at the HIV-κB enhancer elements has not been clearly demonstrated, the ability of CAI to repress both c-Rel- and NFAT-dependent transactivation clearly underlies its potency as an HIV LTR transcriptional inhibitor. Although it is clear that the κB sites are the major targets of CAI action, we cannot rule out a possible effect of CAI on other cis-regulatory elements within the HIV LTR. Under the conditions used in this study, deletion of the κB sites reduces the mitogen inducibility of the HIV LTR to <0.6-fold above background (data not shown), thus making accurate assessment of possible CAI inhibition at other non-κB sites impractical.The precise mechanism through which CAI is able to inhibit calcium influx into Jurkat T-cells remains an area of active investigation. Prior studies have provided clear evidence that, at high concentrations, CAI can inhibit calcium entry and other downstream events in diverse cell types (22Felder C.C. Ma A.L. Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 967-971PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. Jacobs W. Holmes K.A. Day A. Freer R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar, 53Felder C.C. MacArthur L. Ma A.L. Gusovsky F. Kohn E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1706-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, significant inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ has been demonstrated (54Gusovsky F. Lueders J.E. Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7768-7772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thapsigargin acts by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase pump on the endoplasmic reticulum, thus allowing calcium release into the cytoplasm (40Gouy H. Cefai D. Christensen S.B. Debre P. Bismuth G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that depletion of internal calcium stores by ionophore may also elicit calcium influx (39Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fact that thapsigargin- or ionomycin-activated cells are resistant to low-dose (1 μm) pretreatment with CAI indicates that CAI may target events that occur prior to the depletion of internal calcium stores. Eligible targets include the protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent events set in play at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane following ligation of T-cell surface receptors (30Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 55van Oers N.S. Weiss A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 56Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 57Weiss A. Kadlecek T. Iwashima M. Chan A. Van Oers N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).It is likely that CAI can blunt multiple calcium-dependent signaling events during mitogenic stimulation. Although highly selective at low concentrations, a higher concentration of CAI produces a broader inhibition of downstream effectors of mitogenic signaling. As noted in this study, 10-fold higher concentrations of CAI can effectively inhibit activation of the TRE (Fig. 2). The mechanism of this level of inhibition remains to be determined. It is important to note that this higher level of CAI is not toxic since the effects are fully reversible (Fig. 3). CAI is likely to have effects at more distal events in the multiple signal pathways triggered by mitogenic stimulation. The potency of CAI action and its ready reversibility will make it a very effective pharmacological tool for dissecting the intricate web of signal transduction events critical to cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The selective efficacy of CAI action in repressing HIV LTR transactivation highlights the usefulness of calcium entry as a viable therapeutic target in the development of antiretroviral strategies.

Most of this control is mediated through the gene regulatory region of the HIV genome, referred to as the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) (1Vaishnav Y.N. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Garcia J.A. Gaynor R.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Perinatol. 1994; 21: 39-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of host and virus-derived factors interact with this HIV promoter to influence transcriptional activity through a complex interplay of both positive and negative elements (2Garcia J.A. Gaynor R.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 157-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Antoni B.A. Stein S.B. Rabson A.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 43: 53-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The HIV LTR can be divided into three regions based on the viral and cellular regulatory proteins that bind them. These regions have been designated the modulatory region, the core region, and the Tat-responsive element (1Vaishnav Y.N. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Garcia J.A. Gaynor R.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

The modulatory region extends from residues −78 to −454 (relative to the start of transcription) and binds a variety of cellular proteins, including AP-1, chicken ovalbumin upstream factor, T-cell factor-1α, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and multiple members of the c-Rel-related transcription factors including NF-κB.

HIV transcription is highly inducible in T-cells through signal transduction pathways that share significant overlap with those signaling events that are important for activated expression of T-cell lymphokines such as interleukin-2 (5Siekevitz M.

Our finding that the nuclear translocation of c-Rel is much more dramatically affected by CAI treatment than that of p65 is consistent with these previous observations. The differential sensitivity of p65 and c-Rel to calcium blockade is likely due to the fact that c-Rel induction is also controlled transcriptionally by multiple active NF-κB enhancer elements in its promoter (49Grumont R.J.

Accordingly, small IκB-mediated changes in the nuclear levels of p65 or c-Rel would be expected to actively impinge on c-Rel transcription, thus reducing the total amount of cellular c-Rel, as shown in Fig.6 B.Interestingly, pentoxifylline, a vasoactive anti-inflammatory drug, has also been shown to preferentially influence the induction of c-Rel over other Rel family members (46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This finding correlates well with the ability of pentoxifylline to inhibit transactivation of the HIV LTR (50Biswas D.K. Ahlers C.M. Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Mol.

Thapsigargin acts by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase pump on the endoplasmic reticulum, thus allowing calcium release into the cytoplasm (40Gouy H. Cefai D. Christensen S.B. Debre P. Bismuth G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that depletion of internal calcium stores by ionophore may also elicit calcium influx (39Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fact that thapsigargin- or ionomycin-activated cells are resistant to low-dose (1 μm) pretreatment with CAI indicates that CAI may target events that occur prior to the depletion of internal calcium stores. Eligible targets include the protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent events set in play at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane following ligation of T-cell surface receptors (30Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 55van Oers N.S. Weiss A. Semin.

Iwashima M. Chan A. Van Oers N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).It is likely that CAI can blunt multiple calcium-dependent signaling events during mitogenic stimulation. Although highly selective at low concentrations, a higher concentration of CAI produces a broader inhibition of downstream effectors of mitogenic signaling. As noted in this study, 10-fold higher concentrations of CAI can effectively inhibit activation of the TRE (Fig. 2). The mechanism of this level of inhibition remains to be determined. It is important to note that this higher level of CAI is not toxic since the effects are fully reversible (Fig. 3). CAI is likely to have effects at more distal events in the multiple signal pathways triggered by mitogenic stimulation. The potency of CAI action and its ready reversibility will make it a very effective pharmacological tool for dissecting the intricate web of signal transduction events critical to cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The selective efficacy of CAI action in repressing HIV LTR transactivation highlights the usefulness of calcium entry as a viable therapeutic target in the development of antiretroviral strategies. CAI is a potent drug with antimetastatic, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic properties (43Kohn E.C. Alessandro R. Spoonster J. Wersto R.P. Liotta L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 44Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. Jacobs W. Holmes K.A. Day A. Freer R. Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence that >8 h of pretreatment of T-cells with 1 μm CAI causes a selective reversible inhibition of mitogen-dependent transactivation of the HIV LTR. Under these conditions, this inhibition occurs without altering the transactivation of other mitogen response gene regulatory elements such as the TRE. The region of the HIV LTR containing the κB enhancer element has been found to be the primary target through which CAI represses HIV LTR transactivation. This finding is further substantiated by the observation that nuclear factors that bind the HIV-κB elements are reduced in nuclear extracts from CAI-treated cells. Interestingly, 1 μm CAI repression of HIV LTR transactivation in Jurkat T-cells is highly dependent on the nature of the calcium-mobilizing mitogenic stimulation. PHA-dependent induction, where intracellular calcium is increased via signal transduction pathways involving extracellular ligation of T-cell surface receptors, such as CD3, is effectively inhibited by 1 μm CAI. In contrast, mitogenic agents that increase intracellular calcium through receptor-independent mechanisms, such as ionomycin and thapsigargin, are not inhibited by CAI. Finally, direct measurement of calcium influx in Jurkat T-cells shows potent and reversible inhibition of PHA-dependent increases in intracellular calcium. The calcium influx targeting by CAI is further highlighted by the observation that CAI inhibits both the appearance of NFAT DNA binding activity and transactivation in activated Jurkat T-cells. It is not clear why CAI requires an 8-h pretreatment interval to have full effect. This requirement could reflect simply the time required for the drug to gain full entry into the cell or interact with cell-surface molecules. The rapid reversibility of the effects of CAI (<15 min, the time required to change the cells into a drug-free medium) argues against a simple model based on slow diffusion through the lipid bilayer. CAI may show preferential affinity for calcium channels in the “open” conformation over the “closed” conformation, and the time requirement for inhibition may simply reflect the time required to bind to a stochastic distribution of open channels over the 8 h. In such a scenario, the rapid reversibility of the CAI inhibition could be due to a low affinity interaction (micromolar) between CAI and its target receptor or merely reflect very rapid dissociation and association rates for stochastically available binding sites. Because CAI has a high protein binding activity (45Holmes K.A. Chaffins S. Osborn B.L. Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the lengthy duration of pretreatment could reflect the time required for the drug to partition between the protein-rich culture medium and the cell surface. Still other interpretations include the possibility that CAI may be metabolized intracellularly to a freely and rapidly diffusible active product that accrues to threshold levels during the pretreatment period. A role for calcium in NF-κB regulation has been suggested by numerous recent studies (9Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Venkataraman L. Wang W. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Several of these studies have indicated that individual Rel family members display differential requirements for calcium-dependent signaling (9Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Venkataraman L. Wang W. Sen R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The general consensus from these studies has been that c-Rel activity is much more strongly influenced by calcium signaling than is RelA (p65), whose calcium dependence is more variable. In fact, c-Rel has been shown previously to have activation characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of NFAT (47Venkataraman L. Burakoff S.J. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These characteristics include a requirement for activation by both phorbol ester and calcium-mobilizing agents and a susceptibility to repression by the immunophilin class of calcineurin inhibitors including FK506 and cyclosporin A. Our finding that the nuclear translocation of c-Rel is much more dramatically affected by CAI treatment than that of p65 is consistent with these previous observations. The differential sensitivity of p65 and c-Rel to calcium blockade is likely due to the fact that c-Rel induction is also controlled transcriptionally by multiple active NF-κB enhancer elements in its promoter (49Grumont R.J. Richardson I.B. Gaff C. Gerondakis S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 731-743PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, small IκB-mediated changes in the nuclear levels of p65 or c-Rel would be expected to actively impinge on c-Rel transcription, thus reducing the total amount of cellular c-Rel, as shown in Fig.6 B. Interestingly, pentoxifylline, a vasoactive anti-inflammatory drug, has also been shown to preferentially influence the induction of c-Rel over other Rel family members (46Wang W. Tam W.F. Hughes C.C. Rath S. Sen R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This finding correlates well with the ability of pentoxifylline to inhibit transactivation of the HIV LTR (50Biswas D.K. Ahlers C.M. Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 31-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Biswas D.K. Ahlers C.M. Dezube B.J. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11044-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, unlike pentoxifylline, CAI is also a very potent inhibitor of NFAT induction (Fig. 8 B). A simple and logical conclusion that can be drawn from the functional distinctions between the actions of these different classes of drugs is that pentoxifylline exerts its effect at a point in the calcium-dependent signaling pathway that is distal to the effects of the immunophilins, while the action of CAI occurs proximal to both pentoxifylline and FK506/CSA (i.e. at the level of calcium influx). Recent reports have implicated a role for NFAT in the transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR through the κB site (52Bassuk A.G. Anandappa R.T. Leiden J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3563-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a direct transcriptional role for NFAT at the HIV-κB enhancer elements has not been clearly demonstrated, the ability of CAI to repress both c-Rel- and NFAT-dependent transactivation clearly underlies its potency as an HIV LTR transcriptional inhibitor. Although it is clear that the κB sites are the major targets of CAI action, we cannot rule out a possible effect of CAI on other cis-regulatory elements within the HIV LTR. Under the conditions used in this study, deletion of the κB sites reduces the mitogen inducibility of the HIV LTR to <0.6-fold above background (data not shown), thus making accurate assessment of possible CAI inhibition at other non-κB sites impractical. The precise mechanism through which CAI is able to inhibit calcium influx into Jurkat T-cells remains an area of active investigation. Prior studies have provided clear evidence that, at high concentrations, CAI can inhibit calcium entry and other downstream events in diverse cell types (22Felder C.C. Ma A.L. Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 967-971PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. Jacobs W. Holmes K.A. Day A. Freer R. Liotta L.A.

This may be physiologically important for establishing or maintaining non-overlapping groups of GlcNAc-1-P- and Man-6-P-modifiedDictyostelium proteins that reside in functionally distinct endo-lysosomal vesicles. The lysosomal enzymes of Dictyostelium have two types of carbohydrate modifications. One is a methylated form of Man-6-P onN-linked oligosaccharides (Man-6-POCH3) (1Freeze H.H. Neuberger A. Van Deenen L.L.M. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 29B. Elsevier Science, The Netherlands1997: 91-105Google Scholar) and the other, called phosphoglycosylation, is GlcNAc-1-P in a phosphodiester linkage to serine (2Gustafson G.L. Gander J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The two modifications appear to be on distinct classes of proteins, indicating that addition of each type is highly selective (3Mehta D.P. Ichikawa M. Salimath P.V. Etchison J.R. Haak R. Manzi A.

Biophys. 1997; 339: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One or more of these motifs is probably the site GlcNAc-1-P addition since deletion of this entire Ser-rich domain in proteinase-1(CP7) abolishes the recognition by a GlcNAc-1-P-specific monoclonal antibody (6Ord T. Adessi C. Wang L. Freeze H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein glycosylation is initiated when a glycosyltransferase recognizes an acceptor amino acid in the context of neighboring residues, e.g. the NXS(T) sequence forN-linked glycosylation (7Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). O-Linked glycosylation initiated by αGalNAc transferases involves recognition of surrounding amino acids and aspects of their secondary structure that generate a continuum of efficient to inefficient acceptor glycosylation sites (8Elhammer A.P.

Examples include the selective addition of Man-6-P residues to high mannose-type N-linked chains of mammalian lysosomal enzymes (10Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Since our previous results showed that CPs are modified by GlcNAc-1-P (3Mehta D.P. Ichikawa M. Salimath P.V. Etchison J.R. Haak R. Manzi A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol.

We found that the transferase has a preference for certain Ser-containing peptide sequences, but most importantly, it shows a high affinity for binding eukaryotic CPs of the papain family. The latter may be the first step in selecting proteins for phosphoglycosylation and may help to distinguish them from proteins modified with Man-6-P.

The fusion protein was denatured by 2-fold excess of SDS and heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and a 4–5-fold excess of bovine serum albumin was added to quench the excess SDS. This mixture was then incubated in the presence of the transferase to determine the K m of denatured fusion protein. A similar incubation of the transferase with SDS-denatured bovine serum albumin showed that the transferase activity is still retained under these conditions. The plasmid pGEX 5X1 was used for generating the fusion protein, FLAG-CP7-GST. The complete sequence of the CP7 gene, cprG, in Dictyostelium has been published and the FLAG epitope was introduced before the serine insert in CP7 using the construct FLAG-CP7-pDNeo 67 (6Ord T. Adessi C. Wang L. Freeze H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding the mature-FLAG-CP7 was made using polymerase chain reaction amplification with the primers 5′ AAAAGGATCCATGCTTCC GCTCAAGTC GATTGG 3′ and 5′ TACTGTCGACTTAAAGTGATGCAACAGCAG 3′ using FLAG-CP7-pDNeo 67 as template. The polymerase chain reaction product, mature-FLAG-CP7, was cut with restriction endonucleases BamHI and SalI and ligated into the vector pGEX 5X1 which was prepared using the same enzymes. The construct was transformed into E. coli strain XL1-Blue using the rapid transformation protocol according to the manufacturer's directions. A single colony of E. coli XL1-blue containing the plasmid encoding mature-FLAG-CP7-GST was incubated in LB medium. The cells were grown at 37 °C until the A 600reached 1.0 and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was further maintained at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested and subjected to extensive sonication in TTBS buffer. The inclusion bodies of the cells contained the fusion protein and were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing the fusion protein was resuspended in 0.01 mTris, pH 8.0, containing 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100 and dialyzed extensively against TTBS buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed material was diluted 30-fold and applied to a DEAE column equilibrated with 5 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at −20 °C. The purified protein was separated on a 12.5% SDS gel and stained with Coomassie Blue and also analyzed by Western blot using either anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) or GlcNAc-1-P-specific mAb, AD7.5 (3Mehta D.P.

This was followed by incubation with anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate and visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. TLC was performed on cellulose plates and developed in ethyl acetate:acetic acid:water in 6:4:3 ratio (v/v). Sugar standards were detected by silver nitrate spray (19Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1986: 485-486Google Scholar), and the phosphorylated sugar standards were detected by molybdate-perchloric acid spray (19Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1986: 485-486Google Scholar). QAE-Sephadex and C18 reverse phase chromatographies were carried out as described (20Etchison J.R. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HPLC analyses of anionic compounds were done using a 4.6 mm × 25 cm Microsorb-MV amino-bonded silica column with a linear gradient of 0.01–0.25 m ammonium formate, pH 6.0, containing 40% acetonitrile for 60 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Peptide substrates and Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase products were analyzed by MALDI-MS using a Kratos MALDI I system. Peptides were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile at 0.1 mg/ml; transferase peptide products were dissolved in a minimal volume of 50% acetonitrile (about 5–20 μm). Matrices used in these studies were as follows: 1) DAN, a saturated solution of 1,5-diaminonaphthalene in 50% acetonitrile; 2) α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile; 3) 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 50 mm 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and 4) HABA, a saturated solution of [2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)-benzoic acid] in 50% acetonitrile. Mild acid treatment was done on the peptide and endogenous products with 0.01 n HCl at 100 °C for 15 min. Mild base hydrolysis was performed at room temperature with 0.1 n NaOH for 4 h. The acid/base hydrolysates were neutralized, desalted, and analyzed by C18 reverse phase chromatography or QAE-Sephadex anion exchange chromatography as detailed above. Membranes were prepared from log phase cells grown to 4 × 106cells/ml, and the postnuclear supernatants were solubilized with 1% octyl glucoside and centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 15 min in a TLA-100.2 rotor. The detergent-solubilized extract (10 mg/ml protein) contained the majority of the Ser-GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity on both peptide and endogenous acceptors. 1.0 ml of solubilized extract was layered on a 10–40% sucrose gradient made in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.1% octyl glucoside and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm either for 3 or 16 h using an SW 40 rotor. 0.5-ml fractions were collected by piercing the bottom of the tube with a 25-gauge needle. The fractions were assayed for protein (21Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 964-967Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and Ser-GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity using both peptide 1 (C8GSSSSSSG) and endogenous acceptors. Total mouse RNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was also separated on a similar sucrose gradient to determine the position of 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA used as markers. Phosphoglycosylated CPs from vegetativeDictyostelium cells have a 25–110-amino acid serine-rich domain that is not found in other eukaryotic CPs (5Souza G.M. Hirai J. Mehta D.P. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28938-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Ord T. Adessi C. Wang L. Freeze H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The domain has three repeated motifs of poly(S), SGSG and SGSQ (5Souza G.M. Hirai J. Mehta D.P. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28938-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and at least one is probably phosphoglycosylated, since deletion of the entire domain in proteinase-1(CP7) abolishes recognition by a GlcNAc-1-P specific antibody (6Ord T. Adessi C. Wang L. Freeze H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Also, a synthetic peptide with three SG repeats is a good acceptor in in vitro Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase assays (18Freeze H.H. Ichikawa M Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine if one of the motifs is a preferred acceptor, we prepared three substrates: Peptide 1 (C8-GSSSSSSG), peptide 2 (C8-GSGSGSGS), and peptide 3 (C8-SGSQSGSQ). All wereN-octanoylated (C8) to facilitate recovery from the assay mixture. UDP-[3H]GlcNAc was added to detergent-solubilized membranes, and peptide-bound label was determined. K m values for the three peptides were between 126 and 194 μm and all showed similar catalytic efficiencies (V max/K m ) (TableI). Thus, transferase did not show a strong preference for any one of the motifs.Table ISer:GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity on peptides containing Dictyostelium Ser-rich motifsPeptidesK mV maxV max/K mμmpmol/min/mg1.

Open table in a new tab Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity was assayed using synthetic peptides 1–3 that contained the Ser-rich motifs found inDictyostelium CPs. The K m andV max were determined by double-reciprocal plots of reaction rates at different peptide concentrations. To confirm that the products were phosphodiester-linked GlcNAc-1-P, they were treated with either mild acid or base to release label which was analyzed by QAE-Sephadex ion exchange or C18 reversed phase chromatography. Mild acid hydrolysis sufficient to cleave labile phosphodiester bonds released 88–94% of the radiolabel which co-migrated exclusively with authentic GlcNAc on cellulose TLC plates (not shown). Base hydrolysis released 86–97% of 3H label, and all of it co-migrated with GlcNAc-1-P by TLC (not shown). The base-released material bound to QAE-Sephadex, and 85% was neutralized by digestion with alkaline phosphatase. These results are consistent with the presence of [3H]GlcNAc-1-P in a phosphodiester linkage to the peptidylserine and is similar to the products characterized in previous studies (2Gustafson G.L. Gander J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Merello S. Parodi A.J. Couso R. J. Biol.

Commun. 1995; 208: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptides were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC. Peptide 1 gave two major incompletely resolved peaks, and peptides 2 and 3 gave single peaks (Fig.1 A). These products were purified by preparative anion exchange HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-MS to determine the number of GlcNAc-1-P residues. Peptide 1 product did not yield any desorbed ions in the expected mass range (700–2000) when analyzed using four different matrices in either the positive ion or negative ion mode. Products of peptides 2 and 3 gave strong signals in the negative ion mode using the DAN and HABA matrices, respectively. Fig. 1 B shows the negative ion mass spectra for peptides 2 and 3 (panels i and iii) and the HPLC-purified transferase products (panels ii and iv). The calculated mass for peptide 2 is 720.8 and that for peptide 3 is 862.9.Panel i shows two major signals at 719.2 and 815.3, corresponding to peptide 2 (expected [M − H]−1 = 719.8) and its trifluoroacetyl ester (+ 96 mass units). Panel ii shows the HPLC-purified transferase products of peptide 2 with negative ion masses of 1002.6 and 1098.5 (Δm/z = 96.1; trifluoroacetyl ester). These ions are 283 mass units larger than the corresponding peptide ions shown in panel i, as expected for GlcNAc-1-phosphoryl derivatives (mass = 283.2). Panel iii shows a major negative ion at 861.9 for peptide 3 (expected [M − H]−1 = 861.9). Panel iv shows the major negative ion at 1145.6 for the HPLC-purified peptide 3 transferase product, 283.7 mass units larger than the peptide, as expected for the GlcNAc-1-phosphoryl derivative. A second product ion at 1438.2 is 296.6 mass units larger than the major product ion and, therefore, is probably not due to an additional GlcNAc-1-phosphoryl group. Thus, MALDI-MS shows only one GlcNAc-1-P per peptide. None of the three peptide motifs is highly preferred as an acceptor, but the neighboring amino acids are expected to influence recognition and efficiency. We tested a limited series of 12 peptides having single or multiple serine residues and different flanking amino acids. None of these is found in the Ser-rich domain of the knownDictyostelium CPs. As shown in TableII, glycosylation rates vary by at least 50-fold. In a homologous series of peptides containing a single Ser flanked by various amino acids, it was clear that flanking by Ala (PPAAASAAPLR) was much better than either Gly (PPDGGSGGPLR) or Val (PPDVVSVVPLR). A peptide with multiple contiguous Ser residues flanked by single Ala residues (PPDASSSAPLR) was the best acceptor having a 5-fold better efficiency than the Ser motifs seen in theDictyostelium CPs but nearly the same K m . Serines flanked by basic amino acids (APARSSPP) or by Pro (APPPSLPSP) residues were poor acceptors. This limited survey clearly shows that flanking amino acids influence transferase activity. However, the specificity of phosphoglycosylation seen in Dictyosteliumsuggested that other features might also contribute to substrate recognition.Table IISer:GlcNAc phosphotransferase has a preference for certain peptide sequencesPeptideSpecific activityK mV maxV max/K mpmol/min/mgμmpmol/min/mgVLGSTAV12VLGTSAV21VKSEASSFI5PPDAASAAPLR1007501610.215PPDGGSGGPLR27PPDVVSVVPLR7PPDASSSAPLR2031561851.19APARSSPP11APPPSLPSP9PPASTSAPG2264762300.483PPASSSAPG622-aK m or V max not determined as it was linear up to 800 μm of peptide concentration.RTPPP13RSPPP7The activity of Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase was measured with peptides having single or multiple Ser residues flanked by various amino acids.

Detergent-solubilized Dictyosteliummicrosomal membranes incorporate label from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc into endogenous acceptors. Incorporation is linear for up to 2 h and from 1.6–6.5 mg/ml protein as reported in earlier studies (15Merello S. Parodi A.J. Couso R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7281-7287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Freeze H.H. Ichikawa M Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, UDP-[3H]GlcNAc can be used by two different GlcNAc-1-P transferases as follows: one is Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase, and the other is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. The latter transfers GlcNAc-1-P to selected mannose residues onN-linked oligosaccharides of lysosomal enzymes to generate the Man-6-P marker (22Lang L. Couso R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6320-6325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GlcNAc transferase adds an “intersecting” GlcNAc residue to high mannose N-linked chains (23Capasso J.M. Capasso A. Kaplan A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1281: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The N-linked glycopeptides bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose, whereas GlcNAc-1-P-Ser peptides do not (15Merello S. Parodi A.J. Couso R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7281-7287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, >90% of the label is incorporated into glycopeptides that do not bind to the lectin column and are therefore likely to be Ser:GlcNAc phosphotransferase products. The 3H-labeled products were degraded by base and mild acid treatments as described above to characterize their linkage to the acceptors. Base released 86% of the label of which 80% bound to QAE-Sephadex before but not after digestion with alkaline phosphatase. TLC analysis of the base and acid-hydrolyzed material gave exclusively [3H]GlcNAc-1-P and GlcNAc, respectively (not shown). These results confirmed that most of the product is [3H]GlcNAc-1-P in a diester linkage to the endogenous acceptors, presumably through serine residues. Solubilized membranes and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc were mixed with increasing amounts of proteinase-1(CP7) as a potential acceptor for GlcNAc-1-P. Rather than stimulating overall incorporation, the added protein inhibited incorporation into endogenous acceptors (Fig.2 A). To eliminate the possibility that inhibition resulted from residual proteolytic activity (24Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. B"

The 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA contains an open reading frame of 660 base pairs, encoding a 23-amino acid signal sequence followed by a mature protein of 197 residues. The sequence of p27 exhibits strong similarity to that of cyclophilin B, a peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase. p27 exhibits isomerase activity with ak cat /K m of 0.18 μm−1 s−1 for a peptide substrate; this activity is inhibited by cyclosporin A but is not affected by FK506. Although the p27 precursor possesses an amino-terminal secretory hydrophobic signal sequence, unlike other cyclophilin B molecules, it lacks a conserved carboxyl-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and it contains a central 8-amino acid insertion. Although p27 is secreted into the culture media of transiently expressed COS cells, it is not detected in horseshoe crab hemolymph plasma but rather is localized to the hemocyte large granules, the regulated secretory granules that are exocytosed upon stimulation. These results indicate that p27 is a new peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase in the regulated secretory granules, and is thus designated cyclophilin G.

The horseshoe crab (or limulus) is an arthropod with a unique innate humoral immune system that differs substantially from the immunoglobulin-based acquired immune system of vertebrates (1Muta T.

These granules contain LPS- and β-glucan-sensitive coagulation factors, lectins, and antimicrobial proteins, which after exocytosis participate in the establishment of proteolytic cascades that ultimately immobilize and kill invading pathogens (1Muta T.

Recently, we purified a serine protease zymogen factor G from hemocytes (8Muta T. Seki N. Takaki Y. Hashimoto R. Oda T. Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The autocatalytic activation of factor G by a trace amount of (1,3)-β-d-glucan on the surface of fungi triggers a protease cascade that culminates in hemolymph coagulation. Factor G is a heterodimeric protein composed of subunits α and β. Subunit α is a novel mosaic protein involved in β-glucan recognition, whereas subunit β is a 37-kDa serine protease zymogen (9Seki N. Muta T. Oda T. Iwaki D. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1370-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During immunoblotting analyses of horseshoe crab hemocyte lysate with subunit β-specific antisera, we found a 27-kDa protein (p27) that cross-reacts with subunit β antiserum. Thus, anticipating a related serine protease, we initiated a study of p27. In this study, we purified p27 and cloned its cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of p27 unexpectedly revealed that it was a cyclophilin (CyP) homologue with peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity. A PPIase, which catalyzes the cis/trans-isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds, was first isolated from porcine kidney cortex (10Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar), and sequence analysis revealed that it was identical to cyclophilin A (CyPA), a cytosolic protein isolated from bovine thymocytes which binds to the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) (11Handschumacher R.E.

Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3627) Google Scholar). Although CsA inhibits the PPIase activity of CyPA, its calcineurin inhibitory activity is independent of its PPIase activity. Other non-cytosolic CyP homologues with PPIase activity have been found to participate in the processing of secretory proteins (15Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin B (CyPB) is mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is thought to have a role in the folding of nascent peptide chains (16Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol.

The ninaA gene product, a CyP homologue inDrosophila photoreceptor cells, co-localizes with rhodopsin in secretory transport vesicles, suggesting a role in protein trafficking and macromolecular assembly (18Baker E.K.

This study characterizes a new 27-kDa CyP homologue, cyclophilin G, which is located in the L-granule, one of two types of regulated secretory granules in horseshoe crab hemocytes. This is the first report demonstrating the presence of a PPIase in regulated secretory granules, and suggests an expanded role for CyPs in maintaining the integrity of stored secretory proteins. Hemocyte lysate of the Japanese horseshoe crabs (Tachypleus tridentatus) was prepared as described previously (19Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem.

Sephadex G-150, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, Superdex 75 HR 10/30, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were products of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). α-Chymotrypsin was obtained from Worthington and succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-prolyl-l-phenylalanine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA) was from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sawady Technology (Tokyo, Japan). Cyclosporin A and FK506 were kindly provided by Sandoz AG (Basel, Switzerland) and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ibaraki, Japan). λgt22A horseshoe crab hemocyte cDNA library was prepared by using a Superscript™ Lambda system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The rabbit antiserum against factor G subunits and p27 was prepared by using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins of a factor G fragment and recombinant p27 as antigens, respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column (inner diameter, 5.0 × 14 cm) chromatography of the lysate (590 ml) derived from 97.5 g (wet weight) of the horseshoe crab hemocytes was performed as described (8Muta T.

The 2.0 m NaCl fractions containing p27 were lyophilized, and applied to a Sephadex G-150 column (inner diameter, 3.2 × 98 cm) in 20 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing p27 were pooled, diluted 10-fold with 20 mmsodium acetate (pH 5.5), and then applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B (inner diameter, 1.0 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 0.05 m NaCl, bound proteins were eluted by a linear salt gradient from 0.05 m to 0.4 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5). Further purification of p27 was performed by a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 chromatography in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out by the standard method with antiserum against factor G subunit β or p27 (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 471-510Google Scholar). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories) and an ECL™ Western blotting detection system (Amersham Japan, Tokyo). p27 was further purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Phenyl-5PW RP column (inner diameter, 4.6 × 75 mm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) for sequence analysis. Purified p27 was reduced,S-alkylated by iodoacetamide, and digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The generated peptides were separated on a Chemcosorb 5-ODS-H column (inner diameter, 2.1 × 150 mm) (Chemco Scientific Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The amino-terminal sequence analyses of each peptide and intact p27 were carried out with an Applied Biosystems 477A or 473A gas-phase protein sequencer. Amino acid analysis was performed on a PICO·TAG system (Waters). Two degenerated oligonucleotide primers (5′-CTGAATTCGTNTAYTTYGAYATHAC-3′ and 5′- GCGAATTCTTRAARTTYTCRTCNGG-3′), each of which contained an EcoRI site (underlined), were synthesized based on the partial amino acid sequences of p27. A partial cDNA fragment for p27 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the first strand cDNA derived from the horseshoe crab hemocyte as a template, 100 pmol each of the oligonucleotide primers, and 2.5 units ofPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The generated DNA fragment containing a partial p27 cDNA fragment was used as a probe for the screening of λgt22A horseshoe crab hemocytes cDNA library (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A positive clone was isolated and its cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out on ABI PRISM™ 373A or 377 DNA sequencer using ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit. All sequences were confirmed by sequencing overlapping fragments. A computer-assisted homology search of p27 was performed in the DDBJ homology search system using the programs FASTA version 3.0 (24Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9391) Google Scholar) and BLAST version 1.4.9 (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

The sample was preincubated at 10 °C for 2 min with 6.7 μm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), in the presence and absence of CsA or FK506, in a total volume of 1.485 ml. The reaction was started by adding 15 μl of 0.1 mm α-chymotrypsin, and the fluorescence was monitored for 5 min with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. Under these assay conditions, the rate constant for the cisto trans isomerization can be obtained by measuring the rate constant of the substrate hydrolysis at the slow phase. The apparent first order rate constant (k app =k H2O +k enz) was determined from the slope of the Guggenheim plot (27Guggenheim E.A. Phil. Mag. Ser. VII. 1926; 2: 538-543Crossref Google Scholar). k H2O is the rate constant in the absence of PPIase, andk enz is that catalyzed by PPIase. One unit of PPIase activity was defined as k enz(s−1). Thek cat /K m was calculated from the equation, k enz/[E], where [E] is the concentration of PPIase. A cDNA fragment encoding the mature p27 was created by a PCR and inserted into aBamHI site of pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The expression and purification of the GST-p27 fusion protein was carried out with glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified GST-p27 was digested by trypsin (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Worthington), and then released p27 was purified by passing it through benzamidine-Sepharose (28Holmberg L. Bladh B. Astedt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns. The amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequence of the prepared recombinant p27 was confirmed. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A plasmid containing the full-length cDNA for p27 in pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) was transfected by the calcium phosphate method (29Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the medium was changed to a serum-free medium and the culture was continued for another 24 h. The cell lysate and the culture supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-p27 antiserum. The horseshoe crab hemolymph were fixed, immediately after bleeding, in 2% paraformaldehyde EM (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd., Berkshire, UK) for 10 min at room temperature. The washed hemocytes were mounted on a glass coverslip. The cells, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After the washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:50 dilution, DAKO) for 1 h, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The specimen was mounted in Entellan neu (Merck) and viewed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope. Anti-p27 antiserum, preimmune serum, or anti-horseshoe crab tachylectin 1 (L6) (30Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as primary antibody at a dilution of 1:100. Western blotting analysis with antiserum against factor G revealed two bands of 37 and 27 kDa in the horseshoe crab hemocyte lysate, which reacted specifically with anti-subunit β but not with anti-subunit α antisera (Fig.1). The 37-kDa band was indistinguishable from factor G subunit β, whereas the 27-kDa band did not correspond with any fragments of factor G or activated factor G (8Muta T. Seki N. Takaki Y. Hashimoto R. Oda T. Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We started the purification of this protein (p27) by using anti-subunit β antiserum as a probe. The hemocyte lysate was initially fractionated with dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography (Fig.2 A). Whereas the 37-kDa subunit β of factor G eluted from the column with 0.25 mNaCl corresponding to factor G activity (8Muta T. Seki N. Takaki Y. Hashimoto R. Oda T. Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), p27 was found to elute in the 2.0 m NaCl fractions. The fractions containing p27 were pooled and subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 at pH 5.5 in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 2 B). The p27-containing fractions were pooled, diluted to reduce NaCl concentration, and then applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B column at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2 C). p27 bound to the column was eluted with a NaCl gradient and was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR column (Fig. 2 D). The purified p27 gave a single band (mass = 27 kDa) on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig.2 D, inset, fraction 15), and its mobility did not change under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). Forty μg of p27 was obtained from 97.5 g (wet weight) of hemocytes (Table I).Table IPurification of p27 from the horseshoe crab hemocyte lysateStepVolumeTotal protein1-aEstimated from absorbance assumingA 280 nm1% of 10.0.Total activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgunits1-bSee “Experimental Procedures” for the unit definition.units/mg-fold%Hemocyte lysate59021,0001-cEstimated by the method of Bradford (44).7.800.00041.0100Dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B240762.400.0318330Sephadex G-1501105.31.30.2567017CM-Sepharose CL-6B500.451.22.7720015Superdex 75 HR1.00.0400.143.286001.81-a Estimated from absorbance assumingA 280 nm1% of 10.0.1-b See “Experimental Procedures” for the unit definition.1-c Estimated by the method of Bradford (44Schneuwly S.

Open table in a new tab To obtain a partial amino acid sequence, amino-terminal sequences of the purified p27 and its proteolytic fragments were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3,underlined). Two degenerated primers were synthesized based on the partial sequences (Fig. 3, boxed) and were used in reverse transcriptase-PCR with hemocyte poly(A)+ RNA as a template. A PCR fragment of 280 bp was obtained, and sequencing confirmed that it encoded p27. Using this fragment as a probe, one clone was isolated from 500,000 clones of the hemocyte cDNA library. Sequence analysis of this clone showed that the cDNA contained an open reading frame of 660 bp followed by a TAA termination codon, and that it was flanked by a 104-bp 5′-noncoding sequence containing in-frame termination codons and 914 bp of 3′-noncoding sequence. A poly(A)+ signal was missing. The open reading frame encoded a p27 precursor of 220 amino acid residues. All the partial amino acid sequences were consistent with the deduced sequence, confirming that it encoded p27 (Fig. 3, underlined). The amino-terminal sequence of the purified p27 was located at the 24th amino acid of the deduced sequence, consistent with a 23-residue pro-sequence, which exhibited the characteristics of a typical hydrophobic ER signal sequence. Thus, mature p27 was composed of 197 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 21,614 Da. The amino acid compositions calculated from the mature protein of 197 amino acids agreed well with the analytical values obtained from the purified protein (TableII). Although one potential glycosylation site (Asn148) for an N-linked carbohydrate chain (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) was present in the sequence, no amino sugar was detected in the purified p27 (Table II).Table IIAmino acid composition of p27Amino acidResidues/molecule2-aObtained by 20-h hydrolysis with 6 m HCl.

Open table in a new tab A sequence homology search indicated that p27 had extensive similarity with proteins belonging to CyPB family (Fig.4). p27 showed the highest similarity with human and mouse CyPBs (70% identity). p27 also showed more than 60% sequence identity with other vertebrate CyPBs and CyP homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (CyP-5 and 6). A CyP homologue in yeast and an eye-specific CyP homologue in Drosophila, NinaA, had 50% and 36% identity, respectively. The 15 residues conserved in all CyPs, which are involved in close contact with substrates or CsA, were also found in the p27 sequence (Fig. 3,boldface). Two distinct differences were found between p27 and other members of the CyPB family. All the members of CyPB family contain a conserved 10-residue ER retention signal at their carboxyl termini, which differs from a typical motif, K/HDEL. This signal was missing in p27. In addition, p27 had an insertion of 8 residues in the middle of the molecule, which has not been observed in any other CyPs. Since p27 showed high sequence similarity with CyPs having PPIase activity, the isomerase activity of p27 was assessed at each purification step (Fig. 2). At each step, the elution profile of p27 antigen correlated well with PPIase activity. However, p27 represented only a minor part of total PPIase activity in the hemocytes, since most of the activity was eluted in the flow-through fractions of the dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography, the first step of the purification procedure (Fig.2 A). The chymotrypsin-coupled assay for PPIase activity showed that p27 increased the hydrolysis of a peptide substrate by α-chymotrypsin by catalyzing cis to trans isomerization of Pro at the P2 site (Fig. 5 A). Thek cat /K m of purified p27 was estimated to be 0.18 μm−1 s−1, which was 5–50-fold lower than the other CyPBs. The PPIase activity of p27 was inhibited by CsA, an inhibitor for CyP family (Fig.5 B). The CsA concentration (IC50) required for 50% inhibition of the p27 (1.3 nm) activity was 8.3 nm, similar to that reported for other eukaryotic CyPs (31Schonbrunner E.R. Mayer S. Tropschug M. Fischer G. Takahashi N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3630-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, another PPIase inhibitor, FK506, did not show any inhibitory activity on p27 (data not shown). Recombinant p27 was prepared by excising an expressed insert from a GST-p27 fusion protein. Its amino-terminal sequence and amino acid composition showed that recombinant p27 started with the 4th Lys residue, indicating that the first 4 residues were removed after trypsin digestion (data not shown). This recombinant p27 showed a similar mobility with the purified protein on SDS-PAGE and reacted with the anti-subunit β antiserum (Fig.6 A). The recombinant p27 also exhibited a PPIase activity as the purified p27 (Fig. 6 B), ruling out the possibility that p27 was co-purified with minor contaminant that has isomerase activity. CyPBs have been reported to localize in the ER through their carboxyl-terminal ER retention signal (32Arber S. Krause K.H. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We tested whether p27, which lacks this retention signal, would also localize to the ER when expressed in COS cells. COS7 cells were transfected with the full-length cDNA for p27, and cell lysate and culture supernatant of the transfected cells were analyzed by using anti-p27 antiserum. p27 was detected in the culture supernatant, but not in the cells (Fig. 7). We next analyzed the distribution of p27 in the horseshoe crab hemocytes. The fixed and permeabilized hemocytes were stained with anti-p27 antiserum, followed by rhodaminelabeled secondary antibody. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses indicated that intracellular granular structures of the hemocyte were stained with anti-p27 (Fig. 8 A) but not with preimmune serum (Fig. 8 B). The staining pattern with anti-p27 antiserum was essentially same as that of antiserum against tachylectin-1 (L6), a lectin abundantly present in the L-granule (20Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,30Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 C). We further examined subcellular localization of p27 in the horseshoe crab hemocytes, which contain two types of secretory granules (L- and S-granules) (4Toh Y. Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The L- and S-granules were purified from the cells (20Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.8 D). The anti-p27 antiserum identified p27 protein in the L-granules in addition to the hemocyte lysate, but not in the S-granules. p27 was not detected in the hemolymph plasma. Similar results were obtained with anti-factor G subunit β antiserum. 2Y. Takaki and T. Muta, unpublished data. Although the cross-reactivity of p27 with antiserum against subunit β of the horseshoe crab β-glucan-sensitive serine protease zymogen factor G (Fig. 1) led us to initially speculate that it might be a new serine protease, p27 instead exhibits an amino acid sequence most similar to that of CyPs and PPIases (Figs. 3 and 4). The amino acid sequence of p27 showed little similarity with that of factor G. p27 and factor G subunit β should share a conformation-specific epitope(s), although its biological significance is unknown. Representing only a small portion of total hemocyte isomerase activity, this protein was found to localize to the hemocyte L-granules and was purified approximately 8600-fold with an overall yield of 1.8% (TableI). Comparative sequence analysis revealed that p27 was most homologous with members of the CyPB family (Fig. 4), and functional data supported this conclusion; in a chymotrypsin-coupled assay, p27 exhibited isomerase activity that was inhibited by CsA, but not by FK506 (Fig.5). These results indicate that p27 is a CyP-type enzyme, distinct from the FK506/rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP)-type enzyme (15Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). But unlike other cyclophilins, which are proteins functioning in cytosol or ER, p27 is instead found only in the L-granules of horseshoe crab hemocytes. Thus, p27 is a new type of CyPB, hereby designated as cyclophilin G (CyPG). A sequence comparison between CyPG and other CyPs offers insight into the mechanisms underlying its unique biological activities. Similar to other CyPBs, the CyPG precursor contains an amino-terminal hydrophobic pro-peptide, but unlike them it lacks a well conserved 10-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence, VEKPFAIAKE, which functions as an ER retention signal (Fig. 4) (32Arber S. Krause K.H. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed, CyPG is not retained in the cells but instead is secreted into the medium (Fig. 7), indicating that the amino-terminal pro-peptide functions as a signal peptide targeting the polypeptide to the ER, but because CyPG lacks the ER retention signal, it is not retained. The specific signal(s) which target proteins to the regulated secretory granules in hemocytes are not yet known. The signal(s) for targeting CyPG to the L-granule might be present in the unique central 8-amino acid insertion, which is not found in any known CyPBs. Alternatively, it may be present in the amino-terminal pro-peptide, or CyPG might instead localize through a conformation-specific signal patch(es). It might be noted that the amino-terminal signal sequences of CyPG and factor G subunit β (8Muta T. Seki N. Takaki Y. Hashimoto R. Oda T. Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Seki N. Muta T. Oda T. Iwaki D. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1370-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are localized in the L-granules, are similar: FLVFVTTLS and FLVFITLS, respectively, although the mature proteins exhibit little sequence similarity. In addition, both CyPG and C. elegans CyP-5 share similar carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal signal sequences; an analysis of the subcellular localization of CyP-5, which is not currently known, may provide a key insight into this question (33Page A.P. MacNiven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The specific function of CyPG in the hemocyte granule is not known. The L-granule, one of two regulated secretory granules in the hemocytes, is known to contain many proteins involved in the defense system, such as coagulation factors, lectins, and antimicrobial proteins (1Muta T. Iwanaga S. Rinkevich B. Müller W.E.G. Progress in Molecular & Subcellular Biology: Invertebrate Immunology. 15. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1996: 154-189Google Scholar, 20Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These components are stored in the granules until they are released from the cells after being stimulated by bacterial endotoxin. Since CyPs generally function as “molecular chaperones,” CyPG might similarly be involved in the quality control of stored protein components,i.e. in the refolding or repair of partially denatured proteins. For instance, a serine protease zymogen called factor C triggers an LPS-sensitive coagulation cascade, and it contains autocatalytic cleavage sites: -Lys(P3)-Pro(P2)-Arg(P1)-Ser(P1′)- and -Ser(P3)-Pro(P2)-Phe(P1)-Ile(P1′)- (34Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Morita T. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Muta T. Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage of the latter site can be catalyzed by α-chymotrypsin (36Tokunaga F. Nakajima H. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and is essential for the activation (37Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In each cleavage site, a proline is located at the P2 site, and an appropriate cis/trans conformation of theseX-Pro bonds may be critical for the autocatalytic activation of the zymogen. CyPG might function to maintain the correct conformation of such X-Pro bonds. Similarly, 7 out of 8 well defined proline residues in the crystal structure of coagulogen, a clottable protein that is the final target of the hemolymph clotting cascade, have the trans-configuration, implying that thecis/trans conformation of prolines is strictly regulated in these granules (38Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, CyPG was not detected in the S-granules (Fig. 8 D). The protein/peptide components in the S-granule are much smaller and rich in cystines, compared with those in the L-granule (20Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Kawasaki S. Seki N. Muta T. Toh Y. Ito A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Those S-granule components could be stabilized by disulfide bond(s), thus the PPIase activity to repair peptide folding might not be required. Maintaining the conformational integrity of the proline-rich L-granule proteins may be essential to sustain the integrity of the organism's host defense, and CyPG may thereby provide a key immunological function. In summary, this report demonstrates the purification, cloning, expression, and characterization of CyPG (p27), a unique PPIase that is present in the regulated secretory granules of horseshoe crab hemocytes. This is the first report to establish the existence of such “quality control” molecules in regulated secretory granules, and although the exact function of CyPG is not known, the recognized function of cyclophilins as molecular chaperones suggests that it may play a role in maintaining the conformational integrity of stored granular proteins. Indeed, the presence of at least 11 isoforms of CyPs in C. elegans (33Page A.P. MacNiven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) has suggested that CyPs may exhibit more varied biological activities than previously recognized. Further elucidation of the function of CyPG in the horseshoe crab hemocyte granule may therefore offer interesting insights into the diverse functions of this interesting group of molecules.
