https://openalex.org/W2036500213,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) affects the growth and differentiation of many hemopoietic cells in vitro; in particular, it is a potent suppressor of macrophage and T cell functions. In IL-10-deficient mice, generated by gene targeting, lymphocyte development and antibody responses are normal, but most animals are growth retarded and anemic and suffer from chronic enterocolitis. Alterations in intestine include extensive mucosal hyperplasia, inflammatory reactions, and aberrant expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on epithelia. In contrast, mutants kept under specific pathogen-free conditions develop only a local inflammation limited to the proximal colon. These results indicate that the bowel inflammation in the mutants originates from uncontrolled immune responses stimulated by enteric antigens and that IL-10 is an essential immunoregulator in the intestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W1979319210,"Although the primary cellular targets of many anticancer agents have been identified, less is known about the processes leading to the selective cell death of cancer cells or the molecular basis of drug resistance. p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used to examine systematically the requirement for p53 in cellular sensitivity and resistance to a diverse group of anticancer agents. These results demonstrate that an oncogene, specifically the adenovirus E1A gene, can sensitize fibroblasts to apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide, and adriamycin. Furthermore, the p53 tumor suppressor is required for efficient execution of the death program. These data reinforce the notion that the cytotoxic action of many anticancer agents involves processes subsequent to the interaction between drug and cellular target and indicate that divergent stimuli can activate a common cell death program. Consequently, the involvement of p53 in the apoptotic response suggests a mechanism whereby tumor cells can acquire cross-resistance to anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2017949036,"A developmental analysis of growth kinetics in mouse embryos carrying null mutations of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, and the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R), alone or in combination, defined the onset of mutational effects leading to growth deficiency and indicated that between embryonic days 11.0 and 12.5, IGF1R serves only the in vivo mitogenic signaling of IGF-II. From E13.5 onward, IGF1R interacts with both IGF-I and IGF-II, while IGF-II recognizes an additional unknown receptor (XR). In contrast with the embryo proper, placental growth is served exclusively by an IGF-II-XR interaction. Additional genetic data suggested that the type 2IGF/mannose 6-phosphate receptor is an unlikely candidate for XR. Postnatal growth curves indicated that surviving Igf-1(-/-) mutants, which are infertile and exhibit delayed bone development, continue to grow with a retarded rate after birth in comparison with wild-type littermates and become 30% of normal weight as adults."
https://openalex.org/W2000208875,"Mice deficient for interleukin-2 develop normally during the first 3-4 weeks of age. However, later on they become severely compromised, and about 50% of the animals die between 4 and 9 weeks after birth. Of the remaining mice, 100% develop an inflammatory bowel disease with striking clinical and histological similarity to ulcerative colitis in humans. The alterations of the immune system are characterized by a high number of activated T and B cells, elevated immunoglobulin secretion, anti-colon antibodies, and aberrant expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. The data provide evidence for a primary role of the immune system in the etiology of ulcerative colitis and strongly suggest that the disease results from an abnormal immune response to a normal antigenic stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2036274324,"bcl-2-/-mice complete embryonic development, but display growth retardation and early mortality postnatally. Hematopoiesis including lymphocyte differentiation is initially normal, but thymus and spleen undergo massive apoptotic involution. Thymocytes require an apoptotic signal to manifest accelerated cell death. Renal failure results from severe polycystic kidney disease characterized by dilated proximal and distal tubular segments and hyperproliferation of epithelium and interstitium. bcl-2-/-mice turn gray with the second hair follicle cycle, implicating a defect in redox-regulated melanin synthesis. The abnormalities in these loss of function mice argue that Bcl-2 is a death repressor molecule functioning in an antioxidant pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1993672117,"Newborn mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of insulin-like growth factor gene (Igf-1) exhibit a growth deficiency similar in severity to that previously observed in viable Igf-2 null mutants (60% of normal birthweight). Depending on genetic background, some of the Igf-1(-/-) dwarfs die shortly after birth, while others survive and reach adulthood. In contrast, null mutants for the Igf1r gene die invariably at birth of respiratory failure and exhibit a more severe growth deficiency (45% normal size). In addition to generalized organ hypoplasia in Igf1r(-/-) embryos, including the muscles, and developmental delays in ossification, deviations from normalcy were observed in the central nervous system and epidermis. Igf-1(-/-)/Igf1r(-/-) double mutants did not differ in phenotype from Igf1r(-/-) single mutants, while in Igf-2(-)/Igf1r(-/-) and Igf-1(-/-)/Igf-2(-) double mutants, which are phenotypically identical, the dwarfism was further exacerbated (30% normal size). The roles of the IGFs in mouse embryonic development, as revealed from the phenotypic differences between these mutants, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2042288895,"Measles virus normally causes disease in human beings, and the host range of this virus may be determined by a specific receptor on the surface of primate cells. Human-rodent somatic cell hybrids were tested for their ability to bind measles virus, and only cells that contained human chromosome 1 were capable of binding virus. A study of lymphocyte markers suggested that the complement regulator known either as membrane cofactor protein or CD46 was the measles virus receptor. We proved this hypothesis by demonstrating that hamster cell lines that expressed human CD46 could subsequently bind virus. Furthermore, infected CD46+ cells produced syncytia and viral proteins. Finally, polyclonal antisera against CD46 inhibited virus binding and infection. These results prove that human CD46 permits cells both to bind measles virus and to support infection."
https://openalex.org/W2152892875,"Hereditary major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency (or bare lymphocyte syndrome) is a form of severe primary immunodeficiency with a total lack of MHC class II expression. It is due to a defect in the regulation of MHC class II genes. A novel gene was isolated by complementation cloning, using an MHC class II-negative mutant cell line. This gene (CIITA) functions as a transactivator of MHC class II gene expression and restores expression of all MHC class II isotypes in mutant cells. In addition, CIITA fully corrects the MHC class II regulatory defect of cells from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome. In this disease we have identified a splicing mutation that results in a 24 amino acid deletion in CIITA, resulting in loss of function of the transactivator. Hence, the CIITA gene is essential for MHC class II gene expression and has been shown to be responsible for hereditary MHC class II deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2062572904,"Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop a disease very similar to type 1 diabetes in humans. We have generated a transgenic mouse strain carrying the rearranged T cell receptor genes from a diabetogenic T cell clone derived from a NOD mouse. Self-reactive T cells expressing the transgene-encoded specificity are not tolerized in these animals, resulting in rampant insulitis and eventually diabetes. Features of the disease process emphasize two so-called check-points, recognized previously in the NOD and human diseases but easily misinterpreted. Although NOD mice are protected from insulitis and diabetes by expression of the E molecule encoded in the major histocompatibility complex, the transgenics are not, permitting us to exclude some possible mechanisms of protection."

https://openalex.org/W2133124453,"BCR-ABL is a chimeric oncoprotein that exhibits deregulated tyrosine kinase activity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive human leukemias. Sequences within the first exon of BCR are required to activate the transforming potential of BCR-ABL. The SH2/SH3 domain-containing GRB-2 protein links tyrosine kinases to Ras signaling. We demonstrate that BCR-ABL exists in a complex with GRB-2 in vivo. Binding of GRB-2 to BCR-ABL is mediated by the direct interaction of the GRB-2 SH2 domain with a phosphorylated tyrosine, Y177, within the BCR first exon. The BCR-ABL-GRB-2 interaction is required for activation of the Ras signaling pathway. Mutation of Y177 to phenylalanine (Y177F) abolishes GRB-2 binding and abrogates BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation. The BCR-ABL (Y177F) mutant is unable to transform primary bone marrow cultures and is impaired in its ability to transform Rat1 fibroblasts. These findings implicate activation of Ras function as an important component in BCR-ABL-mediated transformation and demonstrate that GRB-2 not only functions in normal development and mitogenesis but also plays a role in oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2106315019,"Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a transcriptional activator, and its antagonistic repressor, IRF-2, were originally identified as regulators of the type I interferon (IFN) system. We have generated mice deficient in either IRF-1 or IRF-2 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. IRF-1-deficient fibroblasts lacked the normally observed type I IFN induction by poly(I):poly(C), while they induced type I IFN to similar levels as the wild type following Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection. In contrast, IRF-2-deficient fibroblasts showed up-regulated type I IFN induction by NDV infection. A profound reduction of TCR alpha beta+CD4-CD8+ T cells in IRF-1-deficient mice, with a thymocyte developmental defect, reveals a critical role for IRF-1 in T cell development. IRF-2-deficient mice exhibited bone marrow suppression of hematopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis and mortality following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W1971245466,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) causes G1 growth arrest and the accumulation of unphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in responsive cells. Cdk4 (cyclin-dependent kinase), a major catalytic subunit of the mammalian D-type G1 cyclins, can phosphorylate Rb in vitro, and at least one D-type cyclin, D2, directs the phosphorylation of Rb in vivo. Here we show that TGF beta 1 induces suppression of cdk4 synthesis in G1 in mink lung epithelial cells. Constitutive cdk4 synthesis in these cells led to TGF beta 1 resistance. It also resulted in growth in low serum medium when these cells were released from contact inhibition. Cdk2 activity was also suppressed by TGF beta 1 action, but its constitutive expression failed to override a TGF beta 1-induced G1 block. Hence, the TGF beta 1 block is primarily mediated by cdk4 modulation. Further evidence suggests that TGF beta 1-induced down-modulation of cdk4 leads to inhibition of cdk2 activation and that both events might contribute to TGF beta 1 growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2081975691,"We have generated mice carrying a germline mutation in the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain of the trkB gene. This mutation eliminates expression of gp145trkB, a protein-tyrosine kinase that serves as the signaling receptor for two members of the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-4. Mice homozygous for this mutation, trkBTK(-/-), develop to birth. However, these animals do not display feeding activity, and most die by P1. Neuroanatomical examination of trkBTK (-/-) mice revealed neuronal deficiencies in the central (facial motor nucleus and spinal cord) and peripheral (trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia) nervous systems. These findings illustrate the role of the gp145trkB protein-tyrosine kinase receptor in the ontogeny of the mammalian nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2065967745,"We used the fluorescent membrane probe FM 1–43 to label recycling synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic boutons of dissociated hippocampal neurons in culture. Quantitative time-lapse fluorescence imaging was employed in combination with rapid superfusion techniques to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles within single boutons. This approach enabled us to measure exocytosis and to analyze the kinetics of endocytosis and the preparation of endocytosed vesicles for re-release (repriming). Our measurements indicate that under sustained membrane depolarization, endocytosis persists much longer than exocytosis, with a ); once internalized, vesicles become reavailable for exocytosis in ∼ 30 s. Furthermore, we have shown that endocytosis is not dependent on membrane potential and, unlike exocytosis, that it is independent of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1964795153,"Dorsal mesoderm is thought to provide important signals for axis formation and neural differentiation in vertebrate embryos. We have examined induction and patterning in a zebrafish mutant, no tail, that lacks a derivative of dorsal mesoderm, the notochord. Despite the absence of a differentiated notochord, development of the central nervous system including floor plate appears normal, likely owing to the presence of notochord precursor cells. In contrast, somites are misshapen, and muscle pioneer cells are absent. Wild-type cells transplanted into mutant hosts can autonomously differentiate into notochord and thereby rescue somitic defects, suggesting that interactions between notochord and paraxial mesoderm are necessary for proper somite patterning. Thus, cells derived from dorsal mesoderm may have multiple signaling functions during zebrafish embryogenesis."

We report here the purification, electron microscopic visualization, and motor properties of a protein of this class. Myosin-V molecules consist of two heads attached to an approximately 30 nm stalk that ends in a globular region of unknown function. Myosin-V binds to and decorates F-actin, has actin-activated magnesium-ATPase activity, and is a barbed-end-directed motor capable of moving actin filaments at rates of up to 400 nm/s. Myosin-V does not form filaments. Each myosin-V heavy chain is associated with approximately four calmodulin light chains as well as two less abundant proteins of 23 and 17 kd."
https://openalex.org/W2164269732,"DNA replication in mammalian cells occurs in discrete nuclear foci. Here we show that terminally differentiated myotubes can be induced to reenter S phase and show the same pattern of replication foci as cycling cells. We used this cellular system to analyze the interaction of cell cycle proteins with these foci in vivo. Cyclin A and cdk2, but not cyclin B1 and cdc2, were specifically localized at nuclear replication foci, just like the replication protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen. A potential target of cyclin A and cdk2 is the 34 kd subunit of replication protein A (RPA34). In contrast with the 70 kd subunit, which localizes to the foci, RPA34 was not detected at these replication sites, which may reflect a transient interaction. The specific localization of cyclin A and cdk2 at nuclear replication foci provides a direct link between cell cycle regulation and DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2055039476,"Replication of RNA viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is dependent upon multiple specific interactions between viral RNAs and viral and cellular proteins. A small molecule that interferes specifically with one or more of these RNA-protein interactions could be an efficacious antiviral agent. Here we show that certain aminoglycoside antibiotics, in particular neomycin B, can block binding of the HIV Rev protein to its viral RNA recognition element. Inhibition appears to be highly selective, resulting from competitive binding of the drug to a small viral RNA region within the Rev-binding site. We further demonstrate that neomycin B can specifically antagonize Rev function in vitro and in vivo and can inhibit production of HIV. Our results establish the feasibility for developing antiviral drugs that act by selectively blocking RNA-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2062319807,"In budding yeast, G1 cyclins such as CLN1 and CLN2 are expressed in G1 and S phases, while mitotic cyclins such as CLB1 and CLB2 are expressed in G2 and M phases. We find that the CLBs play a central role in the transition from CLNs to CLBs: the CLBs stimulate their own expression while repressing that of CLNs. This negative regulation of CLNs may occur via the transcription factor SWI4, because CLBs are necessary for G2 repression of SCB-regulated genes like CLN1 and CLN2 but not for repression of MCB-regulated genes like DNA polymerase and CLB5. Furthermore, SW14 associates with CLB2 protein and is a substrate for the CLB2-associated CDC28 kinase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1977546470,"We describe a novel signal-transducing protein complex, which consists of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain that is disulfide linked to a 33 kd glycoprotein and noncovalently associated with proteins of the CD3 complex on the surface of the pre-T cell line SCB.29. This 33 kd glycoprotein, provisionally designated gp33, represents neither of the known TCR chains and has escaped previous detection because it labels poorly by surface iodination. This glycoprotein is absent from the surface of mature T cell lines. A TCR beta complex with identical molecular masses before and after reduction can be immunoprecipitated from surface-iodinated large thymocytes of TCR alpha-deficient mice. The novel gp33-TCR beta complex may be entirely or partly responsible for control of early T cell development exerted by the TCR beta protein."
https://openalex.org/W2165218504,"Nucleosomes positioned over promoters are usually inhibitory to protein binding and activity. We analyzed at the nucleotide level of resolution the nucleosomal organization of a distal, liver-specific enhancer in various mouse tissues and found that the enhancer exists in an array of three precisely positioned nucleosomes only in liver chromatin, where the enhancer is active. In vivo footprinting reveals that essential transcription factor-binding sites are occupied on apparent nucleosome surfaces, in one case leading to a perturbed nucleosomal structure. A similar nucleosomal array is generated with an in vitro chromatin assembly system in which nucleosome positioning is dependent upon binding to the enhancer of proteins related to hepatocyte nuclear factor 3. We suggest that certain transcription factors can organize nucleosomal structures that define an active enhancer element."
https://openalex.org/W1501106246,"Recent work has demonstrated that inhibition of nitric oxide production with various nitric oxide synthesis inhibitors (l-NAME, l-NMMA) initiate leukocyte adhesion to postcapillary venules. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism (or mechanisms) that promote the l-NAME-induced leukocyte response. Intravital microscopy was used to examine 25–40 μm venules in the rat mesentery. Nitric oxide synthesis was inhibited with l-NAME and leukocyte adhesion was observed over the first 60 min. The fourfold increase in leukocyte adhesion was independent of alterations in venular red blood cell velocity. The adhesion was superoxide-mediated inasmuch as superoxide dismutase (SOD) abolished the rise in leukocyte adhesion associated with nitric oxide synthesis inhibition. Ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer, also abolished the rise in leukocyte adhesion induced by l-NAME, Histology revealed that mast cell degranulation occurred only in animals treated with l-NAME but not in animals pretreated with SOD or kctotifen. This observation suggests that mast cells become activated in the absence of nitric oxide production and superoxide contributes to the mast cell activation. The l-NAME-induced leukocyte adhesion could be reproduced by infusing hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (a superoxide generating system) or compound 48/80 (an activator of mast cells) and both responses were attenuated by ketotifen. These data suggest that inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis results in a superoxide and mast cell-dependent leukocyte adhesion.—Kubes, P., Kanwar, S., Niu, X.-F., Gaboury, J. P.

https://openalex.org/W1590413499,"The messenger RNA for apolipoprotein B undergoes a discrete and specific C to U editing of nucleotide 6666. This generates a stop translation codon and defines the carboxyl terminus of apolipoprotein B48. A 27-kDa rat intestinal protein that does not itself edit apolipoprotein B mRNA, but confers editing activity on chick intestinal extracts that do not have intrinsic editing activity, has recently been identified and its cDNA cloned (Teng, B., Burant, C. F., and Davidson, N. O. (1993) Science 260, 1816-1819). Here we show that p27 is homologous in the zinc coordinating region of the active site to cytidine deaminases from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, yeast, and man and to deoxycytidylate deaminases from T2 and T4 bacteriophages and man. p27 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocyte extracts has cytidine deaminase activity and specifically confers editing activity on chick intestinal extracts. The homologous E. coli cytidine deaminase does not confer editing activity. The zinc-specific chelating agent o-phenanthroline abolishes p27 activity and site-specific apolipoprotein B mRNA editing in rat enterocyte editing extracts. We conclude that p27 is the catalytic subunit of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme and is a zinc-containing cytidine deaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1520755299,"The mouse microphthalmia phenotype is complex and consists of one or more of the following phenotypic alterations: a lack of pigmentation, small eyes, a mast cell defect, and bone abnormalities. The locus for this allele has been assigned to chromosome 6. A single gene defect that produces such a pleiotropic effect has suggested some involvement at a control point in development. Recently a mutant line of mice carrying a transgene insertion, which represents a new allelic form of mi, was described. The integration site of the transgene from these mi(tg) mice was cloned and analyzed. An exon sequence was discovered adjacent to the insertion. Computer analysis of this nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of a motif indicative of the helix-loop-helix class of transcription factors. The gene was expressed in a number of tissues from wild type animals but was absent in the tissue RNA from mi(tg) mice. Southern blot analysis demonstrated a deletion of some of the genetic material for this gene in the mi(tg) mice. This is consistent with the lack of expression in the mi(tg) mice. Interestingly, when DNA from other mi allelic variants was subjected to a similar analysis, a deletion was also observed in this gene in two other mi lines. Taken together, these data suggest that the gene encoding this new helix-loop-helix DNA-binding protein, and residing in the mi locus, is a strong candidate for the mi gene."
https://openalex.org/W1501401884,"Viruses are known to acquire and modify the genes of their hosts to attain a survival advantage in the host environment. Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a T-lymphotropic virus that causes fatal lymphoproliferative diseases in several non-human primates. The gene ECRF3 of HVS was most likely acquired from a primate host. ECRF3 encodes a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor that is remotely related (approximately 30% amino acid identity) to the known mammalian alpha and beta chemokine receptors, namely interleukin-8 receptor (IL8R) types A and B and the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor, respectively. Chemokines regulate the trafficking, activation, and, in some cases, proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid cell types. We now show that ECRF3 encodes a functional receptor for the alpha chemokines IL-8, GRO/melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA), and NAP-2 but not for beta chemokines, a specificity identical to that of IL8RB. Paradoxically, IL8RA shares 77% amino acid identity with IL8RB but is not a receptor for GRO/MGSA or NAP-2. This is the first functional characterization of a viral seven-transmembrane-domain receptor. It suggests a novel role for alpha chemokines in the pathogenesis of HVS infection by transmembrane signaling via the product of ECRF3."
https://openalex.org/W1998090727,"Each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives input from about 160,000 glutamatergic granule cells. In anatomically intact preparations this input has hitherto been studied only as a compound synaptic potential or current. Presented here are simultaneous recordings in cerebellar slices of synaptically connected granule cell-Purkinje cell pairs. The mean amplitude of the excitatory synaptic currents evoked by stimulation of individual granule cells ranged from 2 to 60 pA, whereas the great majority of the spontaneous glutamatergic currents in Purkinje cells in the presence of tetrodotoxin were <40 pA. In several cases, stimulation of a single granule cell evoked a disynaptic inhibitory current. It is estimated that on the order of 50 simultaneously active granule cells are sufficient to excite a Purkinje cell."
https://openalex.org/W2063466760,"C. elegans hermaphrodites make sperm and then oocytes in an otherwise female animal. Gain-of-function mutations in the sex-determining gene tra-2 (tra-2(gf)) transform hermaphrodites into females (spermless hermaphrodites). The tra-2(gf) mutations map to a perfect direct repeat in the 3' untranslated region; each repeat is called a direct repeat element (DRE). Three experiments demonstrate that DREs repress tra-2 at the translational level. First, tra-2(gf) mRNAs are associated with larger polysomes than are their wild-type counterparts. Second, translation of a reporter RNA is inhibited by DREs. Third, disruption of DREs does not increase tra-2 mRNA levels. An RNA binding activity specifically associates with the DREs. We propose that tra-2 translation is inhibited by association of an RNA binding-factor with the DREs and that this translational control is essential for development of C. elegans as a hermaphrodite/male species."

https://openalex.org/W2013454744,"The cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor bears two tyrosine-containing determinants that can independently target receptors from the Golgi to the basolateral plasma membrane of MDCK cells. We found that these determinants, localized to the membrane-proximal and -distal regions of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain, also control polarized sorting in endosomes. Inactivation of the distal determinant reduced receptors' ability to return to the basolateral domain following endocytosis, resulting instead in receptor transcytosis from basolateral endosomes to the apical plasma membrane. Similarly, receptors internalized from the apical surface were transported from apical endosomes to the basolateral surface, owing to the proximal basolateral targeting determinant. Thus, receptor recycling in endosomes is directed by the same signals as polarized sorting in the Golgi, indicating that sorting on the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways involves similar mechanisms. The observation that brefeldin A interfered with sorting but not transport in both endosomes and the Golgi further supports this."
https://openalex.org/W1982418584,"The RecG protein of E. coli is a junction-specific DNA helicase involved in recombination and DNA repair. The function of the protein was investigated using an in vitro recombination reaction catalyzed by RecA. We show that RecG counters RecA-driven strand exchange by catalyzing branch migration of the Holliday junction in the reverse direction. This activity represents a new mechanism for resolving recombination intermediates that is independent of junction cleavage. We discuss how reverse branch migration can facilitate DNA repair, promote recombination in conjugational crosses, and confine the distribution of Chi-stimulated cross-overs. We suggest that the RecG mechanism for resolution of junctions is universal and provides a simple system that allows gene conversion without associated crossing over."

https://openalex.org/W2058503971,"Mutagenesis experiments on voltage-gated K+ channels have suggested that the ion-selective pore is comprised mostly of H5 segments. To see whether regions outside of the H5 segment might also contribute to the pore structure, we have studied the effect of single amino acid substitutions in the segment that connects the S4 and S5 putative transmembrane segments (S4-S5 loop) on various permeation properties of Shaker K+ channels. Mutations in the S4-S5 loop alter the Rb+ selectivity, the single-channel K+ and Rb+ conductances, and the sensitivity to open channel block produced by intracellular tetraethylammonium ion, Ba2+, and Mg2+. The block of Shaker K+ channels by intracellular Mg2+ is surprising, but is reminiscent of the internal Mg2+ blockade of inward rectifier K+ channels. The results suggest that the S4-S5 loop constitutes part of the ion-selective pore. Thus, the S4-S5 loop and the H5 segment are likely to contribute to the long pore characteristic of voltage-gated K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1556070173,"Integrins are a family of heterodimeric integral plasma membrane proteins that behave as receptors for components of the extracellular matrix and also mediate cell to cell adhesion. Occupation of integrins can result in the transduction of intracellular signals, leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and induction of gene expression. We report here that the ligation of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin by collagen-adhesion stimulatory anti-alpha 2 and anti-beta 1 antibodies resulted in the accumulation of p21ras in the active GTP-bound state in Jurkat T-lymphoblastoid cells. The activation was accompanied by the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 47-52 kDa. This stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and p21ras activation was specific for the activating antibodies and occurred within 2 min of the addition of these antibodies. Although treatment of the cells with the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also resulted in an induction of both cell attachment to collagen and of p21ras activation, tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed. These results demonstrate that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin activation can result in the specific stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of 47-52-kDa proteins, as well as activation of a signaling pathway involving p21ras."
https://openalex.org/W2128888716,"We used high resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy to visualize Golgi cisternal structure and analyze morphological transitions induced by various in vitro incubations. Our images show that Golgi cisternae have two distinct surface coatings with different distributions and apparent functions. The first type, probably a coatomer coat, consists of tightly packed ∼10 nm surface particles. These are localized exclusively to sites of membrane budding and are as intimately involved in bud formation as clathrin or caveolin coats. When this coating is exaggerated by GTPγS, the periphery of all cisternae is partitioned into coated vesicles that remain attached at their sites of formation. A second, much finer coating is evenly distributed over the periphery of cisternae, including tubules enclosing the fenestrae. It appears to stabilize the membrane curvature associated with tubules and edges. These different coatings must be considered in further attempts to unravel Golgi membrane trafficking mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1521646176,"Anti-peptide antibody to the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was produced and used to demonstrate that a subset of the GR population resides in the plasma membrane of human leukemic cells. Characterization of the antibody with intracellular GR (iGR) showed its ability to shift [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-labeled GR (4S protein) from two human leukemic cell lines to a higher density in sucrose gradients; Western and autoradiographic analysis of affinity-labeled ([3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate) receptor revealed an immunoreactive and competitively labeled band of 94 kDa. CCRF-CEM cell membrane GR (mGR) resolved as a > 7S protein on density gradients and immunoselected cell surface protein labeled by whole cell biotinylation or affinity-labeling with [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate was ~145 kDa, demonstrating that mGR was larger in size than iGR, as has been shown previously for the mGR of mouse lymphoma cells. Analysis of mGR in lymphocytes of leukemic patients and the CCRF-CEM cell line indicated differences in levels of expression as shown by FACS and immunocytochemical analyses. We arc currently using this system to study the correlation between the quantity of membrane-resident GRs and the glucocorticoid-induced lytic response, a relationship previously shown in the murine (S-49 cell) system.—Gametchu, B., Watson, C.

This key post-translational modification is catalyzed by p21ras farnesyltransferase, which transfers farnesyl from farnesylpyrophosphate to the cysteine of the CA1A2X carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of p21ras. In the present report, we describe potent inhibition of p21ras farnesyltransferase by CA1A2X peptidomimetics containing no peptidic amide bonds. We synthesized a series of CA1A2X analogues where the 2 aliphatic amino acids A1 and A2 were replaced by a hydrophobic spacer, 3-aminomethylbenzoic acid (AMBA). The peptidomimetic Cys-AMBA-Met, inhibits p21ras farnesyltransferase from human colon carcinoma (COLO-205) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) with IC50 values of 60 and 120 nM, respectively. Cys-AMBA-Met is 3-, 8-, and 9-fold (COLO-205) and 2-, 5-, and 7-fold (Daudi) more potent than the corresponding tetrapeptides of p21KB-ras (CVIM), p21N-ras (CVVM), and p21KA-ras (CIIM), respectively. Replacing methionine at the X position with negatively charged glutamate reduces its ability to inhibit the enzyme, whereas positively charged lysine at this position abolishes the inhibitory character of the peptidomimetic. A hydrophobic moiety at the X position, as in Cys-AMBA-Phe, retains potent inhibitory activity. Leucine in the X position of CA1A2X is a post-translational signal for protein geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation, and, as expected, Cys-AMBA-Leu does not inhibit the enzyme. Furthermore, CVIM, CVVM, and CIIM are farnesylated by human p21ras farnesyltransferases and inhibit these enzymes by serving as alternative substrates. In contrast, the peptidomimetics described here are true p21ras farnesyltransferase inhibitors since none is farnesylated by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1988418910,"A dynamic network of cortical microfilaments is associated with the cleavage furrow membranes during cellularization of the Drosophila embryo. A specific set of structural rearrangements in this network is required for orchestration and execution of its mechanistic roles. We describe the characterization of the gene bottleneck (bnk), mutations in which disturb the proper sequence of rearrangements of the microfilament network, leading to a variety of morphological defects during cellularization. bnk, whose expression is restricted to the blastoderm stages of Drosophila embryogenesis, encodes a novel, exceptionally basic protein that specifically colocalizes with the microfilament network. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype of bnk suggest a direct role for this element in regulation of the dynamic restructuring of the actin-based cytoskeleton of cellularizing Drosophila embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1508365798,"The D-glucuronosyl- (GlcA) and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl- (GlcNAc) transferase reactions involved in heparin/heparan sulfate biosynthesis were assayed, measuring transfer of radiolabeled GlcA or GlcNAc monosaccharide units from the corresponding UDP-sugars to the appropriate oligosaccharide acceptors. The assays were applied to enzyme purification from bovine serum. The two activities remained inseparable through a series of different chromatographic steps, resulting in approximately -2000-fold purification. Further purification was achieved by chromatofocusing, which showed an isoelectric point of pH approximately -7.0, similar for both activities. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of subfractions from the chromatofocusing procedure revealed an approximately 70-kDa protein in amounts reflecting enzyme activity. SDS-PAGE followed by extraction of gel segments and renaturation of proteins showed that the GlcA- and GlcNAc-transferase activities were both recovered from the same single segment, corresponding to the 70-kDa component. It is proposed that the two glycosyltransferase reactions are catalyzed by the same Golgi enzyme (see also Lidholt, K., Weinke, J. L., Kiser, C. S., Lugemwa, F. N., Bame, K. J., Cheifetz, S., Massague, J., Lindahl, U., and Esko, J. D. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 2267-2271)."
https://openalex.org/W2038591883,"Preliminary work using directed mutagenesis proved that cysteine is not required for operation of UhpT, the anion exchange protein responsible for glucose 6-phosphate transport by E. coli. We then made a detailed study of C143 and C265, because these cysteines impart sensitivity to p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate (PCMBS), a sulfhydral agent resembling glucose 6-phosphate in size, shape, and charge. We showed that C143 was exposed to the cytoplasm, as expected from hydropathy analysis, but we found no sidedness for C265. Rather, C265 was accessible to PCMBS from both membrane surfaces. And since the attack at C265 was blocked by glucose 6-phosphate, position 265 must lie directly on the pathway taken by the substrate as it moves through this membrane carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1502858476,"Although initially it was thought that polydimethylsiloxane (silicone) was biologically inert, recent published studies have demonstrated varying levels of IgG antibody reactive with this structure in humans. The objective of our study was to determine whether silicone implanted in humans results in a measurable immune response directed against a 3700 mol wt hydroxyl terminated silicone molecule and whether that response could be correlated with the level of presumed silicone exposure as inferred by clinical history. In a blind study, sera from 111 patients, with and without breast implants, were sent to a laboratory using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine specific anti-silicone IgG antibody levels. Test results showed that patients with implants demonstrated statistically significant elevation in anti-silicone antibodies compared with the unimplanted control groups. The highest anti-silicone antibody levels were measured in implanted women with either frank implant ruptures or leakage of their silicone gel implants.—Wolf, L. E., Lappé, M., Peterson, R.

https://openalex.org/W1636516195,"Histone H1 is a major chromatin protein, which stabilizes the nucleosome, has an essential role in organizing nucleosomes into higher order structures, and may have a role as a repressor of transcription (van Holde, K. E. (1989) Chromatin, Springer Publishing Co., New York). Here we show that H1 forms a defined complex with a synthetic four-way junction of DNA strands even in the presence of an excess of linear nonspecific competitor DNA. The four-way junction also competes efficiently against two duplex DNA molecules, which together have the same sequence information as the four-way junction molecule. Another major chromatin protein, high mobility group protein 1, also binds four-way junction structures specifically (Bianchi, M. E., Beltrame, M., and Paonessa, G. (1989) Science 243, 1056-1059), and this similar behavior may indicate a related function of these proteins. Our finding may suggest that four-way DNA junction is a structural equivalent to the main H1 binding site in the nucleosome: a crossover of double helical DNA at the point where the DNA enters and exits the nucleosome (Allan, J., Hartman, P. G., Crane-Robinson, C., and Aviles, F. X. (1980) Nature 288, 675-679)."

https://openalex.org/W1999518377,"Bacteriophage T4 Alc protein participates in shutting off host transcription after infection of E. coli. It is demonstrated that Alc acts as a site-specific termination factor. The Alc sites occur frequently in E. coli DNA, resulting in early cessation of elongation in several tested transcription units. Alc-dependent termination requires unimpeded propagation of the elongating complex as it approaches the Alc site. Temporary halting of RNA polymerase within 10-15 bp before the Alc site prevents termination. Bacteriophage T4 transcription is protected from the action of Alc by overall substitution of cytosine with 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine in T4 DNA. In vitro methylation of CpG sequences in the vicinity of an Alc site abolishes the effect of Alc. Thus, Alc-dependent termination involves local sensing of the state of cytosine modification and a short-term ""memory"" of recent pausing."
https://openalex.org/W1593741601,"Vitamin A deficiency severely compromises the magnitude of the primary and secondary antibody response to tetanus toxoid (TT) but does not impair the development of immunologic memory. To further characterize this immunodeficiency in antibody production, we have quantified the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c) during the primary and secondary response to TT in normal, vitamin A-deficient, and retinol-repleted rats. In the primary response in normal rats, anti-TT IgG1 and IgG2b predominated. In vitamin A-deficient rats the production of anti-TT IgG2b was severely impaired, with little change in either IgG1 or IgG2a. In the secondary response vitamin A-deficient rats produced low levels of all anti-TT IgG subclasses. However, when vitamin A-deficient rats were repleted with retinol 2 days before reimmunization their secondary anti-TT IgG response was normal both in magnitude and IgG subclass distribution. This result implies that although vitamin A deficiency during the primary antibody response impaired anti-TT IgG2b production, it did not inhibit Ig heavy chain recombination or the differentiation of lymphocytes that formed memory B cells for each subclass; furthermore, these cells were activated in the secondary response after vitamin A status was improved. Thus, these experiments further support the concept that memory cell formation remains normal during vitamin A deficiency despite low levels of antibody production.—Kinoshita, M., Ross, A. C. Vitamin A status and immunoglobulin G subclasses in rats immunized with tetanus toxoid. FASEB J. 7: 1277-1282; 1993."
