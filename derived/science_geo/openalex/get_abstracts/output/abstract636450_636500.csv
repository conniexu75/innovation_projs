https://openalex.org/W2909737023,"Understanding the mechanism of high temperature (high Tc) superconductivity is a central problem in condensed matter physics. It is often speculated that high Tc superconductivity arises from a doped Mott insulator as described by the Hubbard model. An exact solution of the Hubbard model, however, is extremely challenging due to the strong electron-electron correlation. Therefore, it is highly desirable to experimentally study a model Hubbard system in which the unconventional superconductivity can be continuously tuned by varying the Hubbard parameters. Here we report signatures of tunable superconductivity in ABC-trilayer graphene (TLG) / boron nitride (hBN) moir\'e superlattice. Unlike ""magic angle"" twisted bilayer graphene, theoretical calculations show that under a vertical displacement field the ABC-TLG/hBN heterostructure features an isolated flat valence miniband associated with a Hubbard model on a triangular superlattice. Upon applying such a displacement field we find experimentally that the ABC-TLG/hBN superlattice displays Mott insulating states below 20 Kelvin at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings, corresponding to 1 and 2 holes per unit cell, respectively. Upon further cooling, signatures of superconducting domes emerge below 1 kelvin for the electron- and hole-doped sides of the 1/4 filling Mott state. The electronic behavior in the TLG/hBN superlattice is expected to depend sensitively on the interplay between the electron-electron interaction and the miniband bandwidth, which can be tuned continuously with the displacement field D. By simply varying the D field, we demonstrate transitions from the candidate superconductor to Mott insulator and metallic phases. Our study shows that TLG/hBN heterostructures offer an attractive model system to explore rich correlated behavior emerging in the tunable triangular Hubbard model."

Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression in multiple cell lineages in MS lesions and validated the results using multiplex in situ hybridization. We found selective vulnerability and loss of excitatory CUX2-expressing projection neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal inflammation; such MS neuron populations exhibited upregulation of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs. Signatures of stressed oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes and activated microglia mapped most strongly to the rim of MS plaques. Notably, single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified phagocytosing microglia and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear import of myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human culture assays. Our findings indicate lineage- and region-specific transcriptomic changes associated with selective cortical neuron damage and glial activation contributing to progression of MS lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2958014316,"Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often achieve remission after therapy, but subsequently die of relapse1 that is driven by chemotherapy-resistant leukaemic stem cells (LSCs)2,3. LSCs are defined by their capacity to initiate leukaemia in immunocompromised mice4. However, this precludes analyses of their interaction with lymphocytes as components of anti-tumour immunity5, which LSCs must escape to induce cancer. Here we demonstrate that stemness and immune evasion are closely intertwined in AML. Using xenografts of human AML as well as syngeneic mouse models of leukaemia, we show that ligands of the danger detector NKG2D—a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells6–9—are generally expressed on bulk AML cells but not on LSCs. AML cells with LSC properties can be isolated by their lack of expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) in both CD34-expressing and non-CD34-expressing cases of AML. AML cells that express NKG2DLs are cleared by NK cells, whereas NKG2DL-negative leukaemic cells isolated from the same individual escape cell killing by NK cells. These NKG2DL-negative AML cells show an immature morphology, display molecular and functional stemness characteristics, and can initiate serially re-transplantable leukaemia and survive chemotherapy in patient-derived xenotransplant models. Mechanistically, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) represses expression of NKG2DLs. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PARP1 induces NKG2DLs on the LSC surface but not on healthy or pre-leukaemic cells. Treatment with PARP1 inhibitors, followed by transfer of polyclonal NK cells, suppresses leukaemogenesis in patient-derived xenotransplant models. In summary, our data link the LSC concept to immune escape and provide a strong rationale for targeting therapy-resistant LSCs by PARP1 inhibition, which renders them amenable to control by NK cells in vivo. Leukaemic stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia are defined by a lack of expression of NKG2D ligands, which mediates their ability to evade surveillance by NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2956765615,"Research reported during the past decade has shown that global warming is roughly proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates. A method of tracking changes in estimates of the remaining carbon budget over time should help to reconcile differences between these estimates and clarify their usefulness for setting emission reduction targets."
https://openalex.org/W2957093526,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has the capacity to capture molecular machines in action1,2,3. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters are highly dynamic membrane proteins that extrude a wide range of substances from the cytosol4,5,6 and thereby contribute to essential cellular processes, adaptive immunity and multidrug resistance7,8. Despite their importance, the coupling of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis and release to the conformational dynamics of these proteins remains poorly resolved, especially for heterodimeric and/or asymmetric ABC exporters that are abundant in humans. Here we present eight high-resolution cryo-EM structures that delineate the full functional cycle of an asymmetric ABC exporter in a lipid environment. Cryo-EM analysis under active turnover conditions reveals distinct inward-facing (IF) conformations—one of them with a bound peptide substrate—and previously undescribed asymmetric post-hydrolysis states with dimerized nucleotide-binding domains and a closed extracellular gate. By decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis, we could capture an outward-facing (OF) open conformation—an otherwise transient state vulnerable to substrate re-entry. The ATP-bound pre-hydrolysis and vanadate-trapped states are conformationally equivalent; both comprise co-existing OF conformations with open and closed extracellular gates. By contrast, the post-hydrolysis states from the turnover experiment exhibit asymmetric ATP and ADP occlusion after phosphate release from the canonical site and display a progressive separation of the nucleotide-binding domains and unlocking of the intracellular gate. Our findings reveal that phosphate release, not ATP hydrolysis, triggers the return of the exporter to the IF conformation. By mapping the conformational landscape during active turnover, aided by mutational and chemical modulation of kinetic rates to trap the key intermediates, we resolved fundamental steps of the substrate translocation cycle of asymmetric ABC transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2959165901,"When faced with unfamiliar reaction space, synthetic chemists typically apply the reported conditions (reagents, catalyst, solvent and additives) of a successful reaction to a desired, closely related reaction using a new substrate type. Unfortunately, this approach often fails owing to subtle differences in reaction requirements. Consequently, an important goal in synthetic chemistry is the ability to transfer chemical observations quantitatively from one reaction to another. Here we present a holistic, data-driven workflow for deriving statistical models of one set of reactions that can be used to predict out-of-sample reactions. As a validating case study, we combined published enantioselectivity datasets that employ 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL)-derived chiral phosphoric acids for a range of nucleophilic addition reactions to imines and developed statistical models. These models reveal the general interactions that impart asymmetric induction and allow the quantitative transfer of this information to new reaction components. This technique creates opportunities for translating comprehensive reaction analysis to diverse chemical space, streamlining both catalyst and reaction development. A workflow for deriving statistical models of one set of reactions that can be used to predict related reactions is presented, facilitating catalyst and enantioselective reaction development."

https://openalex.org/W2963516723,"The ability to directly monitor the states of electrons in modern field-effect devices—for example, imaging local changes in the electrical potential, Fermi level and band structure as a gate voltage is applied—could transform our understanding of the physics and function of a device. Here we show that micrometre-scale, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy1–3 (microARPES) applied to two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures4 affords this ability. In two-terminal graphene devices, we observe a shift of the Fermi level across the Dirac point, with no detectable change in the dispersion, as a gate voltage is applied. In two-dimensional semiconductor devices, we see the conduction-band edge appear as electrons accumulate, thereby firmly establishing the energy and momentum of the edge. In the case of monolayer tungsten diselenide, we observe that the bandgap is renormalized downwards by several hundreds of millielectronvolts—approaching the exciton energy—as the electrostatic doping increases. Both optical spectroscopy and microARPES can be carried out on a single device, allowing definitive studies of the relationship between gate-controlled electronic and optical properties. The technique provides a powerful way to study not only fundamental semiconductor physics, but also intriguing phenomena such as topological transitions5 and many-body spectral reconstructions under electrical control. Changes in the electronic states of two-dimensional semiconductor devices resulting from electrical gating can be monitored directly using micrometre-scale angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2959087041,"Single-molecule junctions have been extensively used to probe properties as diverse as electrical conduction1–3, light emission4, thermoelectric energy conversion5,6, quantum interference7,8, heat dissipation9,10 and electronic noise11 at atomic and molecular scales. However, a key quantity of current interest—the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions—has not yet been directly experimentally determined, owing to the challenge of detecting minute heat currents at the picowatt level. Here we show that picowatt-resolution scanning probes previously developed to study the thermal conductance of single-metal-atom junctions12, when used in conjunction with a time-averaging measurement scheme to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, also allow quantification of the much lower thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions. Our experiments on prototypical Au–alkanedithiol–Au junctions containing two to ten carbon atoms confirm that thermal conductance is to a first approximation independent of molecular length, consistent with detailed ab initio simulations. We anticipate that our approach will enable systematic exploration of thermal transport in many other one-dimensional systems, such as short molecules and polymer chains, for which computational predictions of thermal conductance13–16 have remained experimentally inaccessible. The thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions is measured using picowatt-resolution calorimetric scanning probes and is found to be nearly independent of the length of the alkanedithiol molecules studied."
https://openalex.org/W2958723445,"Lamin A/C (LMNA) is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM related to mutations in LMNA is a common inherited cardiomyopathy that is associated with systolic dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias. Here we modelled the LMNA-related DCM in vitro using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Electrophysiological studies showed that the mutant iPSC-CMs displayed aberrant calcium homeostasis that led to arrhythmias at the single-cell level. Mechanistically, we show that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling pathway is activated in mutant iPSC-CMs compared to isogenic control iPSC-CMs. Conversely, pharmacological and molecular inhibition of the PDGF signalling pathway ameliorated the arrhythmic phenotypes of mutant iPSC-CMs in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of the PDGF pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of LMNA-related DCM and point to PDGF receptor-β (PDGFRB) as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2908639602,"The nature of the pseudogap phase of cuprates remains a major puzzle. Although there are indications that this phase breaks various symmetries, there is no consensus on its fundamental nature. Although Fermi-surface, transport and thermodynamic signatures of the pseudogap phase are reminiscent of a transition into a phase with antiferromagnetic order, there is no evidence for an associated long-range magnetic order. Here we report measurements of the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ in the normal state of four different cuprates (Nd-LSCO, Eu-LSCO, LSCO, and Bi2201) and show that a large negative $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ signal is a property of the pseudogap phase, appearing with the onset of that phase at the critical doping $p^*$. Since it is not due to charge carriers -- as it persists when the material becomes an insulator, at low doping -- or magnons -- as it exists in the absence of magnetic order -- or phonons -- since skew scattering is very weak, we attribute this $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ signal to exotic neutral excitations, presumably with spin chirality. The thermal Hall conductivity in the pseudogap phase of cuprates is reminiscent of that found in insulators with spin-liquid states. In the Mott insulator LCO, it attains the highest known magnitude of any insulator."

https://openalex.org/W2959319935,"Many genome-processing reactions, including transcription, replication and repair, generate DNA rotation. Methods that directly measure DNA rotation, such as rotor bead tracking1-3, angular optical trapping4 and magnetic tweezers5, have helped to unravel the action mechanisms of a range of genome-processing enzymes that includes RNA polymerase (RNAP)6, gyrase2, a viral DNA packaging motor7 and DNA recombination enzymes8. Despite the potential of rotation measurements to transform our understanding of genome-processing reactions, measuring DNA rotation remains a difficult task. The time resolution of existing methods is insufficient for tracking the rotation induced by many enzymes under physiological conditions, and the measurement throughput is typically low. Here we introduce origami-rotor-based imaging and tracking (ORBIT), a method that uses fluorescently labelled DNA origami rotors to track DNA rotation at the single-molecule level with a time resolution of milliseconds. We used ORBIT to track the DNA rotations that result from unwinding by the RecBCD complex, a helicase that is involved in DNA repair9, as well as from transcription by RNAP. We characterized a series of events that occur during RecBCD-induced DNA unwinding-including initiation, processive translocation, pausing and backtracking-and revealed an initiation mechanism that involves reversible ATP-independent DNA unwinding and engagement of the RecB motor. During transcription by RNAP, we directly observed rotational steps that correspond to the unwinding of single base pairs. We envisage that ORBIT will enable studies of a wide range of interactions between proteins and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2956570670,"Sirtuins (Sirts) are implicated in regulating a myriad of biologic functions ranging from cell growth and metabolism to longevity. Here, we show that nuclear Sirt, Sirt6, and mitochondrial Sirt, Sirt3, regulate each other's activity and protect the heart from developing diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that expression of both Sirt6 and Sirt3 was reduced in cardiomyocytes treated with palmitate and in hearts of mice fed with a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF-HS) diet to develop obesity and diabetes. Conversely, whole-body overexpressing Sirt6 transgenic (Tg.Sirt6) mice were protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance when fed with the same HF-HS diet. The hearts of Tg.Sirt6 mice were also protected from mitochondrial fragmentation and decline of Sirt3, resulting otherwise from HF-HS diet feeding. Mechanistic studies showed that Sirt3 preserves Sirt6 levels by reducing oxidative stress, whereas Sirt6 maintains Sirt3 levels by up-regulating nuclear respiratory factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent Sirt3 gene transcription. We found that Sirt6 regulates Nrf2-mediated cardiac gene expression in 2 ways; first, Sirt6 suppresses expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a negative regulator of Nrf2, and second, Sirt6 binds to Nrf2 and antagonizes its interaction with Keap1, thereby stabilizing Nrf2 levels in cardiomyocytes. Together, these studies demonstrate that Sirt6 and Sirt3 maintain each other's activity and protect the heart from developing diabetic cardiomyopathy.-Kanwal, A., Pillai, V.

https://openalex.org/W2963149912,"Ambient air pollution is considered a major environmental health threat to pregnant women. Our previous work has shown an association between exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) and an increased risk of developing pre-eclamspia. It is now recognized that many pregnancy complications are due to underlying placental dysfunction, and this tissue plays a pivotal role in pre-eclamspia. Recent studies have shown that PM can enter the circulation and reach the human placenta but the effects of PM on human placental function are still largely unknown. In this work we investigated the effects of airborne PM on trophoblast cells. Human, first trimester trophoblast cells (HTR-8/SV) were exposed to urban pollution particles (Malmö PM2.5; Prague PM10) for up to seven days in vitro and were analysed for uptake, levels of hCGβ and IL-6 secretion and proteomic analysis. HTR-8/SVneo cells rapidly endocytose PM within 30 min of exposure and particles accumulate in the cell in perinuclear vesicles. High doses of Prague and Malmö PM (500–5000 ng/ml) significantly decreased hCGβ secretion and increased IL-6 secretion after 48 h exposure. Exposure to PM (50 ng/ml) for 48h or seven days led to reduced cellular growth and altered protein expression. The differentially expressed proteins are involved in networks that regulate cellular processes such as inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, cellular survival and molecular transport pathways. Our studies suggest that trophoblast cells exposed to low levels of urban PM respond with reduced growth, oxidative stress, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress after taking up the particles by endocytosis. Many of the dysfunctional cellular processes ascribed to the differentially expressed proteins in this study, are similar to those described in PE, suggesting that low levels of urban PM may disrupt cellular processes in trophoblast cells. Many of the differentially expressed proteins identified in this study are involved in inflammation and may be potential biomarkers for PE."

The only currently known cellular molecules covalently modified by LC3/GABARAP are membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine in the autophagosome membrane. Autophagy-related 4 cysteine peptidase (ATG4) proteases process inactive pro-LC3/GABARAP before lipidation, and the same proteases can also deconjugate LC3/GABARAP from lipids. To determine whether LC3/GABARAP has other molecular targets, here we generated a pre-processed LC3B mutant (Q116P) that is resistant to ATG4-mediated deconjugation. Upon expression in human cells and when assessed by immunoblotting under reducing and denaturing conditions, deconjugation-resistant LC3B accumulated in multiple forms and at much higher molecular weights than free LC3B. We observed a similar accumulation when pre-processed versions of all mammalian LC3/GABARAP isoforms were expressed in ATG4-deficient cell lines, suggesting that LC3/GABARAP can attach also to other larger molecules. We identified ATG3, the E2-like enzyme involved in LC3/GABARAP lipidation, as one target of conjugation with multiple copies of LC3/GABARAP. We show that LC3B–ATG3 conjugates are distinct from the LC3B–ATG3 thioester intermediate formed before lipidation, and we biochemically demonstrate that ATG4B can cleave LC3B–ATG3 conjugates.

Ubiquitin becomes covalently attached via its C terminus to the lysine or amino group of target proteins, forming a stable amide linkage and acting as a post-translational modification.

Considering LC3/GABARAP conjugation closely resembles ubiquitination and ATG4 is DUB-like, we decided to investigate whether other cellular targets might exist that can be modified with LC3/GABARAPs (“LC3ylation”) and deconjugated by ATG4 (“deLC3ylation”). As a tool to identify potential novel LC3/GABARAP conjugation targets, we decided to develop a deconjugation-resistant form of LC3B that could be expressed in mammalian cells. We sought to identify a mutation in LC3B that renders it resistant to processing by ATG4 proteases, but does not abolish conjugation when introduced into a pre-primed form of LC3B (LC3B G120). In the literature, we identified the F80A/L82A double mutant (41Fass E. Amar N. Elazar Z. Identification of essential residues for the C-terminal cleavage of the mammalian LC3: a lesson from yeast Atg8.Autophagy. 2007; 3 (17102583): 48-5010.4161/auto.3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and F119A (42Satoo K.

Because LC3B is structurally ubiquitin-like and studies have shown that ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-like modifiers can be rendered resistant to deconjugation by mutating a residue near their protease cleavage site to proline (43Békés M.

We introduced each of these mutations into a synthetic priming sensor construct consisting of full-length LC3B tagged at the C terminus with GFP and the N terminus with 3xFLAG. Expression of these constructs allowed us to compare the effect of each mutation on processing by endogenous ATG4 proteases in human HeLa cells. As seen in Fig. 1A, all tested mutations impeded ATG4-mediated processing to varying degrees compared with WT LC3B, based on an increase in the level of unprocessed 3xFLAG–LC3B–GFP and a reduction in the level of processed 3xFLAG–LC3B. The Q116P mutation in particular led to the most robust reduction in processing, comparable with the negative control G120A mutant that cannot be primed or lipidated (14Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T.

To test whether the LC3B mutations were compatible with PE conjugation, we introduced them into pre-primed GFP–LC3B G120 that localizes to distinct cytoplasmic puncta corresponding to autophagosomes upon lipidation (15Kabeya Y.

As seen in Fig. 1B, the LC3B mutants F80A/L82A and F119A showed a defect in autophagosome localization similar to G120A, suggesting these mutations impaired lipid conjugation. In contrast, Q116P and E117P could localize to puncta in response to treatment, similar to LC3B WT and G120, suggesting these mutations are compatible with conjugation. Overall, the Q116P mutation best fit the criteria of impairing ATG4-mediated processing while permitting conjugation, making it suitable for generating a deconjugation-resistant LC3B mutant. Using the published LC3B–ATG4B co-crystal structure (42Satoo K. Noda N.N. Kumeta H. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F.

To determine the effect of impaired LC3B deconjugation in cells, we expressed 3x-FLAG–tagged deconjugation-resistant LC3B Q116P G120 in WT HeLa cells, with specific detection by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. As seen in Fig. 1D, LC3B Q116P G120 could be converted to the -II form similar to LC3B WT and G120. In contrast, LC3B G120A was expressed as a single band corresponding to the pro-form (46Wang W.

Methods Retrospective analysis of 17 eyes of 17 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients with severe non-proliferative or proliferative DR and no current or past macular edema. Seventeen age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included as controls. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCTA), VD was measured in the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular complex (DVC) that includes the intermediate (ICP) and deep capillary plexuses (DCP), and compared to the retinal thickness (RT) of the inner (from the inner limiting membrane to the inner plexiform layer) and intermediate (inner nuclear and outer plexiform layer) retinal layers. The correlation between the inner and intermediate RT and the VD of the corresponding vascular networks (SVP and DVC, respectively) was assessed. All OCT and OCTA examinations were performed using the RTVue XR Avanti (Optovue, Fremont, CA). Results The inner RT and VD in all plexuses were significantly reduced in T1D patients compared to healthy subjects. The capillary drop-out patterns were polygonal and well-defined in the SVP while the ICP and DCP showed a more diffuse capillary rarefaction and a VD that varied in the same proportion. The inner RT significantly correlated with VD in the SVP (r = 0.71 in healthy subjects and r = 0.62 in T1D patients, p <0.01). The intermediate RT did not significantly correlate with VD in the DVC. Conclusions In T1D subjects, OCTA allowed observing different capillary drop-out patterns in the SVP and in the ICP-DCP, with different structural changes in the corresponding retinal layers, suggesting that they should be considered as distinct anatomical and functional entities."
https://openalex.org/W2963429158,"Herbivorous arthropods cause immense damage in crop production annually. Consumption of these pests by insectivorous animals is of significant importance to counteract their adverse effects. Insectivorous bats are considered amongst the most voracious predators of arthropods, some of which are known crop pests. In vineyard-dominated Mediterranean agroecosystems, several crops are damaged by the attack of insect pests. In this study we aimed 1) to explore the diet and pest consumption of the lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros and 2) analyse whether the composition of pest species in its diet changes throughout the season. We employed a dual-primer DNA metabarcoding analysis of DNA extracted from faeces collected in three bat colonies of a wine region in Southwestern Europe during the whole active period of most pest species. Overall, 395 arthropod prey species belonging to 11 orders were detected; lepidopterans and dipterans were the most diverse orders in terms of species. Altogether, 55 pest species were identified, 25 of which are known to cause significant agricultural damage and 8 are regarded as pests affecting grapevines. The composition of pest species in faeces changed significantly with the season, thus suggesting several periods should be sampled to assess the pest consumption by bats. As a whole, the results imply that R. hipposideros acts as a suppressor of a wide array of agricultural pests in Mediterranean agroecosystems. Therefore, management measures favouring the growth of R. hipposideros populations should be considered."

https://openalex.org/W2963053642,"Despite substantial exposure to infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases, some household contacts (HHC) never acquire latent TB infection (LTBI). Characterizing these “resisters” can inform who to study immunologically for the development of TB vaccines. We enrolled HHCs of culture-confirmed adult pulmonary TB in India who underwent LTBI testing using tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold Test-in-tube (QFT-GIT) at baseline and, if negative by both (<5mm TST and <0.35IU/mL QFT-GIT), underwent follow-up testing at 4–6 and/or 12 months. We defined persons with persistently negative LTBI tests at both baseline and followup as pLTBI- and resisters as those who had a high exposure to TB using a published score and remained pLTBI-. We calculated the proportion of resisters overall and resisters with complete absence of response to LTBI tests (0mm TST and/or QFT-GIT <0.01 IU/ml). Using random effects Poisson regression, we assessed factors associated with pLTBI-. Of 799 HHCs in 355 households, 67 (8%) were pLTBI- at 12 months; 52 (6.5%) pLTBI- in 39 households were resisters. Complete absence of response to LTBI tests was found in 27 (53%) resisters. No epidemiological characteristics were associated with the pLTBI- phenotype. LTBI free resisters among HHC exist but are uncommon and are without distinguishing epidemiologic characteristics. Assessing the genetic and immunologic features of such resister individuals is likely to elucidate mechanisms of protective immunity to TB."
https://openalex.org/W2956608680,"We investigate the use of Twitter data to deliver signals for syndromic surveillance in order to assess its ability to augment existing syndromic surveillance efforts and give a better understanding of symptomatic people who do not seek healthcare advice directly. We focus on a specific syndrome—asthma/difficulty breathing. We outline data collection using the Twitter streaming API as well as analysis and pre-processing of the collected data. Even with keyword-based data collection, many of the tweets collected are not be relevant because they represent chatter, or talk of awareness instead of an individual suffering a particular condition. In light of this, we set out to identify relevant tweets to collect a strong and reliable signal. For this, we investigate text classification techniques, and in particular we focus on semi-supervised classification techniques since they enable us to use more of the Twitter data collected while only doing very minimal labelling. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach to symptomatic tweet classification and relevance filtering. We also propose alternative techniques to popular deep learning approaches. Additionally, we highlight the use of emojis and other special features capturing the tweet’s tone to improve the classification performance. Our results show that negative emojis and those that denote laughter provide the best classification performance in conjunction with a simple word-level n-gram approach. We obtain good performance in classifying symptomatic tweets with both supervised and semi-supervised algorithms and found that the proposed semi-supervised algorithms preserve more of the relevant tweets and may be advantageous in the context of a weak signal. Finally, we found some correlation (r = 0.414, p = 0.0004) between the Twitter signal generated with the semi-supervised system and data from consultations for related health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2957027967,"Objectives To study the differences in the levels of nitrogen metabolites, such as ammonia and nitric oxide and the correlations existing among them in both red blood cells (RBCs) and serum, as well as the possible differences by gender in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Design and methods This cross-sectional study included 80 patients diagnosed with type 2 DM (40 female and 40 male patients) and their corresponding controls paired by gender (40 female and 40 male). We separated serum and RBC and determined metabolites mainly through colorimetric and spectrophotometric assays. We evaluated changes in the levels of the main catabolic by-products of blood nitrogen metabolism, nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Results Healthy female and male controls showed a differential distribution of blood metabolites involved in NO metabolism and arginine metabolism for the ornithine and urea formation. Patients with DM had increased ammonia, citrulline, urea, uric acid, and ornithine, mainly in the RBCs, whereas the level of arginine was significantly lower in men with type 2 DM. These findings were associated with hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1C), and levels of RBC’s MDA. Furthermore, most of the DM-induced alterations in nitrogen-related metabolites appear to be associated with a difference in the RBC capacity for the release of these metabolites, thereby causing an abrogation of the gender-related differential management of nitrogen metabolites in healthy subjects. Conclusions We found evidence of a putative role of RBC as an extra-hepatic mechanism for controlling serum levels of nitrogen-related metabolites, which differs according to gender in healthy subjects. Type 2 DM promotes higher ammonia, citrulline, and MDA blood levels, which culminate in a loss of the differential management of nitrogen-related metabolites seen in healthy women and men."
https://openalex.org/W2962400911,"The cytokine IL-17A plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The frequencies of MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase 3 [also named germinal center kinase–like kinase (GLK)]-overexpressing T cells are correlated with disease severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). T-cell–specific GLK-transgenic mice develop spontaneous autoimmune responses through IL-17A. GLK signaling selectively stimulates IL-17A production in murine T cells through inducing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)–retinoic acid receptor–related orphan nuclear receptor-³t (ROR-³t) complex formation. Here, we investigated whether GLK-induced AhR–ROR-³t complex in T cells is a therapeutic target for human SLE. The population of GLK+IL-17A+ T cells was enhanced in the peripheral blood from patients with SLE compared with that of healthy controls using flow cytometry. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that increased GLK+IL-17A+ T-cell population in peripheral blood reflected an active stage of SLE. In addition, peripheral blood T cells from patients with SLE displayed induction of ROR-³t phosphorylation and the AhR-ROR-³t (and AhR–phosphorylated ROR-³t) complex. Moreover, we identified a small-molecule inhibitor, verteporfin, that inhibited GLK kinase activity and AhR–ROR-³t interaction. The small-molecule inhibitor verteporfin suppressed the disease severity in autoimmune mouse models and IL-17A production in T cells from patients with SLE. Collectively, the GLK-induced AhR-ROR-³t (and AhR–phosphorylated ROR-³t) complex is a therapeutic target for the GLKhighIL-17Ahigh subpopulation of human patients with SLE.—Chuang, H.-C, Chen, Y.-M., Chen, M.-H., Hung, W.-T., Yang, H.-Y., Tseng, Y.-H., Tan, T.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2956483846,"RNA-binding motif protein 5 (RBM5) acts as a tumor suppressor in various human cancers and presents with several important characteristics, such as the potentiation of apoptosis, inhibition of the cell cycle, and alternative splicing of Fas and caspase-2 precursor mRNA. However, its role in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) remains unknown. In this study, we found that RBM5 expression was significantly down-regulated in BUC tissues when compared with the adjacent nontumor tissues. The down-regulation of RBM5 activates ²-catenin, which binds to the T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor element of the miR-432-5p promoter and elevates the expression of miR-432-5p in bladder cancer cells. The up-regulated miR-432-5p directly targets 3′-UTR and depresses RBM5 expression. Thus, RBM5–miR-432-5p–²-catenin forms a feedback loop in regulating bladder cancer cell apoptosis. Our findings provide evidence that the regulatory feedback loop among RBM5, miR-432-5p, and Wnt–²-catenin is responsible for the progress of bladder cancer cells.—Zhang, Y.-P., Liu, K.-L., Wang, Y.-X., Yang, Z., Han, Z.-W., Lu, B.-S., Qi, J.-C, Yin, Y.-W., Teng, Z.-H., Chang, X.-L., Li, J.-D., Xin, H., Li, W.

https://openalex.org/W2962693343,"Canine oral tumors are relatively common neoplasms in dogs. For disease monitoring and early diagnosis, salivary biomarkers are appropriate because saliva collection is non-invasive and requires no professional skills. In the era of omics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) are suitable to identify potential disease-associated peptides and proteins. The present study aimed to use MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS to search for particular peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) and conceivable biomarkers in saliva of dogs with early- and late-stage oral melanoma (EOM and LOM, respectively), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), benign oral tumors (BN), and periodontitis and healthy controls (CP). Pooled saliva samples in each group were used to be representative of population change. Unique PMFs were obtained and specific peptide fragments were sequenced by LC-MS/MS and BLAST-searched with mammalian protein databases. Seven peptide fragments appeared in the tumor groups (EOM, LOM, OSCC and BN) at 1096, 1208, 1322, 1794, 1864, 2354 and 2483 Da, two peptide fragments appeared in the LOM and OSCC groups at 2450 and 3492 Da, and in the CP controls at 2544 and 3026 Da. Also, protein–chemotherapy drug interaction networks were exhibited. Using western blot analysis, the expression of sentrin-specific protease 7 (SENP7), a peptide fragment at 1096 Da, in OSCC was significantly increased, as was the expression of TLR4, a peptide fragment at 3492 Da, in LOM and OSCC, compared with the CP group. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a TLR4 partner, was notably increased in OSCC compared with CP, BN and EOM. The expression was also enhanced in LOM compared with EOM. Expressed protein sequences from western blots were verified by LC-MS/MS. Western blots were then performed with individual samples in each group. The results showed the elevated expression of TLR4 in LOM and OSCC, compared with that in CP and BN, the increased expression of NF-κB in LOM and OSCC, compared with CP and in LOM compared with BN, and the enhanced expression of SENP7 in LOM and OSCC, compared with that in CP and BN. In conclusion, discrete clusters of EOM, LOM, OSCC, BN and CP groups and potential protein candidates associated with the diseases were demonstrated by salivary proteomics. Western blot analysis verified SENP7, TLR4 and NF-κB as potential salivary biomarkers of canine oral tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2963824812,"Despite an overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change poses severe risks to human and natural systems, many young Canadian adults do not view it as a major issue. We analyzed secondary science curricula in each province for their coverage of climate change according to six core topics: physical climate mechanisms (“It’s climate”), observed increase in temperature (“It’s warming”), anthropogenic causes of warming (“It’s us”), scientific consensus (“Experts agree”), negative consequences associated with warming (“It’s bad”), and the possibility for avoiding the worst effects (“We can fix it”). We found that learning objectives tend to focus on knowledge of the first three elements, with little or no emphasis on scientific consensus, climate change impacts, or ways to address the issue. The provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario provide the most comprehensive standards for climate change education, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick provide the least. We conducted interviews with individuals responsible for curriculum design in six different provinces to understand how curriculum documents are developed and whether political controversies influence the writing process. Interviewees described a process relying on input from professionals, institutions, and members of the public where curriculum developers made decisions independent of political concerns. In some cases, efforts to provide balance may have led to a focus on social controversy, contrary to overwhelming scientific consensus. Curriculum documents are the basis for teacher instruction and textbook content; aligning these documents with the best possible evidence can improve student learning and engage the next generation of Canadians on the critical issue of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2962815554,"Students’ writing constitutes a topic of major concern due to its importance in school and in daily life. To mitigate students’ writing problems, school-based interventions have been implemented in the past, but there is still a need to examine the effectiveness of different types of writing interventions that use robust design methodologies. Hence, the present study followed a longitudinal cluster-randomized controlled design using a multilevel modeling analysis with 370 fourth-grade students (nested in 20 classes). The classes were randomly assigned to four conditions: one comparison group and three writing types of writing interventions (i.e., week-journals, Self-Regulation Strategy Development (SRSD) instruction and SRSD plus Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) program using a story-tool), with five classes participating in each condition. Data supports our hypothesis by showing differences between the treatment groups in students’ writing quality over time. Globally, the improvement of students’ writing quality throughout time is related to the level of specialization of the writing interventions implemented. This is an important finding with strong implications for educational practice. Week-journals and writing activities can be easily implemented in classrooms and provides an opportunity to promote students’ writing quality. Still, students who participated in the instructional programs (i.e., SRSD and SRSD plus story-tool) exhibited higher writing quality than the students who wrote week-journals. Current data did not find statistical significant differences between results from the two instructional writing tools."

According to these distributions, we generated a series of simulation data to make a more comprehensive assessment for a novel statistical method, maximal information coefficient (MIC). The results show that MIC is not only in the top tier in the overall performance of identifying differentially expressed genes, but also exhibits a better adaptability and an excellent noise immunity in comparison with the existing methods."

The benefits of the approach to extract spectral information directly from measurements in the projection domain are very advantageous for material science studies with x-rays as polychromatic artifacts like beam-hardening are handled properly. Since related methods require accurate knowledge of all energy-dependent system parameters, we utilize an adapted semi-empirical model, which relies on a simple calibration procedure. The method enables a projection-based decomposition of photon-counting raw-data into basis material projections. The objective of this paper is to investigate the method’s performance applied to x-ray micro-CT with special focus on applications in material science and non-destructive testing. Projection-based dual-energy micro-CT is shown to be of good quantitative accuracy regarding material properties such as electron densities and effective atomic numbers. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach strongly reduces beam-hardening artifacts and improves image contrast at constant measurement time."

These clusters are best known for their roles in redox proteins such as ferredoxins, but some iron–sulfur clusters have nonredox roles in the active sites of enzymes. Such clusters are often prone to oxidative degradation, making the enzymes difficult to characterize. Here we report a structural and functional characterization of dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Conducting this analysis under fully anaerobic conditions, we solved the DHAD crystal structure, at 1.88 Å resolution, revealing a 2Fe–2S cluster in which one iron ligand is a potentially exchangeable water molecule or hydroxide. UV and EPR spectroscopy both suggested that the substrate binds directly to the cluster or very close to it. Kinetic analysis implicated two ionizable groups in the catalytic mechanism, which we postulate to be Ser-491 and the iron-bound water/hydroxide. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Ser-491 is essential for activity, and substrate docking indicated that this residue is perfectly placed for proton abstraction. We found that a bound Mg2+ ion 6.5 Å from the 2Fe–2S cluster plays a key role in substrate binding. We also identified a putative entry channel that enables access to the cluster and show that Mtb-DHAD is inhibited by a recently discovered herbicide, aspterric acid, that, given the essentiality of DHAD for Mtb survival, is a potential lead compound for the design of novel anti-TB drugs.

Branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in eubacteria, fungi, and plants is a highly conserved sequence of reactions catalyzed by only eight enzymes, leading to the biosynthesis of the three branched-chain amino acids: l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-leucine. Six of the eight enzymes in the pathway have been extensively characterized, both mechanistically and structurally (reviewed in Ref. 1Amorim Franco T.M. Blanchard J.S.

A general base abstracts the C2 proton and eliminates the cluster-bound hydroxyl group to generate the enol. The enol tautomerizes with stereospecific C3 protonation to generate the keto acid product, suggesting that the tautomerization occurs in the active site before release. Direct structural information on DHAD enzymes has been elusive, largely because of the experimental challenges associated with the instability of the iron–sulfur cluster. Recently, however, crystal structures have been determined for two sugar dehydratases that are members of the wider DHAD family: an l-arabinonate dehydratase from Rhizobium leguminosarum (Rl-ArDHT) at 2.4 Å resolution (11Rahman M.M.

The structure of a plant DHAD from Arabidopsis thaliana (At-DHAD) has also been reported in the context of a gene-directed search for novel herbicides (13Yan Y. Liu Q. Zang X. Yuan S. Bat-Erdene U.

Rev. 1996; 96 (11848830): 2335-237410.1021/cr950040zCrossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), in contrast to 2Fe–2S plant DHADs and the sugar dehydratases. We also sought to characterize the Mtb enzyme for its importance as an anti-TB drug target. This latter goal is of particular relevance given the recent discovery of a natural product, aspterric acid, that inhibits At-DHAD (13Yan Y. Liu Q. Zang X. Yuan S. Bat-Erdene U. Nguyen C. Gan J. Zhou J. Jacobsen S.E. Tang Y. Resistance-gene-directed discovery of a natural-product herbicide with a new mode of action.Nature. 2018; 559 (29995859): 415-41810.1038/s41586-018-0319-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and could possibly provide a novel lead compound against TB. Inhibition of DHAD activity would impair the synthesis of all three essential branched-chain amino acids as well as CoA (Fig. 1). Mtb-DHAD is encoded by the ORF Rv0189c, which has no mammalian counterpart and has been shown to be essential for growth by high-density transposon mutagenesis (2Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Genes required for mycobacterial growth defined by high density mutagenesis.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48 (12657046): 77-8410.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03425.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). Evidence of its essentiality in Mtb also comes from the observation that, like its E. coli counterpart, Mtb-DHAD is sensitive to oxygen and NO, and the growth of M. tuberculosis treated with NO can be restored only upon supplementation with the three branched-chain amino acids (5Singh V. Chandra D. Srivastava B.S. Srivastava R. Downregulation of Rv0189c, encoding a dihydroxyacid dehydratase, affects growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in mice.Microbiology. 2011; 157 (20864475): 38-4610.1099/mic.0.042358-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of the Rv0189c ORF with antisense RNA has also been shown to markedly impair Mtb growth in the lungs of infected mice (5Singh V. Chandra D. Srivastava B.S. Srivastava R. Downregulation of Rv0189c, encoding a dihydroxyacid dehydratase, affects growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in mice.Microbiology. 2011; 157 (20864475): 38-4610.1099/mic.0.042358-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although a full gene knockout has yet to be reported, these findings suggest Mtb-DHAD to be an outstanding candidate as an antimycobacterial drug target. Here we have overcome the instability of Mtb-DHAD by carrying out all key steps in an anaerobic environment. We have established its kinetic properties, determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.88 Å resolution, shown it contains a 2Fe–2S cluster, and defined the nature and environment of this cluster, pointing to its likely direct role in the catalytic mechanism. We also show that aspterric acid is indeed a potent inhibitor of the Mtb-DHAD enzyme and thus a potential new lead compound for the development of anti-TB drugs. Mtb-DHAD has previously been expressed in E. coli as a thioredoxin fusion protein and shown to be active (5Singh V. Chandra D. Srivastava B.S. Srivastava R. Downregulation of Rv0189c, encoding a dihydroxyacid dehydratase, affects growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in mice.Microbiology. 2011; 157 (20864475): 38-4610.1099/mic.0.042358-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have found, however, that anaerobic conditions are required for full characterization. For the present study we could express the N-terminally His6-tagged enzyme in soluble form in both E. coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed evidence of heterogeneity, however. IMAC gave two peaks: one light brown in color (indicating the holo-protein with an iron–sulfur cluster) and the other colorless. SEC of the holo-protein fraction again gave two peaks: one of them in the void volume, colorless and evidently representing aggregated protein, and the other still light brown. Crystallization trials on the latter fraction gave crystals in 3–5 days, but they were colorless and, despite many attempts at improvement, yielded poor diffraction. We concluded that like the E. coli enzyme, Mtb-DHAD is unstable under aerobic conditions, with the iron–sulfur cluster being either lost or degraded. All subsequent work on Mtb-DHAD, including expression, purification, crystallization, UV-visible spectroscopy, and all functional studies, was therefore conducted in an anaerobic chamber. To ensure complete incorporation of the iron–sulfur cluster and correct folding of the enzyme, we used an E. coli expression system that included the pPH151 plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. Petra Hänzelmann, University of Wurzburg). This plasmid enables overexpression of the entire E. coli suf operon, which orchestrates the efficient synthesis and incorporation of iron–sulfur clusters and has been shown to substantially increase levels of soluble, correctly folded iron–sulfur–containing proteins (14Hänzelmann P. Hernández H.L. Menzel C. García-Serres R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Mendel R.R. Schindelin H. Characterization of MOCS1A, an oxygen-sensitive iron–sulfur protein involved in human molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.J. Biol.

After the IMAC step and before SEC, the protein fractions were supplemented with sodium sulfide and ferric chloride (15Booth M.P.S. Challand M.R. Emery D.C. Roach P.L. Spencer J. High-level expression and reconstitution of active Cfr, a radical-SAM rRNA methyltransferase that confers resistance to ribosome-acting antibiotics.Prot. Exp. Purif. 2010; 74: 204-21010.1016/j.pep.2010.07.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to concentrations of 0.4 and 0.6 mm, respectively, to ensure a homogeneous protein sample fully occupied with its iron–sulfur cluster. The catalytic activity of Mtb-IlvD was monitored using an assay in which the IlvD-catalyzed reaction was coupled with that of the next enzyme in the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway (IlvE) and with glutamate dehydrogenase. The assay results in absorbance changes at 340 nm caused by the oxidation of NADH. A 10-fold excess of IlvE and glutamate dehydrogenase were used in each assay. All activity measurements and spectral recordings were carried out at 30 °C. A Michaelis–Menten plot showing the activity of Mtb-DHAD toward its physiological substrate, 2,3-dihydroxy isovalerate, at pH 7.8, is shown in Fig. 2A. Calculated Km and kcat values for (R)2,3-dihydroxy isovalerate were 2025 ± 140 μm and 112 ± 4 min−1, respectively. The enzyme was shown to be specific for the R isomer, with no catalytic activity against the S isomer. The presence of both Mg2+ and carbonate were found to be essential, because no activity could be detected in the absence of either component. We also showed that the coupling enzymes used in the assay, glutamate dehydrogenase and branched-chain aminotransferase (IlvE), do not require Mg2+ or carbonate. To show this, we used 2-ketoisovalerate (the reaction product of DHAD) in the reaction, in the absence of Mg2+ and carbonate, to confirm that neither of these species is required for the activity of the coupling enzymes. We also showed that a serine residue, Ser-491, which projects into the active site, is essential for activity (see “Discussion”). Mutation of this serine to alanine abolishes activity. The pH dependence of the catalytic activity was also determined over the pH range 6.6 to 8.8 to identify potential active site groups involved in the reaction. The pH-activity profile of Mtb-DHAD was bell-shaped (Fig. 2B), with a pH optimum of ∼7.8, suggesting the involvement of two groups exhibiting pKa values of 7.35 ± 0.05 and 8.30 ± 0.04 whose ionization is critical for catalytic activity. Inhibition studies with aspterric acid (Fig. 2C) were conducted over a range of substrate concentrations (0.5 to 5 mm) using the inhibitor at fixed concentrations up to 20 μm. The data were fitted to a competitive inhibition model, which showed that aspterric acid is a competitive inhibitor of Mtb-DHAD with a Ki of 10.1 ± 0.4 μm. Mtb-DHAD was crystallized with an N-terminal His6 tag present. All crystallization operations were conducted in the same anaerobic chamber in which the enzyme was produced. Brown hexagonal crystals appeared after 5–10 days, growing out of precipitate, and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. The crystals diffracted to ∼1.8 Å resolution on Beamline 21-ID-D (LS-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory), and the structure was readily determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, using the anomalous scattering from the iron atoms of the intrinsic iron–sulfur cluster. The structure was refined at 1.88 Å resolution to a final R-factor of 0.166 and an Rfree value of 0.206.

Open table in a new tab The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure contains one Mtb-DHAD homotetramer, with a 2Fe–2S cluster in each subunit. Each subunit also has a single active site Mg2+ ion, an associated lysine residue with a carbamylated ∈-amino group, Lys-139, and three cis-peptides, at Pro-328, Pro-461, and Pro-504. The fit of the model to the electron density is generally excellent, although the first 13 residues in each chain are missing (14 in subunit B), and there are several flexible loops, at residues 416–419 and 488–499, that cannot be completely modeled in one or more subunits. The organization of the Mtb-DHAD structure is shown in Fig. 3. Each polypeptide chain is folded into two domains that can be approximately defined as residues 1–372 and 393–575, connected by a 20-residue linker peptide, residues 373–392, that meanders over the surface (Fig. 3A). The fold is a complex one that has so far been found only for other dehydratase structures. A search for structural homologs using PDBeFold (16Krissinel E. Henrick K.

As in other members of this family, the N-terminal domain is based on a four-stranded parallel β-sheet with helices packed on either face (an αβα sandwich), and a further layer of helices packed against this. The C-terminal domain adopts a mixed eight-stranded β-barrel structure with a few associated α-helices around its periphery. A feature of this structure that seems likely to be functionally important is the presence of a small subdomain, formed by the N-terminal 50 residues, that protrudes from the main body of the N-terminal domain and packs against a neighboring subunit, close to its active site (Fig. 3B). Helix α1 from this subdomain of subunit C approaches to within 8 Å of the 2Fe–2S cluster of subunit A. The homotetrameric quaternary structure of Mtb-DHAD in the crystal is closely similar to that found for the sugar dehydratases Rl-ArDHT and Cc-XyDHT. It is best regarded as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 3C) in which the two dimers encompass chains AC and BD. The total surface area buried in the AC dimer interface is 6890 Å2 (3445 Å2 per monomer), and in the BD dimer interface it is 6788 Å2 (3394 Å2 per monomer), whereas the tetramer interface is less extensive. The total buried surface between the two dimers of the tetramer is 5060 Å2 (2530 Å2 per dimer). In solution, however, analysis by SEC with multiangle light scattering indicates that Mtb-DHAD is primarily dimeric under the concentrations tested (Fig. 3D), in accord with the dimeric structure found for At-DHAD (13Yan Y. Liu Q. Zang X. Yuan S. Bat-Erdene U. Nguyen C. Gan J. Zhou J. Jacobsen S.E. Tang Y. Resistance-gene-directed discovery of a natural-product herbicide with a new mode of action.Nature. 2018; 559 (29995859): 415-41810.1038/s41586-018-0319-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and other DHAD enzymes, both plant and bacterial. Each of the four subunits of Mtb-DHAD contains a 2Fe–2S cluster, which is essential for activity and marks the location of the active site (Fig. 4). The cluster is estimated to be present at full occupancy as the average B-factor for the cluster atoms is 26.5 Å2, closely comparable with the surrounding protein structure. The cluster occupies an internal cavity, which is bounded in part by hydrophobic residues that include Met-100, Ile-180, Phe-184, Tyr-218, and Leu-467, but also contains some 7 or 8 water molecules and the single Mg2+ ion. One iron atom (Fe1) is coordinated tetrahedrally by the thiolate sulfurs of Cys-64, Cys-137, and the two S2− ions of the cluster. In contrast, the other iron atom (Fe2) has only one cysteine ligand (Cys-214) together with the two bridging S2− ions, leaving one tetrahedral coordination position vacant. A protrusion in the electron density at this position (Fig. 3A) clearly indicates, in each of the four subunits, the coordination of a water molecule, or more likely hydroxide, to Fe2 at a distance of 2.1 Å, completing a regular tetrahedral geometry. The iron–sulfur(Cys) bonds are all 2.3 Å in length, the Fe–S2− bonds are 2.2 Å, and the bond angles range from 104 to 117°, with a mean of 109.4° (values taken from subunit A). The iron-iron distance is 2.7 Å. The magnesium ion is ∼6.5 Å from the 2Fe–2S cluster, coordinated octahedrally by carboxylate oxygens of Asp-96, Asp-138, and Glu-465, two water molecules and one oxygen of the carbamylated ∈-amino group of Lys-139 (Fig. 4). Carbamylated lysine residues have been found in the divalent metal ion sites of a number of other enzymes, notably the amidohydrolase superfamily (17Seibert C.M. Raushel F.M. Structural and catalytic diversity within the amidohydrolase superfamily.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (15850372): 6383-639110.1021/bi047326vCrossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2964120199,"Reducing uncertainties in Earth System Model predictions requires carefully evaluating core model processes. Here we examined how canopy radiative transfer model (RTM) parameter uncertainties, in combination with canopy structure, affect terrestrial carbon and energy projections in a demographic land-surface model, the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2). Our analyses focused on temperate deciduous forests and tested canopies of varying structural complexity. The results showed a strong sensitivity of tree productivity, albedo, and energy balance projections to RTM parameters. Impacts of radiative parameter uncertainty on stand-level canopy net primary productivity ranged from ~2 to > 20% and was most sensitive to canopy clumping and leaf reflectance/transmittance in the visible spectrum (~400–750 nm). ED2 canopy albedo varied by ~1 to ~10% and was most sensitive to near-infrared reflectance (~800–1200 nm). Bowen ratio, in turn, was most sensitive to wood optical properties parameterization; this was much larger than expected based on literature, suggesting model instabilities. In vertically and spatially complex canopies the model response to RTM parameterization may show an apparent reduced sensitivity when compared to simpler canopies, masking much larger changes occurring within the canopy. Our findings highlight both the importance of constraining canopy RTM parameters in models and valuating how the canopy structure responds to those parameter values. Finally, we advocate for more model evaluation, similar to this study, to highlight possible issues with model behavior or process representations, particularly models with demographic representations, and identify potential ways to inform and constrain model predictions."

The study samples were fruits of black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) cv. Galicjanka. In the study, two kinds of presses—piston press and twin gear juice extractor—were used, and two raw material pretreatment methods—freezing and thawing and enzymatic liquefaction—were applied. The study showed that pressing efficiency depends on the design of press and the nature of pretreatment. The highest pressing efficiency was obtained using the twin gear juice extractor. Enzymatic liquefaction of shredded fruits significantly increased the efficiency of pressing by the piston press. The type of press and the pretreatment method used had an effect on the quality traits of the extracted juices. The highest content of soluble solids was obtained for fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and pressed using the twin gear press. The highest total phenolic content was obtained in juice extracted using the piston press from shredded fruits subjected to enzymatic treatment at 45°C. A higher total phenolic content was also a characteristic of juice obtained from fruits not subjected to any pretreatment and extracted using the twin gear press. The capacity of the black chokeberry juices for free radical quenching oscillated around the level of approximately 90%.

Interventions that target food insecurity have the potential to increase treatment adherence, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease mortality. The goals of this study were to compare the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of implementing two different forms of nutrition support for HIV-TB co-infected adults in the Casamance region of Senegal.We conducted a randomized pilot implementation study among HIV-TB co-infected adults initiating treatment for TB (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03711721). Subjects received nutrition support in the form of a local food basket or Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), distributed on a monthly basis for six months.A total of 178 monthly study encounters were completed by 26 HIV-TB co-infected adults; 14 received food baskets and 12 received RUTF. For both the food basket and RUTF, 100% of subjects obtained the supplement at every study encounter, transferred the supplement from the clinic to their household, and consumed the supplement. The food basket had greater acceptability and was more likely to be shared with members of the household. Adherence to TB treatment and ART exceeded 95%, and all outcomes, including CD4 cell count, hemoglobin, nutritional status, and food security, improved over the study period. All subjects completed TB treatment and were smear negative at treatment completion. The total cost of the local food basket was approximately $0.68 per day versus $0.99 for the RUTF.The implementation of nutrition support for HIV-TB co-infected adults in Senegal is feasible and may provide an effective strategy to improve adherence, treatment completion, and clinical outcomes for less than 1 USD per day. Further studies to determine the impact of nutrition support among a larger population of HIV-TB co-infected individuals are indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2961435418,"Implicated in numerous human diseases, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are dynamic ensembles of interconverting conformers that often contain many proline residues. Whether and how proline conformation regulates the functional aspects of IDPs remains an open question, however. Here, we studied the disordered domain 2 of nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A-D2) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). NS5A-D2 comprises a short structural motif (PW-turn) embedded in a proline-rich sequence, whose interaction with the human prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) is essential for viral RNA replication. Using NMR, we show here that the PW-turn motif exists in a conformational equilibrium between folded and disordered states. We found that the fraction of conformers in the NS5A-D2 ensemble that adopt the structured motif is allosterically modulated both by the cis/trans isomerization of the surrounding prolines that are CypA substrates and by substitutions conferring resistance to cyclophilin inhibitor. Moreover, we noted that this fraction is directly correlated with HCV RNA replication efficiency. We conclude that CypA can fine-tune the dynamic ensemble of the disordered NS5A-D2, thereby regulating viral RNA replication efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2963057804,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 in myeloid progenitor cells that activates multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the leukemic phenotype. The tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 in CML patients. Despite the success of nilotinib treatment in patients with chronic-phase (CP) CML, a population of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) quiescent stem cells escapes the drug activity and can lead to drug resistance. The molecular mechanism by which these quiescent cells remain insensitive is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profiling (GEP) of bone marrow (BM) CD34+/lin- cells from CP-CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of nilotinib treatment by microarray, in order to identify gene expression changes and the dysregulation of pathways due to nilotinib action. We selected BM CD34+/lin- cells from 78 CP-CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of first-line nilotinib therapy and microarray analysis was performed. GEP bioinformatic analyses identified 2,959 differently expressed probes and functional clustering determined some significantly enriched pathways between diagnosis and 12 months of nilotinib treatment. Among these pathways, we observed the under expression of 26 genes encoding proteins belonging to the cell cycle after 12 months of nilotinib treatment which led to the up-regulation of chromosome replication, cell proliferation, DNA replication, and DNA damage checkpoint at diagnosis. We demonstrated the under expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCC4, ABCC5, and ABCD3 encoding proteins which pumped drugs out of the cells after 12 months of nilotinib. Moreover, GEP data demonstrated the deregulation of genes involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The down-regulation of JAK2, IL7, STAM, PIK3CA, PTPN11, RAF1, and SOS1 key genes after 12 months of nilotinib could demonstrate the up-regulation of cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation via MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways at diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2963302088,"Broiler breeders, the parent stock of meat chickens, are feed-restricted throughout the production cycle to avoid obesity-related problems in their health and reproductive performance. Broiler breeders often show signs of chronic hunger, lack of satiety and feeding frustration, and the development of alternative feeding strategies has investigated the inclusion of calcium propionate (CaP) as an appetite suppressant. The mechanisms involved in the reduction of voluntary feed intake are unknown, but are thought to be due to low palatability, gastrointestinal discomfort, or both. The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect of CaP as an appetite suppressant on the experience of a negative affective state, using a conditioned place preference test. Twenty four broiler breeders were trained to associate the consumption of CaP or a placebo pill with a red or blue place, depending on inherent colour preference. Pullets consumed two pills followed by 20 g feed allotment. The CaP pill contained 160 mg of CaP and the placebo pill had 160 mg of feed. Conditioning lasted for 90 min/pullet/day over 8 consecutive days at 7 and 9 weeks of age, and pullets’ choice was tested in a T-maze twice on two consecutive days at both 8 and 10 weeks of age. Data were analysed using a linear mixed regression model, with pen nested in the model and age as a repeated measure. Pullets were less likely to choose the place conditioned with the consumption of CaP (P<0.05) and the preference of the placebo linearly increased with training sessions (P<0.05). These results suggest that calcium propionate as an appetite suppressant can induce a negative affective state, reducing feed intake in broiler breeders fed CaP diets by causing an avoidance response rather than satiety."

The Socio-demographic and Background Questionnaire inquired about participants' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and included questions such as history of psychiatric diagnosis and spiritual practices. Univariate and Chi square analyses were used for descriptive purposes. Logistic regressions were used to explore associations between sociodemographic factors and MHS preferences and use.The majority of the sample were females (53.8%), 61 and older (53.8%), and married or living with partner (57.1%), and reported an income equal to or less than $12,000 per year (44.4%), which places them under the US federal poverty line. Most of the participants (66.7%) reported being receptive to seeking services. Findings showed a significant association between living situation and past (p < .05) and lifetime use (p < .05) of MHS and past use of MHS. Participants living alone were more like to have used MHS in the past and during their lifetime. Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed that living with someone was a protective factor for not using MHS in their lifetime (OR = 0.28; C1 = 0.08-0.95). Participants preferred to receive MHS at the oncology clinic, preferably on the date of their oncology appointments and during morning hours.Findings support the integration of mental health services within the oncology practice setting."
https://openalex.org/W2959869806,"We introduce a rapid deterministic algorithm for identification of the most critical links which are capable of causing network disruptions. The algorithm is based on searching for the shortest cycles in the network and provides a significant time improvement compared with a common brute-force algorithm which scans the entire network. We used a simple measure, based on standard deviation, as a vulnerability measure. It takes into account the importance of nodes in particular network components. We demonstrate this approach on a real network with 734 nodes and 990 links. We found the worst scenarios for the cases with and without people living in the nodes. The evaluation of all network breakups can provide transportation planners and administrators with plenty of data for further statistical analyses. The presented approach provides an alternative approach to the recent research assessing the impacts of simultaneous interruptions of multiple links."
https://openalex.org/W2961899111,"Transforming growth factor-β membrane associated protein (TIMAP) is an endothelial cell (EC)–predominant PP1 regulatory subunit and a member of the myosin phosphatase target (MYPT) protein family. The MYPTs preferentially bind the catalytic protein phosphatase 1 subunit PP1cβ, forming myosin phosphatase holoenzymes. We investigated whether TIMAP/PP1cβ could also function as a myosin phosphatase. Endogenous PP1cβ, myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), and myosin IIA heavy chain coimmunoprecipitated from EC lysates with endogenous TIMAP, and endogenous MLC2 colocalized with TIMAP in EC projections. Purified recombinant GST-TIMAP interacted directly with purified recombinant His-MLC2. However, TIMAP overexpression in EC enhanced MLC2 phosphorylation, an effect not observed with a TIMAP mutant that does not bind PP1cβ. Conversely, MLC2 phosphorylation was reduced in lung lysates from TIMAP-deficient mice and upon silencing of endogenous TIMAP expression in ECs. Ectopically expressed TIMAP slowed the rate of MLC2 dephosphorylation, an effect requiring TIMAP–PP1cβ interaction. The association of MYPT1 with PP1cβ was profoundly reduced in the presence of excess TIMAP, leading to proteasomal MYPT1 degradation. In the absence of TIMAP, MYPT1-associated PP1cβ readily bound immobilized microcystin-LR, an active-site inhibitor of PP1c. By contrast, TIMAP-associated PP1cβ did not interact with microcystin-LR, indicating that the active site of PP1cβ is blocked when it is bound to TIMAP. Thus, TIMAP inhibits myosin phosphatase activity in ECs by competing with MYPT1 for PP1cβ and blocking the PP1cβ active site.

https://openalex.org/W2963325483,"Comparative gene expression studies are invaluable for predicting how existing genetic pathways may be modified or redeployed to produce novel and variable phenotypes. Fruits are ecologically important organs because of their impact on plant fitness and seed dispersal, modifications in which results in morphological variation across species. A novel fruit type in the Brassicaceae known as heteroarthrocarpy enables distinct dispersal methods in a single fruit through segmentation via a lateral joint and variable dehiscence at maturity. Given the close relationship to Arabidopsis, species that exhibit heteroarthrocarpy are powerful models to elucidate how differences in gene expression of a fruit patterning pathway may result in novel fruit types. Transcriptomes of distal, joint, and proximal regions from Erucaria erucarioides and Cakile lanceolata were analyzed to elucidate within fruit and between species differences in whole transcriptome, gene ontology, and fruit patterning expression profiles. Whole transcriptome expression profiles vary between fruit regions in patterns that are consistent with fruit anatomy. These transcriptomic variances do not correlate with changes in gene ontology, as they remain generally stable within and between both species. Upstream regulators in the fruit patterning pathway, FILAMENTOUS FLOWER and YABBY3, are expressed in the distal and proximal regions of E. erucarioides, but not in the joint, implicating alterations in the pathway in heteroarthrocarpic fruits. Downstream gene, INDEHISCENT, is significantly upregulated in the abscissing joint region of C. lanceolata, which suggests repurposing of valve margin genes for novel joint disarticulation in an otherwise indehiscent fruit. In summary, these data are consistent with modifications in fruit patterning genes producing heteroarthrocarpic fruits through different components of the pathway relative to other indehiscent, non-heteroarthrocarpic, species within the family. Our understanding of fruit development in Arabidopsis is now extended to atypical siliques within the Brassicaceae, facilitating future studies on seed shattering in important Brassicaceous crops and pernicious weeds."
https://openalex.org/W2963167028,"The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Contactin (CNTN) families of cell-surface proteins have been intensively studied in the context of neural development and neuropsychiatric diseases. Earlier studies demonstrated both genetic and biochemical interactions between the extracellular domains of APP and CNTN3, but their precise binding interfaces were not defined. In the present study, we have used binding assays between APP-alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins and CNTN-Fc fusion proteins, together with alanine substitution mutagenesis, to show that: (i) the second Fibronectin domain (Fn(2)) in CNTN3 mediates APP binding; (ii) the copper binding domain (CuBD) in APP mediates CNTN3 binding; and (iii) the most important amino acids for APP-CNTN3 binding reside on one face of CNTN3-Fn(2) and on one face of APP-CuBD. These experiments define the regions of direct contact that mediate the binding interaction between APP and CNTN3."
https://openalex.org/W2963821417,"We propose a new method for vectorizing a document using the relational characteristics of the words in the document. For the relational characteristics, we use two types of relational information of a word: 1) the centrality measures of the word and 2) the number of times that the word is used with other words in the document. We propose these methods mainly because information regarding the relations of a word to other words in the document are likely to better represent the unique characteristics of the document than the frequency-based methods (e.g., term frequency and term frequency-inverse document frequency). In experiments using a corpus consisting of 14 documents pertaining to four different topics, the results of clustering analysis using cosine similarities between vectors of relational information for words were comparable to (and more accurate than in some cases) those obtained using vectors of frequency-based methods. The clustering analysis using vectors of tie weights between words yielded the most accurate result. Although the results obtained for the small dataset used in this study can hardly be generalized, they suggest that at least in some cases, vectorization of a document using the relational characteristics of the words can provide more accurate results than the frequency-based vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2962836811,"Executives act based on their experiences, values, personality and personal interpretation of the situations which they face in their companies. Investigations in the field of Behavioral Corporate Finance have determined that there are some relations between CEOs’ personal traits and financial decisions of large companies, but these results are based on indirect personal trait measurements and on public companies. To see whether such relations also exist between CEOs’ personal traits and the financial structure of large private companies, we used psychometric tests to measure their level of optimism, risk attitude and affect heuristic, collected financial data for a period of fourteen years, and considered the economic situation of the country as a key factor in these relations. This paper reports the relationship of executives’ personal traits with the financial structure of large Spanish companies for the period 2001–2014. We observed that executives’ high optimism (and risk aversion attitude) is positively (negatively) related to long-term debt, whilst positive affect is directly associated to the financial leverage and short-term debt. This paper also reports a change of relations when taking into account the country’s economic situation. In effect, by considering this new variable, executives’ risk aversion is seen to be associated to financial leverage and short-term debt, whilst CEOs’ positive affect is linked to long-term debt. These relations are strongly moderated and they become statistically significant in a contracting economic period. In conclusion, the links between CEOs’ personal traits and financial structure of large private Spanish companies make sense when the effect of the economic situation is taken into account. Furthermore, the awareness of these links helps to understand the financial decisions taken within large Spanish companies."
