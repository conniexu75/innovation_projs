In this study we generated adiponectin-deficient mice to directly investigate whether adiponectin has a physiological protective role against diabetes and atherosclerosis in vivo. Heterozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo +/−) mice showed mild insulin resistance, while homozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo −/−) mice showed moderate insulin resistance with glucose intolerance despite body weight gain similar to that of wild-type mice. Moreover, adipo −/−mice showed 2-fold more neointimal formation in response to external vascular cuff injury than wild-type mice (p = 0.01).

Injection of adiponectin decreases plasma glucose levels by suppressing glucose production in the liver (7Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat.

Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that administration of globular adiponectin increases fatty acid combustion in muscle, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance in obese mice (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). We have also shown that insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice is completely reversed by a combination of physiological doses of adiponectin and leptin but only partially by either adiponectin or leptin alone (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K.

These observations suggested that adiponectin may be a major insulin-sensitizing hormone secreted by adipose tissue; however, the physiological role of adiponectin in vivo is not yet clear because the conclusions have been primarily based upon gain of function experiments. Dr. Matsuzawa's group (11Ouchi N. Kihara S. Arita Y. Nishida M. Matsuyama A. Okamoto Y. Ishigami M. Kuriyama H. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Hotta K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Yamashita S. Funahashi T.

Thus, whether adiponectin has antiatherogenic properties in vivois an important question that needs to be addressed. We generated adiponectin-deficient mice as a means of directly investigating whether adiponectin has a physiological protective role against diabetes and atherosclerosis in vivo. Heterozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo +/−) mice showed mild insulin resistance, while homozygous adiponectin-deficient (adipo −/−) mice showed moderate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance despite a body weight gain similar to that of wild-type mice. Moreover, adipo −/−mice showed 2-fold more neointimal formation in response to external vascular cuff injury (13Moroi M. Zhang L. Yasuda T. Virmani R. Gold H.K. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) than wild-type mice (p = 0.01). These results indicate that adiponectin plays a protective role against insulin resistance and neointimal formation in vivo. To construct the targeting vector for disruption of the adiponectin gene, a neomycin resistance gene (neoR) was substituted for exon2 and exon3, the coding region of the adiponectin gene (Fig. 1 A). The strategy for culturing, electroporation of J1 embryonic stem (ES)1 cells (129/Sv), and screening for homologous recombinant clones was as described previously (14Minowa O. Ikeda K. Sugitani Y. Oshima T. Nakai S. Katori Y. Suzuki M. Furukawa M. Kawase T. Zheng Y. Ogura M. Asada Y. Watanabe K. Yamanaka H. Gotoh S. Nishi-Takeshima M. Sugimoto T. Kikuchi T. Takasaka T. Noda T.

Male chimeric mice were mated with C57Bl/6 female mice to generate heterozygous offspring, and F1 progeny from two independently generated male chimeric mice were crossed to obtain F2 mice. Although the knockout animals have a C57Bl/6 × 129/sv genetic background, all experiments in this study were performed using littermate mice. Total RNA was prepared from adipose tissue with ISOGEN Reagent Total RNA isolation reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed with 10 μg of total RNA according to the standard protocol as described previously (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Nakano R.

The RNase protection assay to measure TNFα mRNA was performed with RPA IIITM(Ambion) and TNFα cRNA as described previously (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Nakano R.

The high fat diet containing 32% safflower oil, 33.1% casein, 17.6% sucrose, and 5.6% cellulose was prepared as described previously (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K.

The glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were carried out according to previously described methods (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T.

Serum free fatty acid, triglyceride, total cholesterol, leptin, and adiponectin levels were determined by a NEFA C-test, TG L-type, Tchol E-type (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), Quintikine M kit (R&D System Inc.), and mouse adiponectin radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (LINCO Research Inc.), respectively. The cuff injury model was used as described previously (13Moroi M. Zhang L. Yasuda T. Virmani R. Gold H.K. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The left femoral artery was isolated from surrounding tissues, and after loosely sheathing it with a 2.0-mm polyethylene cuff made of PE-50 tubing (inner diameter, 0.56 mm; outer diameter, 0.965 mm), the cuff was tied in place with an 8-0 suture. The cuffs were larger than the vessels and did not obstruct blood flow. The right femoral artery was dissected from surrounding tissues but not cuffed (sham-operated). 2 weeks after cuff placement, vessels were fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Continuous cross-sections (5 μm) were cut from one end of the cuffed portion to the other end and were stained for elastic fibers and with hematoxylin and eosin. Ten cross-sections each from the cuffed left and control right femoral artery of each animal were digitized with a Polaroid digital microscope camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the thickness of the intima and media was measured in each arterial section. Area/volume calculations were based on four measurements made with an image analysis computer program (Scion Image, Frederick, MD): luminal circumference, luminal area, area inside the inner elastic lamina, and area inside the outer elastic lamina. Two distinct adiponectin mutant mice were generated from distinct ES cell clones in which the adiponectin gene was disrupted by homologous recombination (Fig. 1, A and B). Both mice lines showed identical phenotypes in all the experiments carried out in this study. We confirmed homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 C), and Northern blot analysis revealed an ∼60% reduction of adiponectin mRNA expression in adipose tissue from adipo +/− mice and the abrogation of adiponectin mRNA expression in adipose tissue fromadipo −/− mice (Fig. 1 D). The serum adiponectin levels were ∼60% reduced inadipo +/− mice, and they were undetectable inadipo −/− mice (Fig. 1 E). The serum leptin levels of the adipo +/−,adipo −/−, and wild-type mice were not significantly different (Fig. 1 F). The TNFα mRNA levels of the three mouse genotypes were indistinguishable (Fig.1 G). At 6 weeks the adipo +/− mice andadipo −/− mice exhibited a body weight gain similar to that of the wild-type mice (Fig.2 A). Investigation of the insulin sensitivity of the adipo +/− and wild-type littermate mice at 6 weeks by the insulin tolerance test (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the glucose-lowering effect of insulin was slightly but significantly impaired inadipo +/− mice compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that adipo +/− mice exhibited mild insulin resistance. Next adipo +/− and wild-type mice were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 6 weeks (Fig. 2, C and D), and the results showed no significant differences between the adipo +/−and wild-type mice in blood glucose (Fig. 2 C) and plasma insulin (Fig. 2 D) levels before and after the glucose load. After 10 weeks on a high fat diet, the adipo +/−mice again exhibited a body weight gain similar to that of the wild-type mice (Fig. 2 E), and food intake by theadipo +/− and wild-type mice was not significantly different (2.6 ± 0.1 versus 2.7 ± 0.2 g/day). The blood glucose levels (Fig. 2 F) before and after the glucose load of the OGTT, however, were significantly higher in the adipo +/− mice than in the wild-type mice. The plasma insulin levels (Fig. 2 G) before and after the glucose load were not significantly different between theadipo +/− and wild-type mice. We investigated the insulin sensitivity of adipo −/− and wild-type littermates at 6 weeks by means of the insulin tolerance test (Fig. 2 H). The results showed that the glucose-lowering effect of insulin was significantly impaired in theadipo −/− mice compared with the wild-type mice and adipo +/− mice (p = 0.03, Fig. 2 B), suggesting that theadipo −/− mice were more insulin-resistant than the adipo +/− mice. When the OGTT was performed on adipo −/− and wild-type littermate mice at 6 weeks (Fig. 2, I and J), the blood glucose levels after the glucose load were also found to be significantly higher in the adipo −/− mice than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 2 I). These data revealed moderate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in the adipo −/− mice. There were no differences between the adipo −/−and wild-type mice in plasma insulin levels (Fig. 2 J) before and 30 min after the glucose load, but the plasma insulin levels 15 min after the glucose load tended to be lower in theadipo −/− mice than in the wild-type mice. At 6 weeks, the serum free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) levels did not differ significantly between the adipo +/− mice and wild-type mice (Table I). The serum TG levels were slightly but significantly higher in adipo −/−mice than in wild-type mice, but the serum FFA and TC levels did not differ between the adipo −/− mice and wild-type mice (Table I).Table ISerum lipid levels of adiponectin-deficient mice at 6 weeksMiceWild type (n = 28) adipo +/− (n = 27) adipo −/− (n = 12)Serum FFA levels (meq/liter)1.48 ± 0.091.50 ± 0.111.77 ± 0.14Serum TG levels (mg/dl)54.5 ± 2.2660.2 ± 3.5164.5 ± 4.971-ap < 0.05 (versus wild type).Serum TC levels (mg/dl)64.7 ± 2.6662.2 ± 3.6769.2 ± 4.02Each value represents the mean ± S.E.1-a p < 0.05 (versus wild type).

We placed a cuff around the femoral artery to induce inflammation of the adventitia and subsequent neointimal formation 2 weeks after cuff placement. Luminal diameters did not differ between the adipo −/− and wild-type mice (Fig. 3, A andE), but intimal thickness was significantly greater (2-fold) in the adipo −/− mice than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 3, B and E). There were no significant differences in medial thickness between the two mouse groups (Fig. 3,C and E). The intimal (I)/medial (M) volume ratio was significantly higher (2-fold) in theadipo −/− than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 3,D and E). Adiponectin has been shown to be decreased in insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (5Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). We have reported that administration of adiponectin ameliorates insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice and type 2 diabetic mice (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). Others have also reported that administration of adiponectin decreases the plasma glucose levels of normal mice (7Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 8Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin.

These findings suggest that adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing hormone; however, they were primarily based on gain of function experiments, and loss of function experiments were required to directly determine the physiological role of adiponectin in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Accordingly in the present study we generated adiponectin-deficient mice. The results provide the first direct evidence that adiponectin is indeed required for normal regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasisin vivo. Moreover, adipo +/− mice with a 60% reduction of adiponectin levels were significantly more insulin-resistant than wild-type mice, suggesting that 40–70% reductions in plasma adiponectin levels due to genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms of the adiponectin gene (17Hara K. Boutin P. Mori Y. Tobe K. Dina C. Yasuda K. Yamauchi T. Otabe S. Okada T. Eto K. Kadowaki H. Hagura R. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Taniyama M. Matsubara K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Kimura S. Tomita M. Kimura S. Ito C. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), or environmental factors, such as a high fat diet (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar), may have been causally associated with the insulin resistance. Leptin and adiponectin are two major adipocyte-derived insulin-sensitizing hormones (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat.

Nature. 1999; 401: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The heterozygous leptin-deficient (ob/+) mice did not display a distinct phenotype, but homozygous leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice exhibited severe obesity and associated insulin resistance and diabetes (19Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Sinceadipo +/− mice showed mild but significant insulin resistance, unlike ob/+ mice, adiponectin appears to play a greater regulatory role in the determination of insulin sensitivity under physiological and pathophysiological states as stated above. However, in contrast to ob/ob mice, adipo −/−mice showed normal body weight gain, although they showed insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Although the role of adiponectin in this process has been a matter of controversy (9Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar), leptin clearly plays a much greater role in the regulation of appetite and energy expenditure than adiponectin. These findings indicate that adiponectin and leptin have distinct yet overlapping roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis in vivo. Dr. Matsuzawa's group (11Ouchi N.

In this study, we showed thatadipo −/− mice formed 2-fold more neointima (I/M ratio, p = 0.01) in response to external vascular cuff injury than wild-type mice (Fig. 3, D andE), thereby providing the first direct evidence that adiponectin plays a protective role in neointimal formation in vivo. Although adipo −/− mice showed glucose intolerance and hypertriglyceridemia compared with wild-type mice, these metabolic abnormalities alone are unlikely to account for the increased neointimal formation since homozygous insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-deficient (IRS-1 −/−) mice, which exhibit greater metabolic abnormalities than adipo −/− mice, failed to show any increase in neointimal formation when the same system was used. 2T. Kubota, N. Kubota, M. Moroi, and T. Kadowaki, manuscript in preparation. These findings strongly suggest that the protective effect of adiponectin may be a direct consequence of adiponectin action on the vascular wall and/or macrophages rather than an indirect consequence of alteration of conventional atherosclerotic risk factors in vivo. The cuff injury model mimics features of human atherosclerosis with quantitative and reproducible endpoints (13Moroi M. Zhang L. Yasuda T. Virmani R. Gold H.K. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For example, neointima mainly was formed by cells that originate from bone marrow and medial smooth cells that migrate to subendothelial space and proliferate there. In conclusion, this study provides the first direct evidence that adiponectin plays a protective role against insulin resistance and neointimal formation in vivo. The results of this study also suggest that administration of adiponectin may provide a novel treatment modality for both type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

Whether this increased muscling results from prenatal or postnatal lack of myostatin activity is unknown. Here we show that myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that can be activated by acid treatment. Systemic overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle and fat loss analogous to that seen in human cachexia syndromes. These data indicate that myostatin acts systemically in adult animals and may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired."

Human immunodeficiency virus–type 1 (HIV-1) mutations that allow escape from host immune responses may therefore be HLA allele–specific. We analyzed HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences from a large HLA-diverse population of HIV-1–infected individuals. Polymorphisms in HIV-1 were most evident at sites of least functional or structural constraint and frequently were associated with particular host HLA class I alleles. Absence of polymorphism was also HLA allele–specific. At a population level, the degree of HLA-associated selection in viral sequence was predictive of viral load. These results support a fundamental role for HLA-restricted immune responses in driving and shaping HIV-1 evolution in vivo."

Near a methyltransferase gene cluster is the pylT gene, which encodes an unusual transfer RNA (tRNA) with a CUA anticodon. The adjacent pylS gene encodes a class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges the pylT -derived tRNA with lysine but is not closely related to known lysyl-tRNA synthetases. Homologs of pylS and pylT are found in a Gram-positive bacterium. Charging a tRNA CUA with lysine is a likely first step in translating UAG amber codons as pyrrolysine in certain methanogens. Our results indicate that pyrrolysine is the 22nd genetically encoded natural amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1557270760,"A central problem in biology is determining how genes interact as parts of functional networks. Creation and analysis of synthetic networks, composed of well-characterized genetic elements, provide a framework for theoretical modeling. Here, with the use of a combinatorial method, a library of networks with varying connectivity was generated in Escherichia coli . These networks were composed of genes encoding the transcriptional regulators LacI, TetR, and lambda CI, as well as the corresponding promoters. They displayed phenotypic behaviors resembling binary logical circuits, with two chemical “inputs” and a fluorescent protein “output.” Within this simple system, diverse computational functions arose through changes in network connectivity. Combinatorial synthesis provides an alternative approach for studying biological networks, as well as an efficient method for producing diverse phenotypes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2122905397,"It is essential to keep track of the movements we make, and one way to do that is to monitor correlates, or corollary discharges, of neuronal movement commands. We hypothesized that a previously identified pathway from brainstem to frontal cortex might carry corollary discharge signals. We found that neuronal activity in this pathway encodes upcoming eye movements and that inactivating the pathway impairs sequential eye movements consistent with loss of corollary discharge without affecting single eye movements. These results identify a pathway in the brain of the primate Macaca mulatta that conveys corollary discharge signals."
https://openalex.org/W2102032812,"We have studied the correlation between structural dynamics and function of the hairpin ribozyme. The enzyme-substrate complex exists in either docked (active) or undocked (inactive) conformations. Using single-molecule fluorescence methods, we found complex structural dynamics with four docked states of distinct stabilities and a strong memory effect where each molecule rarely switches between different docked states. We also found substrate cleavage to be rate-limited by a combination of conformational transitions and reversible chemistry equilibrium. The complex structural dynamics quantitatively explain the heterogeneous cleavage kinetics common to many catalytic RNAs. The intimate coupling of structural dynamics and function is likely a general phenomenon for RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2078868629,"Endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent anti-angiogenic protein, but the molecular mechanism of its action is not yet clear. We examined the effects of endostatin on the biological and biochemical activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Endostatin blocked VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 and activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125FAK in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endostatin also inhibited the binding of VEGF165 to both endothelial cells and purified extracellular domain of KDR/Flk-1. Moreover, the binding of VEGF121 to KDR/Flk-1 and VEGF121-stimulated ERK activation were blocked by endostatin. The direct interaction between endostatin and KDR/Flk-1 was confirmed by affinity chromatography. However, endostatin did not bind to VEGF. Our findings suggest that a direct interaction of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1 may be involved in the inhibitory function of endostatin toward VEGF actions and responsible for its potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities in vivo.

However, the molecular mechanisms of endostatin-mediated anti-angiogenesis and tumor regression are not yet clear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 a potent mitogen for endothelial cells, is an important mediator of angiogenesis and is involved in the differentiation of endothelial cells and the development of the vascular system (8Ferrara N. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 2413-2422Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr.

In particular, it is thought that VEGF is the most important angiogenic factor closely associated with induction and maintenance of the neovasculature in human tumors. The increased expression of VEGF mRNA has been detected in a variety of tumors, and recently tumor VEGF level was recognized as an important prognostic marker of tumor angiogenesis (10Veikkola T.

VEGF exerts its effects through binding to its two receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1, expressed on endothelial cells. KDR/Flk-1 is related mainly to the mitogenic and chemotactic responses, whereas Flt-1 is required for endothelial cell morphogenesis (12Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol.

In addition, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is considered an essential mediator of VEGF-induced angiogenesis (17Zachary I. Am. J.

Previous studies have reported that endostatin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in response to VEGF (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,19Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but its mechanism of action is not clearly delineated. Here we report that endostatin blocks VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 and activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125FAK, which are downstream events of KDR/Flk-1 signaling and are involved in the mitogenic and motogenic activities of VEGF in endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that endostatin inhibits the binding of VEGF to endothelial cells and to its cell surface receptor, KDR/Flk-1. The binding partner for endostatin is KDR/Flk-1 but not VEGF. Our results suggest that direct interaction of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1 blocks the binding of VEGF to endothelial cells and the VEGF-induced signaling of KDR/Flk-1 itself and its downstream signaling events, resulting in the inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration. VEGF165, VEGF121, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), protein A-agarose, and antibody to p125FAK were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Tissue culture dishes and plasticware were obtained from Falcon Plastics. M199 and heparin were purchased from Invitrogen. KDR/Flk-1-Fc, Flt-1-Fc, and antibody for VEGF were from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-KDR/Flk-1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies for phospho-specific ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and ERK2 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies for human IgG-HRP and mouse IgG-HRP were from Pierce. [3H]thymidine,125I-VEGF165, NHS-activated Sepharose, and the chemiluminescent substrate for horseradish peroxidase were fromAmersham Biosciences. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical cord veins by collagenase treatment as described previously (20Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar), and only passages 2–6 were used. The cells were grown in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 ng/ml bFGF, and 5 units/ml heparin at 37 °C under a humidified 95 and 5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2, respectively. The recombinant mouse endostatin was expressed and purified from HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pFLAG-CMV-1-endostatin as described previously (21Kim Y.M. Jang J.W. Lee O.H. Yeon J. Choi E.Y. Kim K.W. Lee S.T. Kwon Y.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5410-5413PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis against PBS, the purity of recombinant mouse endostatin as checked by SDS-PAGE was as high as 97%. Confluent HUVECs were incubated for 6 h in M199 containing 1% FBS, and cells were stimulated by the addition of VEGF (10 ng/ml). After stimulation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either 1 μg/ml anti-KDR/Flk-1 antibody or anti-FAK antibody at 4 °C for 3 h followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and further analyzed by Western blotting. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates from HUVECs were run in SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blocked membranes were then incubated with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate. The counting assay was performed as described previously (19Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well onto gelatin-coated 6-well plates. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with M199 containing 1% FBS with or without endostatin as indicated (0, 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 μg/ml, respectively). After 30 min, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml VEGF165. After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized, and the total number of cells was counted. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of endostatin on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was carried out as described previously (22Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in gelatin-coated 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with M199 and incubated for 6 h in M199 containing 1% FBS. Cells were stimulated by the addition of 10 ng/ml VEGF for 30 h, followed by the addition of 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine for 6 h. High molecular weight DNAs were precipitated using 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. After two washes with ice-cold H2O, 3H radioactivity was solubilized in 0.2n NaOH, 0.1% SDS and determined by liquid scintillation counter. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and the assays were repeated twice. Chemotaxis assay was performed as described previously (22Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chemotactic motility of HUVECs was assayed using Transwell with 6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size). The lower surface of the filter was coated with 10 μg of gelatin. The fresh M199 medium (1% FBS) containing VEGF was placed in the lower wells. HUVECs were trypsinized and suspended at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in M199 containing 1% FBS. Various concentrations of endostatin (0, 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 μg/ml, respectively) were given to the cells for 30 min at room temperature before seeding. One hundred μl of the cell suspension was loaded into each of the upper wells. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping with a cotton swab, and chemotaxis was quantified by counting with an optical microscope (×200) the cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter. Ten fields were counted for each assay. The binding of 125I-VEGF to HUVECs was performed as described previously (23Bae D.G. Gho Y.S. Yoon W.H. Chae C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13588-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well onto gelatin-coated 24-well plates, incubated overnight, washed with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA in M199), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cultured cells were first treated with various amounts of endostatin for 30 min, and125I-VEGF165 (0.125 nm) was added in 200 μl of binding buffer. The binding was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 3 h, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer followed by washing once with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min, and receptor-bound radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. The amount of nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled VEGF165. Each data point was assayed in triplicate, and the assays were repeated twice. VEGF165 and VEGF121 (80 ng/well) in 100 μl of PBS were immobilized to 96-well plates. The wells were washed and blocked with 3% BSA in M199 for 2 h. After 10 min of preincubation of KDR/Flk-1-Fc (25 ng/ml) in M199 containing 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% BSA with or without various amount of endostatin, the mixture (100 μl) was added to each well. After 2 h, the wells were washed three times with PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20). The bound KDR/Flk-1-Fc was determined by incubation with anti-human IgG-HRP followed by a chemiluminescent substrate. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Each data point was assayed in triplicate, and the assays were repeated at least twice. Endostatin affinity and negative control beads were prepared using NHS-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions and suspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS. KDR/Flk-1-Fc (2.5 μg) in 450 μl of PBS was added to 50 μl of control or endostatin affinity beads (1:1 slurry), and the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 400 μl of PBS. Bound materials were eluted by boiling with 50 μl of reducing SDS-loading dye. Samples (25 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and KDR/Flk-1-Fc was detected using anti-human IgG-HRP. Various amounts of endostatin in 100 μl of PBS were coated on ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed and blocked with M199 containing 3% BSA at room temperature for 2 h.125I-VEGF165 (0.125 nm) was added to each well, and the binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were washed three times with PBST. Bound 125I-VEGF165 was removed by the addition of 150 μl of 0.1 n NaOH at room temperature for 30 min, and the radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the assays were repeated twice. The p values were calculated from Student's t test based on comparisons with control samples tested at the same time. According to the previous reports (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), endostatin inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, but its mechanism is not clear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of endostatin associated with its anti-angiogenic activities, the recombinant mouse endostatin was purified from HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pFLAG-CMV-1-endostatin as described previously (21Kim Y.M. Jang J.W. Lee O.H. Yeon J. Choi E.Y. Kim K.W. Lee S.T. Kwon Y.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5410-5413PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-angiogenic activities of purified endostatin were evaluated (Fig. 1). Endostatin inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). In addition, endostatin blocked VEGF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 B). Endostatin also inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of bovine aortic endothelial cells but had no effect on the proliferation of HT1080 cells (data not shown). VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration was also blocked by endostatin in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal activity at ∼ 1 μg/ml (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that endostatin used in this study had the intrinsic properties described in other studies (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 24Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Because previous studies have shown that VEGF induces proliferation and migration through activation of its cell surface receptor, KDR/Flk-1 (10Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 17Zachary I. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1375-C1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of endostatin on VEGF-induced KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation. When HUVECs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF165 for 5 min, a protein migrating at 205 kDa was strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.2 A). Preincubation of HUVECs with 10 μg/ml endostatin (30 min) prior to VEGF165stimulation dramatically reduced VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein. To determine whether the VEGF-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is KDR/Flk-1, tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-KDR/Flk-1 and then immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown Fig. 2 B, VEGF165 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1; this phosphorylation was blocked by endostatin pretreatment. These results indicate that endostatin blocks VEGF-induced KDR/Flk-1 activation in endothelial cells. To further determine the inhibitory effect of endostatin on VEGF-induced KDR/Flk-1 activation, we investigated the effect of endostatin on the intracellular signaling pathways induced by VEGF. Because previous studies have demonstrated that VEGF induces a rapid activation of ERK and p38 MAPK, which are downstream signaling molecules of KDR/Flk-1 (14Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 18: 2169-2177Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar), the effects of endostatin on VEGF-induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation were assessed. Subconfluent HUVECs were preincubated with various concentrations of endostatin for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VEGF165 for 10 min. Fig.3 A shows that VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK, and endostatin inhibited VEGF-induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with endostatin (10 μg/ml) for various times prior to the addition of VEGF165 (10 ng/ml) showed that endostatin almost completely blocked VEGF-induced ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation after 30 min of preincubation (Fig. 3 B). When HUVECs were treated simultaneously with endostatin and VEGF165, the inhibitory activity was greatly reduced. To confirm the inhibitory effect of endostatin on KDR/Flk-1 signaling, we investigated whether endostatin could block p125FAKtyrosine phosphorylation, which lies downstream of the KDR/Flk-1 receptor (15Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 18: 2169-2177Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Preincubation of HUVECs with endostatin (30 min) caused a marked decrease in p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation induced by VEGF165 (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that endostatin can block multiple signaling events of VEGF in endothelial cells, presumably via VEGF receptor inactivation. To determine the mechanism by which endostatin blocks VEGF-mediated KDR/Flk-1 activation, we investigated the effect of endostatin on the binding of VEGF165 to HUVECs. Fig.4 A shows that pretreatment of endostatin (30 min) prior to the addition of125I-VEGF165 blocked the binding of VEGF to HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 ≈ 1.25 μg/ml). When endothelial cells were preincubated with endostatin for 30 min, the specific binding of125I-VEGF165 (0.125 nm) was reduced to 3.7% by the presence of 10 μg/ml of endostatin (Fig.4 B). The inhibitory activity of endostatin (10 μg/ml) was markedly reduced without preincubation (52.0%). These results suggest that preincubation of endostatin prior to VEGF treatment is necessary to block the VEGF binding to endothelial cells. To further confirm the inhibitory activity of endostatin on the interaction between VEGF and its receptors, using an ELISA binding assay we examined the effect of endostatin on the binding of VEGF with KDR/Flk-1-Fc, a soluble fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of KDR/Flk-1. As shown in Fig. 4 C, preincubation of endostatin (10 min) with KDR/Flk-1-Fc blocked the interaction between VEGF and KDR/Flk-1-Fc in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 ≈ 2.5 μg/ml). The binding of Flt-1-Fc to immobilized VEGF165 was also blocked by endostatin. We next investigated the effect of preincubation time of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1-Fc on the binding of VEGF to KDR/Flk-1-Fc. The longer preincubation showed less binding of KDR/Flk-1-Fc to the immobilized VEGF (Fig. 4 D). We also examined whether endostatin can affect the dissociation rate of KDR/Flk-1-Fc from the preformed VEGF and FKDR/Flk-1-Fc complex. Endostatin even at a high concentration (10 μg/ml) had no significant effect on the dissociation rate of KDR/Flk-1-Fc from VEGF and its receptor complex (data not shown). These results suggest that preincubation of endostatin prior to VEGF treatment is necessary to block VEGF binding to endothelial cells and that endostatin inhibits VEGF-induced signaling via the direct blockage of VEGF and its receptor KDR/Flk-1 interaction. VEGF165 and VEGF121 are two major isoforms of VEGF generated via an alternative splicing mechanism from a unique gene (10Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 17Zachary I. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1375-C1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF165 but not VEGF121 binds to heparin-like molecules, and the binding is related to the biological function of VEGF165. To clarify the involvement of the heparin binding domain of VEGF in the inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial cell responses by endostatin, we investigated the effect of endostatin on the binding of VEGF121 to KDR/Flk-1 and VEGF121-stimulated ERK activation in endothelial cells. Preincubation of endostatin (10 min) with KDR/Flk-1-Fc blocked the binding of KDR/Flk-1-Fc to the immobilized VEGF121 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). The IC50 value was ∼3.5 μg/ml, similar to that of VEGF165. The longer preincubation of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1-Fc showed a lower level of binding of KDR/Flk-1-Fc to VEGF121 in the presence of the same amount of endostatin (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 5 C, both VEGF121 and VEGF165 stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in endothelial cells, and these effects were blocked by the treatment of endostatin. These results suggest that endostatin can inhibit the interaction between VEGF121 and its receptor KDR/Flk-1 and block VEGF121-induced ERK activation in endothelial cells. Because endostatin blocks the interaction between VEGF and its receptor KDR/Flk-1, we investigated whether endostatin directly binds to either KDR/Flk-1 or VEGF. Endostatin affinity chromatography showed that KDR/Flk-1 bound to the endostatin-immobilized beads but not to control beads (Fig. 6 A). Flt-1-Fc also bound to the endostatin-immobilized beads (data not shown). In an ELISA assay, 125I-VEGF165 did not bind to immobilized endostatin (Fig. 6 B). Affinity chromatography also showed that there was no interaction between endostatin and VEGF (data not shown). These results suggest that direct interaction of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1 but not with VEGF may be involved in the inhibitory activity of endostatin on VEGF-induced signaling, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells. Several reports demonstrate that endostatin, a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, specifically blocks the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by angiogenic factors including VEGF (6Yamaguchi N.

However, the molecular mechanisms of endostatin-mediated anti-angiogenesis and tumor regression are not yet clear. To delineate the mechanisms involved in the anti-angiogenic activity of endostatin, we investigated the effect of endostatin on VEGF action by cell biological and biochemical experiments. VEGF is the most important angiogenic molecule associated with tumor-induced neovascularization. In this paper, we present several novel observations. First, endostatin blocks the VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 in endothelial cells. Second, endostatin suppresses the VEGF-induced activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125FAK, which are downstream events of the KDR/Flk-1 signaling and are involved in the mitogenic and motogenic activities of VEGF in endothelial cells. Third, endostatin inhibits the binding of VEGF to endothelial cells and to its cell surface receptor, KDR/Flk-1. Finally, endostatin directly binds to KDR/Flk-1 but not to VEGF. Our findings clearly indicate that direct interaction of endostatin with the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1 blocks the binding of VEGF to its receptor, the VEGF-induced signaling of KDR/Flk-1 itself, and its downstream signaling such as ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125FAK, resulting in the inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Previous reports showed that endostatin inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because recent studies suggest that the VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1 and not Flt-1 is involved in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in response to VEGF (12Bernatchez P.N. Soker S. Sirois M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31047-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we first revealed that endostatin could interfere with VEGF-induced activation of its receptor KDR/Flk-1. Endostatin blocked VEGF165-induced phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 in human endothelial cells. This finding was further supported by our data that endostatin clearly suppressed the downstream events of VEGF165-induced KDR/Flk-1 signaling, such as activation of ERK and p38 MAPK and p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, that are requisite for the mitogenic and motogenic activities of VEGF in endothelial cells (14Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J.

Endostatin also inhibited VEGF121-induced activation of ERK in HUVECs. These results supposed that the anti-angiogenic action of endostatin against VEGF is associated with its ability to block VEGF receptor KDR/Flk-1 activation. How does endostatin block the VEGF-mediated endothelial cell signaling events that result in the blocking of VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells? There are at least three different possible mechanisms: (i) endostatin directly interferes in the interaction between VEGF and its receptor, KDR/Flk-1, via its direct binding either to VEGF or to KDR/Flk-1; (ii) binding of endostatin to its receptor-like molecules present on the surface of endothelial cells transfers intracellular signals to block VEGF-mediated signaling; and (iii) internalized endostatin blocks the VEGF-mediated signaling. Our results showed that endostatin blocks the binding of VEGF to its receptors present on the surface of HUVECs and also interferes in the interaction between VEGF and KDR/Flk-1-Fc in a dose-dependent manner. It is worthwhile to note that endostatin blocked VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells and activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125FAK as well as the binding of VEGF to endothelial cells and to KDR/Flk-1 with an IC50 in the μg/ml range. This working concentration was at a level similar to that shown in other reports (7Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Waterman M.J., Lu, H. Knebelmann B. Segal M. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11721-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 25Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, some groups have demonstrated that endostatin blocks VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration with an IC50 in the ng/ml range (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 26Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M.

Cell. 2001; 7: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the working concentration of endostatin is still controversial. What is the binding partner for endostatin? Our experiments, including endostatin affinity chromatography, showed that the binding partner for endostatin is KDR/Flk-1 but not VEGF. Preincubation of endostatin with endothelial cells or KDR/Flk-1-Fc was necessary for the efficient blockage of interaction between VEGF and its cell surface receptors or KDR/Flk-1-Fc. These results may be the reason why preincubation of HUVECs with endostatin prior to VEGF treatment is required for the efficient inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 and intracellular signaling pathways. Previously reported results also show that preincubation of endostatin with endothelial cells is necessary for the blockage of VEGF-induced migration (6Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M. Sasaki T. Fukai N. Shapiro R. Que I. Lowik C. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Taddei L. Chiarugi P. Brogelli L. Cirri P. Magnelli L. Raugei G. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Chiarugi V. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The requirement of preincubation for the efficient activity of endostatin also supports the finding that the binding partner for endostatin is KDR/Flk-1 not VEGF. Although most of the VEGF-induced responses in endothelial cells are mediated through KDR/Flk-1, a recent study suggested that Flt-1 but not KDR/Flk-1 may be involved in VEGF-induced formation of capillary networks via the stimulation of nitric oxide release in HUVECs (27Bussolati B. Dunk C. Grohman M. Kontos C.D. Mason J. Ahmed A. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 993-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Endostatin blocks the tube formation of endothelial cells (28Joki T. Machluf M. Atala A. Zhu J. Seyfried N.T. Dunn I.F. Abe T. Carroll R.S. Black P.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our results showed that endostatin also bound to Flt-1 and blocked the interaction between VEGF and Flt-1. It is worthwhile to note that endostatin neither competes with the binding of bFGF to human tissues nor affects FGF receptor signaling (29Chang Z. Choon A. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 71-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K., Lu, L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although endostatin was originally identified based on its inhibitory activity of bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation (4O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar). Although we could not completely rule out the other mechanisms, our observations suggest that direct interaction of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1 can block the binding of VEGF to its receptor present on the surface of endothelial cells and may be involved in the inhibitory activity of endostatin on VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Although several groups have found endostatin-binding proteins and suggested models to delineate the mechanism of endostatin action, the molecular mechanisms of endostatin-mediated anti-angiogenesis and tumor regression are not fully understood. Endostatin induces tyrosine kinase signaling through the Shb adaptor protein and enhanced apoptosis in bFGF-treated endothelial cells (30Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K., Lu, L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endostatin inhibits pro-MMP-2 activation mediated by membrane type 1 MMP and the catalytic activities of both MMP-2 and membrane type 1 MMP resulting in the inhibition of endothelial and tumor cell invasion (21Kim Y.M. Jang J.W. Lee O.H. Yeon J. Choi E.Y. Kim K.W. Lee S.T. Kwon Y.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5410-5413PubMed Google Scholar). Endostatin also binds with α5- and αv-integrins on the surface of endothelial cells and inhibits integrin-dependent endothelial cell migration (25Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The interaction of endostatin with tropomyosin causes disruption of microfilament integrity leading to inhibition of endothelial cell migration, induction of endothelial cell apoptosis, and ultimately inhibition of tumor growth (31MacDonald N.J. Shivers W.Y. Narum D.L. Plum S.M. Wingard J.N. Fuhrmann S.R. Liang H. Holland-Linn J. Chen D.H. Sim B.K. J. Biol.

A recent study has shown that endostatin interacts with endothelial cell surface glypicans via its glycosaminoglycan chain and that glypicans are necessary for the inhibitory activity of endostatin on VEGF165- but not VEGF121-induced endothelial cell migration; endostatin, however, efficiently blocks both VEGF165- and VEGF121-induced endothelial cell migration (26Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M. Hanai J.I. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Keiser N. Kalluri R. Zeng H. Mukhopadhyay D. Chen R.L. Lander A.D. Hagihara K. Yamaguchi Y.

Another study shows that heparin binding is not involved in the function of endostatin (29Chang Z. Choon A. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 71-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An in situ-binding assay showed that endostatin binds predominantly to its functional target (blood vessels) and co-localizes largely with bFGF in human breast carcinoma tissues (29Chang Z. Choon A. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 71-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in situ endostatin binding to blood vessels is resistant to treatment with heparinase and is not affected by bFGF and heparin. These results indicate that binding of endostatin to blood vessels is not mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans and that heparin binding domain of endostatin may not be involved in the in vivoanti-angiogenic and anti-tumor action of endostatin. We have shown herein that endostatin blocks the binding of both VEGF165and VEGF121 to KDR/Flk-1 and their intracellular signaling events in endothelial cells. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which endostatin inhibits angiogenesis induced by VEGFin vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular characteristics of endostatin/KDR binding are under investigation. We thank Dr. H. K. Kleinman for critical reading of the manuscript."

Differentiated hepatocytes rapidly reenter the cell cycle after surgical removal of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver. Following two rounds of DNA synthesis and cell division, liver mass is restored within 2 weeks (2Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 (IL-6)1 is known as one of the most important initiators of the regenerative response (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R.

IL-6−/− mice have impaired liver regeneration characterized by liver necrosis and failure, a blunted DNA synthetic response in hepatocytes, and reduced gene activation during G1 phase. Furthermore, STAT3 activation is absent posthepatectomy in IL-6−/− livers, which supports a possible pro-proliferative role of STAT3 in hepatocytes (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). IL-6 induces a large spectrum of immediate-early genes (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I.

Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in part through direct activation via STAT3 binding sites and in part through cooperative interaction between STAT3 and other transcription factors (5Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Leu J.P. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, because IL-6 also activates other signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway during liver regeneration (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the absence of STAT3 is responsible for part or all of the growth defects that are seen in IL-6−/− livers. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) belongs to the family of STAT transcription factors which mediate the cellular response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors including IL-6 (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 7Darnell Jr., J.E.

When IL-6 binds to its specific receptor subunit, it can induce dimerization of the gp130 receptor and activation of the gp130-associated Janus kinase (Jak). The Jaks in turn phosphorylate the specific tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the gp130, providing docking sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of signaling molecules including STAT3. Once recruited to the receptor chains, STAT3 itself becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by the Jaks, which leads to the dissociation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of the activated STAT3. Nuclear STAT3 can then bind to specific promoter elements on DNA and activate target gene transcription (9Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Because STAT3 deletion leads to embryonic lethality (12Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, several laboratories independently have developed conditional STAT3 knock-out in different organs and tissues. Specific disruption of STAT3 in T cells revealed that STAT3 activation is responsible for IL-6-dependent T cell proliferation through preventing apoptosis (13Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar). Also the conditional deletion of STAT3 in the liver demonstrated that STAT3 is essential for the induction of all acute phase response genes downstream of IL-6 (14Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the STAT3 signaling pathway during liver regeneration and in hepatocyte proliferation, we utilized the STAT3 conditional liver knock-out to study the DNA synthetic response during regeneration. We found that DNA synthesis was partially impaired in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers but that liver regeneration still occurred in the absence of STAT3. STAT3 regulates the expression of some IL-6 target genes during liver regeneration but could not account for all of the gene expression abnormalities observed in IL-6−/− livers. This is the first in vivo evidence that STAT3 promotes cell cycle progression and cell proliferation by up-regulating immediate-early growth response genes. STAT3fl/fl mice were generated in Dr. Valeria Poli's laboratory as described previously (14Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell.

Because Alb+STAT3fl/fl mice are viable and fertile, all conditional knock-out mice and their control littermates used for experiments were generated by mating Alb+STAT3fl/fl with Alb−STAT3fl/fl animals. Genotyping for theCre transgene was performed by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: CRE1, 5′-AGGCGTTTTCTGAGCATACC-3′; CRE 10, 5′-TAGCTGGCTGGTGGCAGATG-3′. Two additional oligonucleotides that identify the IL-6 gene were used as an internal control for the PCR reaction: IL-6 Small, 5′-CTTCACAGAGGATACCACTCCCAACAG-3′; IL-6 No. 4, 5′-CTTCCAGACAGGAAAGGAACCCCTTC-3′. The mice were maintained on anad libitum diet of rodent laboratory chow 5008 (Ralston-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO). Procedures involving animals were conducted with the approval of IACUC and in conformity with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. 8–12-week old mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and subjected to midventral laparotomy, and the left lateral and median lobes were removed (2). Animals were sacrificed at different time points posthepatectomy. Blood was obtained from the heart at the time of harvest, and serum was collected and analyzed by Ani Lytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Total RNA was isolated from the remaining liver lobes as described previously (16Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 5 μg of RNA samples from both the Alb+ and Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers at 2 h posthepatectomy were reverse-transcribed, labeled with [α-32P]dATP, and hybridized to the mouse atlas cDNA expression array as described previously (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Filters were washed and exposed to autoradiograph film. The intensity of the hybridization signal was analyzed using the ImageQuant program and normalized to the housekeeping genes on the blot. Northern blot analysis was performed using 20 μg of total RNA as described previously (16Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whole liver extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (17Cressman D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein electrophoresis, protein transfer, and detection by Western blot and chemiluminescence assay (ECL from AmershamBiosciences, Inc.) were carried out as described previously (18Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were: anti-STAT3 antibody (C-20), anti-phospho-MAPK (E-4), anti-Erk2 (C-14), anti-cyclin D1 (C-20), anti-cyclin E (M-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-β-actin (AC-74) (Sigma). Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibodies are used at a dilution of 1:10,000 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). 10 μg of nuclear extracts from liver were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A double-stranded oligonucleotide from the sis-inducible factor binding element in the c-Fos promoter (5′-GATCCTCCAGCATTTCCCGTAAATCCTCCAG-3′) was used for STAT binding as described (19Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating 1 μl of primary antibody with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C 2 h before adding the [α-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide. Anti-STAT3 (C-20X) and anti-STAT1 (E-23X) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Hepatectomized mice were reanesthetized and subjected to ventral laparotomy. Two hours before harvesting of the liver, animals were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)/kg of weight. The remnant liver lobes were removed and fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Formalde-Fresh; Fisher Scientific) for 16–24 h before the buffer was changed to cold phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed liver was paraffin-embedded, cut to 5 μm tissue sections, and adhered to glass slides. BrdUrd immunohistochemical staining was performed on slides as described (18Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase detection system was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA; Vectastain Elite ABC and avidin-biotin blocking kit). Anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at a dilution of 1:250. The percentage of BrdUrd-labeled hepatocytes was determined by counting positively stained hepatocyte nuclei in 12 random 20× microscopic fields and calculating the mean. This value was expressed as a fraction of the total number of hepatocytes in a 20× field and averaged 200 cells/field. Mice homozygous for the STAT3 floxed allele were generated as described (14Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To obtain STAT3 conditional knock-out mice, STAT3fl/fl mice were bred to a line ofCre recombinase transgenic mice. The albumin promoter was chosen to drive the Cre recombinase to obtain liver-specific deletion of the STAT3 gene. Alb+STAT3fl/fl mice are fertile, they have no developmental abnormalities, and the gross morphology of the liver is also normal. Therefore, we bred the Alb+STAT3fl/fl mice to Alb−STAT3fl/fl mice and used the F1progenies in all of our experiments. Alb−STAT3fl/fl littermates were used as controls for the STAT3 conditional-mutants. To confirm that there was little to no STAT3 message or functional protein in the liver posthepatectomy, we performed Northern blot and Western blot analyses. STAT3 mRNA was present in the quiescent Alb−STAT3fl/fl liver but not in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers. In control livers, the message was rapidly induced after surgery and remained high until 24 h posthepatectomy, whereas there was only minimum induction of the STAT3 mRNA in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers (Fig.1 A). We estimated that there was more than 90% deletion of the STAT3 gene. Western blot analyses were used to determine levels of STAT3 protein that had translocated into the nucleus upon activation. STAT3 was not present in the nucleus in quiescent livers, but the level went up rapidly and peaked around 2 h posthepatectomy in Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, there was no detectable STAT3 protein in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers. These results proved that the disruption of STAT3 gene by Cre recombinase in the liver is efficient. A gel mobility shift assay was performed to further confirm that there was no STAT3 DNA binding activity in STAT3 conditional-mutant livers posthepatectomy (Fig.2 A). Peak STAT3 DNA binding occurred at 2 h posthepatectomy in control livers. The most prominent form of the DNA binding complex was the STAT3/STAT3 homodimer. A low level of STAT3/STAT1 heterodimer as well as an even lower level of STAT1 homodimer band were also observed as we have reported previously (17Cressman D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was little induction of the lower two complexes during regeneration in Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers. In contrast, there was little STAT3/STAT3 homodimer observed in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers after surgery, but a high level of complex was detected migrating at the position of the STAT1 homodimer. Supershift assay was used to confirm the composition of the DNA binding complexes in both the Alb− and Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers (Fig.2 B). When preincubated with α-STAT3 antibody, the main DNA binding band in Alb− STAT3fl/fllivers was supershifted, and multiple supershift complexes were formed. Anti-STAT1 antibody had no effect on this complex, but the putative STAT1/STAT1 homodimer in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers was disrupted by the α-STAT1 antibody. α-STAT3 antibody had no effect on this complex. Blood was collected from hepatectomized animals and tested for 10 serum indexes. There was no significant difference in the serum indexes from the Alb+ compared with the Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers, and Alb+STAT3fl/fl animals regained liver mass normally after 1 week of surgery showing no sign of injury at any time point posthepatectomy (data not shown). We examined the DNA synthetic response in the Alb+ and Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers using BrdUrd immunohistochemistry. There was a 3-fold difference in the number of hepatocytes undergoing DNA synthesis at 40 h posthepatectomy (p < 0.02) and reduced DNA synthesis at other time points (Fig. 3, A andB), indicating that Alb+STAT3fl/fl hepatocytes have an impaired DNA synthetic response during regeneration. Previously we had observed that MAPK activation is severely delayed in IL-6−/− livers posthepatectomy (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine whether disruption of the STAT3 signaling pathway posthepatectomy also has an effect on the MAPK signaling pathway, MAPK activation was examined in the Alb+ and Alb−STAT3fl/fl hepatectomized livers using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 4). The activation of MAPK in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers followed the same kinetics as found in control livers. This experiment was repeated with three different sets of samples. After quantification using scanning densitometry, no consistent or significant difference in the level of either the phosphorylated Erk1 or the phosphorylated Erk2 was observed at any time point. This finding supports the conclusion that STAT3 and MAPK represent two independent IL-6 signaling pathways. By using a mouse cDNA expression array, we successfully identified more than 100 immediate-early genes that are activated at 2 h posthepatectomy, 36% of which also showed IL-6 regulation posthepatectomy. Furthermore, we distinguished the genes that were activated by IL-6 posthepatectomy from those activated by IL-6 injection alone using the same analysis (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the spectrum of genes that are regulated by STAT3 posthepatectomy overlaps with those activated by IL-6. Total RNA was isolated from the control and STAT3 conditional-mutant livers at 2 h posthepatectomy and used for the microarray analysis as described previously (Fig. 5). A smaller number of immediate-early genes were differentially expressed in Alb− STAT3fl/fl liversversus Alb+ STAT3fl/fllivers compared with those differentially expressed in the IL-6+/+ and −/− livers. However, the degree of overlap between the two gene sets was high. Only 1 of 10 STAT3 target genes had not previously been identified as an IL-6 target gene (lymphotoxin receptor). Of the nine IL-6 target genes, six were differentially expressed in the IL-6+/+ and −/− livers posthepatectomy, including c-myc, TNFR2, GADD-45, serine protease inhibitor 2.4, c-fos, and Egr-1. Three did not show IL-6 regulation posthepatectomy but were activated by IL-6 injection in the liver (TDAG51, membrane glycoproteingp130, and Erp72, the endoplasmic reticulum stress protein) (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Egr-1, which was down-regulated in IL-6−/− livers 2 h posthepatectomy, was up-regulated in Alb+ STAT3fl/fllivers, indicating a STAT3-independent activation of Egr-1posthepatectomy. In IL-6−/− livers, abnormalities in the induction and temporal expression of several important immediate-early growth response genes are observed posthepatectomy (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT3 is responsible for activation of these IL-6-regulated genes, we performed Northern analysis using RNA samples isolated from both the Alb+ and Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers at different time points posthepatectomy (Fig. 6 A). As in IL-6−/− livers, c-fos, and junB expression were significantly reduced in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers at all time points compared with Alb− STAT3fl/fl livers. Peak activation of c-myc was delayed in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers compared with Alb− STAT3fl/fl livers.IGFBP-1 is one of the most induced immediate-early genes during liver regeneration. Its activation is in part regulated by IL-6 via direct interaction between STAT3, AP-1, and HNF-1 transcription factors (5Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Leu J.P. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In STAT3 conditional-mutant livers,IGFBP-1 expression is reduced at 2 h posthepatectomy by 2-fold based on the result of three different sets of samples. However, the change is not as great as that seen in the IL-6−/− livers (5Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Leu J.P. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Egr-1 is expressed at a lower level at 2 h posthepatectomy in IL-6−/− livers but a higher level at all time points in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers compared with Alb− STAT3fl/fl livers. We examined the nuclear extracts from the Alb+ and Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers representing early time points posthepatectomy to see whether the c-Fos protein level was reduced in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers as seen in IL-6−/− livers (Fig. 6 B). In Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers, induction of c-Fos was detected as early as 1 h, and there was a peak induction at 2 h posthepatectomy. There was little induction of c-Fos until 4 h posthepatectomy in Alb+ STAT3fl/fllivers. We also examined the level of activated STAT1 protein posthepatectomy using nuclear extracts from the STAT3 conditional-mutant and control livers. The STAT1 protein level was markedly induced in the nucleus of Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers, whereas in control livers there was only a slight increase in the STAT1 level posthepatectomy. This result correlated with the increased STAT1 DNA binding activity in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers posthepatectomy. IL-6−/− livers have defects in G1/S phase transition as manifested by a depressed cyclin D1 expression during regeneration. To understand if STAT3 also plays a role in promoting the G1 to S phase transition of the hepatocytes, we sought to determine whether there is abnormal expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers, especially those expressed during G1 phase progression and at the G1/S transition (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). We examined the protein level of cyclin D1 as well as another G1 phase cyclin, cyclin E, using Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). Cyclin D1 expression was normal at earlier time points during the cell cycle but was reduced at the peak of DNA synthesis (40 h posthepatectomy) and remained low at all later time points in the Alb+ compared with Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers. This observation correlated with that made in IL-6−/− livers. Cyclin E was activated as early as 16 h posthepatectomy in Alb−STAT3fl/fl livers and peaked around 48 h posthepatectomy. In Alb+ STAT3fl/fllivers, the induction of cyclin E was delayed until 32 h posthepatectomy, and the level of expression was lower at later time points compared with that in control livers. The upper band observed in the cyclin E blot (Fig. 7) was most likely the phosphorylated and inactive form of cyclin E. It is unknown whether cyclin E is regulated by IL-6 during liver regeneration because the expression of cyclin E posthepatectomy was not examined in IL-6−/− livers. Evidence suggests a link between STAT activation and cellular proliferation (20Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R.

A number of transformed cell lines as well as samples from human cancers are reported to contain constitutively activated STAT3. Furthermore, a constitutively active form of STAT3 causes cellular transformation in immobilized fibroblasts (26Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). The study reported here is the first in vivo evidence that STAT3 can directly participate in cell cycle progression. STAT3 was required for the activation of several immediate-early genes at the gene expression level including c-fos and junB. These two genes are the most strongly affected immediate-early genes in IL-6−/− livers, and their expression is likely to be directly regulated by STAT3 because their full transactivation requires the STAT binding elements in their promoters (19Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 27Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jonge M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). STAT3 was also necessary for the activation of G1 phase cyclins that support DNA synthesis and mitosis. DNA synthesis posthepatectomy was partially impaired in the absence of STAT3, although mass restoration occurred as in IL-6−/− livers (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Regaining liver mass despite deficient DNA synthesis is a general phenomenon in animal models that are defective in liver regeneration, which most likely results from hypertrophy of hepatocytes despite G1/S arrest (3Cressman D.E.

The results obtained from Alb+STAT3fl/fl are important because they represent the first example of a pro-proliferative role of STAT3 under physiological growth conditions in vivo. The STAT family consists of seven family members, and in vitro they bind to a similar consensus element on the DNA, TTCnnn(n)GAA (31Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 32Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

All of the other STAT knock-outs have relatively mild phenotypes correlated with rather specific defects in response to certain cytokines or growth factors (12Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T.

Furthermore, the tissue-specific distribution of some STATs may also contribute to their functional specificity (45Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The STAT1 knock-out has a specific defect in the interferon-γ response (46Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). STAT1 is the only STAT in addition to STAT3 that is activated during liver regeneration (17Cressman D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of STAT3, STAT1 activation was dramatically increased posthepatectomy, suggesting that normally STAT3 may inhibit STAT1 activation during liver regeneration by unknown mechanisms. In the STAT3 conditional knock-out, we observed that the spectrum of genes in which expression levels are reduced is smaller compared with that seen in the IL-6 knock-out. There could be two reasons for this observation. One is that MAPK contributes to the immediate-early gene induction during liver regeneration. Second, the expression of a subset of STAT3 target genes in the liver might be compensated for by STAT1. The expression of IGFBP-1 is activated by STAT3 in coordination with AP-1 and HNF-1 transcription factors via an HNF-1 binding site during liver regeneration. Its expression level is 2-fold lower in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers than control livers compared with more than 3-fold lower in IL-6−/− livers. It represents a class of STAT3 target genes for which expression may be rescued partially in the presence of STAT1, but further analysis would be required to determine whether STAT1 is able to substitute for STAT3 in binding HNF-1. However, STAT1 activation was not sufficient to compensate for all STAT3 function because disruption of STAT3 still led to down-regulation of several immediate-early genes, and the level of the reduction was comparable with that seen in the IL-6 knock-outs. This is consistent with the previous report that the STAT-binding element in the JunB promoter does not bind or respond to STAT1 (27Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jonge M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated clearly that activation of the MAPK pathway is a key signal for the G1 phase progression of the proliferating hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy (47Talarmin H. Rescan C. Cariou S. Glaise D. Zanninelli G. Bilodeau M. Loyer P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Baffet G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). There are two peaks of MAPK activation during regeneration, one at early G1 and the other during mid-late G1 phase. In rat liver, the second peak of activation occurs around 10.5 h, whereas in mouse liver it is around 24 h posthepatectomy, corresponding to a later S phase onset in the mouse liver. In IL-6−/− livers, the first peak of MAPK activation is delayed until 12 h compared with 2 h posthepatectomy in IL-6+/+ livers; the factor responsible for this activation in the absence of IL-6 is not known (4Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, MAPK activation is normal in Alb+STAT3fl/fl livers during the early time points posthepatectomy, suggesting that IL-6 activation of the MAPK pathway is independent of STAT3 activation. On the other hand, it also suggests that the STAT3 effect on hepatocyte DNA synthesis and cell proliferation is not secondary to direct effects on the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, at the peak of S phase, which is approximately 40 h posthepatectomy in mouse livers, the percentage of hepatocytes undergoing DNA synthesis is 5-fold lower in IL-6−/− livers than IL-6+/+ livers, whereas the difference between the Alb+ and Alb− STAT3fl/fl livers is smaller at about 3-fold. This could be explained by the contribution of the MAPK pathway to hepatocyte proliferation. A certain percentage of IL-6−/− animals die after surgery because of liver necrosis and failure (3Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), whereas Alb+STAT3fl/fl animals were viable after hepatectomy with no signs of liver injury. It is possible that the induction of STAT1 in Alb+ STAT3fl/fl livers can rescue some of the defects caused by lack of STAT3 induction. The MAPK pathway may also play a role in reducing injury and cell death in the liver. Furthermore, there could be other signaling pathways activated by IL-6 that are important for maintaining normal liver cell function during liver re-growth that still await characterization.

About 40 kilograms of nutshell and 4 kilograms of stone were excavated at the Panda 100 site. The data unearthed show that chimpanzees transported stones from outcrops and soils to focal points, where they used them as hammers to process foodstuff. The repeated use of activity areas led to refuse accumulation and site formation. The implications of these data for the interpretation of the earliest hominin archaeological record are explored."

The reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney is a major determinant of the plasma levels of phosphate. Phosphatonin is a hormone-like factor that specifically inhibits phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells. Recent studies on tumor-induced osteomalacia suggested that phosphatonin was potentially identical to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23. However, as purified recombinant FGF-23 could not inhibit phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells, the mechanism of action of FGF-23 remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of action of FGF-23 in cultured renal proximal epithelial cells, opossum kidney cells.

Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The homeostasis of the plasma phosphate level is essential for these processes. The reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney is a major determinant of the plasma phosphate level. Reabsorption is largely regulated by the type II sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporter that is expressed in renal proximal epithelial cells (1Murer H. Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The activity of the type-II Na/Picotransporter is regulated by hormones, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH)1 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), which have opposite effects. PTH and 1,25(OH)2D decrease and increase the reabsorption of phosphate in renal proximal tubules, respectively (1Murer H. Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Tumor-induced osteomalacia is a renal phosphate-wasting disorder resulting in low serum phosphorus concentration and osteomalacia. Removal of the tumors responsible for tumor-induced osteomalacia normalizes phosphate metabolism. The responsible tumors secrete a heat-sensitive molecule of ∼25 kDa designated as “phosphatonin” that specifically inhibits sodium-dependent phosphate transport in cultured renal proximal epithelial cells. Recent studies on tumor-induced osteomalacia revealed that phosphatonin was potentially identical to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, which is a new member of the FGF family (2White K.E.

Autosomal dominant hypophosphataemic rickets is also a renal phosphate-wasting disorder resulting in low serum phosphorus concentration, rickets, and osteomalacia. The ADHR gene was also potentially identified to be FGF-23 with missense mutations (4White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Speer M.C. Econs M.J. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Grabowski M. Meitinger T. Strom T.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). However, as purified recombinant FGF-23 could not inhibit phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T.

A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), the mechanism of action of FGF-23 on the phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of action of FGF-23 on phosphate transport in the cultured renal proximal epithelial cell line, opossum kidney (OK) cells, using purified recombinant FGF-23. The results reported here revealed a novel mechanism of phosphate reabsorption regulated by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediated by FGF signaling. The mouseFGF-23 cDNA with a DNA fragment (75 bp) encoding an E tag (GAPVPYPDPLEPR) and a hexameric His tag (HHHHHH) at the 3′ terminus of the coding region was constructed in a transfer vector,pBacPAK 9 (CLONTECH). Recombinant baculovirus containing the FGF-23 cDNA with the tag sequences was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with recombinant pBacPAK6 and a Bsu36I-digested expression vector, BacPAK6 (CLONTECH), as described (5Yamashita T. Yoshioka M. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). High Five insect cells were transfected with the resultant recombinant baculovirus and infected at 27 °C for 72 h in TC-100 insect medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant mouse FGF-23 was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and desalted by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P6 DG (Bio-Rad Lab) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. OK cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and seeded in 6- or 96-well dishes. The phosphate uptake in OK cells was determined essentially according to the method described previously (6Hafdi Z. Couette S. Comoy E. Prie D. Amiel C. Friedlander G. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). OK cells in monolayers were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 in 24-well dishes. OK cells were further cultured at 37 °C for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 1–10 ng/ml FGF-23 and 10 μg/ml heparin. In the experiments using inhibitors specific for the protein kinases of FGF receptor, SU 5402 (Calbiochem), and for the mitogen-activated protein kinases, PD98059 and SB203580 (Calbiochem), the inhibitors (25 μm SU 5402, 50 μmPD98059, and 10 μm SB203580) were added to the culture medium for 2 h before treatment with FGF-23. The cultured cells were quickly washed with uptake solution containing 137 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) once. Phosphate uptake was initiated by addition of uptake solution supplemented with 0.1 mmKH2PO4/K2H32PO4(1 μCi/ml). The cells were cultured at 37 °C for 5 min. Phosphate uptake was terminated by quickly removing the uptake solution and washing three times with ice-cold stop solution containing 137 mm NaCl and 14 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The cells were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and the cell lysates were used for radioactivity determination with a liquid scintillation counter. RNA was extracted from OK cells in 6-well dishes using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). OK cell cDNA was synthesized in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, a random hexadeoxynucleotide primer, and OK cell RNA as the template. Thetype-II Na/Pi cotransporter cDNA was amplified from the cDNA by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a Model 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems) with a forward primer, reverse primer, and a TaqMan probe specific for opossum type-II Na/Pi cotransportercDNA (8Sorribas V.

Opossum GAPDH cDNA as a control was also amplified with primers for opossum GAPDHcDNA. 2T. Yamashita, M. Konishi, A. Miyake, K. Inui, and N. Itoh, unpublished data. The copy numbers of the type-II Na/Pi cotransporter andGAPDH cDNAs were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. OpossumFGFR-3 cDNA encoding immunoglobulin-like domain III with the surrounding regions was amplified from OK cell cDNA by PCR with primers for mouse FGFR-3 cDNA (9Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S., Xu, J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA was cloned into the pGEM-T DNA vector (Promega). The nucleotide sequences of the clones were determined. Opossum FGFR-3 cDNA encoding immunoglobulin-like domain III with the surrounding regions was amplified from OK cell cDNA by PCR with specific primers as described above. The amplified DNA was digested with MspI followed by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thereafter, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of mouse FGFR-3c with a DNA fragment (75 bp) encoding an E tag and a hexameric His tag at the 3′ terminus of the coding region was constructed in the transfer vector, pBacPAK 9. Recombinant baculovirus containing the FGFR-3c cDNA with the tag sequence was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with recombinantpBacPAK6 and a Bsu36I-digested expression vectorBacPAK6 as described (7Konishi M. Mikami T. Yamasaki M. Miyake A. Itoh N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12119-12122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). High Five insect cells were transfected with the resultant recombinant baculovirus and infected at 27 °C for 72 h in EX-Cell 400 complete medium. The recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR-3c was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose and desalted by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P6 DG in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. OK cells in 6-well dishes were lysed with TNE buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamBiosciences). Phosphorylated ERK or p38-MAPK was detected by Western blotting analysis using rabbit antibodies against phospho-ERK or phospho-p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs). The mouseFGF-23 cDNA with a DNA fragment encoding an E tag and a hexameric His tag at the 3′ terminus was constructed in the baculovirus expression vector. High Five insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus efficiently secreted recombinant FGF-23 as described previously (5Yamashita T. Yoshioka M. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recombinant FGF-23 was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA-agarose. Purified recombinant FGF-23 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by both protein staining and Western blotting analysis with anti-E tag antibodies. Purified recombinant FGF-23 showed a major protein band of ∼30 kDa (data not shown). The observed molecular mass was essentially consistent with the calculated molecular mass of recombinant FGF-23 (28,034 Da). Purified FGF-23 was shown not to inhibit sodium-dependent phosphate uptake in the cultured renal proximal epithelial cell line, OK cells (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). We also examined the ability of FGF-23 to inhibit sodium-dependent phosphate uptake in OK cells by incubation for 3 h with FGF-23. FGF-23 (10 ng/ml) alone could not inhibit phosphate uptake (Fig.1), consistent with the observations reported previously (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). As heparan sulfate or heparin was reported to modulate the activity of several FGFs (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2001; 407: 1029-1034Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar), we examined the inhibitory activity of FGF-23 in the presence of heparin. In the presence of heparin (10 μg/ml), FGF-23 significantly inhibited phosphate uptake (Fig. 1). We also examined the inhibitory activity of FGF-2 in the presence of heparin. However, FGF-2 could not inhibit phosphate uptake (data not shown). FGF-23 rapidly (within ∼1 h) inhibited phosphate uptake, and the extent of inhibition gradually increased thereafter (Fig.2). As the phosphate uptake was mainly mediated by the type II sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporter (8Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effects of FGF-23 on the levels of the type II Na/Picotransporter mRNA in OK cells by real-time quantitative PCR. FGF-23 inhibited phosphate uptake without significant changes in thetype II Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA levels within 3 h (Fig. 2). These results indicated that FGF-23 inhibits phosphate uptake by regulation of the type-II Na/Picotransporter activity at the posttranscriptional level, at least in the short term (∼ 3 h). FGFs exert their activity by binding to FGFRs. There are four types of FGFRgene, FGFR-1, -2, -3, and-4 (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Renal proximal epithelial cells were shown to preferentially express FGFR-3 (10Cancilla B. Davies A. Cauchi J.A. Risbridger G.P. Bertram J.F. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression of FGFR-3 in OK cells. By alternative splicing of the immunoglobulin-like domain III of FGFR-3, two isoforms ofFGFR-3, FGFR-3b and FGFR-3c, can be generated (9Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S., Xu, J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the opossum FGFR3 gene has not been identified, we attempted to amplify opossum FGFR-3 cDNA including the alternative splicing region of the immunoglobulin-like domain III by PCR using OK cell cDNA as a template and primers corresponding to the sequences conserved in mouse and humanFGFR-3 cDNA (9Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S., Xu, J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA of the expected size (∼470 bp) was amplified. The amplified DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the nucleotide sequences of more than 20 clones were determined. Two different amino acid sequences were predicted from their nucleotide sequences. The sequences of major and minor clones were highly similar to those of mouse FGFR-3c and -3b (9Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S., Xu, J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 3), indicating that FGFR-3c was expressed as the major isoform of FGFR-3 in OK cells. To confirm this, the amplified DNA was digested with MspI followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Digestion of the amplified FGFR-3b and -3c cDNAs withMspI should yield two DNA fragments of 385 and 90 bp and three DNA fragments of 276, 103, and 90 bp, respectively. The results of MspI-digestion also indicated that FGFR-3c was the major isoform of FGFR-3 expressed in OK cells (Fig.4).Figure 4Expression of FGFR-3b and-3c mRNAs in OK cells. Opossum FGFR-3 cDNA including the alternative splicing region of immunoglobulin-like domain III was amplified by PCR using OK cell cDNA as a template. The amplified DNA was digested withMspI. The digest was fractionated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The numbers indicated by arrows show the sizes of DNA fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether FGF-23 could bind to FGFR-3c, the recombinant extracellular domain of mouse FGFR-3c was prepared. We examined the binding of FGF-23 to the extracellular domain of FGFR-3c by the Biacore system with the FGF-23 fixed sensor tip in the absence of heparin. In contrast to bovine serum albumin as a control (data not shown), the typical binding and dissociation curves of FGF-23 were observed, indicating that the binding was highly specific (Fig. 5). The equilibrium dissociation was also determined. FGF-23 was found to bind to the extracellular domain with high affinity (Fig. 5). We also examined the binding of FGF-23 to the extracellular domains of FGFR-1c and FGFR-2c. FGF-23 was found to bind to FGFR-2c but not to FGFR-1c (data not shown). SU 5402 is an inhibitor specific for protein kinases of FGFR but not for those of other receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor (11Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). SU 5402 is a specific competitor for the ATP-binding site of FGFR. As FGF-23 was found to bind to FGFR-3c with high affinity, we examined whether the inhibition of phosphate uptake by FGF-23 was mediated through the protein kinase activity of FGFR. SU 5402 completely blocked the inhibitory activity of FGF-23, indicating the involvement of activation of the protein kinases of FGFR in inhibition of phosphate uptake by FGF-23 (Fig. 6). The major intracellular signaling pathway of FGF was shown to be the Ras/MAPK pathway (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of FGF-23 on phosphorylation of MAPKs, ERK, and p38 MAPK in OK cells by Western blotting analysis using antibodies against phospho-ERK and phospho-p38 MAPK. FGF-23 was found to significantly induce phosphorylation of both ERK and p38 MAPK (Fig.7). We also examined the effects of FGF-2 on phosphorylation of MAPKs in OK cells. In contrast to FGF-23, FGF-2 was found to significantly induce phosphorylation of ERK but not that of p38 MAPK (Fig. 7). To examine the functional relevance of the activation of MAPKs, we examined the effects of MAPK inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580, on the inhibition of phosphate uptake in OK cells by FGF-23. PD98059 and SB203580 are specific inhibitors of the upstream kinases of ERK and p38 MAPK (13Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnel P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J.

PD98059 and SB203580 were confirmed to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK in OK cells induced by FGF-23 (Fig. 7). PD98059 and SB203580 also completely blocked the inhibition of phosphate uptake by FGF-23, indicating the involvement of the Ras/MAPK pathway in the inhibition of the phosphate uptake by FGF-23 (Fig. 6). Administration of FGF-23 decreased serum phosphate level in mice (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium containing FGF-23 inhibited sodium-dependent phosphate uptake in OK cells (15Bowe A.E. Finnegan R. Jan de Beur S.M. Cho J. Levine M.A. Kumar R. Schiavi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These results indicated that FGF-23 lowers serum phosphorus concentration by inhibition of phosphate reabsorption in renal epithelial cells. However, purified recombinant FGF-23 could not inhibit the phosphate uptake in OK cells (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indicated that FGF-23 might require other molecule(s) for the activity or further processing to the biologically active form. We prepared purified recombinant FGF-23 produced by the baculovirus expression system and examined the activity of FGF-23. As expected, FGF-23 alone could not inhibit phosphate uptake in OK cells. However, FGF-23 with heparin was found to significantly inhibit phosphate uptake, indicating that heparin-like molecules are essential for the activity of FGF-23. In contrast, FGF-2 could not inhibit phosphate uptake; the inhibitory activity was specific for FGF-23. FGF-23 rapidly (within ∼1 h) inhibited phosphate uptake in OK cells, and then the inhibition increased gradually thereafter. The phosphate uptake in OK cells was shown to be mainly mediated by the type II Na/Pi cotransporter (8Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the levels of thetype II Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA were essentially unchanged during the rapid inhibition (∼3 h), indicating that the inhibition of phosphate uptake by FGF-23 was regulated at the posttranscriptional level. PTH is a hormone that regulates the plasma levels of phosphate by inhibition of the reabsorption of phosphate in renal proximal tubules. PTH also rapidly inhibited phosphate uptake in OK cells. PTH inhibited phosphate uptake by leading to removal of the type II Na/Pi cotransporter from the apical membrane and to its subsequent degradation (17Murer H. Biber A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rapid inhibition by FGF-23 was also expected to be regulated by removal of the type II Na/Pi cotransporter from the apical membrane. PTH binds to PTH receptors on the surface membranes of target cells. The occupied receptors interact with guanyl nucleotide-regulated membrane-bound proteins that in turn activate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP is one of the intracellular second messengers that may be responsible for the action of PTH (18Chase L.R. Aurbach G.D. Science. 1968; 159: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast phosphatonin, FGF-23, was shown not to increase cAMP formation in renal epithelial cells, indicating that phosphatonin, FGF-23, inhibited phosphate transport via a cAMP-independent mechanism (20Kumar R. Bone. 2000; 27: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. FGFs exert their activity by binding to FGFRs (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are four types of FGFR gene, FGFR-1 to FGFR-4. Although the rat kidney expresses all four FGFRs, renal proximal epithelial cells were shown to preferentially express FGFR-3 (10Cancilla B. Davies A. Cauchi J.A. Risbridger G.P. Bertram J.F.

By alternative splicing, two isoforms of FGFR-3, FGFR-3b and FGFR-3c, could be generated (9Chellaiah A.T. McEwen D.G. Werner S., Xu, J. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the isoforms of FGFR-3 expressed in OK cells. The major isoform of FGFR-3 expressed in OK cells was found to be FGFR-3c. We also examined the binding of FGF-23 to the extracellular domain of FGFR-3c by the Biacore system in the absence of heparin. Our results indicated that FGF-23 bound to the extracellular domain of FGFR-3c with high affinity. Therefore, we expected that FGF-23 exerted its activity by binding to FGFR-3c expressed in OK cells. FGF-23 could bind to FGFR-3c in the absence of heparin. However, FGF-23 could inhibit phosphate uptake in the presence of heparin but not in the absence of heparin. Therefore, heparin-like molecules appear to be essential for activation of FGFR-3c by FGF-23 but not for FGF-23 binding to FGFR-3c. FGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases that have intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and elicit tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptors (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An inhibitor specific for protein kinases of FGFR, SU 5402, blocked the inhibitory activity of FGF-23. These findings indicated that FGF-23 inhibited the phosphate uptake by activation of FGFR-3c. The major intracellular signaling pathway of FGF was shown to be the Ras/MAPK pathway (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Suzuki A. Guicheux J. Palmer G. Miura Y. Oiso Y. Bonjour J.-P. Caverzasio J. Bone. 2002; 30: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway and the p38 pathway are major components of the MAPK pathway. The ERK pathway generally plays roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, while the p38 pathway plays roles in cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and differentiation. FGF-23 was found to significantly phosphorylate both ERK and p38 MAPK. An inhibitor of ERK, PD98059, and an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, were also found to block the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK and inhibition of phosphate uptake by FGF-23. These results indicated that FGF-23 inhibited phosphate uptake in OK cells by activation of the MAPK pathway. FGF-2 was shown to bind to most of FGFRs including FGFR-3c (21Ornitz D.M. Jingsong X. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). We also found that FGF-2 could bind to FGFR-3c by the Biacore system.2 However, FGF-2 could not inhibit phosphate uptake even in the presence of heparin. Furthermore, FGF-2 was found to significantly induce phosphorylation of ERK but not that of p38 MAPK. These results also indicated that activation of both the ERK pathway and p38 MAPK pathway by FGF-23 was essential for inhibition of phosphate uptake in OK cells. FGFs are local signaling molecules. FGFs exert their activity by binding to FGFRs in an autocrine/paracrine manner (12Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However,FGF-23 mRNA expression was not detected in the kidney (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, FGF-23 might be a hormone-like-signaling molecule. Although a variety of benign mesenchymal tumors were shown to abundantly express FGF-23, FGF-23 was barely detectable in normal tissues (3Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 4White K.E. Evans W.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Speer M.C.

Commun. 2000; 277: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological significance of FGF-23 remains to be elucidated. In summary, the present study showed that (i) heparin-like molecules are essential for the activity of FGF-23, (ii) FGF-23 could bind to and activate FGFR-3c expressed in renal proximal epithelial cells, and (iii) activation of FGFR and the MAPK pathway was essential for the inhibitory activity. The present findings have revealed a novel MAPK-dependent mechanism of the regulation of phosphate uptake by FGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2094820542,"A quartz-pyroxene rock interpreted as a banded iron formation (BIF) from the island of Akilia, southwest Greenland, contains (13)C-depleted graphite that has been claimed as evidence for the oldest (>3850 million years ago) life on Earth. Field relationships on Akilia document multiple intense deformation events that have resulted in parallel transposition of Early Archean rocks and significant boudinage, the tails of which commonly form the banding in the quartz-pyroxene rock. Geochemical data possess distinct characteristics consistent with an ultramafic igneous, not BIF, protolith for this lithology and the adjacent schists. Later metasomatic silica and iron introduction have merely resulted in a rock that superficially resembles a BIF. An ultramafic igneous origin invalidates claims that the carbon isotopic composition of graphite inclusions represents evidence for life at the time of crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W2072304361,"In the course of gene array studies aimed at identifying IFN-stimulated genes associated with interferon β (IFN-β)-induced apoptosis, we identified X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor-1 (XAF1) as a novel IFN-stimulated gene. XAF1 mRNA was up-regulated by IFN-α and IFN-β in all cells examined. However, IFNs induced high levels of XAF1 protein predominantly in cell lines sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of IFN-β. In apoptosis-resistant cells including WM164 melanoma, WM35 melanoma, U937 pro-monocytic leukemia, and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, XAF1 mRNA was strongly up-regulated but XAF1 protein was up-regulated only weakly or not at all. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a critical mediator of IFN-β-induced apoptosis, but most melanoma cell lines were resistant to recombinant TRAIL protein. For example, A375 melanoma cells were defective in TRAIL induction by IFN-β and were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, IFN-β pretreatment sensitized them to subsequent recombinant TRAIL-induced apoptosis. A375 cells expressing XAF1 constitutively were more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with empty vector-transfected cells. The degree of sensitization by XAF1 was similar to that provided by IFN pretreatment and was correlated with the level of XAF1 expressed. Furthermore, the overexpression of the zinc-finger portion of XAF1 blocked IFN-dependent sensitization of A375 melanoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL.

De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). All of the IFNs increase the abundance or affect the activities of specific effector proteins encoded by subsets of early response genes known collectively as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), the protein products of which mediate physiological responses to IFNs (2Hovanessian A.G.

Many ISGs were identified initially as differentially regulated mRNA species rather than on the basis of their biological functions (see Refs. 2Hovanessian A.G. J.

At least 100 ISGs induced by IFN-α or IFN-β have been identified to date (1De Maeyer E. De Maeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines.

IFNs also have potent antigrowth effects on most cell types, and the identities of the ISGs that regulate antiproliferative or proapoptotic effects have begun to emerge. IFN-β but not IFN-α induced apoptosis in a broad range of solid tumor cell types (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar). TRAIL was an important regulator of the IFN-dependent apoptotic process in melanoma (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar) and myeloma cell lines (12Chen Q. Gong B. Zhou A. His E. Hussein M. Almasan A.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar), exogenous recombinant TRAIL protein alone was a poor proapoptotic agent in melanoma cells (16Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: S966-S973PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other ISGs may contribute to the IFN-dependent apoptotic process. Counteracting cellular apoptotic processes are factors involved in preventing unregulated cell suicide, the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). First identified in baculoviruses where they function to prevent the death of infected host cells, at least six human IAPs have since been described, XIAP/hILP, NAIP, c-IAP1/HIAP-2, c-IAP2/HIAP-1, Survivin, and BRUCE (17Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). XIAP is expressed in all adult and fetal tissues with the exception of peripheral blood leukocytes (18Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). XIAP binds directly to caspases via one or more of its baculovirus inhibitory repeat domains and may function as a competitive inhibitor of caspase catalytic function (19Deveraux Q.L. Stennicke H.L. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The constitutive and induced expression of IAPs blocked caspase activity (19Deveraux Q.L. Stennicke H.L. Salvesen G.S.

IAPs themselves were regulated by cellular proteins including Smac/Diablo, a mitochondrial protein that was released into the cytoplasm inhibiting IAP function and allowing the caspase-dependent cleavage of substrates (21Du C.

XIAP has recently been implicated in conferring resistance to TRAIL in melanoma cells (24Zhang X.D. Zhang X.Y. Gray C.P. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7339-7348PubMed Google Scholar), and the inhibition of XIAP activity may be an obligatory component of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (25Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid studies identified a XIAP-interacting protein designated XIAP-associated factor-1 (XAF1) (26Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St. Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). XAF1 was a novel 317-amino acid protein with a N-terminal zinc-finger (ZF) domain (amino acids 1–178). The cellular association of XAF1 with XIAP was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and in situ co-localization studies (27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The incubation of recombinant XIAP with caspase-3 in the absence or presence of XAF1 demonstrated that XAF1 blocked the inhibitory activity of XIAP for caspase-3, and co-expression of XAF1 and XIAP inhibited XIAP-dependent caspase-3 suppression (27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). XAF1 was implicated as a tumor suppressor based on the observation that expression was lower in tumor cell lines compared with some normal tissues and that transient expression of XAF1 sensitized tumor cells to the proapoptotic effects of etoposide (26Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St. Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that IFN can sensitize cells to the proapoptotic effects of recombinant TRAIL (28Kumar-Sinha C. Varambally S. Sreekumar A. Chinnaiyan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 575-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of XAF1 as a novel type I IFN-induced protein that correlates with the cellular sensitivity to IFN-β-induced apoptosis and contributes to IFN-β-dependent sensitization of cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The full-length XAF1 cDNA expression vector pcDNAhaX20 has been described previously (27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and encodes XAF1 as a fusion protein with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. A 300-bp portion of the XAF1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 in an antisense orientation to serve as a control in stable transfection experiments. Stable transfections were performed by electroporation, and stable transfectants were selected in 500 μg/ml (Hela and A375 cell lines) or 50 μg/ml (WM9 cells) G418. An expression plasmid encoding the XAF1 zinc-finger region (amino acids 1–178) expressed in-frame with a N-terminal HA epitope was created by PCR amplification of the XAF1 zinc-finger domain followed by ligation into plasmid pcDNAha from which the full-length XAF1 cDNA had been excised. RNA was isolated from cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer specifications. XAF1 mRNA was detected by Northern blotting of total cellular RNA using a full-length XAF1 cDNA probe liberated from pcDNAhaX20 with EcoRI andXhoI. Alternatively, XAF1 mRNA was detected by using reverse transcriptase (RT)-coupled PCR. Total cellular RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Promega) and random hexamer primers (42 °C for 60 min). One-tenth of the RT reaction was subjected to PCR analysis using XAF1-specific primers (5′-GAGCACCAGCAGGTTGGGTG-3′ and 5′-AATCATTTGGTTGCAATAAT-3′). PCR products were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Gel images were captured on a digital camera, and the images inverted to give a dark band on a light background for presentation. XAF1 protein was detected in total cell lysate lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) by probing Western blots with an XAF1-specific monoclonal antibody. This antibody was generated against full-length GST-XAF1 following standard techniques and recognized a reactive band at ∼35 kDa when used at a 1:500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). XIAP was detected by using commercially available polyclonal antisera (Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc.), and actin was detected by using monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by using Annexin V staining (BD PharMingen) followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The cells were left untreated or were treated with IFN-β for 72 h. After that time, the cells were harvested and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide. Percent Annexin V-positive and Annexin V/propidium iodide double-positive cells were estimated by using FACS-STAR software on a FACS Vantage cell scanner (BD PharMingen). Recombinant TRAIL (Peprotech, Inc.) was applied to cells at doses ranging from 20–100 ng/ml (depending on the experiment) for 24 h prior to assess apoptosis by Annexin V staining. For co-treatment studies, IFN-β was added to cells for 24 h prior to the addition of TRAIL, and the cells cultured for an additional 24 h before the assessment of apoptosis (48 h total). In these studies, the controls included cells left untreated for 48 h, cells treated with IFN for 24 h and then left untreated for an additional 24 h, and cells left untreated for 24 h and then treated for 24 h with TRAIL. After that time, the cells were stained with sulforhodamine B to detect living cells. A375 melanoma cells were left untreated or were treated with 500 units/ml IFN-β for 24 h and then fractionated into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions as described previously (30Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. Protocols. 1998; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The nuclei were isolated from cells by incubation in nuclear extraction buffer (320 mmsucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) until cell membranes were completely disrupted as determined by trypan blue staining. The lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min and washed twice in a nuclear wash (320 mm sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The nuclei were then solubilized in lysis buffer (as described above) on ice for 15 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. For mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were incubated in mitochondrial isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 15 min followed by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was additionally centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet and the supernatant from the high speed spin represented the mitochondrial and the cytosolic fractions, respectively. Lysis buffer was added to the mitochondrial pellet for 15 min on ice, and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Three independent Affymetrix oligonucleotide array studies assessing genes induced by IFNs in melanoma cells established XAF1 as an ISG whose expression was regulated by both IFN-α and IFN-β. 2D. W. Leaman, M. Chawla-Sarkar, K. Vyas, and E. C. Borden, unpublished observations. To confirm the gene array results, Northern blot analyses were performed to examine XAF1 mRNA expression in WM9 melanoma cells. XAF1 mRNA was not detected in untreated cells but was induced following treatment with IFN-β and IFN-α (Fig. 1 A). The induction of XAF1 protein by both IFNs was confirmed in WM9 cell lysates by using a XAF1-specific monoclonal antibody. XAF1 protein was undetectable in untreated cells but was induced within 24 h of IFN stimulation and sustained through 72 h (Fig. 1 B). Compared with IFN-α, XAF1 protein was induced to a substantially greater extent by IFN-β (Fig. 1 B). Although less potently, XAF1 mRNA was also up-regulated by IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 2). No other stimulus including epidermal growth factor, serum addition or withdrawal, camptothecin, TRAIL, or interleukin-6 induced XAF1 mRNA above basal levels (Fig. 2 and data not shown).Figure 2Induction of XAF1 mRNA by various stimuli. WM9 cells were left untreated or treated for 8 h with IFN-β (500 units/ml) or IFB-γ (500 units/ml), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (50 ng/ml), recombinant human TRAIL (50 ng/ml), or camptothecin (5 μm). Alternatively, cells were serum-starved overnight (0.1% serum) and then cultured in 10% serum for 8 h or were serum-deprived for 24 h prior to RNA isolation (serum withdrawal). Total cellular RNA was isolated, and 20 μg from each sample separated on a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. XAF1 was detected by hybridization with a full-length XAF1 cDNA probe.

In all melanoma cell lines, XAF1 mRNA was either absent or present constitutively at low levels and was induced by both IFN-α2 and IFN-β with the exception of WM164 cells in which only IFN-β induced XAF1 mRNA (Fig.3 A). When XAF1 protein was assessed, all of the apoptosis-sensitive melanoma lines including WM9, WM3211, FEMX, and Guilliams exhibited strong up-regulation of the XAF1 protein that was sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 3 B) (Table I and data not shown). In contrast, apoptosis-resistant WM35 cells exhibited minimal XAF1 protein induction by IFN-β (Fig. 3 B) that was detected only following long exposure with higher concentrations of antibody and cell extract (data not shown). Similarly, apoptosis-resistant WM164 and SKMEL28 melanoma cells displayed weak or transient induction (Fig.3 B and Table I). XAF1 protein was induced strongly in A375 melanoma cells (Fig. 3 B). A375 cells were shown previously to be resistant to IFN-β-induced apoptosis because of the lack of TRAIL induction by IFN-β (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of both XAF1 and TRAIL, but not either one independently, correlated with IFN-β-induced apoptosis in melanoma cell lines (Table I). Although the loss of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 has been implicated in melanoma cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, all of the melanoma cell lines used in these studies expressed apoptotic protease activating factor 1 protein (data not shown). The XAF1 protein expression was assessed in a panel of tumor cell lines representing different tumor types. OVCAR3 ovarian carcinoma, U266 myeloma, and ACHN renal cell carcinoma exhibited potent up-regulation of XAF1 protein and TRAIL induction and underwent IFN-β-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the tumor lines resistant to IFN-β-induced apoptosis including HeLa cervical carcinoma, K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia, HT080 fibrosarcoma, and others exhibited IFN-dependent XAF1 mRNA up-regulation, but protein induction was weak or undetectable (Table I).Table IXAF1 and TRAIL induction correlates with IFN-induced apoptosisTumor typeCell lineBasal XAF1 protein1-aBasal and induced expression levels of XAF1 protein were assessed by using Western blot analysis with the mAb described in this paper.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether XAF1 overexpression could mimic IFN-dependent sensitization of cells to the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL, a XAF1 expression plasmid was transfected into WM9, A375 melanoma, and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and stable transfectants selected in G418. Each cell line was also stably transfected in parallel with pcDNA3.1 empty vector and separately with a XAF1 antisense plasmid. The antisense plasmid included only 300 bp of the XAF1-coding region and did not influence endogenous XAF1 protein levels (data not shown) but served as an additional negative control. The XAF1 expression plasmid encoded an influenza HA/XAF1 fusion protein to allow the distinction of the exogenously expressed protein from the endogenous protein. A375 cells formed G418-resistant stable colonies following transfection with all three of the aforementioned plasmids. In contrast, WM9 cells readily formed stable colonies with the empty vector or antisense controls but few colonies with the XAF1 sense expression plasmid (Fig.4 A). Most of the colonies that formed within the XAF1 sense-transfected cultures did not progress beyond the 10-cell stage at which point they underwent a death process resembling apoptosis (Fig. 4 A). Similar observations were made with HeLa where few XAF1 stable transfectants survived G418 selection. XAF1 sense plasmid-transfected WM9 or HeLa cells that survived G418 selection did not express constitutively the XAF1 protein (Fig. 4 B). An analysis of haXAF1 protein expression in individual A375 clones selected from the stably transfected population demonstrated that fewer than 50% of the clones expressed XAF1 constitutively (Fig.5 A and data not shown). Thus, three clones with varying levels of constitutive haXAF1 protein expression were selected for further analysis. A375/XAF1 clone 7 expressed high constitutive levels of HA-tagged XAF1, whereas clone 1 exhibited lower constitutive expression (Fig. 5 A,upper band). Clone 2 was resistant to G418 but did not express haXAF1 constitutively (Fig. 5 A). All of the three clones exhibited normal up-regulation of endogenous XAF1 in response to IFN-β (Fig. 5 A, lower band) and TRAIL receptor (DR4 and DR5) expression levels were not significantly different among the three clonal lines (data not shown). The sensitivity of the haXAF1-expressing clones to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was initially examined by using Annexin V staining. Unlike empty vector-transfected cells, XAF1-transfected clones 1 and 7 expressing medium and high levels of XAF1, respectively, displayed potent sensitivity to TRAIL as a single agent (Fig. 5 B). Clone 2, which did not express XAF1 protein constitutively, had a phenotype identical to untransfected or empty vector-transfected A375 (Fig. 5 B). All of the three clones exhibited IFN-β-dependent sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and this process was enhanced in clones 1 and 7 (Fig. 5 B). These apoptosis studies were extended to include an assessment of TRAIL-dependent cell killing in the XAF1-transfected clones. Whereas clone 2 was resistant to TRAIL at doses <100 ng/ml, clones 1 and 7 were both sensitive to TRAIL at doses as low as 20 ng/ml, which killed >80% of cells within 24 h (Fig.5 C). A direct implication of XAF1 function in IFN-dependent sensitization of cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was obtained by overexpressing the zinc-finger region of XAF1 (amino acids 1–178). This region has been implicated in XAF1 self-association, whereas the C-terminal region has been implicated in other biological functions. 3K. Tamai and S. Toji, unpublished observations. It was hypothesized that overexpression of the zinc-finger domain would inhibit downstream XAF1 functions that depend on XAF1 self-association or interaction with other proteins. Indeed, A375 melanoma cell clones constitutively expressing the XAF1 ZF domain, exhibited dramatically reduced (Fig. 6, ZF Cl.2) or complete ablation (ZF Cl.1 and ZF Cl.5) of IFN-dependent sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis that was observed in parental A375 cells. The degree of inhibition was correlated with the level of XAF1 ZF domain expression (Fig. 6 A) and was apparent in both cell growth assays (Fig.6 B) and Annexin V apoptosis assays (Fig. 6 C). The overexpression of XAF1 fragments not encompassing the zinc-finger domain had no effect on IFN-induced sensitization to TRAIL (data not shown). 4M. Reheman and D. W. Leaman, unpublished observations. Endogenous XAF1 protein was up-regulated normally in response to IFN-β treatment in all of the ZF XAF1 expressing clones examined (Fig.6 A). XAF1 has been reported to reside in the nucleus based on the results obtained by using XAF1/green fluorescent protein fusion proteins (26Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St. Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of the endogenous XAF1 protein following IFN stimulation, cell fractionation studies were performed. Cells were left untreated or treated with IFN-β for 24 h, lysed, and separated into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions (30Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. Protocols. 1998; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Equivalent protein amounts from each fraction were assessed for XAF1 by Western blot analysis. XAF1 was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus but was absent from the mitochondria (Fig.7). Stimulation with IFN-β plus TRAIL did not alter XAF1 distribution (data not shown). 5D. W. Leaman and K. Vyas, unpublished observations. The IFN-β-dependent induction of XAF1 did not alter the subcellular localization of XIAP, which remained predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 7). IFNs have potent antiviral and antiproliferative activities and have been the most effective cytokine for treating human malignancies. Despite the >20 years that IFNs have been known to be effective as antitumor proteins (31Borden E.C. Parkinson D. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar), little progress has been made in dissecting the roles of the >100 IFN-stimulated gene products in inducing the cytotoxic effects of IFNs. Most ISGs are induced by IFNs in all cell types. However, substantial variability has been identified in the overall sensitivity of tumor cells to the antiproliferative or apoptotic effects of IFNs (11 and references therein). A better understanding of the molecular determinants of tumor cell sensitivity to IFNs could lead to increased therapeutic potential. Through gene expression-profiling studies in WM9 melanoma cells that are preferentially sensitive to IFN-β compared with IFN-α2,TRAIL was identified as an ISG that was necessary but not sufficient to mediate IFN-β-induced apoptosis (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar). The neutralization of TRAIL activity blocked IFN-induced apoptosis (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar), but most of the cell lines examined did not apoptose in response to TRAIL as a single agent (Figs. 5 and 6) (29Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAIL induction by IFN correlated poorly with IFN-induced apoptosis. TRAIL was induced in many cell lines that did not undergo apoptosis (29Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, additional factors either present constitutively or IFN-induced were postulated to be required to sensitize cells to IFN or synergize with TRAIL to stimulate an apoptotic response. Additional gene profiling experiments implicated XAF1 as a potent ISG induced in a variety of cell types including melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia and endothelial cells. 6D. W. Leaman, M. Chawla-Sarkar, and E. C. Borden, unpublished observations. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that XAF1 was a potent ISG induced at the transcriptional level by IFNs (Fig. 1). XAF1 mRNA was induced by IFN in nearly all of the cell lines examined and therefore did not correlate with IFN-induced apoptosis. However, XAF1 protein induction by IFN-β was strongly correlated with the proapoptotic effects of IFN-β. XAF1 protein was induced strongly in all of the cell lines that underwent IFN-β-induced apoptosis but was not in resistant cells except where the other components of the apoptotic machinery were defective (Table I). Two clear examples of this correlation were WM35 and WM9 melanoma cells. WM9 were highly sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of IFN-β, and XAF1 protein was strongly up-regulated by IFN-β. In contrast, WM35 cells were resistant to IFN-β-induced apoptosis, and although XAF1 mRNA was up-regulated by IFN, little or no XAF1 protein was detected (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, XAF1 induction alone was clearly insufficient to activate apoptosis in A375 cells that lacked TRAIL induction by IFN but exhibited potent XAF1 protein up-regulation by IFN (Table I). By using A375 clones stably expressing haXAF1 protein at different constitutive levels, the amount of XAF1 expression was correlated with cellular sensitivity to TRAIL. Clones that constitutively expressed ectopic haXAF1 protein at levels comparable to those observed with the endogenous protein following IFN-treatment such as clone 7 were as sensitive to TRAIL as a single agent as the cells pretreated with IFN (Fig. 5 B). Clones resistant to G418 but expressing no exogenous XAF1 behaved identically to parental A375 cells. These data, combined with the observation that apoptosis-resistant cell lines such as WM35 melanoma and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells expressed TRAIL but little or no XAF1 protein in response to IFN-β stimulation, suggest that both TRAIL and XAF1 are required for cells to undergo apoptosis in response to IFN-β as a single agent. The mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic functions of XAF1 are unknown, although its interaction with XIAP probably via the zinc-finger region appears to be critical. The overexpression of the zinc-finger domain blocked IFN-β-dependent sensitization of cells to the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL (Fig. 6). This overexpression may block the dimerization of the endogenous XAF1 protein or inhibit its interaction with downstream substrates such as XIAP. The dominant negative effect was dependent upon the level of ZF XAF1 expression (Fig. 6). These data support the hypothesis that XAF1 induction by IFN-β contributes to the sensitization of cells to the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL. IAPs have been increasingly recognized as critical regulators of cellular apoptotic processes (19Deveraux Q.L. Stennicke H.L. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although initially thought to play a primary role in mediating NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic function, constitutive IAP activity has been recognized as an important determinant of cellular viability. Inhibitors of IAP activity, particularly Smac/Diablo, have been viewed as essential for normal function of apoptotic caspase cascades (21Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 22Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Although XAF1 has little structural similarity with Smac/Diablo, it may have a similar physiological function once induced by IFNs (20Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A recent report suggested that XAF1 functions by sequestering XIAP to the nucleus, thereby inactivating this critical IAP and allowing caspase cascades to proceed unabated (27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Our own cell fractionation studies were partially consistent with this possibility, because XAF1 was localized in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 7). However, unlike the previous studies performed with XAF/green fluorescent protein and XIAP/green fluorescent protein fusion proteins (27Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), no re-distribution of XIAP occurred in cells overexpressing XAF1 in response to IFN-β (Fig. 7). Thus, additional studies are needed to address the mechanism of XAF1-dependent inhibition of XIAP. In summary, IFN-induced apoptosis appeared to require the induction of at least two proteins, TRAIL and XAF1. Whereas TRAIL induction was previously shown to be necessary for IFN-induced apoptosis based on antibody neutralization experiments (11Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Borden E.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1821-1831PubMed Google Scholar), it was also found to be insufficient as a single agent to induce apoptosis in most melanoma cell lines (16Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: S966-S973PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kumar-Sinha C. Varambally S. Sreekumar A. Chinnaiyan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 575-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Chawla-Sarkar M. Leaman D.W. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). XAF1 protein was more directly correlated with IFN-induced apoptosis, because it was induced only in cells that exhibited IFN-induced apoptosis (Table I). More importantly, the overexpression of XAF1 was shown here to augment sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, and a truncated XAF1 could inhibit IFN-dependent sensitization of cells to TRAIL. Thus, IFN-induced apoptosis may minimally require the induction of TRAIL to initiate caspase-dependent apoptotic cascades and induction of XAF1 to inhibit IAP function, thereby allowing caspase cleavage events to proceed unabated. Whether other IFN-induced proteins are also required for IFN-regulated apoptosis and whether IFN-induced XAF1 plays important regulatory functions in other ligand-dependent apoptotic responses remain to be determined.

Thioredoxin family proteins share a conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif at their active center and play important roles in control of cellular redox state and protection against oxidative damage. In addition to the well studied cytosolic and extracellular form (Trx1), rat and avian mitochondrial forms of thioredoxin (mtTrx) have been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length human mtTrx cDNA and performed localization and functional studies in 143B human osteosarcoma cells. The coding sequence of human mtTrx consists of a region with homology to Trx1 as well as a putative mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) at its N terminus. In stably transfected cell lines, mtTrx had a mitochondrial localization as measured by subcellular fractionation studies and by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Deletion of the MLS rendered mtTrx to be solely expressed in the cytosolic fraction. On SDS-PAGE, transfected mtTrx had the same apparent molecular weight as the MLS truncated form, indicating that the leader sequence is cleaved during or after mitochondrial import. Treatment with the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide induced apoptosis in 143B cells. This oxidant-induced apoptosis was inhibited by overexpressing the full-length mtTrx in 143B cells.

Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The reversible oxidation/reduction in the active center enables Trx to transfer electrons to protein disulfide substrates. Two other components, thioredoxin reductase (TR) and NADPH, reduce the oxidized Trx and complete Trx cycling (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the presence of TR and NADPH, Trx mediates rapid and reversible disulfide-thiol exchange of dithiol motifs in protein substrates. Although Trx was originally identified as an electron donor of ribonucleotide reductase, a wide range of other biological functions have been characterized based on its redox capability (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Trx is implicated in apoptosis regulation through two different mechanisms: 1) scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect against oxidative stress (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and 2) direct binding and inhibiting the activity of the proapoptotic protein apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (2Saitoh M.

Like its cytosolic homolog, mtTrx can reduce insulin in vitro, suggesting that proteins share similar biological properties (10Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol.

This is further supported by the recent finding that chicken cells lacking mtTrx showed increased spontaneous apoptosis and were more sensitive to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (9Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Udea S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).In this study, we cloned the human mtTrx and determined that it is specifically localized in mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed the existence of two forms of human mtTrx mRNA and demonstrated that it is widely expressed in human tissues. The two forms of the mtTrx transcript differ in the 3′-untranslated region. Finally, stable overexpression of human mtTrx in 143B osteosarcoma cells protected cells from cell death induced by the chemical oxidanttert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH). These data suggest that the mtTrx system may represent an important defense mechanism that functions in mitochondria to protect against oxidative stress and apoptosis.DISCUSSIONTrx exists in more than one form in diverse species and shows compartmentalized distribution in higher organisms (4Miranda-Vizuete A.

The shorter one is in good agreement with the recently updated mtTrx sequence (GenBankTM accession no. NM-056182), except that it lacks the last 12 nucleotides. The longer one has an additional 330 bp 3′ downstream of the previous sequence and contains the consensus polyadenylation signal “AAUAAA” and “CA” at the very 3′ end. No such signal exists in the shorter cDNA fragments, raising a question considering which is the correct in vivotranscript. One possibility is that both transcripts could exist and that an alternative polyadenylation signal is used for the short cDNA sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that two bands were present in some tissues and that the molecular weights were close to those of the two cDNA fragments achieved from RACE, 1.34 and 1.01 kb respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that the two mRNA species are both likely to exist in vivo.Tissue distribution studies show a very generalized distribution in all tissues with a high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. These results are consistent with Northern blot analyses of mtTrx distribution in rat (10Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) in which high expression occurs in tissues with high energy demand. Because of the association of ROS production with mitochondrial respiration, increased expression of mtTrx could function along with GSH-dependent mechanisms to protect against ROS, regulate the protein redox state, and perhaps control the cellular responses to apoptosis.Previous studies with selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH suggested that the chemical oxidant tBH (17Cai J., Wu, M. Nelson K.C. Sternberg P., Jr. Jones D.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 959-966PubMed Google Scholar, 22Miller S. Walker S.W. Arthur J.R. Nicol F. Pickard K. Lewin M.H. Howie A.F.

Toxicol. 1993; 6: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). tBH induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in which the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is activated (25Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), cytochrome c is released, and caspase 3 is activated (17Cai J., Wu, M. Nelson K.C. Sternberg P., Jr. Jones D.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 959-966PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that mtTrx-transfected cells were protected against the tBH-induced cell death (Fig. 6). This protection might be achieved through a direct ROS scavenger function in conjunction with peroxiredoxin (26Nordberg J. Arner E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar, 27Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar); however, no difference in rate of elimination of tBH was observed between control and mtTrx-overexpressing cells.mtTrx could alternatively prevent apoptosis by controlling the redox state of mitochondrial proteins. For example, an important component of the MPT pore, adenine nucleotide translocator, also contains critical thiols that are subject to redox regulation (28Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Larochette N. de Pablo M.A. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29Vieira H.L. Belzacq A.S. Haouzi D. Bernassola F.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). mtTrx may interact with the adenine nucleotide translocator and thereby regulate the function of the MPT. Accumulating evidence indicates that redox control of the MPT may be a critical determinant of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, a process thought to contribute to aging and various age-related diseases (30Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Broekemeier K.M. Klocek C.K. Pfeiffer D.R.

Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study demonstrates that the nuclear-encoded human mtTrx is expressed as two mRNA species that differ in length of the 3′-non-coding region. mRNA expression was greater in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver than in other major tissues. An epitope-tagged mtTrx protein was targeted to mitochondria, and stable overexpression of this protein protected against oxidant-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that in addition to the well studied superoxide dismutase and GSH-dependent protein systems, human mitochondria contain a functional Trx-dependent system for protection against oxidative damage and oxidant-induced apoptosis. Thioredoxins (Trx)1 are a family of small proteins that contain a conserved redox active center, Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The reversible oxidation/reduction in the active center enables Trx to transfer electrons to protein disulfide substrates. Two other components, thioredoxin reductase (TR) and NADPH, reduce the oxidized Trx and complete Trx cycling (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the presence of TR and NADPH, Trx mediates rapid and reversible disulfide-thiol exchange of dithiol motifs in protein substrates. Although Trx was originally identified as an electron donor of ribonucleotide reductase, a wide range of other biological functions have been characterized based on its redox capability (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Trx is implicated in apoptosis regulation through two different mechanisms: 1) scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect against oxidative stress (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and 2) direct binding and inhibiting the activity of the proapoptotic protein apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (2Saitoh M.

Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Regulating the activities of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, is another important aspect of its biological functions (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of Trx have been identified in different organisms, ranging from Escherichia coli to mammalian cells (4Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol.

The RACE analysis indicates that there are two mRNA sequences that are different in the length of the 3′-untranslated region. The shorter one is in good agreement with the recently updated mtTrx sequence (GenBankTM accession no. NM-056182), except that it lacks the last 12 nucleotides. The longer one has an additional 330 bp 3′ downstream of the previous sequence and contains the consensus polyadenylation signal “AAUAAA” and “CA” at the very 3′ end. No such signal exists in the shorter cDNA fragments, raising a question considering which is the correct in vivotranscript. One possibility is that both transcripts could exist and that an alternative polyadenylation signal is used for the short cDNA sequence. Northern blot analysis showed that two bands were present in some tissues and that the molecular weights were close to those of the two cDNA fragments achieved from RACE, 1.34 and 1.01 kb respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that the two mRNA species are both likely to exist in vivo. Tissue distribution studies show a very generalized distribution in all tissues with a high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. These results are consistent with Northern blot analyses of mtTrx distribution in rat (10Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) in which high expression occurs in tissues with high energy demand. Because of the association of ROS production with mitochondrial respiration, increased expression of mtTrx could function along with GSH-dependent mechanisms to protect against ROS, regulate the protein redox state, and perhaps control the cellular responses to apoptosis. Previous studies with selective depletion of mitochondrial GSH suggested that the chemical oxidant tBH (17Cai J., Wu, M. Nelson K.C. Sternberg P., Jr. Jones D.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 959-966PubMed Google Scholar, 22Miller S. Walker S.W. Arthur J.R. Nicol F. Pickard K. Lewin M.H. Howie A.F. Beckett G.J. Clin.

Toxicol. 1993; 6: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). tBH induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in which the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is activated (25Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), cytochrome c is released, and caspase 3 is activated (17Cai J., Wu, M. Nelson K.C. Sternberg P., Jr. Jones D.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 959-966PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that mtTrx-transfected cells were protected against the tBH-induced cell death (Fig. 6). This protection might be achieved through a direct ROS scavenger function in conjunction with peroxiredoxin (26Nordberg J. Arner E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar, 27Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

For example, an important component of the MPT pore, adenine nucleotide translocator, also contains critical thiols that are subject to redox regulation (28Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). mtTrx may interact with the adenine nucleotide translocator and thereby regulate the function of the MPT. Accumulating evidence indicates that redox control of the MPT may be a critical determinant of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, a process thought to contribute to aging and various age-related diseases (30Fontaine E.

In summary, the present study demonstrates that the nuclear-encoded human mtTrx is expressed as two mRNA species that differ in length of the 3′-non-coding region. mRNA expression was greater in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver than in other major tissues. An epitope-tagged mtTrx protein was targeted to mitochondria, and stable overexpression of this protein protected against oxidant-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that in addition to the well studied superoxide dismutase and GSH-dependent protein systems, human mitochondria contain a functional Trx-dependent system for protection against oxidative damage and oxidant-induced apoptosis.

PUFAs of the n-3 series have been shown to be particularly effective and are known to interfere with proinflammatory eicosanoid (prostaglandin/leukotriene) synthesis (1Calder P.C. Lipids. 2001; 36: 1007-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, PUFA-mediated inhibition of T lymphocyte activation and function has repeatedly been shown to be independent of eicosanoid synthesis (5Santoli D. Zurier R.B. J.

Because PUFA treatment changes the lipid composition of lymphocyte membranes (9Rossetti R.G. Seiler C.M. DeLuca P. Laposata M. Zurier R.B. J. Leukoc.

Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Membrane lipid rafts or microdomains are specialized regions within the plane of the plasma membrane and have been proposed as playing an essential role in T cell signal transduction (12Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q.Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 13Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A.

Lipid rafts are characterized by a high concentration of cholesterol and sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and glycolipids, and their polar lipids contain predominantly saturated fatty acyl residues (17Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar, 18Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Such lipids spontaneously form liquid-ordered membrane regions that are insoluble in non-ionic detergents, facilitating raft isolation as detergent-resistant membrane domains (18Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 19Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and transmembrane proteins are targeted to lipid rafts mostly by acylation with saturated fatty acyl moieties (palmitoyl and myristoyl) which link these proteins to the cytoplasmic lipid leaflet of microdomains (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Several proteins involved in T cell signaling such as Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and LAT (linker for activation of T cells) are concentrated in rafts because of post-translational palmitoylation, emphasizing the role of lipid rafts in T cell signaling (14Hořejšı́ V. Drbal K. Cebecauer M. Cerny J. Brdicka T. Angelisova P. Stockinger H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 356-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The activation of T cells requires stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex. Triggering CD3 leads to the activation of Src-family PTKs and the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the CD3 complex, thereby facilitating the binding of other signaling molecules such as the Syk-family PTKs ZAP-70 and Syk (21Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). ZAP-70 associates with phosphorylated CD3ζ and is subsequently activated by the Src family kinase Lck. Following phosphorylation by ZAP-70, the central adaptor protein LAT recruits phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) to the plasma membrane (22Zhang W.G. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 23Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W.G. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). PLCγ1 is also activated by ZAP-70 to liberate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, thereby eliciting an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which is a key event for promoting downstream activation (24Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that PUFA treatment leads to the displacement of Src family PTKs from lipid rafts in parallel with the inhibition of calcium response (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the particular step in T cell signaling by which PUFA-mediated modification of T cell membrane rafts affects T cell activation remained unknown. Here we show that PUFA treatment of T cells specifically blocks signal transduction at the level of LAT and PLCγ1 phosphorylation by the partial displacement of LAT from lipid rafts. Moreover, the expression of a genetically modified LAT protein that is retained in the membrane rafts of PUFA-treated T cells effectively restores PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-enriched T cells. These results reveal that LAT displacement from lipid rafts is a crucial molecular mechanism for PUFA-mediated inhibition of T cell signaling.

Peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTLs) were isolated by separating mononuclear cells from buffy coats via Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation and by subsequent rosetting with neuramidase-treated sheep erythrocytes (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). The obtained population contained >90% CD3-positive cells (not shown). As described previously (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), Jurkat cells or PBTLs were enriched with fatty acids by incubation for 2 or 3 days, respectively, in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and indicated concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(n-3)) or stearic acid (18:0; all from Sigma), which served as a control. Stearic acid was found previously to be indistinguishable from the vehicle alone (ethanol, ≤0.5% (v/v)) in regard to PUFA content, membrane subdomain distribution of proteins, and calcium signaling (Ref. 11Stulnig T.M.

Cytoplasmic calcium concentration was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (26Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T.

The ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 395 and 530 nm was computed as a direct estimate of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Maximal indo-1 fluorescence ratios achieved by stimulation were compared between PUFA and stearic acid-treated cells (26Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Hořejšı́ V. Waldhäusl W. J.

Jurkat and peripheral blood T cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) including 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and stimulated via CD3 by incubation with 5 μg/ml OKT3 for 1 min followed by cross-linking with 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2-fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 min at 37 °C. After cessation by the addition of ice-cold washing buffer, cells (2 × 107 Jurkat cells/ml and 5 × 107 PBTLs/ml) were lysed on ice for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.2) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), phosphatase (1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 5 mm EDTA) and protease inhibitors. After removing nuclei, indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated using GammaBind Plus beads (Amersham Biosciences) preincubated with specific antibodies. Membrane lipid rafts were separated as detergent-resistant floating material by lysing T cell membranes in Tris-buffered saline including 1% Brij-58 (Pierce) and protease inhibitors followed by isopycnic centrifugation in a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient as described (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Eleven fractions of equal volume were collected from the top. Standard Western blotting procedures were applied, and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence on a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This system allows linear signal quantitation over four orders of magnitude and was used to calculate relative amounts of (phosphorylated) proteins according to their chemiluminescence signals. The oligonucleotides TAGGATCCCTGCCAGGCTCCTACG and ATTCAGTTCAGCTCTTGCAGATTC were used as PCR primers to amplify the cDNA sequence encoding the intracellular part (residues 32 to 233), and the primers ACGGAATTCATGGAGGAGGCCATCC and ATAGTCTAGATCAGTTCAGCTCTTGCAGATTC were used to amplify the whole coding sequence of LAT, respectively. The sequence encoding the transmembrane and extracellular domains of PAG (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains) (residues 1 to 42) (28Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A.

PCR products were subcloned into the T/A site of pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). The chimeric construct was fused by ligating the LAT fragment into theBamHI (introduced by primers) and NotI sites of pGEM/PAG, sequenced, and subcloned into the PstI andNotI sites of the pEFIRES-P expression vector (29Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The wild type LAT was sequenced and cloned into the EcoRI andNotI sites of pEFIRES-P. ANJ3 cells were transfected by electroporation, and stably transfected clones were selected in standard culture medium including 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The expression of transfected protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-LAT antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), which is directed against amino acids 31–233. Surface expression of CD3ε was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by a two-tail unpaired Student's t test, and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Treatment with PUFAs but not with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids inhibits CD3-induced calcium response in Jurkat T cells (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment with polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) but not saturated stearic acid (18:0) significantly inhibited CD3-stimulated calcium response not only in Jurkat T cells but also in PBTLs. Calcium signaling depends on the release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by PLCγ1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 following stimulation via CD3 was markedly decreased when Jurkat or peripheral blood T cells had been cultured with PUFAs (20:5) compared with stearic acid-treated cells (18:0, Fig.1 B). To elucidate the functional block leading to the inhibition of PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-enriched T cells, we investigated the preceding signaling steps. Neither phosphorylation of CD3ζ nor recruitment of ZAP-70 to CD3ζ were inhibited in PUFA-enriched Jurkat T cells (Fig.2 A). PLCγ1 is not only a substrate of Syk family PTKs (ZAP-70 and Syk) but also of Tec family PTKs such as Itk/Emt/Tsk (21Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these PTKs was apparently not inhibited in CD3-stimulated, PUFA-enriched Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2 A). However, CD3-stimulated phosphorylation of LAT was significantly blocked by PUFA treatment (Fig. 2 A). As in Jurkat T cells, PUFA enrichment did not interfere with CD3-induced phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP-70 but significantly inhibited subsequent LAT phosphorylation in PBTLs (Fig.2 B). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylations of LAT and PLCγ1 were the most upstream signaling events affected in PUFA-enriched T cells.Figure 2Early T cell signaling events in PUFA-enriched T cells. Jurkat J7.7 cells (A) or PBTLs (B) were incubated with 50 μm saturated (18:0; control) or polyunsaturated fatty acid (20:5) and stimulated by cross-linking of CD3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of distinct proteins was detected by immunoprecipitation (IP) with specific antibodies followed by phosphotyrosine Western blotting (pY) as indicated. LAT phosphorylation was detected as pp36/38 in phosphotyrosine blots of whole cell lysates (WCL). Phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and PLCγ1 in PBTLs was determined by antibodies specific for the respective phosphoprotein. The quantity of distinct proteins in immunoprecipitated or whole cell lysates, respectively, was assessed by Western blotting on stripped membranes except for unphosphorylated Jurkat CD3ζ, which was detected in whole cell lysates. Association of ZAP-70 with phospho-CD3ζ (CD3ζ/ZAP-70; pp23 of CD3ζ) was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation. Each blot is representative of at least three independent experiments. Relative amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of PUFA-treated stimulated samples are given as a percentage of stimulated control. ***,p ≤ 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Enrichment of Jurkat T cells with PUFAs has been shown to markedly displace the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn from rafts (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface proteins, exemplified by CD59, remained inside lipid rafts in PUFA-enriched T cells as reported previously and were hence used as raft markers (Fig.3 and Ref. 11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Targeting to lipid rafts of intracellular proteins such as Src family kinases as well as raft targeting of transmembrane proteins such as LAT appear to be mediated by protein palmitoylation (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 30Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 31Zhang W.G. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Notably, in PUFA-enriched Jurkat and peripheral blood T cells a considerable fraction of LAT was displaced from lipid rafts in parallel with Src family PTKs (Fig. 3). Because (i) the phosphorylation of LAT was the most upstream signaling event inhibited by PUFA treatment and (ii) LAT was effectively displaced from rafts, the displacement of LAT from lipid rafts could be the primary cause for disturbed signal transduction in PUFA-enriched T cells. Strikingly, another palmitoylated protein, PAG/Cbp (28Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y.

Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), was found in lipid rafts irrespective of fatty acid treatment (Fig. 3). To test the hypothesis that displacement of LAT from lipid rafts is the underlying molecular mechanism of PUFA-mediated T cell inhibition, we expressed a genetically modified LAT protein with the potential to be localized in the membrane lipid rafts of PUFA-enriched T cells. The transmembrane adaptor protein PAG/Cbp is structurally similar to LAT but contains a longer (16 amino acids) extracellular domain (28Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Hořejšı́ V. Schraven B. J. Exp.

Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Because PAG/Cbp was exactly co-distributed with GPI-anchored CD59 in sucrose density gradients, we assumed that the extracellular and/or transmembrane domain of PAG/Cbp could underlie its unique retainment in rafts of PUFA-treated T cells. Therefore, we combined the functionally important intracellular part of LAT with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of PAG/Cbp, including its membrane-proximal palmitoylation site. The chimeric PAG-LAT and the wild type LAT were stably introduced into the LAT-deficient Jurkat subline ANJ3 (25Zhang W.G. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The clones obtained from each transfectant expressed comparable amounts of the transfected proteins PLCγ1 and CD3ζ, although the expression of LAT or PAG-LAT, respectively, exceeded LAT expression in parental Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4 A). As we anticipated, PAG-LAT but not endogenous Lck remained in lipid rafts in PUFA-enriched cells comparable with wild type PAG/Cbp. In contrast, transfected wild type LAT was markedly displaced from rafts in parallel to Lck and similar to the manner of endogenous LAT in parental Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4 B, cf. Fig. 3). CD3 stimulation of the LAT-deficient Jurkat subline ANJ3 did not evoke PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation or calcium response, but reconstitution with wild type LAT or PAG-LAT effectively restored these signaling events under control conditions (Fig.5). Similar to the manner in PUFA-modified parental Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 B), tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was markedly blocked in LAT-transfected ANJ3 cells treated with PUFAs as compared with controls treated with stearic acid (18:0; Fig. 5 A). In contrast, CD3-stimulated phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was not inhibited in the PUFA-treated ANJ3 clones transfected with chimeric PAG-LAT as compared with the 18:0-treated cells. Accordingly, CD3-induced calcium response was diminished after PUFA enrichment in ANJ3 clones transfected with wild type LAT but not in PAG-LAT transfected clones (Fig. 5, Band C). Transfected ANJ3 clones differed in the amount of surface CD3, but PUFA enrichment did not have any influence on CD3 expression in transfected ANJ3 as it did in parental Jurkat T cells (Ref. 11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, retaining LAT alone within lipid rafts effectively rescued PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-enriched T cells. A number of recent studies have shown that TCR signaling is dependent on lipid rafts and their stimulation-induced association (12Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q.Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 13Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A.

Membrane lipid rafts provide a platform where several molecules critically involved in the early phases of the TCR signaling cascade are concentrated, including Src family kinases (Lck and Fyn) and the adaptor protein LAT. The current model assumes that aggregates of TCR complexes induced by their natural or surrogate ligands fuse with rafts, and, thereby, activation motifs of the TCR-associated CD3 complex become phosphorylated by Lck and Fyn present in the rafts (21Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar,33Leitenberg D. Balamuth F. Bottomly K. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CD3ζ chains then serve as docking sites for the cytoplasmic kinase ZAP-70, which subsequently phosphorylates its major substrate, the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT, which is constitutively present in rafts. Tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT then binds several other molecules involved in the initiation of further downstream pathways (15Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The integrity of membrane rafts mainly depends on the physical interactions of saturated fatty acyl residues, which are characteristic for their lipid and protein constituents (18Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Consequently, the substitution of saturated residues in raft lipids and/or lipidated proteins by polyunsaturated acyl moieties could easily result in functional disturbances in TCR signaling. Previous data from our laboratory showed that Src family kinases, which are attached by acylation to the cytoplasmic membrane lipid leaflet, were largely displaced from rafts in PUFA-treated T cells, whereas markers of the raft exoplasmic leaflet such as GPI-anchored proteins or ganglioside GM1 remained in rafts of PUFA-enriched T cells (11Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the results of the present functional analysis revealed that, rather than depletion of Src family kinases, the partial displacement of another raft component, the adaptor protein LAT, is of crucial importance for PUFA-induced suppression of TCR signaling. As shown in Fig. 2, Lck-driven tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP-70 was not altered in PUFA-enriched T cells, indicating that the partial displacement of Lck from rafts by PUFAs does not significantly perturb its function in TCR signaling. A straightforward explanation of this observation is that the amount of Lck left in rafts after the PUFA treatment is still functionally sufficient, although the complete exclusion of Lck from rafts does disrupt TCR signaling (30Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In line with this notion, the targeting of minute amounts of Lck to rafts effectively rescues the downstream activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) (34Kosugi A. Hayashi F. Liddicoat D.R. Yasuda K. Saitoh S. Hamaoka T. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 76: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, Lck was shown to phosphorylate its substrate CD3ζ independent of its raft localization (33Leitenberg D. Balamuth F. Bottomly K. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Delgado P. Fernandez E. Dave V. Kappes D. Alarcon B. Nature. 2000; 406: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Werlen G. Hausmann B. Palmer E. Nature. 2000; 406: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, our present data showing that the PUFA-mediated partial displacement of Lck from lipid rafts is not per sesufficient to inhibit TCR signaling are in agreement with previous studies on this topic. Moreover, these data argue that the displacement of a significant fraction of a signaling protein from rafts does not necessarily disrupt its function. Activated ZAP-70 primarily phosphorylates LAT and subsequently LAT-associated PLCγ1 (37Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W.G. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast to the preceding Lck-driven signaling events, the phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1 was markedly diminished following PUFA treatment (Figs. 1 and 2). Phosphorylation of LAT and PLCγ1 thus represent the most upstream CD3 signaling events that are inhibited in PUFA-enriched T cells. In addition, these findings indicate that, in contrast to Lck, the phosphorylation of ZAP-70 substrates requires them to be localized in membrane rafts. Under physiological conditions, the recruitment of phosphorylated CD3ζ to rafts may bring associated ZAP-70 into proximity with its substrates, particularly LAT and PLCγ1 (38Kosugi A. Saitoh S.I. Noda S. Yasuda K. Hayashi F. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions are largely facilitated by spatial confinement in unperturbed rafts in control T cells but appear to be effectively blocked in PUFA-enriched T cells. LAT is a pivotal adaptor protein in T cell signal transduction, and its phosphorylation is a prerequisite for subsequent PLCγ1 activation and downstream signaling. LAT was recently shown (31Zhang W.G. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 39Brdicka T. Cerny J. Hořejšı́ V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) to depend on raft localization to function in T cell signaling. Moreover, LAT seems to be specifically located in the vicinity of the TCR, and this vicinity is lost by preventing the raft localization of LAT (41Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When displaced from membrane rafts, LAT phosphorylation is either blocked as in PUFA-treated PBTLs or parental Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2), or when LAT is overexpressed, it may proceed in an uncontrolled manner possibly by overwhelming interactions with PTKs outside the rafts (40Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42Torgersen K.M. Vaage J.T. Rolstad B. Tasken K. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The overexpression of wild type LAT in transfected cells alone did not rescue PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-treated T cells, strongly indicating that the proportion of LAT located in rafts rather than the absolute amount of LAT present in rafts is functionally important. Because protein association with lipid rafts is a dynamic process (43Jacobson K. Sheets E.D. Simons R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 44Schütz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), the apparent PUFA-induced displacement of proteins from rafts in density gradients most probably represents an altered distribution equilibrium of proteins between raft and non-raft membrane subdomains. The observation that LAT phosphorylation was the most upstream signaling event affected by PUFA treatment indicated that the displacement of LAT from rafts may be the key mechanism of the inhibitory effects of PUFAs on TCR signaling. It seemed likely that, in contrast to Lck, the correct amount of LAT in T cell rafts is a limiting factor, and its decrease, as induced by PUFAs, markedly affects the signaling process. This hypothesis was proven by introducing a chimeric LAT protein (PAG-LAT) that was retained in membrane rafts in PUFA-enriched T cells and restored PLCγ1/calcium signaling. PUFAs may affect T lymphocytes by a variety of mechanisms apart from modifying membrane and raft lipid composition (e.g. by activating nuclear receptors) (45Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 46Jones D.C. Ding X. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6838-6845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the rescue of PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-enriched T cells by the chimeric LAT protein rules out the proposition that signaling steps upstream of LAT or other signaling events that contribute to CD3-induced calcium signaling are significantly altered by PUFA treatment. The selective displacement of palmitoylated proteins such as Src family kinases and LAT from lipid rafts in PUFA-treated T cells is predominantly due to altered raft lipid composition (10Stulnig T.M. Huber J. Leitinger N. Imre E.-M. Angelisová P. Nowotny P. Waldhäusl W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37335-37340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), although altered protein acylation may contribute as well (47Webb Y. Hermida Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the cause of the unique stable raft localization of PAG/Cbp has yet to be elucidated in detail. Because the distribution of PAG/Cbp in density gradients of membrane lysates exactly reflected that of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 in a variety of experiments (Fig. 3 and data not shown), interaction of the extracellular/transmembrane domains of PAG/Cbp with a glycolipid-anchored protein or a glycolipid may be a likely explanation. Notably, the intracellular domain of PAG/Cbp, which interacts with the cytoskeleton (48Brdickova N. Brdicka T. Andera L. Spicka J. Angelisova P. Milgram S.L. Hořejšı́ V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 49Itoh K. Sakakibara M. Yamasaki S. Takeuchi A. Arase H. Miyazaki M. Nakajima N. Okada M. Saito T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), apparently does not contribute to its PUFA-insensitive raft targeting as evidenced by the chimeric PAG-LAT (Fig. 4 B). In conclusion, our results uncovered a molecular mechanism for the PUFA-mediated inhibition of T cell signaling by showing that the displacement of LAT from membrane lipid rafts is the primary cause for diminished PLCγ1/calcium signaling in PUFA-treated T cells. Similar disturbances of membrane rafts involving the displacement of Src family kinases and LAT apparently also contribute to the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of T cell signaling (50Van Laethem F. Baus E. Smyth L.A. Andris F. Bex F. Urbain J. Kioussis D. Leo O. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because dietary PUFAs are effectively incorporated into lymphocyte membrane lipids, altered LAT membrane subdomain distribution could also underlie the clinically apparent immunosuppressive action of PUFAs when these substances are applied to patients with inflammatory diseases. Moreover, understanding this principle of action may promote the development of more potent drugs for displacing LAT from lipid rafts,e.g. by interfering with its protein acylation. We are grateful to Thomas Sigmund for skillful technical assistance, Lawrence E. Samelson for generously providing LAT-deficient ANJ3 Jurkat cells, Ludwig Wagner for his help with DNA construction and transfection, and Hannes Stockinger for extensive discussion and critical comments on the manuscript."

These results suggest that nicastrin plays an integral role in the regulated, intramembranous, and proteolytic events involved in processing APP, Notch, and possibly other transmembrane proteins. The presenilin-nicastrin complexes are functionally necessary for an unusual form of proteolytic processing in which several membrane-bound proteins (including Notch and APP) are cleaved within their transmembrane domains (26Wong P.C.

PS1 and PS2 facilitate the S3-site intramembranous cleavage of Notch that generates the Notch intracellular domain, which then acts as a transcriptional activator. PS1 and PS2 play similar roles in the γ-site cleavage of the membrane-bound, APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) produced by α- or β-secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein. This intramembranous cleavage generates the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide (30De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

Other roles that have been postulated for presenilins include serving either as an adaptor/regulator of γ-secretase and S3 cleavages (39Chen F. Yang D.-S. Tandon A., Yu, G. Rozmahel R. Nishimura M.

Indeed, spe-4, a distant member of the presenilin family in C. elegans, regulates shuttling of a Golgi-like organelle (45Arduengo P.M. Appleberry O.K. Chuang P. L'Hernault S.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As would be predicted for a functional component of the presenilin complexes, nicastrin plays a similar role in these activities. RNA interference suppression of nicastrin expression in C. elegans causes an embryonic lethal glp-1-like phenotype similar to that induced by loss of both presenilin homologues (sel-12 and hop-1) (1Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.-S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M., Xu, D.H. Sato C.

This is consistent with the recent evidence of aph-2 links to thelin-12/Notch pathway (22Levitan D., Yu, G., St George-Hyslop P. Goutte C. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function nicastrin mutations also suppress γ-secretase cleavage of APP and reduce Aβ secretion in vitro (1Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L., Yu, H. Yang D.-S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M., Xu, D.H. Sato C.

Although nicastrin does display some sequence similarities to dipeptidases, no intrinsic enzymatic activity can be demonstrated, suggesting that nicastrin is not itself a protease (46Fergani A., Yu, G., St George-Hyslop P. Checler F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 678-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the processing and intracellular localization of the presenilins, relatively little is known about the processing and intracellular localization of nicastrin. We have explored the subcellular localization and post-translational modification of nicastrin in several cells types, including primary neurons. We report here that nicastrin is expressed at higher levels in the brain than in other tissues. We also found that nicastrin undergoes a complex pattern of glycosylation and that it is the fully mature, glycosylated form that preferentially interacts with PS1. Only a small proportion of PS1 is bound to immature species, even when nicastrin is expressed at high levels in transfected cells. A loss-of-function deletion mutation in nicastrin, which inhibits its trafficking and glycosylation, reduces the PS1-nicastrin interactions. This suggests that proper trafficking/compartmentalizations of nicastrin and presenilins and/or specific patterns of glycosylation may be essential for the formation of functional γ-secretase complexes. Wild-type and mutant (missense DYIGS-AAIGS and deletion) nicastrins, with and without V5 epitope tags, were prepared as described previously (1Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L.

To examine compartment-specific oligosaccharide processing, wild-type and D336A/Y337A mutant nicastrin cDNAs were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis to express a C-terminal KKAA ER retention tag and ligated into pcDNA6/V5-HisA vector, using KpnI andPmeI sites. The original expression vector was engineered to retain the V5 epitope at the C terminus of nicastrin, to which the di-lysine motif was attached. Retention of the V5 tag permitted the transfected protein to be immunoprecipitated and distinguished from its endogenous counterpart. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and SHSY-5Y cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Where required, cells were then transiently transfected with nicastrin using LipofectAMINE. SHSY-5Y cells were plated on uncoated glass coverslips and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS. Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were obtained from 6-day-old mice. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% glucose, and 25 mm KCl. Cytosine arabinoside (4 μm) was added at 18 h post-plating. Cultures were ∼95% neuronal (as indicated by immunostaining with neuron-specific enolase), and differentiated cells were examined at 7 days post-plating. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (5De Strooper B. Beulens M. Contreras B. Craessaerts K. Moechars D. Bollen M. Fraser P., St George-Hyslop P. Van Leuven F. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) in Tris-buffered saline. Nicastrin immunoreactivity was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised either to the C-terminal domain at residues 691–709 or to a GST fusion protein containing residues 320–420 of human nicastrin. Double labeling for nicastrin and organelle marker proteins was achieved using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed to the following: BiP (an endoplasmic reticulum marker) (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); p58 (a Golgi marker) (Sigma); the PS1 N-terminal fragment (NT1) (48Mathews P.M.

Cells were further processed as described above and co-stained for ER-lumenal BiP to ensure that the intracellular membranes remained intact. Immunofluorescence was visualized with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse antisera (Vector, Burlingame, CA).

Nicastrin-containing total protein extracts were examined for glycosylation patterns using Endo H and PNGase (New England Biolabs), as per the manufacturer's protocols. Interactions between PS1 and the various forms of nicastrin were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Membrane preparations from cells expressing endogenous protein or transiently transfected V5-tagged nicastrin constructs were isolated and extracted with digitonin, as described (1Yu G. Nishimura M.

PS-containing complexes were precipitated using an antiserum directed toward PS1 residues 1–25 and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The presence of mature and immature nicastrin was examined using antisera directed to the C terminus of nicastrin. To examine the distribution of intracellular nicastrin, ER and Golgi-enriched fractions were obtained from HEK293 cells expressing endogenous and transfected nicastrin as indicated. These membrane fractions were homogenized in buffer containing 130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), plus protease inhibitors. Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to remove nuclear debris, and the supernatants were collected and re-centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g. These extracts were then layered on a step gradient consisting of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, and 2.5% iodixanol (v/v) (Accurate Chemicals) in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 126,000 × g for 30 min. Eleven fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and the distribution of nicastrin was examined by Western blotting. The fractions were also examined for the presence of the following intracellular markers of the ER (BiP and calnexin; StressGen) and the Golgi (p59 and GM130; Sigma) to confirm the localization of the nicastrin constructs. To assess the topology of nicastrin within cellular membranes, antibodies raised to different domains were used for immunofluorescence studies in several different cell types expressing either endogenous nicastrin or transiently overexpressed exogenous nicastrin. These cells were permeabilized with digitonin to selectively disrupt the plasma membrane and selectively expose cytoplasmic epitopes. Comparable cells were treated with Triton X-100 to disrupt all membranes, thereby exposing epitopes sequestered within the lumina of vesicles and organelles in addition to cytoplasmic epitopes. Strong perinuclear staining was detected when antibodies to the C-terminal tail (residues 691–709) of nicastrin were used to investigate MDCK cells transfected with wild-type human nicastrin and permeabilized with digitonin (Fig.1 A). In regions more remote from the nucleus, the nicastrin-immunoreactive structures had a punctate appearance that may reflect either localization within a discrete vesicular compartment or the presence of clusters of membrane-bound nicastrin. In some cells, a small amount of nicastrin immunoreactivity localized to the nuclear envelope (PS1 immunoreactivity has a similar distribution) (17Levesque G., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L., Yu, H., Xu, D. Liang Y. Rogaeva E. Ikeda M. Duthie M. Murgolo N. Wang L. VanderVere P. Bayne M.L. Strader C.D. Rommens J.M. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P. J.

All immunoreactivity was abolished when the antisera were preabsorbed with the appropriate antigen, and no immunoreactivity was detected by preimmune serum (not shown). To establish whether digitonin had selectively exposed the C terminus of nicastrin in the cytoplasm by permeabilizing only the plasmalemma, the cells were co-immunostained with an antibody to BiP, a protein resident in the ER lumen. No BiP immunoreactivity was detectable, confirming that digitonin had selectively exposed only epitopes oriented toward the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C;overlay image Fig. 1 E).

https://openalex.org/W1989418680,"Copper is essential for the growth and development of mammalian cells. The key role in the intracellular distribution of copper belongs to the recently discovered family of metallochaperones and to copper-transporting P-type ATPases. The mutations in the ATPase ATP7B, the Wilson's disease protein (WNDP), lead to intracellular accumulation of copper and severe hepatic and neurological abnormalities. Several of these mutations were shown to disrupt the protein-protein interactions between WNDP and the metallochaperone Atox1, suggesting that these interactions are important for normal copper homeostasis. To understand the functional consequences of the Atox1-WNDP interaction at the molecular level, we produced recombinant Atox1 and characterized its effects on WNDP. We demonstrate that Atox1 transfers copper to the purified amino-terminal domain of WNDP (N-WNDP) in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. A maximum of six copper atoms can be transferred to N-WNDP by the chaperone. Furthermore, the incubation of copper Atox1 with the full-length WNDP leads to the stimulation of the WNDP catalytic activity, providing strong evidence for the direct effect of Atox1 on the function of this transporter. Our data also suggest that Atox1 can regulate the copper occupancy of WNDP. The incubation with apo-Atox1 results in the removal of copper from the metalated N-WNDP and apparent down-regulation of WNDP activity. Interestingly, at least one copper atom remains tightly bound to N-WNDP even in the presence of excess apo-Atox1. We suggest that this incomplete reversibility reflects the functional non-equivalency of the metal-binding sites in WNDP and speculate about the intracellular consequences of the reversible Atox1-mediated copper transfer.

It is essential for normal cell metabolism serving as a cofactor to various enzymes involved in cellular processes as diverse as respiration, antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and iron homeostasis. At the same time, excess copper is toxic to the cell; therefore, the intracellular copper concentration is tightly controlled. Recent studies in yeast indicate that the amount of free copper in eucaryotic cells is negligible and that copper after being transported into the cell quickly becomes bound to various carriers (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Among these carriers, the key role in further intracellular distribution of copper belongs to a recently discovered family of copper chaperones. These proteins temporarily sequester free copper while delivering it to specific target proteins throughout the cell (for reviews see Refs. 2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Human copper chaperone Atox1 (also known as HAH1) is a small cytosolic protein that plays a key role in the distribution of copper to the cell secretory pathway. In yeast, the Atox1 ortholog, Atx1, was shown to facilitate copper delivery to the copper-transporting P-type ATPase Ccc2, which then transports copper into the late Golgi compartment (5Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar,6Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Atox1 was proposed to bring copper to the copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, or the Menkes disease protein (MNKP)1 and the Wilson's disease protein (WNDP), respectively. MNKP and WNDP then use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to either translocate the metal into the lumen of the trans-Golgi network for incorporation into copper-dependent enzymes or to export excess copper out of the cell. The deletion of the Atox1 gene in mice leads to the intracellular accumulation of copper and decreased activity of secreted copper-dependent enzymes such as tyrosinase, supporting the proposed role of Atox1 as a metal donor for the copper-transporting ATPases (7Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the important role of Atox1 for mammalian copper homeostasis was clearly demonstrated (7Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the experimental data directly linking functions of the human chaperone Atox1 and the copper-transporting ATPases MNKP and WNDP are still lacking. Recent studies from several laboratories provided experimental evidence for physical interactions between Atox1 and the amino-terminal domains of MNKP and WNDP (8Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In addition, several mutations found in Wilson's disease patients were shown to disrupt the ability of WNDP to interact with Atox1, suggesting that this interaction was essential for normal copper homeostasis (9Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Whether the protein-protein interactions lead to the transfer of copper from Atox1 to either WNDP or MNKP has not yet been demonstrated. Most importantly, it remains unknown whether the transfer of copper from the chaperone to the copper-transporting ATPases has a direct effect on activity of these transporters. To address these important issues, we generated recombinant Atox1 and examined whether Atox1 can transfer copper to the amino-terminal domain of WNDP (N-WNDP). We also determined the effect of Atox1 on the catalytic activity of WNDP using the full-length membrane-bound transporter. Finally, we characterized the reversibility of the Atox1-mediated transfer of copper and demonstrated that Atox1 can regulate the copper occupancy and activity of WNDP. In this work, we focused on the functional interactions between Atox1 and WNDP; however. our conclusions are probably applicable, at least in general, to the transfer of copper from Atox1 to MNKP, which is highly homologous to WNDP. The human Atox1 cDNA was excised from the previously generated pET24b-Atox1 plasmid using NdeI and EcoRI endonucleases and cloned into the pTYB12 vector (New England Biolabs) to produce the pTYB12-Atox1 construct (see Fig. 1 and “Results”). This construct encoding the fusion protein composed of Atox1, intein, and a chitin-binding domain was then transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The expression of the Atox1-containing fusion was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h at room temperature. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5) containing one Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were passed through a French Press (Sim-Aminco) at 16,000 p.s.i., and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble fraction of the lysate was passed through a chitin bead column (New England Biolabs), allowing the Atox1 fusion to bind to the resin via its chitin-binding domain. The resin was then washed with 30-column volumes of lysis buffer. To induce the intein-mediated cleavage, the beads were incubated in 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 25 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.15, 150 mm NaCl, for 40 h at room temperature. Atox1 was then collected in elution fractions and dialyzed against lysis buffer at 4 °C overnight to remove DTT. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar), and protein purity was determined by a 15% Laemmli gel (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The identity of Atox1 was confirmed by mass spectrometry and by immunochemistry using an Atox1-specific antibody. The yield of purified soluble Atox1 was ∼2 mg of protein from a liter of cell culture. CuCl2 was mixed with glutathione at a 1:10 molar ratio, and the mixture was then added to Atox1 at a copper to protein ratio of 1:1. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, Atox1 was extensively dialyzed against Na2HPO4 buffer, and the stoichiometry of the copper-Atox1 complex was determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay in which the absorbance of a Cu(I)·BCA complex was monitored at 562 nm (13Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) or by atomic absorption (both methods produced very similar results). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out on one of the samples that had a typical copper-binding stoichiometry of 0.8 Cu/Atox1. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker E500 X-Band EPR spectrometer with a Super X microwave bridge and a Super High Q resonator. The instrument was equipped with a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat. No Cu2+ signal was detected, suggesting that copper bound to Atox1 was in the reduced Cu1+ form. N-WNDP used in this study was a fusion of 601 amino acid residues of human WNDP and the maltose-binding protein (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). N-WNDP was expressed and purified using affinity chromatography on amylose resin as described previously (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For copper transfer experiments, N-WNDP bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) was washed with 30-column volumes of assay buffer (20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated with 100 μm DTT for 10 min at room temperature. After an additional wash with 10-column volumes of assay buffer, various amounts of soluble copper-bound Atox1 in the assay buffer were added to the resin and incubated with N-WNDP for 10 min at room temperature. 2The amount of N-WNDP bound to the amylose resin was determined from a preliminary analytical purification of a portion of the lysate. Atox1 was then washed off the resin with assay buffer followed by the elution of N-WNDP with 10 mm maltose in the assay buffer. The protein concentration of each sample was measured using the Bradford assay, and the amount of copper bound to each protein was estimated using the BCA assay. The presence of Atox1 in the N-WNDP elution fractions was examined by quantitative Western blot analysis. From the elution fractions, 2 μg of total protein were run on a Tris-Tricine gel (15Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) in parallel with the known amounts of purified Atox1 used to generate a calibration curve. The proteins were transferred to a Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and then immunostained using polyclonal anti-Atox1 antibody at 1:20,000 dilution. The amount of Atox1 in the fractions was quantified by densitometry (Bio-Rad) and compared with the calibration curve. N-WNDP was loaded with copper in cell culture by growing the N-WNDP-expressing cells in the presence of 500 μm CuCl2 as described previously (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Copper-loaded N-WNDP was bound to amylose resin and washed as described above. The increasing amounts of apo-Atox1 were then added to the resin, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Atox1 was washed off the resin followed by elution of N-WNDP with the maltose-containing buffer, and the amount of copper bound to N-WNDP and Atox1 was analyzed. In addition, the accessibility of the cysteines in N-WNDP after the removal of copper by apo-Atox1 was examined using chemical labeling with the residue-specific fluorescent reagent 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) (Molecular Probes). A 60-fold molar excess of CPM was added to N-WNDP, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2.5 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was quenched with an excess of β-mercaptoethanol, and the CPM-labeled protein was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of labeling was quantified using densitometry of fluorescent bands. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amount of protein in the N-WNDP bands was determined by a second round of densitometry. The fluorescence intensity was then normalized to the N-WNDP protein levels. The full-length WNDP was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus-mediated infection, and the membrane fraction containing WNDP was isolated as described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Apo-Atox1 and copper-bound Atox1 were prepared as described above and were dialyzed overnight against the assay buffer containing 100 μm of freshly prepared reducing reagent tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Sigma) prior to incubation with WNDP. For the Atox1-mediated reactivation of WNDP, 50 μg of total membrane protein was resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold assay buffer containing 100 μm TCEP. The copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS, ICN Biomedicals) then was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the membrane protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and BCS was removed. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of assay buffer containing 100 μm TCEP, and the copper-Atox1 complex was added to the mixture at concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were placed on ice for 5 min, radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, specific activity 20 mCi/μmol) was added to 1 μm final concentration, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for additional 4 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of ice-cold 1 mm NaH2PO4 in 50% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 ×g. The protein pellet was washed once with ice-cold water, resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer (5 mmTris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 mDTT, 5% SDS), and loaded on the acidic 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (17Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min and dried on blotting paper. The dried gels were exposed either overnight to the Molecular Imaging Screen-CS (Bio-Rad) or for several hours at −80 °C to Kodak BioMax MS film, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using Bio-Rad molecular imager or Bio-Rad densitometer. The dried gels then were rehydrated, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amount of protein in the WNDP-related bands was determined by a second round of densitometry. The 32P incorporation into WNDP was then normalized to the WNDP protein levels. The results of the initial experiments with apo-Atox1 showed a significant variability. This was most probably attributed to rapid oxidation of the apo-chaperone, because the storage of apo-Atox1 decreased its effects on WNDP and N-WNDP, whereas subsequent treatment of apo-Atox1 with reducing reagent TCEP restored the chaperone function. To make the results reproducible, additional treatment of apo-Atox1 with TCEP was carried out immediately before the reactions with either N-WNDP or the full-length WNDP. 50 μg of the membrane preparation containing WNDP was resuspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer containing 100 μm TCEP, and apo-Atox1 was added to final concentrations indicated in the legend for Fig. 5. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The membrane pellets were then resuspended in 200 μl of assay buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, specific activity 20 mCi/μmol) was added to 1 μm final concentration, and the analysis of catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP was carried out as described above. The generation and characterization of the D1027A mutant of WNDP, which lacks catalytic activity and was used in these experiments as a background control, had been described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To simplify the purification of Atox1 and to obtain the purified protein without a large affinity tag, we generated an expression construct for Atox1 using a pTYB12 vector. In this construct, Atox1 was fused with an intein and a chitin-binding domain (CBD) (Fig.1 A). This enabled us to purify the expressed Atox1-CBD-intein fusion by affinity chromatography on chitin beads and then excise Atox1 from the fusion through the intein-mediated protein cleavage, leaving CBD and intein associated with the beads. The procedure adds three amino acid residues to the amino terminus of Atox1. Fig. 1 B illustrates a typical experiment on the expression and purification of Atox1. The induction of expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside leads to the appearance of the 70-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), consistent with the expression of the Atox1-CBD-intein fusion. The treatment of the fusion protein bound to chitin beads with DTT releases highly pure Atox1 into the solution (Fig. 1 B,lane 5). Judging from the ratio between the uncleaved Atox1 fusion and the CBD-intein fragment, which remains associated with the resin, the efficiency of the cleavage is ∼80% (Fig. 1 B,lane 6). The addition of the copper-glutathione complex to purified Atox1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) generates the metalated chaperone with a typical stoichiometry of 0.85 ± 0.1 copper atoms/Atox1. To determine whether Atox1 can transfer copper to WNDP, we utilized purified N-WNDP bound to amylose resin and a soluble copper-Atox1 complex (Cu·Atox1). Cu·Atox1 was passed through the resin containing bound N-WNDP, the resin was washed, and N-WNDP was then eluted from the resin using the maltose-containing buffer (Fig.2 A). The amount of protein and copper in each elution fraction was analyzed. This protocol allowed for a quick separation of Atox1 and N-WNDP and an easy determination of copper bound to both proteins after the transfer reaction. In agreement with our earlier results (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), control N-WNDP eluted from the amylose resin did not contain measurable amounts of copper (data not shown). In contrast, when N-WNDP was first preincubated with Cu·Atox1 and then eluted, copper was detected in the N-WNDP-containing fractions (Fig. 2 A, fractions 29 and 30), suggesting that copper was transferred from Atox1 to N-WNDP. It was previously shown that Atox1 interacted with N-WNDP and that these interactions could be detected using a protocol similar to the procedure used for our transfer studies (8Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that in our experiments copper co-eluted with N-WNDP as a result of an association of Atox1 with N-WNDP and not because of copper transfer. To eliminate this possibility, we examined the presence of Atox1 in the N-WNDP-containing elution fractions. No Atox1 was detected in the N-WNDP-containing fractions analyzed by gel-electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. However, Atox1 was observed by immunostaining, indicating that small amounts of protein remained associated with N-WNDP after washes of the resin (data not shown). The amount of Atox1 that co-elutes with N-WNDP was determined using quantitative Western blot analysis and purified Atox1 as a standard. These calculations indicate that Atox1 is present in the N-WNDP elution fractions at a molar ratio of ∼0.1 Atox1/N-WNDP and can account for 5–10% total copper bound to N-WNDP. Thus, we conclude that the incubation of Atox1 with N-WNDP leads to a transfer of copper from the chaperone to its target. To characterize the transfer reaction in more detail, the experiments were repeated using a wide range of molar ratios of Atox1 with a 0.85 ± 0.1 copper to protein stoichiometry and N-WNDP. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the incubation of N-WNDP with increasing amounts of Cu·Atox1 leads to a dose-dependent and saturable transfer of copper to N-WNDP. Up to six copper atoms per N-WNDP can be transferred when a 30–40-fold molar excess of Cu·Atox1 over N-WNDP is present. N-WNDP is known to contain six metal-binding sites; therefore, it appears that Atox1 can deliver copper to all metal-binding sites in N-WNDP. A further increase in the amount of added Cu·Atox1 does not lead to an additional binding of copper to N-WNDP, consistent with the idea that the chaperone controls the delivery of copper to specific sites. In N-WNDP, copper is coordinated by Cys residues in the highly conserved GMTCXXC sequence motifs. The binding of copper to N-WNDP in a cell protects these Cys residues against labeling with the fluorescent coumarine maleimide CPM (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A similar decrease in fluorescent labeling of N-WNDP was observed following copper transfer from Cu·Atox1 to N-WNDP (data not shown), suggesting that copper was transferred to Cys residues. Recently, we demonstrated that the full-length WNDP expressed in insect cells was catalytically active and was able to form a phosphorylated acylphosphate intermediate when incubated with ATP (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This catalytic reaction is inhibited by the copper chelator BCS. An addition of copper to the inhibited enzyme restores its activity. We utilized this assay to test whether Cu·Atox1 could reactivate the BCS-treated WNDP by transferring copper to the transporter. The membrane-bound WNDP was incubated with either apo-Atox1 or Cu·Atox1, and [γ-32P]ATP was then added and the ability of WNDP to form an acylphosphate intermediate was analyzed by measuring the amount of radioactivity associated with the WNDP band on an acidic polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig.3 A, the addition of Cu·Atox1 to the BCS-treated WNDP leads to the reactivation of the enzyme, indicating that Cu·Atox1 transfers copper to the WNDP metal-binding sites, which are essential for the stimulation of its catalytic phosphorylation. The lack of WNDP reactivation by apo-Atox1 confirms that copper transfer and not a mere interaction with Atox1 is necessary for the stimulation of the WNDP activity (Fig. 3 A). In the copper transfer experiments shown in Fig. 2, purified N-WNDP was the only protein that could accept copper from Atox1. In contrast, in the membrane preparations used for the reactivation experiments, WNDP represents 2% or less of the total protein (as shown in this study). Thus, it was interesting to compare the ability of Atox1 to transfer copper to purified N-WNDP with its ability to activate WNDP in the presence of a large excess of other proteins. To do that, the amount of WNDP in the membrane fraction was estimated using quantitative Western blot analysis. Atox1 then was added to the BCS-treated WNDP at the same molar ratios that were used previously for the copper transfer experiments with purified N-WNDP. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the effect of copper-Atox1 on catalytic activity was dose-dependent and saturable with a maximum reactivation reached in the presence of a 20–30-fold molar excess of Atox1 over WNDP. Thus, Atox1 was at least as efficient in activating WNDP in the presence of a large excess of unrelated proteins as it was in transferring copper to purified N-WNDP. Also, we compared the efficiency of Cu·Atox1 in the stimulation of the WNDP activity with respect to free copper. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Cu·Atox1 activated WNDP with EC50 equal to 0.18 ± 0.07 μm. Free copper added in the presence of 100 μm ascorbate stimulated the WNDP phosphorylation with comparable EC50 = 0.17 ± 0.04 μm. 3The effective concentration of free copper required to activate WNDP in these experiments was lower than the previously reported value of 1.5 ± 0.6 μm (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This difference is attributed to the modification in the experimental conditions, i.e. the experiments described in this paper were carried out at pH 7.0 and room temperature, whereas previous studies were done at pH 6.0 on ice. It has been proposed that copper transfer from the chaperone to N-WNDP could be reversible (8Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In fact, a reversible copper exchange was demonstrated using the yeast copper-chaperone Atx1 and a purified single metal-binding repeat of the copper-transporting ATPase Ccc2 (18Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether apo-Atox1 can remove copper from WNDP and how the presence of the multiple copper-binding sites in this protein (a situation typical for the eucaryotic copper-ATPases) affects this process. To determine whether copper could be transferred from N-WNDP back to Atox1, N-WNDP loaded with 5–6 copper atoms in cell culture (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was bound to amylose resin and then incubated with 30–40-fold molar excess of purified apo-Atox1. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the addition of apo-Atox1 to the N-WNDP-containing resin leads to a co-elution of the chaperone and copper, indicating that apo-Atox1 was able to strip copper from N-WNDP. However, some copper remained bound to N-WNDP, suggesting that the reverse transfer was partial. To verify these conclusions, the experiments were repeated using a wide range of molar ratios of apo-Atox1 and copper-bound N-WNDP. As shown in Fig.4 B, the addition of increasing amounts of apo-Atox1 to N-WNDP resulted in a saturable decrease in the amount of copper bound to N-WNDP. Interestingly, 3–4 copper atoms can be stripped from N-WNDP using a fairly small excess of apo-Atox1 over N-WNDP, whereas the remaining copper seems to be much less exchangeable. In fact, 1.11 ± 0.11 copper atoms remained associated with N-WNDP even after incubation with a large excess of apo-Atox1, suggesting that one metal-binding site had a much lower affinity for Atox1 or was much less exposed. It was interesting to determine whether removal of copper by apo-Atox1 leaves the Cys residues in N-WNDP in the reduced state and thus available for subsequent loading with copper. To examine the accessibility of cysteines, we carried out the fluorescent labeling of N-WNDP before and after the incubation of N-WNDP with increasing amounts of apo-Atox1. Copper bound to N-WNDP protects cysteine residues in the metal-binding sites against labeling with the fluorescent coumarine maleimide CPM (Fig. 4 C) (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J.

After incubation with apo-Atox1, copper is removed from N-WNDP; the decrease in copper binding is associated with the increase in the fluorescent labeling of Cys in N-WNDP (Fig. 4 C). The availability of the Cys residues for labeling with the fluorescent probe indicates that after copper is removed by the chaperone, these residues remain reduced and available for a new round of copper binding. We have previously proposed that copper binding to N-WNDP regulates the functional activity of WNDP (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ability of apo-Atox1 to remove copper from N-WNDP suggested that treatment of the fully active transporter with apo-Atox1 may decrease the copper occupancy of WNDP and consequently reduce its catalytic activity. To test this hypothesis, the fully active membrane-bound WNDP was incubated with increasing concentrations of apo-Atox1, and subsequently, the chaperone was separated from WNDP by centrifugation. WNDP was resuspended in assay buffer, and its ability to undergo catalytic phosphorylation was measured using [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.5, preincubation with apo-Atox1 leads to a concentration-dependent and saturable reduction of the WNDP activity, presumably because of a reverse transfer of copper from the amino-terminal domain of WNDP to Atox1. Interestingly, even after treatment with a large excess of apo-Atox1, WNDP retains a significant portion of its activity (∼50%), suggesting that the apo-Atox1 removes some but not all coppers from WNDP, leading to the down-regulation of the enzyme. With this work, we began characterizing the biochemical processes important for the distribution of copper from the cytosol to the secretory compartment of human cells. We demonstrate that the previously reported interaction between Atox1 and N-WNDP leads to a transfer of copper from the chaperone to the copper-transporting ATPase and that a maximum of six copper atoms can be transferred from Atox1 to N-WNDP. Furthermore, we found that the addition of increasing amounts of Atox1 to the full-length WNDP led to a concurrent stimulation of the catalytic activity of WNDP measured through the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate. Significantly, this effect was observed using fairly low concentrations of Atox1 (EC50 ≈200 nm). The presence of a large excess of various proteins in the membrane preparation did not interfere with the transfer reaction, suggesting that Cu-Atox1 specifically targeted N-WNDP and activated the transporter. Altogether, our results provide the first experimental demonstration of the direct effect of Atox1 on WNDP function and illustrate that Atox1 can indeed act as a physiological copper donor for this human copper-transporting ATPase. Although it is still technically difficult to make a precise quantitation of how many copper atoms need to be transferred to the full-length WNDP to induce phosphorylation, it is clear that the Atox1-mediated copper transfer correlates with the activation of WNDP. In a cell, such activation would most probably lead to copper transport from the cytosol into the secretory pathway of the cell. It seems particularly interesting that Atox1 cannot only deliver copper to N-WNDP but can also regulate its metal occupancy through the removal of copper. It is possible that in a cell, the ratio of copper-bound and apo-chaperones would fluctuate depending on how much copper is taken up by the cell and how much of it is exported or utilized. Our results suggest that the apo-chaperone is not simply an inert carrier waiting to be occupied by copper. Instead, apo-Atox1 can remove copper from N-WNDP and decrease the activity of the full-length transporter, suggesting that both metalated and apo forms of Atox1 may contribute to the regulation of WNDP. It has been previously shown that the metal-binding sites in N-WNDP are functionally non-equivalent (19Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Only one of them is necessary to sustain the copper transport activity of WNDP (19Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miuna N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the other metal-binding sites in N-WNDP are probably involved in the regulation of the transporter. Our results provide further evidence of distinct properties of the metal-binding sites in N-WNDP. In experiments with apo-Atox1, one copper atom remained bound to N-WNDP even when the chaperone was present in a large excess, suggesting that a certain metal-binding site in N-WNDP was unavailable for interactions with Atox1. This conclusion is in apparent contradiction with the results of the forward transfer experiments in which all of the binding sites in N-WNDP were filled by copper using the copper-Atox1 complex. There are two possible explanations for these results. First, it is possible that in the forward reaction, one of the metal-binding sites in N-WNDP is filled with copper indirectly, i.e. copper is transferred to this site not from Atox1 but from another metal-binding site in N-WNDP. Alternatively, in apo-N-WNDP, all of the metal-binding sites could be available for interactions with the chaperone, whereas in the copper-bound N-WNDP, some sites could be less exposed. This interpretation would be consistent with the results of recent studies from DiDonato et al. (21DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que L., Jr. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the binding of copper to N-WNDP induced the conformational transitions in this protein (21DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que L., Jr. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Experiments are currently underway to understand the sequence of the events during copper transfer to N-WNDP and to identify the site(s) that can retain copper in the presence of excess apo-chaperone. It is also interesting that the incubation of WNDP with apo-Atox1 lowers the WNDP activity to a certain level but does not lead to a full inactivation of the transporter. This finding is in contrast to our earlier results demonstrating that the copper chelator BCS can eliminate WNDP activity (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Apo-Atox1 interacts quite efficiently with WNDP. A dose-dependent curve for the chaperone shows its half-maximum effect at a concentration of 1.0 ± 0.24 μm (Fig. 5), whereas the half-maximum effect of BCS on the WNDP activity was observed only in the presence of 50 μm chelator (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It appears that apo-Atox1, unlike BCS, strips copper only from some presumably “regulatory” metal-binding sites in WNDP, thus down-regulating the enzyme, whereas the site(s) essential for the WNDP activity remains inaccessible to apo-chaperone probably because of steric hindrances. The ability of Atox1 to alter the copper occupancy of N-WNDP and the activity of WNDP in an asymmetric fashion may have important physiological consequences. In a cell, the changes in copper occupancy of WNDP were proposed to affect the intracellular localization (19Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,21DiDonato M. Hsu H.F. Narindrasorasak S. Que L., Jr. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), posttranslational modification (22Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, Atox1 may play a key role in these events by controlling the amount of copper bound to the transporter and hence contribute to the regulation of the intracellular localization or posttranslational modification of WNDP while keeping the transporter active at a wide range of copper concentrations.

Manabe T. Watanabe M. Mamiya T. Ichikawa R. Kiyama Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Inoue Y. Nabeshima T. Mori H. Mishina M. Eur. J.

However, it should be noted that the HNK-1 carbohydrate on NCAM and L1 was shown to negatively regulate their homophilic binding activity. 2K. Ohtsubo, S. Oka, A. Nakamura, Y. Mitsumoto, S. Yamamoto, K. Ono, J. Lütjohann, M. Schachner, U. Rutishauser, and T. Kawasaki, manuscript in preparation. The HNK-1 carbohydrate may weaken the homophilic interaction of CAMs expressed on the synapses and facilitate synaptic plasticity. It should be noted that only a subpopulation of CAMs express the HNK-1 carbohydrate and that the expression is independently regulated from the biosynthesis of CAMs, indicating that the HNK-1 carbohydrate is the characteristic functional component in vivo as a fine tuner that regulates synaptic plasticity or other brain functions. Alternatively the HNK-1 carbohydrate itself may be involved in LTP via interaction with binding proteins (receptors) on the cell surface or in the cell matrix. Several HNK-1 carbohydrate-binding proteins have been identified, such as laminin, selectins, SBP-1, and brevican (25Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J.

However, the association of these receptors or binding proteins with LTP has not been proved.Recently Saghatelyan et al. (29Saghatelyan A.K. Gorissen S. Albert M. Hertlein B. Schachner M. Dityatev A.

This inhibition of perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents by the antibody was also observed in NCAM-deficient mice but not in tenascin-R-deficient mice. The authors suggested that tenascin-R is a carrier molecule for the HNK-1 carbohydrate involved in the regulation of perisomatic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by GABAergic interneurons (29Saghatelyan A.K.

In the present study, however, we detected reduced LTP in the presence of 100 μm picrotoxin that blocks the GABAAreceptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic response, demonstrating that a mechanism other than the reduction of GABAergic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is involved in the attenuation of LTP in GlcAT-P −/− mice.In the present study, we produced mice deficient in GlcAT-P, a glucuronyltransferase, which is involved in biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate.

Manabe T. Watanabe M. Mamiya T. Ichikawa R. Kiyama Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Inoue Y. Nabeshima T. Mori H. Mishina M. Eur. J.

However, it should be noted that the HNK-1 carbohydrate on NCAM and L1 was shown to negatively regulate their homophilic binding activity. 2K. Ohtsubo, S. Oka, A. Nakamura, Y. Mitsumoto, S. Yamamoto, K. Ono, J. Lütjohann, M. Schachner, U. Rutishauser, and T. Kawasaki, manuscript in preparation. The HNK-1 carbohydrate may weaken the homophilic interaction of CAMs expressed on the synapses and facilitate synaptic plasticity. It should be noted that only a subpopulation of CAMs express the HNK-1 carbohydrate and that the expression is independently regulated from the biosynthesis of CAMs, indicating that the HNK-1 carbohydrate is the characteristic functional component in vivo as a fine tuner that regulates synaptic plasticity or other brain functions. Alternatively the HNK-1 carbohydrate itself may be involved in LTP via interaction with binding proteins (receptors) on the cell surface or in the cell matrix. Several HNK-1 carbohydrate-binding proteins have been identified, such as laminin, selectins, SBP-1, and brevican (25Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the association of these receptors or binding proteins with LTP has not been proved. Recently Saghatelyan et al. (29Saghatelyan A.K. Gorissen S. Albert M. Hertlein B. Schachner M. Dityatev A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported that a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the HNK-1 carbohydrate decreased perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents and enhanced LTP in acute slices of the mouse hippocampus. This inhibition of perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents by the antibody was also observed in NCAM-deficient mice but not in tenascin-R-deficient mice. The authors suggested that tenascin-R is a carrier molecule for the HNK-1 carbohydrate involved in the regulation of perisomatic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by GABAergic interneurons (29Saghatelyan A.K. Gorissen S. Albert M. Hertlein B. Schachner M. Dityatev A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3331-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, we detected reduced LTP in the presence of 100 μm picrotoxin that blocks the GABAAreceptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic response, demonstrating that a mechanism other than the reduction of GABAergic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is involved in the attenuation of LTP in GlcAT-P −/− mice. In the present study, we produced mice deficient in GlcAT-P, a glucuronyltransferase, which is involved in biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate. The GlcAT-P −/− mice exhibited gross defects in functions of the nervous system such as LTP in the CA1 region and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. This is the first study to demonstrate the involvement of a carbohydrate, notably of only a single non-reducing terminal carbohydrate residue, in higher ordered brain functions including learning and memory."

Gamma interferon (IFNγ) and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are immunostimulatory cytokines that prime monocytes and prevent endotoxin tolerance. In this study, we show that the deactivating effects of LPS, as well as the priming effects of IFNγ and GM-CSF or their capacity to restore tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production by LPS-tolerized human monocytes are independent of the modulation of TLR2, TLR4, or MD-2. In monocytes pretreated with IFNγ or GM-CSF, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) expression is up-regulated. After LPS stimulation, an increased IRAK kinase activity, a higher MyD88/IRAK association, and a stronger NF-κB activation are observed. In contrast, in LPS-tolerized monocytes, IRAK expression and kinase activity, IRAK/MyD88 association, and NF-κB activation are inhibited. Furthermore, the prevention of tolerance by IFNγ and GM-CSF was independent of IRAK kinase activity. Our results suggest that these cytokines prevent endotoxin tolerance induced by low but not by high doses of LPS by inhibiting IRAK degradation and by promoting its association with MyD88 after a second LPS stimulation, which in turn leads to NF-κB activation and TNF production.

There have been many reports on the reduced capacity of circulating leukocytes from septic patients to produce cytokines as compared with cells from healthy controls. This hyporeactivity, also termed deactivation, has been particularly well studied in isolated monocytes and in whole blood assays. Monocytes from septic patients have a diminished capacity to release TNFα,1 IL-1α and -β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (2Muñoz C. Carlet J. Fitting C. Misset B. Bleriot J.P. Cavaillon J.M. J. Clin.

Sauerwein R.W. Gallati H. Vannice J. van Der Meer J.W.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although a defect in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB has been reported (5Adib-Conquy M. Adrie C. Moine P. Asehnoune K. Fitting C. Pinsky M.R. Dhainaut J.-F. Cavaillon J.-M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism leading to this hyporeactivity remains unknown.This deactivation found in leukocytes from septic patients resembles the phenomenon called endotoxin tolerance. Endotoxin tolerance is defined by a reduced capacity of the host (in vivo) or of cultured leukocytes (in vitro) to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation following a first exposure to this stimulus. Endotoxin tolerance is thought to be an adaptive response that tends to limit the overwhelming inflammation that occurs during bacterial infection, but it may also favor subsequent infections in survivors of septic shock. It is associated with a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and with changes in the cellular levels and composition of NF-κB. Indeed, its has been shown that unlike naive cells, tolerized cells have a predominance of the p50 homodimer of NF-κB (6Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Wedel A. Schraut W. Ströbel M. Wendelgass P. Sterndorf T. Bäuerle P.A. Haas J.G. Riethmüller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17001-17004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in contrast to the p65p50 heterodimer, has a minimal transactivation capacity (7Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 8Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that endotoxin tolerance was associated with a depletion of both forms of NF-κB (9Blackwell T.S. Blackwell T.R. Christman J.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein binds specifically the endotoxins (10Wright S. Ramos R. Tobias P. Ulevitch R. Mathison J. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). However, CD14 lacks an intracellular domain, and LPS signal transduction was shown to be mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) (11Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6380) Google Scholar, 12Yang R.-B. Mark M.R.

TLR family members are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to that of the IL-1R type I (13Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that TLRs and IL-1R share several signaling molecules including adaptor protein MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and TNF receptor-activated factor 6 (TRAF6) (14Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Upon activation, IRAK is recruited to the receptor through MyD88, becomes highly phosphorylated (by autophosphorylation and/or by the action of another kinase), and then relays the signal downstream by interacting with TRAF6. The kinase activity of IRAK does not seem to be essential for signal transduction, because kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK have been shown to induce NF-κB activation (15Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is now clear that TLR4 is necessary for LPS signaling, whereas TLR2 is involved in Gram-positive bacteria signaling (17Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar) except for LPS from Leptospira interrogansand Porphyromonas gingivalis, which have been shown to signal through TLR2 (18Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.-H. Kravchenko V. Saint Girons I. Haake D.A. Godowski P.J. Hayashi F. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Aderem A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Nat.

Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). MD-2, a soluble protein associated with TLR4 at the cell surface, is needed for an efficient signaling in response to endotoxin (20Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). The effect of endotoxin tolerance on the expression of TLR4 has been studied in macrophages of LPS-tolerized mice and has led to conflicting results. One study reported the down-regulation of TLR4 both in terms of mRNA and membrane expression (21Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), whereas in another report, down-regulation of TLR4 was not observed and TLR2 mRNA was found to be up-regulated (22Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that endotoxin tolerance in the monocytic cell line THP-1 was associated with a defect in the formation of the MyD88·IRAK complex (23Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Endotoxin tolerance can be prevented or reversed in vitro by immunostimulatory cytokines such as IFNγ or GM-CSF (24Haas J.G. Meyer N. Riethmüller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Randow F. Docke W.D. Bundschuh D.S. Hartung T. Wendel A. Volk H.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2911-2918PubMed Google Scholar). The monocyte desensitization is prevented if these cytokines are added during the first contact with LPS and is reversed if they are added subsequent to LPS preculture and before the second LPS challenge. Furthermore, GM-CSF was shown to reactivate in vitro the impaired TNFα production by whole blood samples from patients after trauma or cardiopulmonary bypass but not in samples from patients with severe sepsis (26Flohé S. Börgermann J. Dominguez F.E. Majetschak M. Lim L. Kreuzfelder E. Obertacke U. Nast-Kolb D. Schade F.U. Shock. 1999; 12: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IFNγ seems to be more potent than GM-CSF, as it can restore TNFα secretion in monocytes from septic patients (27Döcke W.D. Randow F. Syrbe U. Krausch D. Asadullah K. Reinke P. Volk H.D. Kox W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). IFNγ and GM-CSF can also prevent LPS tolerance inducedin vivo (28Bundschuh D.S. Barsig J. Hartung T. Randow F. Docke W.D. Volk H.D. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2862-2871PubMed Google Scholar).The aim of this study was to gain insight into the mechanisms of prevention of endotoxin tolerance by INFγ and GM-CSF. For this purpose, we studied the expression of TLR4, TLR2, and MD-2 mRNA by RT-PCR, as well as that of TLR4 on the surface of monocytes after exposure to low or high doses of LPS, IFNγ, or GM-CSF. We compared the capacity of these monocytes to activate NF-κB and produce TNF in response to a secondary LPS challenge. We also studied the expression of IRAK both at mRNA and protein levels. Finally, IRAK kinase activity and its association with MyD88 following LPS stimulation were analyzed.DISCUSSIONEndotoxin tolerance in monocytes is characterized by a transient down-regulation of several functions, such as the capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines (32Cavaillon J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This state of hyporesponsiveness to LPS following an exposure to bacterial products can be reversed by IFNγ or GM-CSF. These two cytokines possess immunostimulatory properties; they not only prime resting monocytes but also restore monocytic functions after LPS tolerization (24Haas J.G. Meyer N. Riethmüller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Randow F. Docke W.D. Bundschuh D.S. Hartung T. Wendel A. Volk H.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2911-2918PubMed Google Scholar). IFNγ and GM-CSF have been shown to up-regulate TNF mRNA (24Haas J.G. Meyer N. Riethmüller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Flohé S. Börgermann J. Dominguez F.E. Majetschak M. Lim L. Kreuzfelder E. Obertacke U. Nast-Kolb D. Schade F.U. Shock. 1999; 12: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, priming of monocytes with IFNγ enhanced the activation of NF-κB and increased the half-life of its p65 subunit mRNA (33Hayes M.P. Freeman S.L. Donnelly R.P. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34de Wit H. Hoogstraten D. Halie R.M. Vellenga E. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 228-235PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous studies, we found that IFNγ, and also GM-CSF, enhanced NF-κB nuclear translocation in response to LPS. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB was much more intense after priming with IFNγ than with GM-CSF, although comparable levels of TNF were found in the culture supernatants for both cytokines. Perhaps other mechanisms, such as an enhanced mRNA stability, may contribute to the increased production of TNF in GM-CSF-primed monocytes. In addition, we showed that IFNγ and GM-CSF could restore NF-κB activation, which was otherwise defective, in monocytes tolerized with low doses of LPS. Several authors have shown that LPS tolerance induces modifications in the expression of NF-κB. Some reports show an increase in p50p50 homodimer (6Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Wedel A. Schraut W. Ströbel M. Wendelgass P. Sterndorf T. Bäuerle P.A. Haas J.G. Riethmüller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17001-17004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inactive form of this transcription factor, whereas other studies show a depletion in both p65p50 and p50p50 (9Blackwell T.S. Blackwell T.R. Christman J.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Takasuka N. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4803-4812PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the latter studies, we found that NF-κB nuclear expression was barely induced by LPS in endotoxin-tolerized cells.In the present study, we aimed to gain insights in the precise mechanism of action of IFNγ and GM-CSF in terms of TLR modulation and post-receptor signaling. We showed that the priming effects of IFNγ and GM-CSF were independent of the modulation of TLR4 or MD-2 mRNA. Our results show that MD-2 mRNA, like TLR2, which is not involved in E. coli LPS signaling, is not significantly modulated by IFNγ, GM-CSF, and high or low doses of LPS. We found a significant up-regulation of TLR4 mRNA by IFNγ but not with GM-CSF, whereas both cytokines primed monocytes similarly. Conversely, LPS at 100 ng/ml did not down-regulate TLR4 mRNA, but this concentration of LPS led to a profound defect in TNF production in response to a subsequent endotoxin stimulation. The literature differs on the effects of LPS on TLR4 expression, but this is most likely because of differences in timing or the cell types. Indeed, an up-regulation of TLR4 mRNA has been observed in the hours following LPS stimulation of monocytes, neutrophils, or endothelial cells (36Muzio M. Bosisio D. Polentarutti N. D'amico G. Stoppacciaro A. Mancinelli R. van't Veer C. Penton-Rol G. Ruco L.P. Allavena P. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5998-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 37Faure E. Thomas L., Xu, H. Medvedev A.E. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, for mouse macrophages, the levels of TLR4 mRNA after 20–24 h were similar to those found in untreated cells (22Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 38Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Mühlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) or even below base line (39Matsuguchi T. Musikacharoen T. Ogawa T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5767-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). TLR4 mRNA was still up-regulated 24 h after LPS stimulation in one study dealing with cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells (40Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.-D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Similarly to cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells (37Faure E. Thomas L., Xu, H. Medvedev A.E. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 40Frantz S. Kobzik L. Kim Y.-D. Fukazawa R. Medzhitov R. Lee R.T. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), we observed that IFNγ up-regulated TLR4 mRNA expression in human monocytes, but in contrast to endothelial cells, it had no effect on TLR2.We did not find an agreement between mRNA levels and surface expression of TLR4, which emphasizes that the analysis of TLR should not be limited to the mRNA expression as seen in a number of previous studies. Our data indicate that the priming effects of IFNγ and GM-CSF and the reversal of endotoxin tolerance by these cytokines were independent of TLR4 surface expression. Our observation of a dissociation between LPS-induced deactivation and TLR4 expression is consistent with a recent report showing that overexpression of TLR4 and MD-2 in a CD14-positive Chinese hamster ovary cell line could not overcome endotoxin tolerance (41Medvedev A.E. Henneke P. Schromm A. Lien E. Ingalls R. Fenton M. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, a mycoplasmal lipopeptide has been reported to induced cross-tolerance to a subsequent LPS stimulation without affecting the surface expression of the TLR4·MD2 complex on mouse peritoneal macrophages (38Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Mühlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, some studies performed on mouse peritoneal macrophages, or the THP-1 cell line, have shown that tolerization with E. coli LPS was associated with a down-regulation of TLR4 surface expression (21Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 38Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Mühlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Martin M. Katz J. Vogel S.N. Michalek S.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5278-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We did not find this to be the case for human monocytes; perhaps the effect of LPS on TLR4 expression also depends on the differentiation stage of the cells and/or the compartment they derive from.As LPS tolerance prevention by IFNγ and GM-CSF was not linked to TLR4 expression, we further analyzed the effect of these cytokines on the signaling pathway downstream the receptor. The immunostimulatory effect of IFNγ and GM-CSF may be explained by their capacity to up-regulate IRAK expression and to induce a more important and sustained MyD88·IRAK association in response to LPS. On the contrary, LPS-tolerized monocytes expressed less IRAK than untreated cells. When the cells were tolerized with a low dose of endotoxin (1 ng/ml), MyD88·IRAK association was still found; however, the complex rapidly dissociated after the second LPS stimulation. IRAK down-regulation was more pronounced for the cells tolerized with 100 ng/ml LPS; consequently we barely detected any IRAK·MyD88 complexes in these cells. These results are in accordance with a recent study on the monocytic cell line THP-1, in which a defect of association between MyD88 and IRAK was found after LPS tolerization (23Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In the former study, the cells were tolerized with 100 ng/ml LPS. In the present study, using human monocytes, we show that at this concentration of endotoxin, IFNγ or GM-CSF could not reverse the defect in IRAK expression. In contrast, the reversal was possible in cells tolerized with a low concentration of LPS, where both IFNγ and GM-CSF induced an up-regulation of IRAK and its association with MyD88 in response to LPS challenge. The time course analysis of IRAK expression at protein and mRNA levels suggests that the up-regulation of this protein by IFNγ and GM-CSF at 1 ng/ml LPS is due to an inhibition of its degradation rather than to increased transcription. IFNγ has been shown to affect proteasome complex composition and to decrease the level of 26 S proteasome, which is responsible for the degradation of short-lived cellular proteins, including ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (43Bose S. Brooks P. Mason G.G.F. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In monocytes tolerized with 1 ng/ml LPS, IRAK association with MyD88 was induced in a stronger manner by IFNγ than by GM-CSF, which also corresponds to a stronger NF-κB activation. This may thus explain the fact that GM-CSF was only reversing the tolerization, whereas IFNγ induced a 5–10-fold higher TNF production as compared with untreated cells.Similar to a study performed on the THP-1 cell line (23Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we found that endotoxin tolerance, induced by 100 ng/ml as well as 1 ng/ml LPS, resulted in a defect in IRAK kinase activity. Pretreatment of monocytes with IFNγ or GM-CSF enhanced the kinase activity of IRAK. However, the presence of these cytokines did not prevent the inhibition of IRAK kinase activity by LPS tolerization. Nevertheless, monocytes tolerized with 1 ng/ml LPS in the presence of IFNγ or GM-CSF were not impaired for NF-κB activation and TNF production in response to a subsequent LPS stimulation. Thus, IRAK kinase activity seems to be dispensable for NF-κB activation and TNF production in human monocytes. These results are in accordance with previous studies performed on cell lines, showing that IRAK signaling capacity is independent of its kinase activity and that kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK could still activate NF-κB (15Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In summary, our study shows that IFNγ and GM-CSF prime human monocytes by up-regulating IRAK protein expression and kinase activity and by promoting its association with MyD88 following LPS stimulation. These cytokines can also reverse endotoxin tolerance by inhibiting IRAK degradation and by restoring IRAK/MyD88 association but only when the tolerization has been performed with low doses of LPS. Despite the major progress achieved thanks to antibiotherapy, the frequency and severity of nosocomial infections and the occurrence of sepsis syndrome remain major problems in Western countries (1Randel-Frausto M. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1999; 13: 299-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There have been many reports on the reduced capacity of circulating leukocytes from septic patients to produce cytokines as compared with cells from healthy controls. This hyporeactivity, also termed deactivation, has been particularly well studied in isolated monocytes and in whole blood assays. Monocytes from septic patients have a diminished capacity to release TNFα,1 IL-1α and -β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (2Muñoz C. Carlet J. Fitting C. Misset B. Bleriot J.P. Cavaillon J.M. J. Clin.

Sauerwein R.W. Gallati H. Vannice J. van Der Meer J.W.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although a defect in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB has been reported (5Adib-Conquy M. Adrie C. Moine P. Asehnoune K. Fitting C. Pinsky M.R. Dhainaut J.-F. Cavaillon J.-M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism leading to this hyporeactivity remains unknown. This deactivation found in leukocytes from septic patients resembles the phenomenon called endotoxin tolerance. Endotoxin tolerance is defined by a reduced capacity of the host (in vivo) or of cultured leukocytes (in vitro) to respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation following a first exposure to this stimulus. Endotoxin tolerance is thought to be an adaptive response that tends to limit the overwhelming inflammation that occurs during bacterial infection, but it may also favor subsequent infections in survivors of septic shock. It is associated with a decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and with changes in the cellular levels and composition of NF-κB. Indeed, its has been shown that unlike naive cells, tolerized cells have a predominance of the p50 homodimer of NF-κB (6Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Wedel A. Schraut W. Ströbel M. Wendelgass P.

Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). However, CD14 lacks an intracellular domain, and LPS signal transduction was shown to be mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) (11Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C., Du, X.

TLR family members are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to that of the IL-1R type I (13Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that TLRs and IL-1R share several signaling molecules including adaptor protein MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and TNF receptor-activated factor 6 (TRAF6) (14Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Upon activation, IRAK is recruited to the receptor through MyD88, becomes highly phosphorylated (by autophosphorylation and/or by the action of another kinase), and then relays the signal downstream by interacting with TRAF6. The kinase activity of IRAK does not seem to be essential for signal transduction, bec"

Co-expression in HEK-293 cells of SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope (NF-SLN), PLN, and SERCAs followed by measurement of the Ca(2+) dependence of Ca(2+) transport activity in isolated microsomal fractions showed that NF-SLN can reduce the apparent Ca(2+) affinity of both SERCA1a (DeltaK(Ca) = -0.22 +/- 0.01 pCa units) and SERCA2a (DeltaK(Ca) = -0.37 +/- 0.04 pCa units). When SERCA1a or SERCA2a were co-expressed with both NF-SLN and PLN, inhibition was synergistic, reducing DeltaK(Ca) by about -1.0 pCa units. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that NF-SLN increased the binding of PLN to SERCA, whereas PLN did not increase the binding of NF-SLN to SERCA. Elevated Ca(2+) dissociates both PLN and NF-SLN from their complexes with both SERCA1a and SERCA2a, but NF-SLN induced resistance to Ca(2+) dissociation of the PLN.SERCA complex. Co-immunoprecipitation of PLN and NF-SLN without SERCA showed that NF-SLN binds directly to PLN and that NF-SLN inhibits the formation of PLN pentamers. Thus the ability of NF-SLN to elevate the content of PLN monomers can account, at least in part, for the superinhibitory effects of NF-SLN in the presence of PLN."
https://openalex.org/W2126326932,"α-Synuclein, an acidic neuronal protein of 140 amino acids, is extremely heat-resistant and is natively unfolded. Recent studies have demonstrated that α-synuclein has chaperone activity both in vitro and in vivo, and that this activity is lost upon removing its C-terminal acidic tail. However, the detailed mechanism of the chaperone action of α-synuclein remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the chaperone action of α-synuclein by analyzing the roles of its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–95) was found to bind to substrate proteins to form high molecular weight complexes, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail (residues 96–140) appears to be primarily involved in solubilizing the high molecular weight complexes. Because the substrate-binding domain and the solubilizing domain for chaperone function are well separated in α-synuclein, the N-terminal-binding domain can be substituted by other proteins or peptides. Interestingly, the resultant engineered chaperone proteins appeared to display differential efficiency and specificity in terms of the chaperone function, which depended upon the nature of the binding domain. This finding implies that the C-terminal acidic tail of α-synuclein can be fused with other proteins or peptides to engineer synthetic chaperones for specific purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2004793363,"The mating response of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Although signal transmission by such pathways has been modeled in detail, postreceptor down-regulation is less well understood. The pheromone-responsive G protein α subunit (Gα) of yeast down-regulates the mating signal, but its targets are unknown. We have found that Gα binds directly to the mating-specific MAPK in yeast cells responding to pheromone. This interaction contributes both to modulation of the mating signal and to the chemotropic response, and it demonstrates direct communication between the top and bottom of a Gα-MAPK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2024750606,"Acrolein, a representative carcinogenic aldehyde that could be ubiquitously generated in biological systems under oxidative stress, shows facile reactivity with the ε-amino group of lysine to formN ε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (FDP-lysine) as the major product (Uchida, K., Kanematsu, M., Morimitsu, Y., Osawa, T., Noguchi, N., and Niki, E. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16058–16066). In the present study, we determined the electrophilic potential of FDP-lysine and established a novel mechanism of protein thiolation in which the FDP-lysine generated in the acrolein-modified protein reacts with sulfhydryl groups to form thioether adducts. When a sulfhydryl enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was incubated with acrolein-modified bovine serum albumin in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C, a significant loss of sulfhydryl groups, which was accompanied by the loss of enzyme activity and the formation of high molecular mass protein species (>200 kDa), was observed. The FDP-lysine adduct generated in the acrolein-modified protein was suggested to represent a thiol-reactive electrophile based on the following observations. (i)N α-acetyl-FDP-lysine, prepared from the reaction of N α-acetyl lysine with acrolein, was covalently bound to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (ii) The FDP-lysine derivative reacted with glutathione to form a GSH conjugate. (iii) The acrolein-modified bovine serum albumin significantly reacted with GSH to form a glutathiolated protein. Furthermore, the observation that the glutathiolated acrolein-modified protein showed decreased immunoreactivity with an anti-FDP-lysine monoclonal antibody suggested that the FDP-lysine residues in the acrolein-modified protein served as the binding site of GSH. These data suggest that thiolation of the protein-bound acrolein may be involved in redox alteration under oxidative stress, whereby oxidative stress generates the increased production of acrolein and its protein adducts that further potentiate oxidative stress via the depletion of GSH in the cells. Acrolein, a representative carcinogenic aldehyde that could be ubiquitously generated in biological systems under oxidative stress, shows facile reactivity with the ε-amino group of lysine to formN ε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (FDP-lysine) as the major product (Uchida, K., Kanematsu, M., Morimitsu, Y., Osawa, T., Noguchi, N., and Niki, E.

The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by reactive aldehydic intermediates such as 2-alkenals and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (3Shacter E. Drug. Metab. Rev. 2000; 32: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

These reactive aldehydes are considered important mediators of cell damage because of their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and cause mutations (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). 2-Alkenals represent a group of highly reactive aldehydes containing two electrophilic reaction centers. A partially positive carbon 1 or 3 in such molecules can attack a nucleophile such as a protein. Among all the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, acrolein is by far the strongest electrophile (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Acrolein is widely found in the environment and is formed in cells via lipid peroxidation (7Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Its high reactivity indeed makes this aldehyde a dangerous substance for the living cell. A number of reports have appeared describing the damaging effects of acrolein on the tracheal ciliatory movement (8Kensler C.J. Battista S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1963; 269: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the pulmonary wall (9Izard C. Liberman C. Mutat. Res. 1978; 47: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that acrolein reduces the colony-forming efficiency of mammalian cells, forms cyclic adducts with nucleosides in vitro, and is a potent mutagen (5Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Moreover, acrolein was shown to initiate urinary bladder carcinogenesis in rats (10Cohen S.M. Garland E.M., St. John M. Okamura T. Smith R.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3577-3581PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the reaction of protein with acrolein and identified a novel acrolein-lysine adduct,N ε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (FDP-lysine),1 as the major product (7Uchida K.

In addition, by using a monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) against FDP-lysine, we have shown that FDP-lysine recognized by the antibody indeed constitutes the atherosclerotic lesions in which intense positivity is primarily associated with macrophage-derived foam cells (11Uchida K.

These findings and the in vitro observations (7Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol.

In the present study, we found that FDP-lysine is not the end product but is the electrophilic intermediate that potently reacts with thiol compounds. Moreover, we established a novel mechanism of protein thiolation in which FDP-lysine generated in the acrolein-modified protein undergoes the nucleophilic addition of thiols. In addition to the mechanisms for proteinS-thiolation, our present findings suggest an alternative mechanism that utilizes the acrolein-lysine adduct (FDP-lysine) as a potential thiol-binding site. N α-acetyl-l-lysine, acrolein, GSH, N α-acetylcysteine, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. The horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was measured with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed using a Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) operated in the linear mode. N α-Acetyl-FDP-lysine was prepared by incubating 100 mm N α-acetyl lysine with 100 mmacrolein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C. N α-acetyl-FDP-lysine was purified by a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Nomura Chemicals, Seto, Japan) equilibrated in a solution of 5% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 227 nm. The chemical structure ofN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine was confirmed by the LC-MS analysis and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectrometries (7Uchida K.

BSA (1.0 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 mm acrolein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then applied to a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to separate the acrolein-modified protein from the free acrolein. The amount of FDP-lysine generated in the acrolein-modified BSA was examined by amino acid analysis as previously reported (7Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol.

Rabbit muscle GAPDH (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with acrolein-modified BSA (0–0.1 mg/ml) orN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine (0–1 mm) in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at 37 °C. The enzyme activity of GAPDH was measured as previously reported (12Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6388-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was assayed in 3 ml of 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate containing 30 mm sodium arsenate buffer (pH 8.5). The reaction of GAPDH was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 7.5 mm NAD, 100 μl of 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μl of 15 mmdl-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured. The amount of the sulfhydryl group was fluorometrically measured according to the method of Hissin and Hilf (36Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.8 ml of 0.1 m phosphate solution (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 μl of theo-phthalaldehyde solution (1 mg/ml) were added to the reaction mixture (100 μl), and then the fluorescence intensity at 420 nm was determined with activation at 350 nm. N α-Acetyl-FDP-lysine (1 mm) was incubated withN α-acetylcysteine (10 mm) or GSH (10 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. The reaction products ofN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine with GSH were examined by reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in a solution of 5% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 227 nm. The acrolein-modified BSA (1.0 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 mmGSH in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the protein samples was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, the proteins were hydrolyzedin vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were then concentrated and dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system. To coat the wells of the microtiter plate, 100 μl/well poly-l-lysine (1 mm, lysine equivalent) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was used and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washing with TBS containing 10% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween), 100 μl of the acrolein solution (10 mm) was added to the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing with TBS/Tween, each well was filled with 200 ml of Block Ace solution (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The anti-FDP-lysine monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) was then added to the wells at 100 μl/well of 10 mg/ml solution for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with TBS/Tween, 100 μl/well peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum (1:4000) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of 0.05m citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.4 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H2O2was added and incubated for several minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. A gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with mAb5F6. This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment and ECL reagents (AmershamBiosciences). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. Based on the fact that the major acrolein-lysine adduct FDP-lysine (Fig.1) retains an electrophilic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde moiety, we hypothesized that this adduct might react with nucleophiles such as the sulfhydryl groups of proteins via the Michael addition reaction. Hence, we examined the potential reactivity of the acrolein-modified proteins toward sulfhydryl enzymes using GAPDH as a convenient model protein that contains four sulfhydryl groups per subunit and is known to be highly sensitive to inactivation by α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in vitro (12Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6388-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, when GAPDH (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with native BSA or acrolein-modified BSA (0–0.1 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C, the acrolein-modified BSA showed a significant inhibitory effect on the GAPDH activity. The concentration of acrolein-modified BSA up to 0.01 mg/ml had no detectable effect, whereas treatment with high concentrations (> 0.02 mg/ml) of the modified protein resulted in a significant reduction of the GAPDH activity; the enzyme activity decreased to 65% of the control values of the untreated GAPDH as the concentration of acrolein-modified BSA was increased to 0.1 mg/ml. In accordance with the loss of enzyme activity, the amount of cysteine (sulfhydryl groups) decreased to 50% of the initial value as the concentration of the acrolein-modified BSA was varied from 0 to 0.1 mg/ml (Fig. 2 B). To examine the covalent binding of the acrolein-modified BSA with GAPDH, the incubation mixtures of the acrolein-modified BSA treated with GAPDH were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the acrolein-modified BSA migrated as a broad protein band with the molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, whereas the acrolein-modified protein was converted to a higher molecular mass protein species with >200 kDa, strongly suggesting that the acrolein-modified protein was covalently bound to GAPDH. These data suggest that acrolein modification of the protein results in the generation of an electrophilic adduct that possesses reactivity toward the thiol protein. This proposition was supported by the observation that pretreatment of the acrolein-modified BSA with GSH resulted in a decrease in the inhibitory effect on the GAPDH activity (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2Inactivation of GAPDH by acrolein-modified protein.

The acrolein-modified BSA was prepared upon the incubation of BSA (1.0 mg/ml) with 10 mmacrolein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then applied to a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to separate the acrolein-modified protein from the free acrolein. In panels A and B, GAPDH (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with native BSA or acrolein-modified BSA (0–0.1 mg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C. In panel C, acrolein-modified BSA (1.0 mg/ml) was incubated with GAPDH (0–1.0 mg/ml) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C. In panel D, acrolein-modified BSA (1.0 mg/ml) was treated with GSH (0–10 mm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h prior to the incubation with GAPDH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether FDP-lysine is involved in the inactivation of GAPDH upon incubation with acrolein-modified BSA, the enzyme was treated with various concentrations (0–1 mm) ofN α-acetyl lysine orN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 4 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the GAPDH activity decreased to 65% of the initial value as the concentration of the FDP-lysine derivative was varied from 0 to 1 mm. The loss of enzyme activity was associated with the decrease in the amount of the cysteine residues (sulfhydryl groups) (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 C, there is a linear correlation between the loss of catalytic activity and the loss of sulfhydryl groups from GAPDH. In addition, the inhibitory effect of FDP-lysine on the enzyme activity was significantly retarded by the addition of GSH (Fig.3 D). To further examine the mechanism of inactivation of GAPDH caused byN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine, the native and FDP-lysine-treated GAPDHs were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 4, the analysis of native GAPDH revealed a peak with m/z 35,699. When GAPDH was incubated with 5 mm N α-acetyl-FDP-lysine in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C, some unmodified GAPDH subunits were observed (m/z35,749) as well as the peaks (m/z 35,993, 36,263, and 36,539) corresponding to the addition of from one to three molecules of the FDP-lysine derivative per subunit. Sequential peaks in the spectrum of the FDP-lysine/GAPDH all differed in molecular mass by ∼270–290 Da, values which were close to the molecular mass ofN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine (282 Da). This increase in the molecular mass provides strong evidence that the reaction between FDP-lysine and protein nucleophiles, such as thiols, occurred via the Michael addition reaction. We then investigated the products formed by the reaction of the FDP-lysine with thiol compounds such asN α-acetylcysteine and GSH. As shown in Fig.5, when 10 mm N α-acetyl-FDP-lysine was incubated with 10 mm N α-acetylcysteine (panel A) or 10 mm GSH (panel B) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), the consumption of both the FDP-lysine and the thiol compounds was immediately observed within 1 h, suggesting the covalent binding of the FDP-lysine with these thiols. To detect an FDP-lysine-thiol conjugate,N α-acetyl-FDP-lysine was incubated with an equimolar concentration of GSH in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h, and the products were analyzed by LC-MS. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the reaction of the FDP-lysine derivative with GSH indeed provided the new products (products a and b), which gave a pseudomolecular ion peak (M+H)+ atm/z 589 (Fig. 6 B) corresponding to the expected GSH conjugate withN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine. Among other possibilities, the products a and b may represent the isomeric forms of the GSH-FDP-lysine conjugate. The GSH conjugates of FDP-lysine were relatively unstable, and we were not successful in stably isolating the conjugates. The adductions may be reversed in aqueous buffer, which leads to the reversible binding of GSH to FDP-lysine. The involvement of a Michael-type addition of a sulfhydryl group to the ethylenic bond of FDP moiety was also suggested by the observation that the UV light absorption spectrum of theN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine showed a maximum at 227 nm, whereas the spectrum of theN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine adducts ofN-acetylcysteine and GSH exhibited a maximum at 204 nm.Figure 6Formation of GSH-FDP-lysine conjugate. A, HPLC profile of the reaction mixture ofN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine and GSH.N α-Acetyl-FDP-lysine was incubated with an equimolar concentration of GSH in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h, and the products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in a solution of 5% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min.

The mixture was analyzed with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The products were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0, 100% solvent A; 40 min, 60% solvent A), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min.

E, schematic illustration of GSH binding to the FDP-lysine adduct.AU, absorbance unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is notable that the GSH-FDP-lysine conjugate has a free aldehyde group that would be detectable by reaction with a carbonyl reagent. To examine whether the conjugate indeed possesses a carbonyl function, we exposed the reaction mixture ofN α-acetyl-FDP-lysine and GSH to an excess carbonyl reagent, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), and the products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the products corresponding to the conjugates reacted with the carbonyl reagent and provided the new products, c and d. The LC-MS analysis of the products gave the same pseudomolecular ion peak (M+H)+ at m/z 770 (Fig.6 D), which corresponded to the expected dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative of the GSH-FDP-lysine conjugate. These data also support our proposition that FDP-lysine reacts with GSH to form a GSH conjugate via a Michael addition reaction (Fig.6 E). We have shown previously that, upon in vitro incubation of low-density lipoproteins with acrolein, the lysine residues that disappeared are partially recovered by the FDP-lysine (7Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Based on the results of Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, it is likely that the FDP-lysine residues generated in the acrolein-modified proteins may react with GSH to form a glutathiolated protein. Prior to investigation of the glutathiolation of the acrolein-modified proteins, we examined the covalent binding of acrolein to the protein (BSA) and the formation of the FDP-lysine by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid analysis, respectively. As shown in Fig.7 A, the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the native BSA and acrolein-treated BSA revealed the peaks of 66,541 and 74,097, respectively, indicating that a substantial amount of acrolein was incorporated into the protein. When BSA (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 1 mm acrolein in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C, the molecular mass increase that was observed corresponds to ∼135 acrolein molecules per protein molecule, based on the 56-Da molecular mass of acrolein (Fig.7 B). We then determined the amount of FDP-lysine in the acrolein-modified BSA by amino acid analysis. As shown in Fig.7 C, the incubation of BSA with acrolein resulted in the loss of up to 51 lysine residues per mol of BSA at 24 h. These losses were accompanied by the formation of the FDP-lysine. The concentration reached about 20 molecules of FDP-lysine per protein molecule after a 1-h incubation. This accounted for about 40% of the lysine residues that had disappeared. Because formation of one FDP-lysine involves the loss of one H2O molecule, and the corresponding mass shift would be 94, ∼25% of the molecular mass increase in the acrolein (10 mm)-modified BSA can be accounted for by the formation of the FDP-lysine. To examine whether acrolein-modified proteins react with GSH, the acrolein-modified BSA was incubated with GSH and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the GSH-treated BSA did not show any change in molecular weight (m/z 66,596), whereas the GSH-treated acrolein-modified BSA gave a molecular ion peak, the center of which corresponds to m/z78,339 as (M+H)+. Upon incubation of the acrolein-modified BSA (1 mg/ml) with GSH (10 mm) at 37 °C, a time-dependent incorporation of GSH into the protein was observed (Fig. 7 D). The binding of GSH to the acrolein-modified BSA reached a plateau after 6 h of incubation. On the basis of the known masses of GSH (307 Da), ∼14 molecules of GSH were incorporated into the protein at 6 h. We have previously raised a monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) against the acrolein-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin and showed that the antibody recognizes the FDP-lysine as the major epitope (11Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsuda M. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E. Osawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we examined the changes in the immunoreactivity of the GSH-treated acrolein-modified protein with mAb5F6. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the acrolein-modified BSA showed a potent immunoreactivity with the antibody, whereas incubation of the acrolein-modified BSA (1 mg/ml) with 10 mm GSH resulted in a significant decrease in the antigenicity of the protein (although the antigenicity of the acrolein-modified BSA was scarcely affected by 5 mm GSH). These data suggested that GSH is directly bound to the FDP-lysine residues in the acrolein-modified protein, leading to decreased immunoreactivity with the antibody. To further obtain evidence that the FDP-lysine residues generated in the acrolein-modified protein served as the binding-site of GSH, poly-l-lysine was coated on the immunoplate and sequentially incubated with acrolein and GSH, and changes in the immunoreactivity of the acrolein-modified poly-l-lysine with mAb5F6 after treatment with GSH were examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the immunoreactivity of the acrolein-modified poly-l-lysine with mAb5F6 was significantly decreased after treatment with GSH. These data strongly suggest that GSH primarily reacts with the FDP-lysine residues in the acrolein-modified proteins. A growing body of evidence suggests that many of the effects of cellular dysfunction under oxidative stress are mediated by the products of t"

It decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface of infected cells. V1H is the regulatory subunit H of the vacuolar membrane ATPase (V-ATPase). Previously, the interaction between Nef and V1H has been found to facilitate the internalization of CD4, suggesting that V1H could connect Nef to the endocytic machinery. In this study, we demonstrate that V1H binds to the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef from HIV-1 and to the medium chain (μ2) of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) in vitro and in vivo. The interaction sites of V1H and μ2 were mapped to a central region in V1H from positions 133 to 363, which contains 4 armadillo repeats, and to the N-terminal adaptin-binding domain in μ2 from positions 1 to 145. Fusing Nef to V1H reproduced the appropriate trafficking of Nef. This chimera internalized CD4 even in the absence of the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef. Finally, blocking the expression of V1H decreased the enhancement of virion infectivity by Nef. Thus, V1H can function as an adaptor for interactions between Nef and AP-2.

By interacting with molecules associated with the T cell antigen receptor, Nef activates infected cells (11Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M.

Nef also decreases the expression of class I major histocompatibility complex determinants on the cell surface, thus protecting infected cells from cytotoxic T cells (15Schwartz O. Marechal V.

Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Finally, Nef internalizes CD4, which is the major receptor for HIV and SIV, thus preventing the superinfection of infected cells and interference with virus release and infectivity (17Benson R.E.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), its absence on infected cells could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. This variety of different functions is mediated by distinct sequence motifs within Nef (21Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).

They include the tyrosine-based motif, YXXφ, where X and φ are any and bulky hydrophobic amino acids, respectively, and the dileucine-based motif, LL or Lφ, which often is preceded by an acidic residue at position −4 (33Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Both sorting motifs use distinct saturable components on adaptor protein complexes (33Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For the tyrosine-based motif, the interaction is mediated by the medium chains of adaptor protein complexes. Indeed, Nef from SIV binds AP-2 via its N-terminal YXXL sequence (28Piguet V. Chen Y.L. Mangasarian A. Foti M. Carpentier J.L. Trono D.

Nef from HIV-1, however, lacks this N-terminal tyrosine-based motif but interacts with AP complexes via its C-terminal flexible loop, which contains a consensus dileucine-based motif (23Bresnahan P.A.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The downstream motif, which is highly conserved among different nef alleles, is required for the internalization of CD4 by Nef as well as for its interaction with the subunit H of the vacuolar membrane ATPase, V1H (27Lu X.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This study focuses on V1H, which is the 56-kDa regulatory subunit H of the universal proton pump (37Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 38Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is required for the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes and binds AP-2 (37Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 39Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, V1H could be a connector for Nef, which would carry CD4 from CCP to lysosomes for its degradation. To this end, we performed binding and internalization studies, which revealed that V1H binds Nef and the μ-chain of AP-2 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, when the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef was mutated or deleted, V1H fused to this truncated Nef protein could perform all the internalization functions of its wild-type counterpart. These findings fulfilled the structural and functional criteria for V1H as an adaptor between Nef and AP-2. Additionally, our results suggest that V1H plays a central role in the enhancement of virion infectivity by Nef. COS, 293T, and Sx22-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. COS and 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of experimental and 20 μg of carrier DNA (salmon sperm DNA from Sigma), respectively, at 250 volts at 960 microfarads. 48 h after the transfection cells were subjected to various analyses. All plasmid constructions for cell transfections were made into the pEF-BOS vector system. Plasmids CT, CN, Nef, NefED-AA, and V1H were described previously (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For this study, plasmids CV1H, CNV1H, NefV1H, NefED-AAV1H, and Nef160V1H were constructed as follows: HA-V1H (GenBankTM accession numberAF298777) was generated by PCR cloning, inserting the full-length HA-V1H into the SalI and ClaI sites of pEF-BOS. The HA sequence was placed at the 5′ end. CT, CN, Nef, NefED-AA, and Nef160 were amplified by PCR from DNA using primers with XbaI and SalI linkers. Amplified fragments were inserted into XbaI andSalI sites of HA-V1H. GST-V1H fusion proteins were amplified by PCR with EcoRI (5′) and SalI (3′) restriction sites for V1H-(1–483) and V1H-(1–363) or with BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites for V1H-(133–483), -(133–363), and -(362–483). All fragments were inserted into the pGEX-4T1 vector (AmershamBiosciences). The plasmid encoding μ2 was a generous gift from Juan S. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health) (40Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Plasmids μ2-(1–145) and μ2-(119–435) for in vitro translation with the T7-promotor were cloned into the T7-plink2 vectors usingBamHI and XhoI, e.g. NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. All plasmid constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. 48 h later, the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies (BD PharMingen) for 30 min on ice. Stained cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and were subjected to FACS analyses (FACSCalibur, BD PharMingen) using the CELL-QUEST program. CD4 kinetic internalization assays were performed as described recently (34Mandic R. Fackler O.T. Geyer M. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.-H. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 293T cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of a CD4 expressing plasmid together with 5 μg of the respective Nef (Nef), loop mutant Nef (NefED-AA), and Nef-V1H (Nef160V1H) fragment effectors. For evaluation of the kinetic internalization rates, the geometric mean fluorescence of the different time points was measured by FACS analysis. The geometric mean fluorescence of the time point at 0 min was subtracted from the respective values at 5, 10, and 15 min to calculate the level of CD4 internalization. GST-V1H fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia colistrain DH5α and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) with a modified lysis buffer containing 50 mmHepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Expressed proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The purity of fusion proteins was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE and their concentration was determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 35S-Labeled hybrid CD8-Nef proteins and the μ2 chain were transcribed and translated using the rabbit reticulocyte system (TNT, Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of translated proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A C-terminal His-tagged version of μ2 was expressed from pcDNA3, and HA-tagged V1H was expressed from pEF-Bos in COS cells. For the immune precipitation, mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was coupled to tosyl-activated Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Lake Success, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used to precipitate HA-tagged V1H from cell lysates obtained in buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL) at 4 °C for 60 min. The beads were washed 3 times with buffer I and resuspended in SDS sample buffer to elute bound proteins. 293T cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid encoding HA-V1H protein. 24 h later cells were starved for methionine and cysteine in methionine- and cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h, then labeled by adding 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for an additional 4 h. After washing 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO3. Lysates were clarified and immunoprecipitation was performed on the supernatants utilizing 1 μg of the 12CA5 mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody or preimmune serum followed by incubation with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 4 times and subjected to 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For interactions between Nef and V1H, 0.2 μg of Nef was incubated with 20 μl of hybrid GST-V1H protein or glutathione S-transferase (GST) beads and the indicated amounts of inhibitory LL/ED or control oligopeptides in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm NaVO3 (kinase buffer) for 2 h. Beads were washed 4 times in the kinase buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a mouse anti-Nef antibody (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For the mapping of the interaction sites between V1H and μ2, about 7 μl of the respective GST-V1H protein fragments were incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled μ2 protein fragments for 2–3 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of kinase buffer. Beads were then washed 3 times in the same buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For virus production in Jurkat cells, 1 μg of proviral DNA of HIV-1NL4-3 and its counterpart deleted in the nef gene HIV-1NL4-3ΔNef (a kind gift from J. Guatelli, University of California, San Diego) along with 0–3 μg of AS-V1H plasmid were transfected into 1 × 106 Jurkat cells using DIMRIE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were balanced to a total of 4 μg with the empty pEF-BOS vector. In 293T cells, 3 μg of the HIV-1NL4-3ΔNef expression plasmid were co-transfected with 3 μg of various Nef or Nef-V1H expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 48 h after the transfection, cellular supernatants were harvested, passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Fisher, Springfield, IL), and stored at −70 °C. The reverse transcriptase activity was measured to calculate the amount of generated virus. The infectivity of viral particles was assayed on infected Sx22-1 cells grown in 96-well plates (Fisher) by counting the β-galactosidase-positive blue cells 36 h after infection (41Klimkait T. Stauffer F. Lupo E. Sonderegger-Rubli C. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 2109-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The relative infectivity was calculated as the number of blue cells/ml divided by the reverse transcriptase activity. Our previous studies demonstrated that the interaction between Nef and V1H facilitates the endocytosis of Nef via CCP, and that Nef binds V1H via its C-terminal flexible loop (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Mandic R. Fackler O.T. Geyer M. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.-H. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether V1H alone could connect Nef and thus CD4 to CCP, new fusion proteins between CD8, Nef, V1H, and parts thereof, were created and utilized for direct and indirect internalization assays (Fig.1 A). The indirect internalization assay measured levels of CD4 on cells co-expressing CD4 and Nef, the hybrid CD8-Nef or Nef-V1H proteins, or their derivatives, which contained mutated or deleted Nef proteins (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the direct internalization assay measured levels of CD8 on cells expressing the hybrid CD8-Nef-V1H and CD8-V1H proteins (Fig. 1 B). COS cells were chosen because they internalize CD4 efficiently and maintain constant steady-state levels of this protein (42Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R.E. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presented are steady-state levels of CD4 or CD8 on the surface of transfected cells as well as kinetic internalization assays. For the indirect internalization assay, the expression of CD4 was measured by FACS with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody 48 h after each transfection (Fig.1 C). Cells expressing only CD4 or CD4 together with the truncated CD8 (CT) or V1H maintained high levels of CD4 on the surface (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2–4). The co-expression of CD4 with Nef or hybrid CD8-Nef and Nef-V1H proteins resulted in 4-fold reduced levels of CD4 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5,7, and 8). As reported previously (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the mutation of the diacidic motif of glutamic and aspartic acids at positions 178 and 179 to alanine in Nef (NefED-AA) blocked the internalization of CD4 (Fig. 1 C, lane 6). In contrast, the co-expression of CD4 and the hybrid mutant NefED-AAV1H and deleted Nef160V1H proteins, which contained the mutation of the diacidic motif and the deletion of the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef, respectively, linked to V1H, led to the efficient internalization of CD4 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 9 and10). As presented in Fig. 1 E, levels of expression of these chimeras were equivalent. We conclude that the C-terminal flexible loop was dispensable for the interaction between CD4 and Nef and that the physical linkage of V1H to an internalization incompetent Nef restores its appropriate trafficking. Thus, V1H could be the adaptor for the internalization of CD4 by Nef. To demonstrate that V1H was internalized identically to Nef, direct internalization assays were performed. The hybrid CD8-Nef, CD8-Nef-V1H, and CD8-V1H proteins were expressed on the surface of COS cells, and the levels of CD8 rather than CD4 were measured by FACS (Fig. 1 D). The disappearance of CD8 from the cell surface represented the ability of Nef, V1H, or both proteins to engage the endocytic machinery. Thus, if Nef, V1H, or hybrid Nef-V1H proteins internalized CD8 to similar levels in the chimeras, V1H could represent an important target for Nef in CCP and endosomes. Cells expressing a truncated CD8 protein (CT) maintained high levels of CD8 on the surface (Fig. 1 D, lane 2). In contrast, the expression of the hybrid CD8-Nef (CN), CD8-Nef-V1H (CNV1H), and CD8-V1H (CV1H) proteins reduced these levels of CD8 up to 7-fold (Fig. 1 D,lanes 3–5). Again, levels of expression of these chimeras were similar (Fig. 1 E). Because the hybrid CD8-Nef, CD8-Nef-V1H, and CD8-V1H proteins decreased levels of expression of CD8 equivalently, the interaction between Nef and V1H could account for the intracellular trafficking of Nef. Next, steady-state FACS analyses were confirmed in a kinetic internalization assay. As presented in Fig.2, the wild type Nef protein promoted the internalization of CD4. Compared with the negative control, ∼2.5 times more CD4 was internalized in the presence of Nef after 15 min (Fig. 2, compare x symbols to black diamonds; approximately 32 versus 13%). In the presence of the internalization defective Nef mutant NefED-AAprotein, the internalization of CD4 was only slightly higher than that observed with the negative control (compare black trianglesto black diamonds, approximately 18 versus 13%). However, in the presence of the hybrid mutant Nef-(1–160)V1H protein, in which the flexible loop and the C terminus of Nef was substituted by V1H, the internalization of CD4 was at least as high as in the presence of the wild type protein (compare white rectangles tox symbols, approximately 35 versus 32%) after 15 min. Overall, these data confirm the results from the steady-state surface expression. We conclude that V1H can substitute for the function of the flexible loop in Nef for the internalization of CD4. The interaction between Nef and V1H was mapped previously to the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef in the yeast two-hybrid system and by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected cells (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Mandic R. Fackler O.T. Geyer M. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.-H. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, whether this interaction occurs directly or requires other cellular components had not been established. To determine whether Nef binds V1H, we performed GST pull-down assays between Nef and V1H. Nef isolated from E. coli or the 35S-labeled hybrid CD8-Nef protein, which was transcribed and translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro, were incubated with the GST-V1H fusion protein coupled to Sepharose beads. Binding proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with the mouse anti-Nef antibody or by autoradiography. As presented in Fig.3 A, purified Nef was readily detected with the mouse anti-Nef antibody in the pull-down assays with the hybrid GST-V1H protein but not with GST alone (lanes 4and 9). Importantly, a 15-residue oligopeptide, SLLHPMSLHGMEDAE (LL/ED), which was derived from the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef and contained both the dileucine and the diacidic motifs, specifically blocked the binding of Nef to the hybrid GST-V1H protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). In contrast, a scrambled control oligopeptide, GDMSLHSMEHLEAPL (Control), which did not contain dileucine or diacidic motifs, did not interfere with this binding (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, Nef binds V1H directly via its flexible loop in vitro. To prove that the hybrid CD8-Nef protein behaves similarly to the wild-type Nef protein, we performed GST pull-down assays between the hybrid CD8-Nef and GST-V1H proteins. As presented in Fig.3 B, the binding patterns between the hybrid CD8-Nef and GST-V1H proteins in the presence of increasing amounts of the LL/ED oligopeptide were indistinguishable from those between Nef and the hybrid GST-V1H protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–5,compared with A, lanes 4–8). Importantly, the control oligopeptide also did not interfere with this binding (Fig.3 B, lanes 6 and 7). Thus, the flexible loop in Nef was the major determinant of the binding between Nef and V1H. For the internalization of CD4, the complex consisting of the cytoplasmic tail of CD4, Nef, and V1H must contact the endocytic machinery. To this end we analyzed if V1H could bind to the adaptor protein complex AP-2, the predominant adaptor complex"

However, few in vivo ligands are known for the SH3 domain of Hck. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify ∼25 potential binding partners for the SH3 domain of Hck from the monocyte cell line U937. Two major interacting proteins were the actin binding proteins Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and WASP-interacting protein (WIP). We also focused on a novel interaction between Hck and ELMO1, an 84-kDa protein that was recently identified as the mammalian ortholog of the Caenorhabditis elegansgene, ced-12. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 interacts with Dock180 as a component of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac pathway responsible for phagocytosis and cell migration. Using purified proteins, we confirmed that WASP-interacting protein and ELMO1 interact directly with the SH3 domain of Hck. We also show that Hck and ELMO1 interact in intact cells and that ELMO1 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells that co-express Hck, suggesting that it is a substrate of Hck.

These ligands disrupt the autoinhibitory interactions, promote autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 within the activation loop, and stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of Src family kinases to cellular proteins can regulate kinase activity by at least three mechanisms, (i) release of autoinhibitory interactions as described above, (ii) relocalization of Src kinases to sites of cellular action, and (iii) tethering the kinases to potential substrates (1Bjorge J.D.

These mechanisms often operate in combination, as is seen when Src kinases are targeted to their substrates by SH3/SH2 domain interactions. Many cases have been described in which Src kinases are recruited to their substrates via SH3 domain interactions. For example, c-Src is known to associate with at least eight substrates via direct binding of its SH3 domain to ligand binding motifs in the substrates (2Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar); well studied cases include Cas (12Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

The dual role of the SH3 domain in substrate targeting is illustrated in experiments with synthetic peptides, where phosphorylation of substrates is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of an SH3 domain ligand (17Scott M.P.

These observations suggest that good substrates for particular Src kinases might be discovered as SH3 domain ligands. Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) is a Src family tyrosine kinase that is expressed predominantly in granulocytic and monocytic cells (18Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M.

The different subcellular localizations of Hck are consistent with its proposed functional roles in phagocytosis (21Kedzierska K. Vardaxis N.J. Jaworowski A. Crowe S.M. J.

In monocytes, FcγRII clustering leads to an array of biological responses including phagocytosis, cell killing, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and activation (25Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Clustering of FcγRII promotes activation of Hck and subsequent phosphorylation of the receptor by direct association of Hck and FcγRII (26Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of Hck with an acidic region of the interleukin 6 receptor β chain, gp130, leads to Hck activation and cell proliferation (29Schaeffer M. Schneiderbauer M. Weidler S. Tavares R. Warmuth M. de Vos G. Hallek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8068-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There are several indications that Hck plays an important role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Neutrophils isolated from Hck/Fgr double knockout mice are deficient in integrin-mediated respiratory burst and granule secretion (30Suen P.W. Ilic D. Caveggion E. Berton G. Damsky C.H. Lowell C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4067-4078PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lowell C.A. Fumagalli L. Berton G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 895-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 32Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Lowell C.A. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1120-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin signaling in polymorphonuclear leukocytes also activates Hck (33Piccardoni P. Sideri R. Manarini S. Piccoli A. Martelli N. de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Evangelista V. Blood. 2001; 98: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and leads to increased association of Hck and with the cytoskeleton (34Nair K.S. Zingde S.M. Cell. Immunol. 2001; 208: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Another role for Hck in actin rearrangement is suggested by the fact that Hck is activated during E-selectin-mediated induction of monocyte chemotaxis (35Kumar P. Hosaka S. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21039-21045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hck has been implicated in a wide variety of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. However, relatively few substrates or effectors of Hck have been identified. One in vivo substrate for Hck, the multidomain signaling protein Cbl, has been shown to interact with the SH3 domain of Hck. As described above, we would expect that many of the best cellular substrates for Hck would contain binding motifs for the SH3 domain of the enzyme. The focus of this study was to identify and characterize novel SH3 domain ligands for Hck. Two proteins that we identified, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and WASP-interacting Protein (WIP), are known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (36Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 117-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Martinez-Quiles N. Geha R.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A third Hck-interacting protein, ELMO1, has recently been described as a component of signaling pathways that regulate phagocytosis and cell migration (38Gumienny T.L. Brugnera E. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Kinchen J.M. Haney L.B. Nishiwaki K. Walk S.F. Nemergut M.E. Macara I.G. Francis R. Schedl T. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Hengartner M.O. Ravichandran K.S. Cell. 2001; 107: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Hck has been implicated in these pathways as well, suggesting that ELMO1 may represent an important downstream substrate/effector of Hck. GST and GST-SH3(Hck) were expressed in Escherichia coli NB42 cells. Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter of aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were added to glutathione-agarose (Molecular Probes). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C the beads were washed 5 times with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 mm EDTA. Glutathione-agarose with immobilized GST or GST-SH3 was used directly in ligand binding experiments. The concentration of GST or GST-SH3 on the beads was determined by treating 50 μl of beads with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. The total amount of protein eluted was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and divided by 50 μl to calculate the total concentration on the beads. Control beads were added to dilute the protein concentration to 1 mg/ml. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Before the pull-down experiment, 800 ml of U937 cells at a density of 106 cells/ml were treated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. After 48 h, cells were harvested and then washed 2× with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed for 30 min with rocking in 4 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, a 1-ml portion of this lysate (containing 5 mg of protein) was added to 50 μl of glutathione-agarose containing 50 μg of GST-SH3. The remaining portion (3 ml, containing 15 mg protein) was added to 50 μl of glutathione-agarose containing 50 μg of GST. Beads and lysate were rocked 2 h at 4 °C and then washed 5 times with 10 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of gel loading buffer by boiling. Proteins that eluted from the GST-SH3(Hck) affinity column were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized with colloidal Coomassie stain. Protein bands specific to the Hck-SH3 pull-downs were excised and digested with trypsin as previously described (39Joyal J.L. Annan R.S., Ho, Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). According to the intensity of the Coomassie band, 1/20 to1/3 of each unfractionated tryptic digest was analyzed by on-line liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using a micro-column (75 μm × 10 cm, 3-μm particles) reverse phase HPLC1 interfaced to an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry-based sequencing was performed on line in a data-dependent manner (40McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.M. Goode B. Yang S. Barnes G. Drubin D. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) as peptides eluted from the HPLC. Uninterpreted spectra were searched for protein matches against a non-redundant protein data base using the program Mascot (41Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were carried out to measure binding between immobilized GST-SH3(Hck) and purified proteins or proteins in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lysates, with the exception that binding reactions contained 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. In some experiments, various concentrations of polyproline-containing peptides were added together with the immobilized SH3 domain. C-terminally phosphorylated wild type Hck, WIP, and ELMO1 were produced inSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Hck was expressed and purified as described previously (16Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cDNA for WIP was the kind gift of Dr. Narayanaswamy Ramesh (Harvard Medical School). The WIP-coding sequence was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac-Htb (Invitrogen). The cDNA for ELMO1 was obtained as clone DKFZp434B0819 from the German Cancer Research Center. We amplified the 2184-base pair DNA sequence by PCR and ligated it as anEcoRI/KpnI fragment into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac-Htb. WIP and ELMO1 were expressed in Sf9 cells using the Invitrogen Bac-to-Bac system. Cells expressing His-tagged WIP and ELMO1 were lysed in a French pressure cell in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter of aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmEDTA). Cell lysate was diluted to 200 ml with column loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 m NaCl, and 20 mmimidazole) and centrifuged. Lysate was passed over a 5-ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). WIP and ELMO1 were eluted with 100 mm imidazole. The concentration of ELMO1 and WIP were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The substrate peptide for the coupled assay (AEEEIYGEFEAKKKKG (42Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Poner B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C.

It was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The polyproline-containing peptide (DFPLGPPPPLPPRATPSR (43Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar)) was the generous gift of Dean Edwards (University of Colorado). Kinase assays were performed by a coupled spectrophotometric assay (44Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this assay, the production of ADP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340 nm. All experiments were carried out at 30 °C. Reactions were performed in buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The assays contained 400 μm peptide substrate and 10 nm Hck. The ELMO1 cDNA was subcloned into two expression vectors to generate epitope-tagged versions of ELMO1 for mammalian expression, 1) pEF1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) for a C-terminal V5 tag and 2) pCM45 (gift of Steve Lang and Pat Hearing, SUNY Stony Brook) for an N-terminal M45 tag. Full-length human Hck cDNA was subcloned into plasmid pCDNA6 (Invitrogen). Two 150-mm tissue culture plates were transfected for each condition tested. Transfections were carried out with 3.5 μl of TransIt (Panvera)/μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 40–48 h, cells from the two plates were combined and washed 2× in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmvanadate, and protease inhibitors) and clarified by centrifugation, and the protein concentration was determined. An equal amount (between 1 and 5 mg) of total cell protein was diluted to 1 ml for each reaction and precleared with 50 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. After pre-clearing, 2 μg of appropriate antibody (or 15 μl of serum containing M45 antibody) or control antibody was added to lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Antibodies used were mouse anti-M45 (P. Hearing, SUNY Stony Brook), mouse anti-Hck (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-Hck (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-WIP (a gift of Dr. Narayanaswamy Ramesh, Harvard Medical School), rabbit anti-WASP (Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Antibody-protein complexes were collected with 50 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were washed 5 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 40 μl of gel loading buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. Incubation with primary antibody was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. After washing, the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hck is expressed predominantly in myeloid cells such as monocytes (18Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J., Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiation of monocytes to macrophages is associated with increased Hck expression and activity (18Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J., Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the more differentiated phenotype would also be accompanied by increases in specific binding complexes between Hck and other signaling proteins. Therefore, we treated U937 monocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 48 h to induce the cells to differentiate to a more macrophage-like phenotype (45Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Clarified lysate from these cells was added to glutathione-agarose beads containing immobilized GST-SH3(Hck). As a control, 3-fold more U937 lysate was added to beads containing GST alone. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized with colloidal Coomassie stain (Fig. 1). All visible bands were excised from the GST-SH3(Hck) lane. Bands in the control lane having similar molecular weight and intensity as bands in the GST-SH3(Hck) lane were also excised. The proteins in the bands were reduced, alkylated, and digested overnight with trypsin. The tryptic digests were analyzed by on-line liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and the uninterpreted data was searched against the non-redundant protein data base using the program Mascot (41Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1995324184,"ElaC is a widespread gene found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and mammals with a highly conserved sequence. Two human ElaC variants were recently associated with cancer (Tavtigian, S. V., Simard, J., Teng, D. H., Abtin, V., Baumgard, M., Beck, A., Camp, N. J., Carillo, A.

(2001)Genomics 72, 169–179). Analysis of the primary sequence indicates homology to an arylsulfatase and predicts a metallo-β-lactamase fold. At present, no ElaC gene product has been investigated. We cloned the Escherichia coli ElaC gene and purified the recombinant gene product. An enzymatic analysis showed that ElaC does not encode an arylsulfatase but rather encodes a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate with ak cat of 59 s−1 and K′ of 4 mm. Kinetic analysis of the dimeric enzyme revealed positive cooperativity for the substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate with a Hill coefficient of 1.6, whereas hydrolysis of the substrate thymidine-5′-p-nitrophenyl phosphate followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, the enzyme is capable of binding two zinc or two iron ions. However, it displays phosphodiesterase activity only in the zinc form. The metal environment characterized by zinc K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy was modeled with two histidine residues, one carboxylate group, and 1.5 oxygen atoms. This corresponds to the coordination found in other metallo-β-lactamase domain proteins. Phosphodiesterase activity is strongly dependent on the presence of zinc. These results identify the currently unassigned gene product ElaC to be a novel binuclear zinc phosphodiesterase. ElaC is a widespread gene found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and mammals with a highly conserved sequence. Two human ElaC variants were recently associated with cancer (Tavtigian, S. V., Simard, J., Teng, D. H., Abtin, V., Baumgard, M., Beck, A., Camp, N. J., Carillo, A. R., Chen, Y., Dayananth, P., Desrochers, M., Dumont, M., Farnham, J.

(2001)Genomics 72, 169–179). Analysis of the primary sequence indicates homology to an arylsulfatase and predicts a metallo-β-lactamase fold. At present, no ElaC gene product has been investigated. We cloned the Escherichia coli ElaC gene and purified the recombinant gene product. An enzymatic analysis showed that ElaC does not encode an arylsulfatase but rather encodes a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate with ak cat of 59 s−1 and K′ of 4 mm. Kinetic analysis of the dimeric enzyme revealed positive cooperativity for the substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate with a Hill coefficient of 1.6, whereas hydrolysis of the substrate thymidine-5′-p-nitrophenyl phosphate followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, the enzyme is capable of binding two zinc or two iron ions. However, it displays phosphodiesterase activity only in the zinc form. The metal environment characterized by zinc K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy was modeled with two histidine residues, one carboxylate group, and 1.5 oxygen atoms. This corresponds to the coordination found in other metallo-β-lactamase domain proteins. Phosphodiesterase activity is strongly dependent on the presence of zinc.

In contrast to the zinc β-lactamase domain enzymes, rubredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase contains two iron atoms in its β-lactamase domain and an additional flavodoxin domain (3Frazao C. Silva G.

Based on weak sequence homology (35% with 32% gaps) to a functionally characterized arylsulfatase fromAlteromonas carrageenovora (9Barbeyron T. Potin P. Richard C. Collin O. Kloareg B. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the protein encoded by ElaC could also exert this function (10Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B.

Stronger sequence homology, up to 50%, was found to two human genes, named ElaC1 and ElaC2. Genetic studies revealed an association with cancer for both human genes.

ElaC2appears to be unique to eukaryotes, whereas ElaC1 orthologs were found in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaebacteria (12Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J.

Gene disruption experiments inSaccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that ElaC2 is an essential gene (12Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y.

Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of theElaC family, together with its ubiquitous expression and the essential function of S. cerevisiae ElaC2, emphasizes that the functions of the gene products are of fundamental biological interest.No ElaC gene product has been previously characterized. As the first member of this widespread and highly conserved group, we purified and functionally characterized theE. coli ElaC gene product. We have shown that this protein is not an arylsulfatase but a phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterase activity is strongly correlated with the zinc content of the enzyme. X-ray absorption spectroscopy provided the first structural model of the active site, which is in agreement with the metal coordination found in metallo-β-lactamase domain proteins. Since no explanation has been published for the abbreviationElaC, we name this novel type of binuclear metallohydrolase zinc phosphodiesterase (ZiPD).1EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsExcept when stated otherwise, all proteins and fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genset (Paris, France). DNA sequencing was performed by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany).Cloning and Expression of ZiPDZiPD was cloned from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA by PCR using primers derived from the ElaC gene (5ZiPD, 5′-GAACTCATGAACTTAATTTTTTTAGGTACT-3′; 3ZiPD, 5′-TAATAACTCGAGTTAAACGTTAAACACGGT-3′) utilizing the translation initiation and termination sites specified in GenBankTM entry U58768 and introducing restriction sites for BspHI and XhoI (underlined), respectively. The PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The PCR product was digested withBspHI and XhoI and cloned into theNcoI and XhoI sites of a modified pET24d vector (Novagen), which contains an N-terminal His6 tag and a TEV cleavage site, yielding pETM-ZiPD. DNA sequencing confirmed that the sequence was identical to that of the gene identifier b2268 under GenBankTM accession number NC_000913. For expression of ZiPD, BL21(DE3) cells harboring pETM-ZiPD were grown in Luria-Bertani medium to an A 600 = 0.6 followed by induction with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h. The recombinant protein was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The eluted fraction from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The main peak of the recombinant protein eluted at a volume corresponding to a dimer of ∼70 kDa. The pooled fractions from the gel filtration column yielded the enzyme as isolated (a.i.-ZiPD). The concentration of purified ZiPD was determined using the calculated extinction coefficient of E280nm1% = 6.7 and a molecular mass of 36.04 kDa.Metal IncubationThe apoenzyme (apo-ZiPD) was obtained after incubation of a.i.-ZiPD with 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and subsequent dialysis of the EDTA metal complex and excess EDTA. Apo-ZiPD was saturated with metals by addition of 0.2 mmZn2+ or Fe2+. Iron incubation was performed in degassed buffer and the presence of 2 mm dithionite. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, excess metal was removed by extensive dialysis against metal-free buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Buffers were treated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) to remove trace metals. This yielded the zinc and iron saturated ZiPD preparations, Zn-ZiPD and Fe-ZiPD respectively, which were used for subsequent analysis.Metal AnalysisProton-induced X-ray EmissionThe metal content of different ZiPD samples was determined by detection of the proton-induced x-ray emission at the Hamburg 2 MeV proton microprobe (14Grossmann D. Niecke M. Koopmann J.P. Schöttler J. Nucl. Instr. Meth. 1990; B49: 495-500Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using this technique, all elements apart from those lighter than sodium can be detected in a single scan at a minimum limit of about 1–10 parts per million by weight. Its application to protein analysis was reviewed by Garman (15Garman E. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R291-R299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A particular advantage of this method is the ability to measure the sulfur content, which serves as an internal standard to determine the protein content of the samples. For the ZiPD samples, the number of sulfur atoms was derived from the encoded sequence in pETM-ZiPD, which contains six cysteine and six methionine residues.Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against Chelex 100-treated buffer composed of 20 mm Tris/acetic acid, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaNO3 to remove chloride and sulfur compounds that disturb the protein sulfur signal. The samples (10–15 μg) were dropped onto sample holders covered with a 1.5-μm polycarbonate backing foil. With the proton microbeam, sample areas of a few mm2 were scanned, and the characteristic x-rays were detected using a Si(Li) detector. A proton current of a few hundred picoamperes was applied for about 1 h, ensuring that no elemental loss (sulfur or metals) due to thermal stress occurred that would otherwise change the x-ray signal intensity.The unknown number of metals per molecule was calculated from their calibrated signals with reference to the calibrated sulfur signal. The overall accuracy was estimated, taking into account the statistical errors of the x-ray yield and the uncertainty in the correction for x-ray absorption within the samples.Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass SpectrometryThe metal content of Zn-ZiPD was additionally analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS HP 4500, Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a perfluoroalkoxy μ-flow nebulizer (100 μl/min self-aspirating) and a cooled Scott spray chamber. Four isotopes (64Zn, 66Zn,67Zn, and 68Zn) were simultaneously monitored to recognize any spectral interference, but no deviations between the isotopes could be observed. Release of the metal ions from Zn-ZiPD took place by acidification with concentrated nitric acid. The total zinc content was determined by the standard addition method (n = 3). To check the zinc distribution in the protein sample, the ICP-MS was on-line-coupled to size-exclusion chromatographic equipment (TSK Gel 3000PWXL 150 mm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, TosoHaas, Stuttgart, Germany). The chromatographic conditions (1 ml/min Tris/HCl, pH = 7.5), in combination with the element-selective detection, enable a separation of protein-bound and free zinc.X-ray Absorption SpectroscopyThe metal coordination was determined by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The extended x-ray fine structure (EXAFS) provides element-specific local structural information (16Meyer-Klaucke W. Strange R.W. Synchrotron Radiat News. 2000; 13: 17-21Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17George G.N. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Zn-ZiPD in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol was concentrated to 1–2 mm using Millipore concentrators with a 10,000 molecular weight cut off. Sample holders covered with Kapton windows were filled with this protein solution and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. During measurement, the sample was cooled to about 30 K. X-ray absorption spectra at the zinc K-edge were recorded at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory bending magnet beamline D2 (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany) utilizing a Si(111) double crystal monochromator, a focusing mirror, and a 13-element germanium solid state fluorescence detector (Canberra). The energy axis of each scan was calibrated by using the Bragg reflections of a static Si(220) crystal in back reflection geometry (18Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Crossref Google Scholar). Data reduction, including averaging of the 30 scans, was performed with the EXPROG software package (C. Hermes and H. F. Nolting, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hamburg, Germany) usingE 0, Zn = 9660 eV. The EXAFS spectrum was analyzed with EXCURV98 applying constrained refinement (19Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Ligand types as well as coordination numbers were varied manually, whereas the distances, the Debye-Waller factors, and the Fermi energy offset were refined.Enzymatic AssaysScreen with β-Lactamase Domain Protein SubstratesActivity tests were performed in 200 μl buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, or sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl) with the a.i.-, apo-, Zn-, and Fe-ZiPD (50 ng) preparations. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin (100 μm) (Calbiochem), a β-lactamase substrate, was detected by a color change to red. Liberation of p-nitrophenol fromp-nitrophenyl sulfate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10 mm) was detected by a yellow color, hydrolysis ofp-nitrocatechol sulfate (10 mm) was detected by a color change from yellow to red. Glycosulfatase activity was probed with glucose-6 sulfate as described previously (20Roberton A.M. Rosendale D.I. Wright D.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 125: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar). Glyoxalase II activity using the substrateS-d-lactoylglutathione (0.5 mm) was monitored at 240 nm. To verify the correct setup of the tests, positive controls were conducted with β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus, arylsulfatase from Aerobacter aerogenes (both from Sigma), and glyoxalase II-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, kindly provided by C. Makaroff (Miami University, Oxford, Ohio). All reactions were carried out at room temperature and monitored for 2 h.Random Substrate ScreenA random substrate screen was performed using Taxa Profile E plates (Merlin, Bornheim-Hersel, Germany). These plates, originally designed for microorganism classification and identification, contain different chromogenic substrates and were used in this study to identify the enzymatic function of ZiPD. Each reaction was set up twice on the top and bottom halves of a 384-well plate, enabling two identical screens on one plate. Each well was filled with 25 μl of either Zn-ZiPD or Fe-ZiPD solution (0.004 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl). A negative control using the buffer without enzyme was performed to locate nonspecific reactions. After 2 h incubation at 22 °C, the reactions were stopped, and the color was developed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Merlin).Substrate Screen with Physiological PhosphodiestersEnzymatic tests with diverse physiological phosphodiesters were performed with Zn-ZiPD in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl at room temperature for at least 1 h. Positive reaction controls with small amounts of either commercial enzyme or reaction product were carried out for all tests. Hydrolysis of DNA (single-stranded M13 DNA, double-stranded λ-DNA) was inspected by analyzing reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Hydrolysis of RNA (yeast RNA Type II) was analyzed by following the absorption change at 260 nm for 20 min after addition of ZiPD. Hydrolysis of single-stranded oligonucleotides (3-, 7-, and 9-mers of oligo(dA)) was tested by incubating the reaction products with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and by subsequent detection of the inorganic phosphate using molybdate/malachite green reagent (21Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, hydrolysis of cyclic mononucleotides was probed. In this test, the reaction products were incubated with 5′-nucleotidase (Sigma) to liberate phosphate from open nucleoside monophosphates. Detection of the inorganic phosphate took place with molybdate/malachite green reagent. Reactivity with pyrophosphate, AMP, ADP, and ATP was investigated by detection of released phosphate using molybdate/malachite green reagent. Phospholipase activity toward phosphatidylcholine was investigated via detection of choline. This makes use of choline oxidase (Sigma) and chromogenic detection of the produced H2O2analogous to the glycosulfatase assay described in Ref. 20Roberton A.M. Rosendale D.I. Wright D.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 125: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar. To distinguish between phospholipase C and D activity, alkaline phosphatase was added to the former assay to convert phosphocholine to choline and phosphate.Phosphodiesterase Assay for Kinetic AnalysisPhosphodiesterase activity was determined using the substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (bpNPP). Standard reaction conditions were 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 14 mm bpNPP. Release of p-nitrophenol (pNP) was continuously monitored for 2 min at 405 nm. The reaction rate was determined from initial slopes using εpNP (pH 7.4) = 11,500 m−1 cm−1. Activity toward thymidine-5′-monophosphate-p-nitrophenylester (TpNPP) was determined analogously. The background activity of a zinc solution in the range between 0.1 and 100 mm toward bpNPP and TpNPP was negligible under the conditions used. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of pNP liberated/min at 22 °C. The kinetic parametersK′, k cat, and the Hill coefficient,n H, were extracted from the dependence of the initial reaction velocities on the substrate concentration, applying the Hill equation (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley Classics Library Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) as shown in Eq. 1,v=VmaxcsnHK′+csnHEquation 1 by nonlinear regression analysis implemented in the program Origin 5.0 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). For the substrate TpNPP, ann H of 1 was obtained, which converts the Hill equation to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Each measurement was performed in triplicate for each of the three different enzyme preparations.DISCUSSIONMultinuclear zinc enzymes are frequently found to hydrolyze peptide, thioester, and phosphoester bonds (25Wilcox D.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2435-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 26Lipscomb W.N. Sträter N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2375-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The previously characterized phosphodiesterases within this group utilize three zinc atoms, as shown for phospholipase C (27Hough E. Hansen L.K. Birknes B. Jynge K. Hansen S. Hordvik A. Little C. Dodson E. Derewenda Z. Nature. 1989; 338: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), nuclease P1 (28Volbeda A. Lahm A. Sakiyama F. Suck D.

Cell. 1999; 98: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Two of the three zinc ions form a binuclear cluster and are bridged by water and carboxylate groups, whereas the third metal ion is about 5 Å away (25Wilcox D.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2435-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This group of multinuclear phosphodiesterases utilizing zinc can now be extended by the enzyme characterized in this study.Sequence analysis assigned ZiPD to the metallo-β-lactamase family (8Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,10Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which suggests a binuclear metal binding site. The metal coordination sites of the structurally characterized members of this family are identified in part by residues from the conserved sequence motif HXHXDH (7Aravind L. In Silico Biol. 1999; 1: 69-91PubMed Google Scholar). Additional weakly conserved amino acid residues and water molecules complement the 4–6-fold coordination. A coordinating cysteine residue has been found so far only in the β-lactamases from Bacteroides fragilisand B. cereus (1Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.M. Dideberg O.

EXAFS analysis of Zn-ZiPD provided the first structural characterization of the average zinc coordination environment. A 4.5-fold coordination was found with 2.0 histidine residues, 1.0 carboxylate group, and 1.5 oxygen atoms, which could be present as water ligands. A coordinating sulfur atom was excluded based on the EXAFS analysis. The metal-ligand distance of 1.99 Å is in agreement with the zinc-ligand distances found in proteins and model complexes with a 4- or 5-fold coordination (31Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J.

At least in vitro, SOCS-1 inhibits the action of multiple cytokines. By studying the effects of SOCS-1 deficiency, we investigated whether SOCS-1 is involved in preventing cytokine-induced death of pancreatic islet cells, a potential mechanism of insulin deficiency in autoimmune diabetes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) + interferon-γ (IFNγ) was more potent at inducing cell death in SOCS-1−/− islets than in wild type. Individually, these cytokines did not induce cell death. The titration of the two cytokines suggested that this increased cell death was because of hypersensitivity to TNF. Interleukin-1 + IFNγ induced the same level of cell death in SOCS-1−/− and wild-type islets, suggesting that the sensitivity of islets to IFNγ or interleukin-1-mediated cytotoxicity is not affected by SOCS-1 deficiency. Additionally, SOCS-1−/− β cells were responsive to lower concentrations of TNF measured by class I major histocompatibility complex up-regulation. The TNF + IFNγ damage of islets was mediated by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and increased iNOS expression and nitric oxide production were found in SOCS-1−/− islets following cytokine treatment. A further analysis revealed that SOCS-1 deficiency results in augmented TNF signaling via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but not NFκB or c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Increased p38 signaling may be responsible for the increased iNOS expression in SOCS-1−/− islets.

TNF-induced cell death in combination with lipopolysaccharide and IFNγ in primary β cells appears to occur indirectly by stimulating intra-islet macrophages to secrete IL-1, which leads to NO-dependent β cell cytotoxicity (5Corbett J.A.

Because overexpression systems have been used to demonstrate the binding of SOCS-1 to these proteins, it is still unclear whether these interactions are physiologically relevant. We have previously demonstrated that SOCS-1 is expressed in β cells (16Chong M.M.W. Thomas H.E. Kay T.W.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because SOCS-1 was identified as a negative regulator of Jak-STAT signaling and in particular signaling by IFNγ, we expected that it would also be a negative regulator of IFNγ signaling in β cells. However, we found that the levels of SOCS-1 expressed in β cells after cytokine treatment were insufficient to terminate IFNγ signaling at the level of STAT1 activation and transcription of IFNγ-regulated genes including class I MHC. This finding suggested that IFNγ signaling in β cells may not be negatively regulated by SOCS-1. Consistent with this observation, SOCS-1 deficiency did not affect the intensity or kinetics of IFNγ signaling in β cells nor the sensitivity of β cells to the cytokine. The aim of this study is to investigate whether SOCS-1 in β cells has a role in regulating signaling by other cytokines. In particular, we have examined the effects of SOCS-1 deficiency on the sensitivity of β cells to damage by IL-1 and TNF. Unlike IFNγ, IL-1 and TNF do not activate Jak-STAT pathway. By analyzing the effects of SOCS-1 deficiency rather than using overexpression systems, we have also addressed the issue of whether the action of SOCS-1 on signaling pathways other than the Jak-STAT pathway is physiologically relevant. SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− and IFNγ−/− mice maintained on mixed C57Bl/6–129Sv backgrounds are described elsewhere (27Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E.

Islets were isolated according to the method of Liu and Shapiro (28Liu M. Shapiro M.E. Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 3208-3210PubMed Google Scholar) by intraductal digestion of the pancreas with collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics) and the separation on a Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) density gradient. The islets were handpicked to purity and cultured in CMRL-1066 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. The cytokines used were recombinant murine TNF (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), recombinant murine IFNγ (Genentech), and recombinant human IL-1 (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA). The iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (Sigma) was used at 1 mm, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) was used at 100 μm, and IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) (Amgen Inc., Thousand Lakes, CA) was used at 5 μg/ml. Sodium nitroprusside (Sigma) was used as a NO donor compound. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was used at 7.5 μg/ml. The quantification of cell death was performed according to the method described by Nicoletti et al. (29Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani G. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar), which measures the fragmentation of nuclei. After cytokine treatment, the islets were dispersed into single cells with 0.2% trypsin (Calbiochem), 10 mm EDTA in Hanks' solution and then were allowed to recover in complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Nuclear DNA was stained by incubating the cells overnight in a hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C. The cells were then analyzed on a FACScan (BD Pharmingen). Apoptotic bodies were identified by their reduced DNA content. Greater than one fragment can be derived from each apoptotic cell. Alternatively, cell viability was quantitated by trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion. After cytokine treatment, the islets were dispersed into single cells and then resuspended in 0.1% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. Viable cells, which are not stained by trypan blue, were counted on a hemocytometer. Islets were dispersed into single cells and allowed to recover in complete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The measurement of class I MHC expression by flow cytometry using an anti-H-2Db monoclonal antibody (28-14-8, BD PharMingen) is described elsewhere (16Chong M.M.W. Thomas H.E. Kay T.W.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed on a FACScan. The β cell population was identified by their high flavin adenine dinucleotide autofluorescence (30Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed on a FACStar (BD PharMingen). For the detection of iNOS, 100 islets were lysed in protein sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, bromphenol blue) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Half of the protein extract (∼15 μg) was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and iNOS protein was detected by Western blotting as described previously (9Stephens L.A. Thomas H.E., Li, M. Grell M. Darwiche R. Volodin L. Kay T.W.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using an anti-iNOS polyclonal antibody (NOS2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). iNOS protein was visualized with Lumi-Light (Roche Diagnostics). The blots were stripped with stripping buffer (2% SDS, 0.75% 2-merceptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6) at 65 °C for 45 min. As a loading control, they were then reprobed with an anti-hsp 70 antibody (obtained from Dr. Hamsa Puthalakkath, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research). For the analysis of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, whole cell lysate from 200 islets/sample were prepared as described by Larsen et al. (31Larsen C.M. Wadt K.A. Juhl L.F. Andersen H.U. Karlsen A.E., Su, M.S. Seedorf K. Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Mandrup-Poulsen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15294-15300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The protein extract (∼30 μg) was divided and run separately on two SDS-polyacrylamide gels. One filter was then Western blotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for phospho-JNK or phospho-p38. As a loading control, the other filter was probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to detect total JNK or p38. All of the anti-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology(Beverly, MA). NO production by islets was assayed by measuring the culture medium for nitrite using the Griess assay (32Wishnok J.S. Glogowski J.A. Tannenbaum S.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase 3 activity was measured according to the method of Silke et al. (33Silke J. Ekert P.G. Day C.L. Hawkins C.J. Baca M. Chew J. Pakusch M. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3114-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 300 islets were lysed in 30 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors). The extract was added to 50 μl of 2× caspase buffer (0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 0.2% CHAPS), 5 μl of 1 mm DEVD-AMC (fluorogenic substrate) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), and 1 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol to a final volume of 100 μl. The fluorescence was measured in a fluorometric instrument (TECAN) at 37 °C for 120 min with individual readings made every 5 min (excitation filter 360 nm; emission filter 465 nm). DEVD-AMC cleavage rates are determined by the change in fluorescence over of time. Two-way analyses of variance were used for statistical comparisons between treatment groups and genotypes. The calculations were performed using Prism version 2.0a (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). We have previously shown that SOCS-1 does not regulate the sensitivity of β cells to IFNγ nor the kinetics of IFNγ signaling (16Chong M.M.W. Thomas H.E. Kay T.W.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in investigating whether SOCS-1 regulates the sensitivity of β cells to other cytokines. This was done by studying the effects of SOCS-1 deficiency on cytokine-induced cell death of pancreatic islets. SOCS-1 deficiency is neonatal lethal in mice (34Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14395-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 35Naka T. Matsumoto T. Narazaki M.

However, SOCS-1−/− mice that are also deficient in IFNγ remain healthy and survive to adulthood (27Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), which allows for the isolation and analysis of SOCS-1−/− islets. Islets were isolated from SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− mice and from IFNγ−/− and wild-type mice as controls and were treated with 1000 units/ml TNF, 100 units/ml IFNγ, or both. After 6 days, cell death was quantitated in a flow cytometric analysis for nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1, A and B). Neither TNF nor IFNγ alone induced cell death in SOCS-1−/− or wild-type islets. However, nuclear fragmentation was induced by a combination of both cytokines. This effect was more pronounced in SOCS-1−/− islets. Cell viability was also assessed by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1 C). The viability of SOCS-1−/− islet cells following treatment with TNF and IFNγ was significantly reduced compared with wild type. These results suggest that SOCS-1 has a role in regulating the sensitivity of pancreatic islets to TNF and/or IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity. The relative contributions of IFNγ and TNF to the increased death of SOCS-1−/− islet cells were assessed by varying the concentrations of the two cytokines. When IFNγ was maintained at 100 units/ml and TNF was added at increasing concentrations, cell death in both SOCS-1−/− and control islets was induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). TNF at 300 units/ml or greater was required to induce nuclear fragmentation in control islets. However, in SOCS-1−/− islets, 30 units/ml of TNF was sufficient to induce nuclear fragmentation, suggesting that SOCS-1 deficiency increases the sensitivity of islets to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, at all of the TNF concentrations, a higher level of cell death was induced in SOCS-1−/− islets compared with wild type. In the converse experiment when TNF was maintained at 1000 units/ml and IFNγ was gradually increased, cell death was again induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). SOCS-1−/− islets were not responsive to lower concentrations of IFNγ compared with wild type. Only at 50 units/ml or greater was IFNγ able to induce nuclear fragmentation in either SOCS-1−/− or wild-type islets. This result is consistent with our previous findings, which show that the sensitivity of islets to IFNγ alone measured by STAT1 activation and the up-regulation of class I MHC, is not affected by SOCS-1 deficiency (16Chong M.M.W. Thomas H.E. Kay T.W.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The interpretation of these experiments remains arguable, because at each increasing concentration of IFNγ with fixed TNF, there was more DNA fragmentation in SOCS-1−/− islets than in wild type. Therefore, we undertook additional experiments to clarify whether the increased cell death was because of hypersensitivity to TNF, IFNγ, or both. To confirm that this increased cell death was not the result of increased sensitivity to IFNγ, we examined the sensitivity of SOCS-1−/− islets to cell death induced by IFNγ in combination with another cytokine, IL-1 (Fig. 2 C). IL-1 activates common signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 37Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar and 38Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and has similar effects on islet cells as TNF (11Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 184: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 10 units/ml IL-1 in combination with 100 units/ml IFNγ induced the same level of nuclear fragmentation in SOCS-1−/− and wild-type islets. Neither 10 units/ml IL-1 alone nor 1 unit/ml in combination with IFNγ damaged SOCS-1−/− or wild-type islets. This finding suggests that SOCS-1 deficiency does not increase the sensitivity of islets to either IFNγ or IL-1-mediated cytotoxicity. To investigate whether TNF signaling in the absence of IFNγ as well as in combination is also regulated by SOCS-1, we examined the effect of SOCS-1 deficiency on TNF-stimulated class I MHC expression. Class I MHC is a well characterized TNF-inducible gene in β cells (40Campbell I.L. Oxbrow L. West J. Harrison L.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The islets were treated with 0–2500 units/ml TNF for 48 h, and then the β-cell population was analyzed for class I MHC expression by flow cytometry (Fig.3 A). The class I MHC expression on both SOCS-1−/− and wild-type β cells was up-regulated by TNF in a dose-dependent manner. Class I MHC was increased on wild-type β cells treated with TNF at 250 units/ml or greater but not at lower concentrations. However, 25 units/ml was sufficient to up-regulate class I MHC expression on SOCS-1−/− β cells. In addition, SOCS-1−/− β cells expressed higher levels of class I MHC in response to a range of concentrations (25–2500 units/ml). Consistent with no change in the sensitivity of SOCS-1−/− islets to IL-1-induced cell death (Fig. 2 B), no difference was found in the IL-1 induction of class I MHC on SOCS-1−/− compared with wild-type β cells (data not shown). To ensure that the increased sensitivity of SOCS-1−/− β cells to TNF in vitro was not because of prior responsiveness to cytokines in vivo, freshly isolated β cells (without culturing) were analyzed for basal class I MHC expression. Basal class I MHC levels on SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− β cells were found to be the same as on the controls (data not shown). Moreover, we did not find any evidence for constitutive activation of IFNγ (STAT1) and TNF (NFκB and MAPK) signaling molecules in SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− islets (data not shown). These data suggest that the increased sensitivity of SOCS-1−/− β cells to TNF is unlikely to be a result of primingin vivo. We have previously shown that β cells express TNFR1 at the mRNA and protein levels but have been unable to detect TNFR2 expression (9Stephens L.A. Thomas H.E., Li, M. Grell M. Darwiche R. Volodin L. Kay T.W.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Increased expression of one or both TNF receptors could be responsible for the increased responses of SOCS-1-/- β cells to the cytokine. However, SOCS-1-/- β cells were found to express the same levels of TNFR1 as controls, whereas TNFR2 expression was undetectable on both SOCS-1−/− and wild-type β cells (Fig. 3 B). TNF + IFNγ may damage β cells indirectly by inducing intra-islet IL-1 production by resident islet macrophages, which in turn results in NO-dependent β-cell cytotoxicity (5Corbett J.A. McDaniel M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly K.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the IL-1-independent actions of TNF on β cells, the effects of intra-islet IL-1 production were blocked with IRAP, an antagonist of IL-1-IL-1 receptor binding (Fig.4 A). The nuclear fragmentation of control islets by TNF + IFNγ was largely inhibited by the addition of IRAP, which is consistent with the stimulation of intra-islet IL-1 production being responsible for the TNF-induced islet cell death. However, the addition of IRAP only partially blocked the TNF + IFNγ-induced cell death in SOCS-1−/− islets. This finding suggests that SOCS-1−/− β cells may be susceptible to damage by TNF itself independent of IL-1. This was confirmed when FACS-purified β cells were analyzed for sensitivity to TNF + IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 4 B). These populations are highly purified and do not contain resident islet macrophages. TNF + IFNγ did not cause nuclear fragmentation of purified control β cells but did in purified SOCS-1−/− β cells, further indicating that the sensitivity of SOCS-1−/− β cells to these cytokines is not dependent on factors produced in non-β cells within the islet but is a direct effect. TNF may induce cell death in SOCS-1−/− islets via the activation of the caspase pathway through the death domain of TNFR1 (TNFR1 signaling is reviewed in Ref. 41Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E.

Alternatively, TNF may induce cell death by inducing iNOS expression and NO production (10Eizirik D.L. Flodstrom M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,39Sekine N. Ishikawa T. Okazaki T. Hayashi M. Wollheim C.B. Fujita T. J. Cell.

Specific inhibitors were used to determine the contribution of caspases and iNOS (Fig. 5 A). Co-incubation with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk did not affect the level of cell death induced by TNF and IFNγ in SOCS-1−/− or wild-type islets. However, the presence of the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine completely blocked the nuclear fragmentation of both SOCS-1−/− and control islets, suggesting that TNF-induce"

The asymmetric unit contains four molecules, which, in the free form, share the same conformation. Upon NAD binding, C3 underwent various conformational changes, whose amplitudes were differentially limited in the four molecules of the crystal unit. A major rearrangement concerns the loop that contains the functionally important ARTT motif (ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin turn-turn). The ARTT loop undergoes an ample swinging motion to adopt a conformation that covers the nicotinamide moiety of NAD. In particular, Gln-212, which belongs to the ARTT motif, flips over from a solvent-exposed environment to a buried conformation in the NAD binding pocket. Mutational experiments showed that Gln-212 is neither involved in NAD binding nor in the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of C3, whereas it plays a critical role in the ADP-ribosyl transfer to the substrate Rho. We observed additional NAD-induced movements, including a crab-claw motion of a subdomain that closes the NAD binding pocket. The data emphasized a remarkable NAD-induced plasticity of the C3 binding pocket and suggest that the NAD-induced ARTT loop conformation may be favored by the C3-NAD complex to bind to the substrate Rho.

ADP-ribosyl toxin turn-turn glutathione S-transferase root mean square deviation nicotinamide mono-nucleotide phosphate-nicotinamide Many bacterial toxins ADP-ribosylate nucleotide-binding proteins that are involved in essential cell functions (for review see Ref. 1Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Protein, Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990Google Scholar). The molecular basis of their action consists of the binding of NAD, its glycohydrolysis into ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, and the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety to a specific residue on the eukaryotic protein substrate. All these toxins share a highly conserved catalytic glutamate, which is critical for the NAD-glycohydrolase activity. Although they exhibit a similar global mode of action, ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins are quite distinct regarding their substrate and their pathophysiological properties. Thus, these toxins can be divided into four subfamilies: diphtheria-like toxins, cholera-like toxins, binary toxins and C3-like exoenzymes. C3-like exoenzymes are distinct from other ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins in that they lack specific cell-surface binding and translocation components to facilitate their cell entry. Also, they are unique because of their high specificity for the small GTP-binding proteins RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC on an asparagine residue. This specificity makes them particularly useful to switch off selectively the cellular function of Rho proteins. Thus, C3-like exoenzymes are used to study the Rho-dependent processes, including cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis, phagocytosis, nucleus signaling, and regulation of gene transcription (for review see Ref.2Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of C3 action including NAD binding, its glycohydrolysis, Rho binding, and Rho ADP-ribosylation, is not well understood. The structure of Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme free of NAD was recently determined, revealing that C3-like exoenzymes possess the main features that characterize the NAD-binding site of other ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These authors have proposed that C3-like exoenzymes and binary toxins should be included in the same subfamily on the basis of structural and sequence similarities in their catalytic domain. A new motif of this subfamily has been described and termed the ARTT1(ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn) motif (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This motif of two short amino acid stretches (or turns) encompasses residues 207–210 and 211–214 and may be important for catalytic activity and substrate recognition (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Wilde C. Just I. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The highly conserved catalytic glutamate (Glu-214) belongs to this motif. Another similarity with the C3-like exoenzymes and binary toxins is the absence of the “active site” loop that has been described for other ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins as a substrate recognition site (5Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To approach the molecular basis of C3 action, we carried out a structural study of the C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme complexed to NAD. Crystals of C3 free of NAD were initially obtained with four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 2.7 Å resolution. To prevent NAD hydrolysis during crystal growth, we briefly soaked these crystals in NAD solution. Hence, the structure of C3 complexed to NAD was determined at 1.95 Å resolution, preventing crystallographic bias in a structural comparison with the free form. These structures showed that upon NAD binding, C3 underwent various conformational changes whose amplitudes were differentially limited in the four molecules of the crystal unit. Our data emphasized a remarkable NAD-induced plasticity of the NAD binding pocket and suggest that a novel ARTT conformation may be privileged by the C3-NAD complex to bind to Rho. The mature form of C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme (residues 41–251) was subcloned into the pET-28a vector, expressed in the BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity in one step by cation exchange chromatography (CM-Sepharose Fast Flow). Mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the pET-28a C3 wild-type as templates and the respective oligonucleotides using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The different C3 mutants (S174A, L177C, Q182A, R186E, and Q212A) were expressed and purified as the wild-type. RhoA was produced as a pure protein as previously described (7Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) using the pGEX-2T RhoA-F25N vector (gift of A. Hall) expressed in the XLI Blue strain of E. coli after cleavage of the GST moiety from the fusion protein RhoA-GST with 3 units of thrombin for 18 h at 4 °C. Crystals of wild-type and mutant C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme were grown in sitting drops by the vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Crystals were obtained with 12 mg/ml protein against a reservoir containing 22.5% PEG (polyethylene glycol) 3350 w/w, 100 mm Li2SO4, and 80 mm citric acid at pH 3. Seeding techniques were applied to obtain large single crystals. A cryoprotectant consisting of 10% propanol, 15% ethylene glycol, 6% xylitol, 22.5% PEG 3350 w/w, and 100 mm citric acid at pH 3 was used for flash-freeze crystals in liquid ethane. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with four molecules per asymmetric unit named, hereafter and in the PDB coordinates, as A, B, C, and D. To solve the structure of C3 by the isomorphous replacement method, we crystallized a cysteine mutant of C3 (L177C). The mutant was co-crystallized with 0.1 mm mercury acetate added to the precipitant. Crystals were later soaked in 97% of the crystallized solution and 3% of saturated methyl mercuric chloride for 3 days. An x-ray diffraction data set was collected at 17 °C to 2.7 Å resolution on a MAR image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku x-ray source. All the data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (8Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38592) Google Scholar) (see Table I). Meanwhile, the crystal structure of the wild-type C3 exoenzyme of C. botulinum was solved (PDB accession code 1G24) (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, this structure was used as search model to solve the C3-L177C structure by molecular replacement with AMoRe (9Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The structure was refined after one round of rigid-body refinements by simulated annealing, energy minimization, and isotropic B-factor refinements through maximum-likelihood as implemented in CNS (10Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). A model was built using TURBO (11Roussel A. Cambillaud C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar) with SIGMAA-weighted 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps calculated with the CCP4 suite (12CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein CrystallographyActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar) through alternating cycles of CNS refinement. No non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used during the refinement. The final structure has an R-factor (R-free) of 24.0% (29.0%). The average r.m.s. deviation between the Cα atoms of the C3-L177C models versus those of the C3 wild-type models reported by Han et al. (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) at 1.7 Å in a different crystal form and pH condition is 0.65 Å, confirming the original polypeptide trace and that the cysteine mutation and mercury atom cause no major change. Consequently, the C3-L177C structure represents well the structure of the wild-type C3 in the nucleotide-free state.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsDataC3-freeC3-NADSoaking delay—60 minSpace groupC2C2Resolution (last shell) (Å)20–2.7 (2.8–2.7)25–1.95 (2.0–1.95)Unit cell (a, b, c) (Å)109.0, 75.6, 123.5103.95, 74.2, 119.7(°)102.4102.1Measured reflections120624157546Unique reflections4911662950Completeness (last shell) (%)93.1 (76.3)96.8 (96.2)Mean I/ς (last shell)9.9 (1.8)16.3 (2.6)Rsym (last shell) (%)7.2 (39.9)5.6 (27.3)R/Rfree(%)24.0/29.023.4/27.7Average B-factor (Å2)59.938.9Number proteins atoms/waters6467/436486/571R.m.s.d. bond (Å)/angles (°)0.012/1.70.027/1.8 Open table in a new tab Crystals of wild-type C3 complexed to NAD were obtained by soaking experiments rather than co-crystallization to limit NAD hydrolysis during crystal growth. Crystals of C3 were soaked for 30–60 min in the crystallized solution with the addition of 20 mm NAD. Then, the crystals were flash-frozen to prevent the NAD hydrolysis in the crystals. An x-ray diffraction data set was collected at −170 °C to 1.95 Å resolution on the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BM30. Because the soaked crystals were isomorphous with those of C3-free, the structure of C3-NAD was directly refined starting from the coordinates of C3-free. Then, ARP/WARP 5 (13Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) was used to automatically position water molecules in uninterpreted electron density (higher than 3.5 ς) corresponding to NAD. REFMAC from the CCP4 suite was used in ARP/WARP 5 to carry out structural refinement (12CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein CrystallographyActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar). The C3-NAD structure was refined as the C3-free structure. The final structure has an R-factor (R-free) of 23.4% (27.7%). The final statistics for the models are summarized in Table I. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB accession codes 1gze and r1gzesf, respectively, for C3L177C-free and 1gzf and r1gzfsf, respectively, for C3WT-NAD. To measure the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of C3 wild-type or its mutants, 0.1 nmol of the exoenzyme and 1 mmol of NAD enriched with 50 μmol of [32P]NAD in 10 μl of phosphate buffer 10 mm, pH 7.5, were incubated for 1, 20, 50, 100, and 120 min at 37 °C. 1 μl of each sample was then loaded on a cellulose MN 300 sheet (Polygram CL 300 PEI/UV254, Machery-Nagel) and eluted with 100% ethanol:H2O:sodium acetate 1 m at pH 5 20:40:20. Radioactivity was detected and quantified with an imaging system (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics). Results are representative of three independent experiments and were subjected to an analysis of variance (StatView). To measure ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C3 wild-type or its mutants, 0.1 nmol of the exoenzyme diluted in 10 μl of Tris 50 mm, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol and 1.3 μm [32P]NAD was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.05 nmol of RhoA. This mixture was then loaded on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and radioactive RhoA was directly detected and quantified on the dried gel by an imaging system (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics) NAD binding measurements on C3 wild-type and mutants were performed using a BIAcore 2000 apparatus (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). C3 proteins (1 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, (pH ≪ pI)) were immobilized on CM5 sensor chip surfaces using the standard amine coupling procedure and a flow rate set at 5 μl/min. The blank surface was constructed in the same way except that the C3 protein was omitted to serve as a reference surface. Kinetics assays were conducted at 25 °C using 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl containing 0.005% Surfactant P20 as running buffer. Various concentrations of NAD (10–250 μm in 10 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween, pH 7.4) were injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min to reduce the mass transport effect. All assays of C3 and NAD interactions were performed in each case in duplicate and in three separate experiments. The blank run was subtracted from each sensorgram prior to data processing using BIAevaluation software 3. The data were fitted using the steady state affinity (Req versus C) option available within BIAevaluation 3 software. The structures of C. botulinumC3 exoenzyme free (C3-free) and complexed to NAD (C3-NAD) were solved by molecular replacement at 2.7 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures were obtained in the same crystal form, which includes four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, named hereafter molecules A, B, C, and D. In the C3-free form, each of the four molecules adopts an overall structure that is similar to the three others or to the one previously described (3Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (r.m.s.d. < 0.67 Å; Table II). The overall structure of the four NAD-bound C3 molecules is also conserved, and each of them is similar to its equivalent unbound form (r.m.s.d. < 0.88 Å; Table II). The overall structure of C3 is a mixed α/β fold with a β-sandwich core formed by perpendicular packing of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet (β1, β4, β8, β7, and β2) against a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β3, β6, and β5). The three-stranded sheet is flanked by four consecutive α-helices (α1, α2, α3, and α4), and the five-stranded sheet is flanked by an additional α-helix (α5) (Fig.1A).Table IIr.m.s. deviation (Å)C3-freeMolecule AMolecule BMolecule CMolecule DC3-freeMolecule AMolecule B0.55Molecule C0.480.67Molecule D0.560.670.57C3-free (Han et al.)

Two of them are quite striking (Fig. 1). The first one concerns the loop comprising residues 204–212 that overlaps the so-called ARTT motif (residues 207–214), which was previously proposed to be implicated in substrate specificity and recognition (14Han S. Tainer J.A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This “ARTT loop” is orientated differently in the NAD-bound molecule A (Fig. 1A), as compared with both the three other NAD-bound molecules (Fig. 1, B, C, and D) and the four unbound molecules, which all possess an ARTT loop in the same conformation. More precisely, the ARTT loop conformational difference between the NAD-bound molecule A and the other unbound or bound molecules is characterized by an average r.m.s.d. of 2.6 Å on the main chain atoms. In molecule A, the ARTT loop is not constrained by the crystal-packing environment, whereas in molecules B, C, and D it makes major crystal-packing contacts with helix α5 from a neighboring C3 molecule (Fig.2). In addition, a superimposition of molecule A on molecule B reveals that the ARTT loop conformation adopted by molecule A would be hindered by the local crystal-packing environment of molecule B (Fig. 2). Therefore, due to its unique unconstrained crystal-packing environment, only molecule A could adopt this NAD-induced ARTT loop conformation. A second striking difference that characterizes the four NAD-bound molecules concerns the NAD itself (Figs. 1 and 3). In molecule A, the electron density of NAD is well defined and its B-factor is low (33.5 Å2) as compared with the B-factor of the overall structure (38.2 Å2) (Fig. 3A). In molecule B, the electron density for the NAD is also well defined but its B-factor is higher (46.2 Å2 for the AMP moiety and 67.2 Å2 for the nicotinamide mono-nucleotide (NMN) moiety) (Fig. 3B). In molecule C, the electron density for NAD is weaker and broken between the C-5′ of the ribose-nicotinamide moiety and the O-5′ of the second phosphate group of ADP (Fig. 3C). The B-factor of NAD bound to molecule C is also higher than in molecule A. However, unlike NAD bound to molecule B, the B-factor of the ADP-ribose moiety (76.7 Å2) is higher than that of the nicotinamide moiety (49.8 Å2) (Fig. 3C), showing that two parts of NAD can be stabilized differentially in the binding site. In molecule D, there is no electron density for the ribose-nicotinamide moiety and the density for ADP moiety is fragmented (Fig. 3D). The presence of a poorly bound ADP molecule in the active site may be due to the NAD cleavage similar to that observed for NAD bound to molecule C, followed by the release of the ribose-nicotinamide. This NAD cleavage into ADP and ribose-nicotinamide is not the one that is expected by the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of the toxin, which hydrolyzes NAD into ADP-ribose and nicotinamide (Fig.3E, yellow bond). A similar situation was observed in the crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosaexotoxin A, a diphtheria-like toxin in complex with β-TAD, an NAD analog (PDB accession code 1AER) (15Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this structure, two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit with one that binds an intact β-TAD and the other that binds a β-TAD cleaved at this unexpected position. The origin of this cleavage is not understood. Therefore, of the four molecules seen in the asymmetric unit, molecules A and B appear to be the most interesting for investigating how NAD may bind to C3. Because molecule A binds an intact NAD and its functionally important ARTT loop is not constrained by crystal-packing contacts, we will now focus on this particular molecule to understand tentatively how NAD binds to C3 and may induce conformational changes.FIG. 3Electron density and B-factors of the co-substrates.

The NAD-glycohydrolyzable bond (N-1–C-1′) is shown in yellow with the nicotinamide moiety on its right and the ADP-ribose moiety on itsleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The NAD lies in a prominent cleft formed by the junction of two antiparallel β-sheets (β1-β3; Fig. 1A). One end of this cleft is open to the solvent, while the other is closed by both the ARTT loop and an additional loop that links strands β3-β4 (Fig. 1A). The latter, so-called “Phosphate-Nicotinamide” (PN) loop stabilizes one phosphate group and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD. The interactions between the toxin and the NAD are reported in Table III. The aromatic ring of Phe-183 from the PN loop stacks against the nicotinamide moiety. The carbonyl and amide groups of Gly-129 (strand β1) form a pair of hydrogen bonds with the carboxamide group of the nicotinamide. The side chain of Gln-212 and the catalytic Glu-214 from the ARTT motif both make a hydrogen bond with the O-2′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose. The carbonyl group of Thr-80 (α2 helix) interacts with the O-3′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose. Arg-128 (strand β1) and Arg-186 from the PN loop together with Asn-87 (α3 helix) make hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups. Asp-130 and Asp-131 (β1 strand) interact with the O-2′ and O-3′-hydroxyl of the adenine ribose. The aliphatic chain of Arg-91 lies against the adenine aromatic ring, whose N-6 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Glu-169 (β2 strand). The NAD adopts an unusual highly folded compact structure, where the AMP and NMN moieties are both in a closed conformation (16Moodie S.L. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This results in both a short intramolecular distance of 4.8 Å between the PA phosphate and the N-9 atom of AMP moiety and an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the N-7 atom of nicotinamide and the PN phosphate group of the NMN moiety. Therefore, NAD binds to C3, like to other ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins (5Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because the C3-free and C3-NAD structures have been solved in the same crystal form, this analysis is prevented from crystal-packing bias. The NAD-induced ARTT loop movement causes a swinging rearrangement of some of its side chains from a solvent-exposed environment to a buried conformation (Fig.4). In particular, the side chain of Gln-212 makes a large switch (7 Å Cδ-Cδ atoms) toward the interior of the NAD-binding cleft, where it interacts with the O-2′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose. Also, but to a lesser extent, Ser-207 and Phe-209 move closer to NAD (Fig. 4, A and B). In this novel conformation, the ARTT loop and the three side chains covered the ribose-nicotinamide moiety in the NAD-binding site. The ribose-nicotinamide moiety is further buried by stacking with the aromatic side chain of Phe-183 from the PN loop (Fig. 4, A and B). All these residue movements lead to the formation of an adjusted pocket that surrounds the ribose-nicotinamide moiety in the NAD-binding site (Fig. 4C). Gln-212 contributes to the formation of this pocket by forming a network of interactions (Fig. 4B). It interacts with Gln-182 from the PN loop, which in turn lies along the aromatic ring of Phe-183 and with a water molecule that links Ser-207 and the catalytic Glu-214. This water molecule takes the same position as the Gly-211 amide from the ARTT loop, which has moved by 6 Å upon NAD binding (Fig. 4, A and B). The catalytic Glu-214 is maintained in the same position in the free and NAD-bound forms for two reasons. First, the interaction between Glu-214 and Gly-211 in the free form is no longer possible in the NAD form due to the glycine movement but is replaced by indirect interactions with Gln-212 and Ser-207 through a water molecule. Second, the interaction of Glu-214 with Ser-174 from the STS motif, which forms the bottom of the site, is preserved. These two sets of interactions lock Glu-214, which thus interacts with the O-2′-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide ribose (Fig. 4B), in agreement with the proposed mechanism of catalysis (18Han S. Craig J.A. Putnam C.D. Carozzi N.B. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Oppenheimer N.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon NAD binding, the ARTT loop undergoes a major movement, accompanied by a rearrangement of two side chains of the PN loop, which lock the ribose-nicotinamide moiety in the binding site, without disturbing the critical position of the catalytic Glu-214. Upon this NAD-induced conformational change, the ARTT loop is further stabilized. Thus, whereas in the free form the B-factor of the ARTT loop is higher (76.9 Å2) than the B-factor of the overall molecule (62.8 Å2), in the NAD-bound form it becomes much lower (26.9 Å2) than the B-factor of the overall molecule (33.9 Å2). The ARTT loop conformational change, however, is not an absolute prerequisite for NAD to bind to C3. Fig. 1Breveals that NAD binds C3 in the crystal, whereas the conformation of the ARTT loop remains similar to that observed in the free form. However, inspection of B-factors revealed that NAD bound in molecule B (B = 56 Å2) is less stabilized than in molecule A (B = 33.5 Å2). The conformational change of the ARTT loop, as seen in molecule A, may be responsible for the stabilization of bound NAD. Whether or not the NAD-induced network of interactions contributes to the stabilization process of NAD has been investigated by the mutational experiments described hereafter. Another important change that occurs in C3 upon NAD binding is a “crab-claw” movement, which closes and opens the ADP moiety-binding site. It concerns a large subdomain consisting of three strands and a helix (β8-β7-β2 and α5), which undergoes a hinge movement of ∼9° with respect to the rest of the molecule"
https://openalex.org/W2067297743,"We examined the signaling pathway by which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces cell motility, with special focus on the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus. We used Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing ERK2 because of their prominent motility response to HGF. HGF stimulation of the cells induces not only a rapid, marked, and sustained activation and rapid nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2, but also a prolonged nuclear retention of the activated ERK1/2. Interruption of the ERK1/2 activation by PD98059 treatment of the cells 30 min after HGF stimulation abolishes the HGF-induced cell motility. Enforced cytoplasmic retention of the activated ERK1/2 by the expression of an inactive form of MKP-3 cytoplasmic phosphatase inhibits the cell motility response. Although epidermal growth factor stimulation of the cells induces the activation and nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2, it does not induce the prolonged nuclear retention of the activated ERK1/2, and fails to induce cell motility. In the nucleus, activated ERK1/2 continuously phosphorylate Elk-1, leading to the prolonged expression of c-fos, which results in the expression of several genes such as matrix metalloproteinase(mmp)-9; MMP-9 activity is required for the induction of the cell motility response. Our results indicate that the sustained activity of ERK1/2 in the nucleus is required for the induction of HGF-induced cell motility."

Increased expression of M-CSFR on cultured microglia results in proliferation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase. We transfected mouse BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglia to overexpress M-CSFR and examined microglial phagocytosis of fluorescein-conjugated Aβ. Flow cytometry and laser confocal microscopy showed accelerated phagocytosis of Aβ in mouse and human microglia because of M-CSFR overexpression that was time- and concentration-dependent. In contrast, microglial uptake of 1-μm diameter polystyrene microspheres was not enhanced by M-CSFR overexpression. Microglial uptake of Aβ was blocked by cytochalasin D, which inhibits phagocytosis. M-CSFR overexpression increased the mRNA for macrophage scavenger receptor A, and fucoidan blocking of macrophage scavenger receptors inhibited uptake of Aβ. M-CSFR antibody blocking experiments demonstrated that increased Aβ uptake depended on the interaction of the M-CSFR with its ligand. These results suggest that overexpression of M-CSFR in APPV717F mice may prime microglia for phagocytosis of Aβ after immunization.

Alzheimer's disease macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor macrophage colony-stimulating factor amyloid β fluorescein-conjugated amyloid β phosphate-buffered saline mouse scavenger receptor type A Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is characterized by amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plaques surrounded by microglia. Aβ is thought to be directly neurotoxic, and activated microglia are hypothesized to have negative effects on neurons through the release of effectors of inflammation (1Akiyama H. Arai T. Kondo H.

Whereas some results suggest that microglial phagocytosis may be key in clearance of Aβ after immunization (8Bard F. Cannon C. Barbour R. Burke R.L. Games D. Grajeda H. Guido T., Hu, K. Huang J.

This controversy has stimulated renewed interest in uptake of Aβ by microglia. A distinctive phenotypic feature of microglia surrounding Aβ plaques in APPV717F transgenic mice and in AD is enhanced expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), translation product of the c-fms proto-oncogene (10Murphy G.M., Jr. Zhao F.

Brain Res. 1994; 639: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Microglial M-CSFR expression is also increased after experimental ischemic and traumatic brain injury (12Wang Y.

M-CSFR regulates proliferation, activation, and survival of cells in the monocyte-macrophage lineage through tyrosine kinase activation of diverse signal transduction pathways including: Src kinase, Ras-ERK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and p38 MAP kinase (14Rothwell V.M.

Blood. 2002; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In AD macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), the ligand for M-CSFR expressed by neurons and glia is also increased (18Du Yan S. Zhu H., Fu, J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W.

Simultaneous increases in M-CSF and M-CSFR expression in the brain could result in significant changes in microglial function. We recently demonstrated that overexpression of M-CSFR by cultured microglia increases proliferation, stimulates release of pro-inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, and induces a paracrine inflammatory response in a microglial-organotypic co-culture system (19Mitrasinovic O.M.

In the present study we sought to determine the effects of M-CSFR overexpression on Aβ phagocytosis by cultured mouse and human microglia. We hypothesized that M-CSFR-induced activation of microglia would increase their capacity to clear Aβ from culture medium. Although Aβ immunization clinical trials have been discontinued in humans for the present, identifying factors that enhance microglial clearance of Aβ may be of benefit in devising alternative means of decreasing Aβ burden in the brain in AD. The c-fms expression plasmid pTK1 was a gift from Dr. Rao Tekmal (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), and contains the complete mouse c-fms sequence under the control of an SV40 promoter (20Keshava N.

The BV-2 immortalized microglial cell line has been characterized previously (21Blasi E. Barluzzi R. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J.

M. Murphy, Jr., unpublished observations.BV-2 cells used in these experiments were from passage 25 or lower. The human SV-A3 cell line was a gift from Dr. Robert Nelson (Pfizer Central Research, Groton, CT). The SV-A3 line was an immortalized line from fetal brain microglia, and phenotypic features have been previously described (19Mitrasinovic O.M. Perez G.V. Zhao F. Lee Y.L. Poon C. Murphy G.M., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30142-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transient transfections with the pTK1 plasmid were carried out using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Invitrogen). BV-2 or SV-A3 cells were plated at 65% confluency in 6-well tissue culture Eagle's medium. BV-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Applied Scientific, South San Francisco, CA) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 4 mm glutamine (Applied Scientific), 0.02m HEPES (Applied Scientific), 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). SV-A3 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For each transfection reaction, 0.2 μg of pTK1 plasmid pre-coated with 6 μl of the PLUS reagent and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per 5 × 105 microglial cells. Control transfections were performed in parallel with an equal volume of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent only (transfection medium; designated by M in the figures). Transfections using the pZeoSV plasmid (Invitrogen) that contains the pTK1 backbone sequence originally used in c-fms subcloning were included as a second control, although we previously showed that pZeoSV does not induce a microglial proinflammatory response (19Mitrasinovic O.M.

Cells were transfected with the pZeoSV plasmid using the same procedure as described for pTK1. After the addition of transfection reagents, cells were returned to the incubator for 24 h, and then used for phagocytosis studies. Microglia that were transfected with the pTK1 plasmid were then compared with nontransfected microglia for M-CSFR expression to determine transfection efficiency. Immunocytochemical visualization of M-CSFR was demonstrated previously (19Mitrasinovic O.M. Perez G.V. Zhao F. Lee Y.L. Poon C. Murphy G.M., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30142-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To quantify cells overexpressing M-CSFR, 24 h post-transfection BV-2 cells were washed with PBS buffer, reacted for 1 h with 10% normal goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse M-CSFR antiserum (1:500) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 16 h at 4 °C. The M-CSFR antibody has specificity for the extracellular domain of the receptor (25Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were then washed three times with 1× PBS buffer on ice, then detached with trypsin and collected by centrifugation. Finally, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde solution and analyzed for M-CSFR overexpression by flow cytometry as described below. A population of 10,000 cells per sample was used to acquire two-dimensional contour forward and orthogonal scatter diagrams. The nonviable subpopulation of cells was excluded by setting the gated forward scatter value to 60. Cellular autofluorescence in the Cy3 channel was 4.32 units for control and c-fms-transfected microglia. Microglial phagocytosis of Aβ was determined using Fluo-Aβ, a direct fluorescein conjugate that can be visualized with a flow cytometer or with fluorescence microscopy (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immediately before use, Fluo-Aβ 1-40 or 1-42 was resuspended in 2% DMSO solution in Earl's buffer (140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 200 nm and allowed to aggregate for 2 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. This preparation was similar to that utilized by Li et al. (3Li R. Shen Y. Yang L.B. Lue L.F. Finch C. Rogers J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluo-Aβ was used at concentrations between 10 and 100 nm in phagocytosis assays. Another Aβ preparation, similar to that described by Webster et al. (26Webster S.D. Galvan M.D. Ferran E. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7496-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was utilized to study phagocytosis at higher Aβ concentrations. This preparation consisted of preaggregated Fluo-Aβ 1-40 added to nonlabeled Aβ 1-40 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) that had been aggregated by 60 h incubation at 4 °C, followed by 8 h incubation with gentle shaking at 37 °C as previously described (24Murphy G.M., Jr. Yang L. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20967-20971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The stock solution of this preparation consisted of 100 nm Fluo-Aβ 1-40 in 10 μm aggregated unlabeled 1-40. The stock solution was diluted 10-fold in culture medium prior to the phagocytosis assay. For the phagocytosis assay, mouse BV-2 cells were plated at 65% density in a 6-well tissue culture dish and grown using the conditions described above. After 24 h of transfection with c-fmsexpression plasmid, the control plasmid pZeoSV, or treatment with transfection medium alone, the medium was removed and BV-2 cells were washed four times with 1× Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen). Immediately before the phagocytosis assay, cells were equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C in 750 μl/well of Earl's buffer that had been supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.01% glucose (Mallinckrodt, Paris, KY). Subsequently, Fluo-Aβ reagents were added and cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark. To monitor the time course and concentration dependence of Fluo-Aβ phagocytosis in mouse microglia, nontransfected BV-2 cells were treated with Fluo-Aβ at final concentrations of 10, 20, or 100 nm, and harvested after 30 min, 60 min, or 24 h of incubation. To examine the effects of M-CSFR overexpression, BV-2 cells were transfected with the pTK1 plasmid, exposed to 15 nmFluo-Aβ 1-40, and harvested after 30 min, 60 min, or 24 h. In experiments with SV-A3 human microglia, transfection and phagocytosis assay conditions were the same as those for BV-2 cells, except that the final concentration of Fluo-Aβ was 10 nmand the exposure time was 120 min. To compare phagocytosis of Aβ peptides 1-40 and 1-42, BV-2 microglia transfected with the c-fms plasmid pTK1, the control plasmid pZeoSV, or treated with transfection medium were exposed to 20 nmFluo-Aβ 1-40 or 1-42 for 120 min. To assess phagocytosis of aggregated Aβ at higher concentrations, preaggregated Fluo-Aβ 1-40 with aggregated unlabeled Aβ 1-40 was applied for 180 min at final concentrations of 10 nm labeled peptide and 1 μm unlabeled peptide in the assay medium. Because rapidly proliferating c-fms-transfected BV-2 cells were not viable for more than few hours in serum-free medium, all 24-h phagocytosis experiments were performed in heat-inactivated serum-containing medium. Control samples for extracellular surface binding of Fluo-Aβ contained nontransfected BV-2 cells that were incubated in triplicate wells with 15 nm Fluo-Aβ for 24 h at 4 °C. To study Aβ uptake by MSR, BV-2 cells were pretreated with 100 μm of the MSR ligand fucoidan (Sigma) for 20 min prior to exposure to 20 nm Fluo-Aβ for 120 min. To demonstrate that uptake of Fluo-Aβ involves phagocytosis, microglia were pretreated with 5 μm cytochalasin D (27Mimura N. Asano A.

The phagocytosis assay was terminated by placing cells on ice and promptly removing medium containing Fluo-Aβ. Cells were washed 4 times with ice-cold 1× PBS to remove residual unbound Fluo-Aβ, and then detached from the bottom of the wells by treatment for 4 min with 250 μl of trypsin-EDTA (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) at room temperature. Trypsinization also served to remove residual amounts of unbound Fluo-Aβ. The cell suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 4 min. Finally, pelleted cells were resuspended by gentle pipetting in 500 μl of 1× PBS buffer on ice, transferred to 5-ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes (BD PharMingen), and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using a 10-color flow cytometer, a hybrid instrument consisting of a FACStarPlus bench (BD PharMingen), MoFlo electronics (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) and a custom electronics and computer system (Stanford Cell Sorting Facility, Stanford, CA) (28Roederer M., De Rosa S. Gerstein R. Anderson M. Bigos M. Stovel R. Nozaki T. Parks D. Herzenberg L. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The emitted fluorescence intensity was measured in triplicate using 10,000 cells per sample. Data were collected on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter desk (36Moore W.A. Kautz R.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.M. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. 4th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Edinburgh, Scotland1986: 30.1-30.11Google Scholar), calibrated so that fluorescence measurements were in the linear range above a value of 1.0. Subsequent statistical analysis of scatter plots and fluorescence histograms was performed using FlowJo 3.3 software (Tree Star Inc., San Carlos, CA). The viability of each sample was evaluated from forward/orthogonal scatter plots obtained on the ungated cell population. In all cases, cell populations were found to be uniform in size and without large aggregates, and the number of nonviable cells and cellular debris was found to be less than 10% of the total. For quantitative analysis, the mean fluorescence values for each sample were collected from the ungated cell population and corrected by subtracting the corresponding cellular autofluorescence value to obtain net signal value. The autofluorescence values for nontransfected and c-fms-transfected microglia were similar and had an average value of 4.27 units, except in Fig. 4Afor which the autofluorescence was 5.6. Autofluorescence of human SV-A3 microglia was 3.31 units. Absolute mean fluorescence intensities (given in figure legends) for control microglia were assigned a value of 1.0. Normalized fold change values were then calculated according to the equation: normalized fold fluorescence change = (mean transfected sample fluorescence intensity − cellular autofluorescence)/(mean control sample fluorescence intensity − cellular autofluorescence). Each experiment consisted of cell samples run in triplicate, and each experiment was performed three times. Graphs show mean normalized fold fluorescence change with standard deviations (S.D.) from triplicate experiments relative to transfection medium (M) treated control microglia. To examine microglial uptake of a substrate other than Aβ, we used polystyrene microspheres. The stock suspension of fluorescent 1-μm diameter polystyrene microspheres (blue-green FluoSpheres Fluorescent Microspheres, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) contained 1 × 107 microspheres per μl of water with 0.02% thimerosal. BV-2 cells were grown to 65% confluency and transfected with the pTK1 c-fms plasmid as described above. The phagocytosis assay was performed identically to that for Fluo-Aβ except that a suspension containing 0.5 μl of microsphere stock suspension per ml of medium was applied to the BV-2 cells. Fluorescence intensity measurements were taken using flow cytometry after 24 h of incubation, and calculations of fluorescence fold change were performed as described for the Fluo-Aβ assay. As a positive control, Fluo-Aβ experiments were performed in parallel to microsphere uptake experiments using the same batch of cells. To visualize phagocytosis of Aβ by microglia we used laser confocal microscopy. BV-2 and SV-A3 cells were cultured and transfected as described above, except that cells were grown on glass coverslips on the bottom of tissue culture dishes. Cells were treated with 25 nm Fluo-Aβ and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed 4 times with 1× PBS buffer at 4 °C and then fixed for 20 min with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Sigma) in 1× PBS. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using SlowFade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and examined on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) using a ×63 oil immersion objective. Images were captured in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. For comparison of c-fms-transfected and control BV-2 and SV-A3 microglia, images were captured using identical acquisition settings for contrast, brightness, pixel, and pinhole dimensions. Images of microglia without Fluo-Aβ treatment acquired with identical settings were used to assess background autofluorescence. Mouse BV-2 microglia were grown to 65% confluency and transfected with the pTK1 plasmid or the pZeoSV control plasmid as described above. After 24 h, total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were diluted to 1 μg/μl in RNase-free water, and reverse transcription was performed from 1 μg of RNA as previously described (19Mitrasinovic O.M. Perez G.V. Zhao F. Lee Y.L. Poon C. Murphy G.M., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30142-30149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Individual 25-μl quantitative SYBR Green real-time PCR reactions consisted of 5 μl of cDNA (50 ng/μl), 12.5 μl of 2× Universal SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 3.75 μl of 50 nm optimized forward and reverse primers with specificity for the mouse macrophage scavenger receptor type A (MSR-A) mRNA (GenBankTM accession number AF203781). Primer sequences designed using Primer Express software (PE Applied Biosystems) were: forward938, 5′-GACAAATTGGCTTCCCTGGA-3′, and reverse1001, 5′-CCCGACCTCCCTGGCTT-3′, where numbers indicate the position of the 5′ nucleotide. A 64-base pair amplicon was generated using these primers. Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI 5700 Instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) using a 3-stage program provided by the manufacturer: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Specificity of the amplification product was confirmed using dissociation reaction plots, with a distinct single peak indicating a single PCR product. Values for each sample were compared using a standard curve (37PE Applied BiosystemsUser Bulletin number 2. 1997; Google Scholar). Each sample was tested in triplicate PCR wells, and samples obtained from three independent experiments were used to calculate the mean ± S.D. BV-2 microglia were grown to a final density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture dishes and transfected with the pTK1 c-fmsexpression plasmid as described above. After 24 h, transfection medium was removed, and after washing cells at 4 °C with 1× PBS buffer, blocking medium was added consisting of 750 μl of serum-free medium and 5 μl of the rabbit anti-mouse M-CSFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Transfected and control microglia were grown in the presence of the M-CSFR blocking reagent for 24 h at 37 °C to account for the greatly increased cellular surface expression of M-CSFR after transfection with pTK1 plasmid (19Mitrasinovic O.M.

As a control, microglial cells were treated with an equal dilution of normal rabbit serum (Sigma). Phagocytosis measurements were taken as described above after 120 min of incubation with 5 nm Fluo-Aβ. All experiments were performed with triplicate cell culture samples, and each experiment was replicated on at least three separate occasions. Means of triplicate experiments were compared using two-tailed unpaired t tests, or with one or two-way analyses of variance. For post-hoc comparisons among means, the rigorous Scheffe adjustment for multiple testing was used. Fig. 1 summarizes flow cytometry analysis of M-CSFR overexpression on mouse BV-2 microglia detected using the antibody to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Fig.1A shows that after 24 h of transient transfection with the c-fms expression plasmid pTK1, there was an increase in Cy3 fluorescence (x axis) from transfected microglia relative to nontransfected cells, demonstrating M-CSFR overexpression. The contour diagrams are based on 10,000 cells per sample, and were gated to exclude nonviable cells with a forward scatter value of 60 and less. Examination of the ungated cell population showed that on average less than 10% of the cells were excluded by gating. The fluorescence histograms shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate that the average Cy3 fluorescence increased from 5.67 in nontransfected cells to 51.5 units in transfected cells. After subtracting the average autofluorescence of 4.32 units, the average net Cy3 intensity increased from 1.35 to 47.18 units. We chose a liberal estimate of 20 for the maximum fluorescence intensity of nontransfected cells. Based on the number of pTK1-transfected microglia that had fluorescence intensities greater than 20, the average transfection efficiency was 89.9%. To compare size, granularity, and overall morphology of transfected and control cells, forward/orthogonal scatter profiles of control and M-CSFR overexpressing BV-2 microglia were overlaid (Fig.1C). After exclusion of nonviable cells there was complete overlap in the scatter plots. This demonstrates no change in the size or structure of BV-2 microglia because of M-CSFR overexpression. BV-2 mouse and SV-A3 human microglia readily ingested Fluo-Aβ at low nanomolar concentrations. This response was enhanced by overexpression of M-CSFR. Fig. 2 shows uptake of Fluo-Aβ by nontransfected BV-2 cells, measured after 30 and 60 min and 24 h at concentrations of 10, 20, and 100 nm. Uptake occurred in a time- and Fluo-Aβ concentration-dependent manner; a maximum mean normalized fold fluorescence change of 6.64 ± 0.04 was measured in the 100 nm Fluo-Aβ-treated sample for 24 h. Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant effects because of concentration, time, and a time by concentration interaction (all p < 0.001). Post-hoc Scheffe tests showed that overall the increase after 24 h was significantly different from that after 30 and 60 min (Scheffe adjusted p < 0.05). The 30- and 60-min time points did not differ significantly. Overall, the 10, 20, and 100 nm concentrations gave significantly different results (adjusted p < 0.05). The interaction was because of a significantly greater increase at the 100 nm concentration after 24 h than after 30 and 60 min. Phagocytosis of Aβ was sharply increased after microglia were transiently transfected with the pTK1 c-fms plasmid. Fig.3 shows confocal imaging of Fluo-Aβ in control and c-fms-transfected microglia, and demonstrates an increase in intracellular Fluo-Aβ in mouse BV-2 (Fig. 3, Aand B) and in human SV-A3 (Fig. 3, C and D) cells as a result of M-CSFR overexpression (Fig. 3, B and D). Uptake of Fluo-Aβ by nontransfected SV-A3 cells was extremely low (Fig. 3C), making it difficult to acquire detailed images of the nontransfected state, even with confocal microscopy. Increased phagocytosis of Fluo-Aβ because of M-CSFR overexpression was quantified by flow cytometry. Fig.4A shows a fluorescence histogram from a representative experiment utilizing 10,000 BV-2 microglia that were c-fms transfected (red) or nontransfected (blue), and exposed to 25 nmFluo-Aβ for 180 min. pTK1-transfected microglia showed no difference in basal autofluorescence from control cells because of their similar size and shape. A positive shift along the x axis indicates an increase in mean fluorescence intensi"

A ligand-independent activation domain called AF-1, which is present in the N-terminal A/B region of RARs, contains serine residues (see Fig. 2 A) that are constitutively (i.e. in the absence of ligand) phosphorylated by the Cdk7 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH (4Rochette-Egly C.

We recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of RARγ2 at these residues is markedly increased in response to RA through activation of p38MAPK. 2Giannı̀, M., Bauer, A., Garattini, E., Chambon, P., and Rochette-Egly, C. (2002) EMBO J., in press.2Giannı̀, M., Bauer, A., Garattini, E., Chambon, P., and Rochette-Egly, C. (2002) EMBO J., in press. This RA-induced phosphorylation is important for both RARγ2-mediated transcription of RA target genes and degradation of the receptor by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate how p38MAPK is activated in response to RA. Activation of p38MAPK has been traditionally associated with stress responses through a cascade of phosphorylation reactions involving upstream kinases (MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK) (Refs. 6Pearson G.

However, it has been recently reported that p38MAPK activity could be regulated through cross-talks with the PI3K/Akt pathway (10Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell.

We show here that the RA-induced activation of p38MAPK and therefore the subsequent increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation resulted from the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was crucial for RA-induced degradation and transactivation activity of RARγ2, indicating that it is a key step in retinoid signaling. The pSG5-based expression vectors for mouse (m) RARγ2, mRARγ2S66A/S68A, and the DR5-tk-CAT reporter gene were described previously (5Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P.

STI571 was a gift from Dr. Barbara Willi (Novartis Pharma AG). The vectors for dominant active and negative Akt containing a Myc tag were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The cDNA for p38MAPK was provided by P. Cohen (Dundee, UK) and cloned into the pSG5 expression vector. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RARγ (RPγ(F)) have been described previously (15Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr(P) 4G10 monoclonal antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p38MAPK and Akt and their active phosphorylated forms, P-p38MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) and P-Akt (Ser-473), were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against c-Abl (K-12), c-Abl antibodies conjugated to agarose beads, and goat polyclonal antibodies against actin (C-11) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-Myc tag antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Polyclonal antibodies specific to RARγ2 phosphorylated at Ser-66 or Ser-68 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides followed by column chromatography with SulfoLink gel columns (Pierce) coupled to the corresponding immunizing phosphorylated peptide. After elution, the antibodies reacting with unphosphorylated RARγ were depleted by chromatography on a column coupled to the unphosphorylated peptide. F9 cells were cultured and treated with 10−7m RA as described previously (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown and transiently transfected in six-well plates using the DMRIE-C reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All transfections contained 2.5 μg of DNA including the DR5-tk-CAT reporter gene (1 μg), the RARγ2 pSG5-based expression vector (0.05 μg), the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (0.5 μg) to correct for variations in transfection efficiency, and Bluescript as a carrier. After a 16-h incubation with DNA, cells were washed and incubated for a further 48 h in medium with or without RA (10−6m). CAT assays were performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (CAT ELISA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All assays were normalized to equal β-galactosidase activity, and the results were expressed as pg of CAT/unit of β-galactosidase. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared as described previously (4Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and, when required, immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked with the indicated antibodies. For the detection of the phosphorylated forms of RARγ2, p38MAPK, Akt, or c-Abl, WCEs were prepared in phosphorylation lysis buffer (17Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D.V. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Proteins, with or without prior immunoprecipitation, were resolved by SDS-10% PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoprobed. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween containing 5% nonfat milk except antibodies against phosphorylated proteins, which were diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The protein-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence according to theAmersham Biosciences protocol. In RARγ2-transfected COS-1 cells, p38MAPK phosphorylation was induced after 24 h of RA treatment as assessed by WB analysis with specific antibodies recognizing the active phosphorylated form of the kinase (Fig.1 A, P-p38, comparelanes 1 and 2). To investigate whether this increase in p38MAPK activity involves Akt, we activated or inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway. First, a constitutively active (da) form of Akt was coexpressed with RARγ2 in COS-1 cells. This markedly decreased the RA-induced activation of p38MAPK (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–6). On the other hand, overexpression of a dominant negative (dn) form of Akt enhanced p38MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A,lanes 7–10). These results were corroborated by using STI571 (18Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl that down-regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway (19Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T.

As expected, STI571 (10 μm) decreased the level of c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B) while it increased the amount of active phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 1 B, P-Akt) as assessed by WB analysis with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of Akt. STI571 also suppressed the RA-induced increase in phosphorylated p38MAPK (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 2and 4). The effects of PI3K inhibitors (LY292002 and wortmannin) on p38MAPK phosphorylation were also evaluated. LY292002 (10 μm) and wortmannin (100 nm) decreased the amount of constitutively phosphorylated and activated Akt (Fig.1 D, P-Akt) and increased the activation of p38MAPK induced by RA (Fig. 1 E, compare lanes 2and 3). RA also activated p38MAPK in mouse embryocarcinoma cells (F9 cells)2 (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). Moreover, as in transfected COS-1 cells, STI571 and LY294002 abrogated (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 2 and 4) and increased (Fig. 1 E, compare lanes 2 and3), respectively, the activation of p38MAPK induced by RA in these cells. Altogether these results indicate that the RA-induced activation of p38MAPK involves the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In transfected COS-1 cells, RARγ2 is constitutively (i.e. in the absence of RA) phosphorylated at serine residues 66 and 68 located in the N-terminal A/B region (Fig.2 A) (5Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover,32P labeling experiments demonstrated that the amount of RARγ2 phosphorylated at these residues is increased in response to RA.2 These results were confirmed by WB analysis using antibodies recognizing specifically RARγ2 phosphorylated at serine 66 (P-RARγS1) or at serine 68 (P-RARγS2). Both antibodies detected an increase in the amount of phosphorylated RARγ2 upon RA treatment (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), indicating that RA increases the phosphorylation of both residues. No increase was observed in COS-1 cells expressing a RARγ2 mutant in which the two serine residues are mutated into alanine (RARγS66A/S68A) (Fig.2 B, lane 4). The RA-induced increase in phosphorylated RARγ2 detected with the phospho-RARγ antibodies was impaired upon incubation of the transfected cells with SB203580 (10 μm), a highly specific inhibitor of p38MAPK (21Cohen P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C, lane 3), while the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (5 μm) had no effect (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Additionally, the increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation was enhanced upon overexpression of p38MAPK (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2 and4) and appeared earlier (at 10 h instead of 24 h). Altogether these results further support the conclusion that the RA-induced increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation results from the activation of p38MAPK.2 We then investigated whether, as expected from the above results, modulating the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway would affect RA-induced RARγ2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of the da form of Akt inhibited the increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and4), whereas a dn form of Akt enhanced RARγ2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and6). Addition of STI571 also blocked the RA-induced increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2 and 4), while in contrast, it was enhanced by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 2 and 4). Similar results were obtained with F9 cells (data not shown). Collectively these results indicate that the RA-induced RARγ2 phosphorylation results from the activation of p38MAPK through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Agonistic ligands convert RARγ2 into a strong transcriptional activator. Concomitantly, RARγ2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (22Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the RA-induced increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation that is mediated through activation of p38MAPK is required for both degradation and transactivation of the receptor.2 Therefore, we investigated whether modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway would also affect RA-induced RARγ2 degradation and transcriptional potential. Expression of da Akt (Fig. 4 A,lanes 5 and 6) blocked RA-induced RARγ2 degradation that occurs at 48 h in transfected COS-1 cells. Addition of STI571 had the same effect in COS-1 cells and F9 cells (Fig. 4 C, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, overexpression of a dn form of Akt (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4) as well as the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (Fig. 4 E, compare lanes 4and 6 to lane 2, and data not shown) increased RARγ2 degradation. The transcriptional activity of RARγ2 was similarly affected. Indeed, in COS-1 cells expressing RARγ2 and a CAT reporter gene under the control of a DR5-RA response element (DR5-tk-CAT), the expression of da Akt (Fig. 4 B) decreased the RA-induced increase in CAT activity. Addition of STI571 had similar effects (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin enhanced CAT activity (Fig. 4 F). Collectively these results indicate that the down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in both RA-induced degradation and transcriptional activity of RARγ2. We previously found that the RA-induced increase in RARγ2 phosphorylation is mediated through activation of p38MAPK.2Here we report that this activation implicates the down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Indeed, blocking PI3K with wortmannin or LY294002 amplified the observed RA-induced increase in p38MAPK activity and RARγ2 phosphorylation. Reciprocally, stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway upon STI571 treatment or overexpression of da Akt down-regulated these processes. Our present results are in agreement with recent reports demonstrating that Akt negatively regulates p38MAPK (10Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 11Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J.

How RA inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway was recently elucidated in mouse embryocarcinoma cells (F9 cells) by Bastien et al., 3Bastien, J., Plassat, J. L., Chambow, P., and Rochette-Egly, C., manuscript submitted.who have shown that RA acts at two levels, phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTEN and inhibition of PI3K through its p85α subunit, both of them leading to Akt inhibition. Interestingly our present study has demonstrated that the RA-induced down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway targets not only the phosphorylation of RARγ2 through the activation of the p38MAPK but also its transcriptional activity and its degradation by the proteasome. Thus, RARγ2 phosphorylation, RARγ2 turnover, and RARγ2-mediated transcription of RA target genes are interrelated events resulting from the RA-induced down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which therefore plays an important role in RA signaling. It is interesting to note that Akt is a mediator of cell growth and survival, while RA has pronounced antiproliferative potential that is usually linked to its capacity to induce differentiation. In keeping with this activity, RA is used in the treatment of several cancers (23Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar,24Smith M.A. Anderson B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2955-2957PubMed Google Scholar). As a number of tumoral processes have been correlated with constitutively high Akt activity (11Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brazil D.P.

Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and therefore to aberrant downstream kinase activities, one can speculate that inhibition of this pathway would improve the efficiency of RA therapy. In that respect it should be noted that STI571, which not only inhibits c-Abl tyrosine kinase but also other receptor tyrosine kinases that are often amplified in carcinoma (27Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar) and lead to increased activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, is currently used in cancer therapy (28Barthe C.

Ponzanelli I. Rambaldi A. Terao M. Garattini E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3234-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is capable of partially reversing the RA resistance of some acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (32Giannı̀ M. Kalac Y. Ponzanelli I. Rambaldi A. Terao M. Garattini E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3234-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Altogether these results strongly suggest that the combination of retinoids with agents that affect the PI3K/Akt pathway could be exploited at the clinical level to improve retinoid therapy and/or reverse RA resistance. In conclusion, this study will provide new insights not only into retinoid signaling but also into retinoid therapy. We acknowledge Dr. Barbara Willi for the generous gift of STI571 and Dr. P.

Hence it is interesting to understand this phenomenon on the molecular level, and numerous studies have been devoted to investigations of dynamical and structural features of A-tract DNA. It was early observed that anomalously slow base pair-opening kinetics were a striking physical property unique to DNA A-tracts (Leroy, J. L., Charretier, E., Kochoyan, M., and Gueron, M.

In the present work it is shown, using imino proton exchange measurements by NMR spectroscopy that the main contribution to the dampening of the base pair-opening fluctuations in A-tracts comes from the C5 methylation of the thymine base. Because the methyl group has been shown to have a very limited effect on the DNA curvature as well as the structure of the DNA helix, the thymine C5 methyl group stabilizes the helix directly. Empirical potential energy calculations show that methylation of the tract improves the stacking energy of a base pair with its neighbors in the tract by 3–4 kcal/mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3358-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that properly positioned adenine tracts increase the accessibility of nearby promoter regions by their intrinsic tendency to oppose nucleosome binding (6Shimizu M. Mori T. Sakurai T. Shindo H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3358-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Blomquist P. Belikov S. Wrange Ö. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hence, alterations of the nucleosome packaging affect the accessibility of promoters and change expression. In this context, it is important to understand the structural and dynamical properties of A-tract DNA. An example of A-tract DNA influencing the global properties of DNA is the bending of the helix axis that occurs when A-tracts are phased with the helical repeat of the double helix, originally discovered from the anomalously slow migration in polyacrylamide gels displayed by such sequences (8Marini J.C. Levene S.D. Crothers D.M. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 9Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The A-tracts must be at least four base pairs long and may contain a 5′-AT-3′ step but not a 5′-TA-3′ step to produce significant bending (10Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 11Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Price M.A. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hence, A-tracts of the type 5′-AnTm -3′, n + m > 3, produce bending when repeated in phase with the helix screw (13Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7033-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar,14Hagerman P.J. Nature. 1986; 321: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Apart from the importance of A-tracts for the organization of DNA in chromatin it has become increasingly apparent that intrinsic bending of DNA is likely to play an important role in gene expression and replication (15Zahn K. Blattner F.R. Science. 1987; 236: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Bracco L. Kotlarz D. Kolb A. Diekmann S. Buc H.

Although the presence of DNA bending in these types of alternating sequences is undisputed the explanation of the phenomenon on the base pair level has been debated (19Haran T.E. Kahn J.D.

Crystal structures reveal that the base pairs in A-tracts are highly propeller-twisted and that the minor groove is unusually narrow (25Nelson H.C. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 26Coll M. Frederick C.A. Wang A.H. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3497-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are compatible with this type of structure. Another feature typical of A-tract DNA is unusually slow imino proton exchange rates measured by NMR spectroscopy, signifying anomalously slow base pair-opening kinetics (33Leroy J.L. Charretier E. Kochoyan M. Gueron M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Moe J.G. Russu I.M.

A striking correspondence with gel mobility data was found. The gel migration anomaly produced by repeating A-tracts is highly sensitive to changes in the base pair composition of the tract. Substitution of the central base pair in the tract by a GC base pair completely restores normal mobility whereas introduction of a single IC base pair has almost no effect (37Koo H.S. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3745-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. McLaughlin L. Ott J. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8257-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results were paralleled in the base pair-opening kinetics measurements where insertions of base pairs in the tracts known to restore normal mobility and consequently diminish the bending, always led to a decrease of the base pair lifetimes to more “normal” levels, whereas an inserted IC base pair only caused a small reduction in the lifetimes. No energetic or structural explanation has yet been given to the anomalously slow kinetics, although it has been assumed that the structural features that set A-tract DNA apart from general sequence DNA, e.g. high propeller twist and narrow minor groove, in some way also are responsible for the unusual kinetics (33Leroy J.L. Charretier E. Kochoyan M. Gueron M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the base pair-opening kinetics in G-tracts, contrary to what has been observed for A-tracts, is unusually fast in particular with high opening rates (39Dornberger U. Leijon M. Fritzsche H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6957-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One of many distinctive features of A- and G-tract DNA (39Dornberger U. Leijon M. Fritzsche H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6957-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) is C5-methylation, which is present on the thymine base but normally absent on the cytosine base and thus makes the major groove of A- and G-tracts methylated and unmethylated, respectively. Although it is known that neither of the U → T or C → 5m-C C5 methylations have a significant effect on the helix structure (40Heinemann U. Hahn M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 225: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we show in the present study that the thymine methyl groups provide the dominant contribution to the high stability of AT base pairs in A-tracts. All oligonucleotides were purified on NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), dissolved in a 3 mm borate buffer (90% H2O and 10% D2O) adjusted to pH 8.8 and containing 100 mm NaCl. The duplex concentrations were in the range of 0.2–2 mm. Base catalyst titrations of the duplexes were carried out at 15 °C with a 6.3 m ammonia buffer adjusted to pH 8.8. The pH value of the buffer was measured with a double-junction high-salt Orion 8103 Ross electrode, and the [acid]/[base] fractions of the buffer were obtained from the amounts of salt and liquid base used to prepare the buffer. The thymidine and deoxyuridine mononucleosides were dissolved in a 10 mm phthalate buffer to a concentration of 10 mm. The samples were adjusted to pH 4.0 in the NMR tube with an Orion 9826 Micro-pH electrode with the NMR tube immersed in a thermostatically controlled water bath maintained at 15 °C before exchange measurements were carried out by titration of a 0.4m NH4Cl solution to the mononucleosides. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was used to calculate the base fraction of the catalyst at each pH value using a pKa value of 9.56 for ammonia at 15 °C (50Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. Chapman & Hall, London1979: 62Google Scholar). The connection between base pair opening and imino proton exchange is based on the assumption that exchange of the imino proton only occurs when the hydrogen bond to the acceptor of the complementary base in the base pair is shifted to some other proton acceptor present in the solvent, i.e. the base pair has opened (51Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Several exchange pathways are possible. Direct exchange to water or exchange catalyzed by the complementary base always occurs, although rather inefficiently due to the low pKa of theses acceptors. By addition of a catalyst with higher pKa values, e.g.ammonia, near opening-limited exchange can be reached. For a base pair with multiple open states, formed with rates kopn and closed with rates kcln, and provided that ∑nkopn≪kc11,kc12,…,kc1mEquation 1 the total imino proton exchange rate k exequals the sum of the exchange rate from each mode (36Wärmländer S. Sen A. Leijon M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (as shown in Equation 2) kex=∑n=1mkopn×ktri[B]kc1n/αn+ktri[B]Equation 2 where ktri is the imino proton exchange rate of the mononucleoside per mole of added base ktri=kexi/[B]Equation 3 and αn is a parameter taking into account the different accessibility of the imino proton in the open states and in the mononucleoside. For a base pair with a single opening mode (n = 1) and with k op ≪k cl, Equation 2 can be rewritten as Equation4 τex=τop+1Kdαktri[B]Equation 4 where τex and τop are the inverse exchange and opening rates, respectively, and K d =k op/k cl is the base pair dissociation constant. If Equation 4 is valid, a plot of τex versus 1/[B] yields a straight line where τop is obtained from the y-axis intercept and α K d is obtained from the slope. Imino proton resonance assignments of the duplexes were obtained from NOESY1 experiments, run with a mixing time of 250 ms at 15 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. A jump-return observe pulse was used to avoid excitation of the solvent resonance (52Plateau P. Guéron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Linear prediction was employed in the indirect dimension to increase resolution. All two-dimensional data processing were carried out with Felix97 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The NMR experiments on the duplexes and the mononucleosides were carried out on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer. The imino proton exchange times τex, at different catalyst concentrations, were obtained from measurements of the inversion recovery times in presence (Trec) and in absence (Taac) of exchange catalyst according to Equation5. 1τex=1Trec−1TaacEquation 5 Apart from longitudinal dipolar relaxation, direct exchange to water as well as exchange catalyzed by OH− ions and the acceptor nitrogen of the opposite base (53Guéron M. Kochoyan M. Leroy J.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) contribute to the recovery rate of the imino protons in the absence of added catalyst (1/Taac). However, these contributions remain constant when the catalyst is added and will be canceled in Equation 5. Consequently, the exchange time τex represents exchange onlyvia the added catalyst. The inversion recovery experiment utilized a 1–1.4-ms iBURP pulse for selective inversion (54Geen H. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 93: 93-141Google Scholar) and a 0.7–1-ms Gaussian observe pulse for selective detection (55Bauer C. Freeman R. Frenkiel T. Keeler J. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 442-457Google Scholar). Right shift and linear prediction of the free induction decay were employed to correct for magnetization evolution during the observe pulse. For the mononucleosides, exchange times were also obtained from the line widths of the imino proton resonances in presence (νcat) and in absence (νaac) of exchange catalyst according to Equation 6. τex=1π·(νcat−νaac)Equation 6 Line widths were measured in spectra acquired with a jump-return observe pulse (52Plateau P. Guéron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Before the base pair stacking calculations were carried out the geometries of the isolated base pairs, with the sugar-phosphate backbone replaced by hydrogens, were optimized utilizing the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation with the 6–31(d,p) basis set of atomic orbitals. The centers of mass of both base pairs in a base pair step were overlaid (implying no slide and shift), and a helical twist of 36 ° was introduced by a counterrotation of the base pairs around an axis passing through their center of mass (56Sponer J. Gabb H.A. Leszczynski J. Hobza P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 76-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 57Sponer J. Florian J. Ng H.L. Sponer J.E. Spackova N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4893-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When calculating the stacking energy of a base pair step the propeller twist was introduced as a counterrotation of the bases around the C-8(pur)–C-6(pyr) base pair axes in the same way for both base pairs of the step. The vertical separation between consecutive base pairs was optimized for each value of propeller twist. Note that optimization of vertical distance between base pairs is critically important to obtain a correct energy profile (58Sponer J. Kypr J. J. Biomol. Struct.

Base stacking energies were calculated using a standard empirical force field of the form (Equation 7) EST(kcal/mol)=−∑AijRij6+∑BijRij12+332∑QiQjRijEquation 7 where Rij are inter-atomic distances, Qiand Qj are atom-centered point charges, and Aijand Bij are constants of the van der Waals term taken from the Cornell et al. force field (60Cornell W.D.

The atomic charges were derived by fitting to the molecular electrostatic potential around the bases obtained using the second-order Moeller Plesset (MP2) perturbational method with the extended aug-cc-pVDZ basis set of atomic orbitals. The quality of the force field was tested against reference ab initio quantum-chemical calculations carried out at the MP2 level with diffuse-polarized 6–31G*(0.25) basis set of atomic orbitals and with correction for the basis set superposition error (56Sponer J.

We carried out 12 base pair step stacking ab initiocalculations and about 20 adenine-thymine and thymine-thymine dimer stacking calculations. The empirical potential and ab initiocalculations presented here are based on our extensive experience with base stacking calculations, and more details about the techniques and their accuracy can be found in the preceding studies (56Sponer J.

Based on these calculations, the van der Waals parameters of the force field were modified by reducing the van der Waals radius of the methyl group hydrogen atoms from 1.487 to 1.087 Å. Let us briefly justify this modification. The modification is due to a clear discrepancy between the original parameterization and the reference ab initio calculations leading to steric clashes, in common B-DNA geometries, between the methyl group and the adenine ring in the ApT steps. When relaxing the vertical separation of the base pairs, the unmodified force field shows substantially earlier onset of the methyl-adenine repulsion, compared with the MP2/6–31G*(0.25) data. It should be noted that although the Cornell et al. (60Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) force field has been parameterized with the aid of Hartree-Fock quantum chemical calculations, no base stacking calculations were considered in the parameterization. Our modified parameters provide very close agreement with the reference ab initio data, and for the present special-purpose base stacking calculations such corrected parameters are superior to the original parameterization. It does not mean, however, that we suggest using the new parameters in condensed phase simulations unless their balance with other parameters of the force field is validated. Work is in progress in our laboratory to investigate the effects of the modification on explicit solvent simulations of nucleic acids, and the results together with the quantum chemical calculations will be presented in a forthcoming paper. To utilize the exchange of the imino protons with the water protons to measure base pair-opening kinetics it is necessary to know the exchange expected for the imino proton in the free nucleoside where it is freely exposed to the solvent (see Eq. 2and 4). The exchange rates of the nucleoside imino protons were obtained from resonance broadening measured when increasing amounts of ammonia was added, using Equation 6. The imino proton transfer rates per mole of added base ( ktri) were determined to be 2.1 × 108 s−1 mol−1and 1.7 × 108 s−1 mol−1 at pH 4.0 and 15 °C for deoxyuridine and thymidine, respectively, by fitting the exchange rates to Equation 3 (Fig.1). The latter value is in reasonable agreement with a previous measurement yielding 2.0 × 108 s−1 mol−1 at the same temperature (64Guéron M. Charretier E. Hagerhorst J. Kochoyan M. Leroy J.L. Moraillon A. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure and Methods. Adenine Press, Guilderland, N. Y.1990: 113-137Google Scholar). Experiments carried out at pH 4.5 and 5.0 gave similar results, indicating that the ktri rates are independent of pH values. Measurements at higher pH values are not possible due to the excessive resonance broadening. The imino proton exchange of eight self-complementary oligomers, d(CATCAYGATG)2, d(CATA2Y2ATG)2, d(CGCGA2Y2CGCG)2, and d(CAGA4Y4CTG)2, with the pyrimidine base Y being either T or U were measured, and the base pair-opening dynamics were derived. Because the upstream and downstream halves of self-complementary oligonucleotides are equivalent and because only one base per base pair carries an imino proton (G and T), the base pairs have been numbered from the 5′-end to the center of the oligomers in the following presentation. As an example, the base pairs of d(CATAATTATG)2 are denoted GC1, AT2, AT3, AT4, and AT5, and the corresponding imino protons are denoted G1, T2, T3, T4, and T5. In Table I the symmetry of the self-complementary oligomers has been taken to advantage by listing the base pair lifetimes (τop) to the left and the apparent base pair dissociation constants (αK d) to the right of the center of symmetry that is indicated by avertical line. We have previously found that τex versus 1/[B] plots, which according to Equation 4 should be linear, sometimes display a curvature that can be satisfactorily accounted for by allowing the exchange to take place from two different open states, according to Equation 2 (36Wärmländer S. Sen A. Leijon M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study we observe a clear curvature for T5 and T6 of d(CATA2T2ATG)2 and d(CGCGA2T2CGCG)2, respectively. A weak curvature is also observed for U5 of d(CATA2U2ATG)2. For the purpose of the present work we only discuss the opening mode from which exchange predominately occurs at high catalyst concentration. We have denoted this opening mode as the fast mode because it occurs more frequently but has a lower dissociation constant and therefore will dominate the exchange at the highest exchange catalyst concentrations (for a more complete discussion see Wärmländer et al.) (36Wärmländer S. Sen A. Leijon M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the curvatures of T5 of d(CATA2T2ATG)2 and T6 of d(CGCGA2T2CGCG)2 (cf.Fig. 2, A and B) are very similar and apparently are an intrinsic property of this base pair when present in a short A2T2-tract.Table IKinetic parameters for base pair opening of self-complementary T- and U-tracts at 15 °CτopαK d(×106)msY=T36181-aThe kinetic parameters for the fast mode of a fit to a two-state kinetic model (Equation 2) is given.0.51-aThe kinetic parameters for the fast mode of a fit to a two-state kinetic model (Equation 2) is given.191045′CATAAYYATGY=U244234699Y=T54114191-aThe kinetic parameters for the fast mode of a fit to a two-state kinetic model (Equation 2) is given.0.61-aThe kinetic parameters for the fast mode of a fit to a two-state kinetic model (Equation 2) is given.60.20.75′CGCGAAYYCGCGY=U1163512160.40.5Y=T4.51-bThe resonances of the two imino protons merge in the course of the catalyst titration.101149981-bThe resonances of the two imino protons merge in the course of the catalyst titration.0.31-bThe resonances of the two imino protons merge in the course of the catalyst titration.0.10.41-bThe resonances of the two imino protons merge in the course of the catalyst titration.1.75′CAGAAAAYYYYCTGY=U∼0.061726120.90.81.84.41.5The kinetic data were obtained by fitting to Equation 2 or 4 utilizing the mononucleoside transfer rates obtained from the fits in Fig. 1.

The ICR shows enhancer blocking activity through CTCF binding to an unmethylated sequence. The unmethylated state of the maternal ICR is maintained throughout development after establishment in the germ line; however, little is known of the molecular mechanisms that regulate DNA methylation. Hence, in this study we show that a dyad Oct-binding sequence (DOS) in the ICR mediates the demethylation of low-density methylation but not hypermethylation and is required to maintain the unmethylated state against the tendency for de novo methylation within the ICR in the embryonic carcinoma cell line P19. Furthermore, we also reveal that the unmethylated state of at least one CTCF-binding site within the ICR is under the control of DOS. Our results suggest that the ICR, as a CTCF-dependent insulator, requires DOS as well as CTCF-binding sites and that DOS maintains the maternal specific unmethylated state of the ICR at postimplantation stages.

Monoallelic expression of both genes depends on differential methylation of an imprinted control region (ICR),1 located 2–4-kb upstream of the H19 gene, that is hypermethylated in the paternal chromosome but unmethylated in the maternal chromosome. Genomic deletions of the ICR result in activation of the normally silent maternal Igf2 and paternal H19genes in liver, gut, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and lung (1Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M.

Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of endodermal enhancers downstream from theH19 gene results in loss of maternal expression ofH19 and paternal Igf2 in liver, gut, and kidney (3Leighton P.A. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Stewart C.L. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the paternal ICR repressesH19 expression and that the maternal ICR represses expression of the distant Igf2 through enhancer blocking activity at least in liver, gut and kidney. In fact, recent reports revealed that a 1.2-kb portion of the methylated ICR in the paternal chromosome functioned as a transcriptional silencer in endodermal tissue (4Drewell R.A. Brenton J.D. Ainscough J.F. Barton S.C. Hilton K.J. Arney K.L. Dandolo L. Surani M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3419-3428PubMed Google Scholar) and that the unmethylated ICR functioned as a CTCF-dependent insulator (1Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M. Park K.Y. Ives E. Hsieh S.

Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of CTCF in mouse fetal liver was observed only on the maternal ICR (7Kanduri C. Pant V. Loukinov D.

These observations suggest that the enhancer blocking activity is repressed on the hypermethylated paternal ICR, which enables association between downstream enhancers and theIgf2 promoter. Thus, the methylation status of the ICR is a crucial factor for monoallelic expression in both genes. The unmethylated state of the maternal ICR is established in the germ line and maintained during development (8Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat.

Previous reports showed that a cis-acting sequence within the ICR directs parent-of-origin-specific methylation in the ICR. Maternal transmission of a chromosome containing a 1.6-kb deletion (dDMD) within the ICR results in moderate methylation of the remnant ICR (16Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, when a 1.2-kb region (dSilencer) that comprises the hypermethylation-dependent silencer within the ICR is deleted, the unmethylated status of the ICR is maintained on the maternal allele (4Drewell R.A. Brenton J.D. Ainscough J.F. Barton S.C. Hilton K.J. Arney K.L. Dandolo L. Surani M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3419-3428PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the unmethylated state of the maternal ICR is actively maintained during development by a cis-acting sequence existing within an 0.75-kb portion (putative differential methylation control region) that is in the dDMD region but not in the dSilencer region (Fig. 1 a). In this study, to address the cis-acting sequence that is involved in the maintenance of the unmethylated state within the ICR, particularly within the dDMD region, we used a transfection assay system in the mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line, P19. Because the P19 line was derived from a teratocarcinoma formed by transplantation of a 7.5-day embryo into the testis and exhibits pluripotency of differentiation into neuroectodermal, endodermal, and mesodermal derivatives (17McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar), we used this line as a model for the epiblasts, early postimplantation embryonic cells that undergo genome-wide de novo methylation (reviewed in Ref. 18Li E. Reik W. Surani A. Genomic Imprinting. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 1-20Google Scholar). Using stable transformants with the H19 upstream region, we revealed that a dyad Oct-binding sequence (DOS) in the putative differential methylation control region is involved in demethylation of low-density methylated DNA and that DOS is required to maintain the unmethylated state in both the CTCF-binding site and CpG sequences widely distributed within the ICR. All constructs were cloned into pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene). Plasmid pEE was cloned from a mouse genomic library constructed from testis DNA and has a 3.8-kb insert flanked by EcoRI sites. Construct pEEd260 was generated by deletion of a 260-bp AvaII fragment from pEE. Construct pEEm1m2 was generated by ligation of DNA fragments derived from pEE and synthetic oligonucleotides that were used for construction of the bm1m2 fragment (described below). Five fragments within the dDMD region were defined as: fragment a, 360-bpHinfI-HinfI; fragment b, 159-bpHinfI-HinfI; fragment c, 213-bpHinfI-NspI; fragment d, 509-bpNspI-AvaI; fragment e, 338-bpAvaI-HindIII. These fragments were excised from pEE and cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(−). The cloned fragments were excised with HindIII andBamHI for further plasmid construction. The mutant series of fragment b was generated by ligation of the mutatedHhaI-HapII fragment, generated by initialized synthetic oligonucleotides, and the flanking fragments on either side. The resulting plasmids, bm1, bm2, and bm1m2, have mutations only at site 1 (m1 in Fig. 3 a), only at site 2 (m2), and at both sites, respectively. Human DOS fragments, hD1 and hD1m, were generated by annealing of synthetic oligonucleotides to form a double-stranded fragment that was cloned. For demethylation assays, five fragments (a–e) from the dDMD region and the mutant series of fragment b were inserted into the blunted HindIII site within the non-CpG island region of H19 (pEdBSl, Fig.1 d, left panel). The H19 fragment was derived from an EcoRI-SalI fragment encompassing the H19 structural gene with a deletion of a 1-kbBamHI fragment. All test constructs were linearized with NaeI and used for transfection or further modification. Test constructs used for demethylation assays were methylated in vitro with the appropriate DNA methylase according to the manufacture's instruction. Constructs pEE and pEEm1m2 were methylated with bacterialHapII methylase (M.HapII) and HhaI methylase (M.HhaI) or SssI methylase (M.SssI) in vitro. In pEE, there are 99 CpG dinucleotides, 8 HhaI sites (GCGC), and 6 HapII sites (CCGG) in the inserted EcoRI fragment derived from theH19 gene (Fig.1 a) and 296 CpG dinucleotides, 32HhaI sites, and 19 HapII sites on the entire plasmid. Construct pEEd260 was methylated with M.HapII and M.HhaI (M.HapII + M.HhaI). Construct pEdBSl and its derivatives were methylated with M.HapII (TaKaRa or New England BioLabs). Methylation reactions were tested with (8–10 unit/μg) HapII and HhaI restriction endonucleases. Plasmids that were methylated completely at the appropriate sites were used for transfection experiments. The mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 was maintained in alpha modification of Eagle's medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 7.5% calf serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin sulfate. P19 cells were co-transfected with test constructs and the selection plasmid pSTneoB, containing the neomycin resistant gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter, at a ratio of 5:1 by the standard calcium phosphate method. Stably transfected clones were selected with 400 μg/ml geneticin. To avoid positional effects, we pooled transfected colonies (30–100 colonies) and analyzed the methylation status on integrated constructs in polyclonal culture samples (19Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed multiple times for confirmation. To assess the methylation levels of transgenes, we used the methylation-sensitive enzymes HapII (TaKaRa, isoschizomer of HpaII and MspI),HhaI (TaKaRa), HaeII (New England BioLabs),AvaI (New England BioLabs), and Bsu15I (Fermentas, isoschizomer of ClaI). Genomic DNA was digested with appropriate enzymes, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and followed by blotting to Nytran-N membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Probes were radiolabeled with the BcaBEST labeling kit (TaKaRa) and hybridized to membrane in 6× SSPE, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C overnight. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al.(20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Fragment site 1, site 1m, site 2, site 2m, and o-wt were generated by annealing the synthetic oligonucleotide sites 1U (5′-ATTGGGGCGTTCAGATGCTAATGATCTCC-3′) and 1L, 5′-CGGAGATCATTAGCATCTGAACGCCCCAA-3′; sites 1mU (5′-ATTGGGGCGTTCAGATGCTCCTGATCTCC-3′) and 1ml (5′-CGGAGATCAGGAGCATCTGAACGCCCCAA-3′); sites 2U (5′-CTTTCGTATTCTAATTGGGGCGTTC-3′) and 2L (5′-TGAACGCCCCAATTAGAATACGAAA-3′); sites 2mU (5′-CTTTCGTATTCTCCTTGGGGCGTTC-3′) and 2ml (5′-TGAACGCCCCAAGGAGAATACGAAA-3′); and o-wt-U (5′-GGGTAATTTGCATTTCTAA-3′) and o-wt-L (5′-TTTAGAAATGCAAATTACC-3′), respectively. Fragment aa contains a 139-bp genomic region flanked byHinfI and HaeIII sites. FII, a core region of the chicken β-globin insulator that binds CTCF, was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides FII top (5′-gggaggcgcGCCCCCAGGGATGTAATTACGTCCCTCCCCCGCTAGGGGGCAGCAGgcgcgcctccc-3′) and FII bottom (5′-gggaggcgcgcCTGCTGCCCCCTAGCGGGGGAGGGACGTAATTACATCCCTGGGGGCgcgcctccc-3′). The lowercase letters signify an additional nongenomic sequence. For EMSA of the CTCF binding site, we used two nonspecific competitor DNAs: Aprt, which contained three Sp1 binding sites in a 91-bp genomic region that was excised from the cloned mouse adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene promoter with EcoO109I andHapII (21Macleod D.

The binding reactions of probe and 2–4 μg of P19 nuclear extract were performed in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 μg of bovine serum albumin (for fragment b, site 1 and site 2 probes) or 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 μg of bovine serum albumin (for the aa probe) at 4 °C for 120 min. Appropriate competitors at 200× excess or 2 μg of antibody were added simultaneously to the reaction mixture. Anti-Oct-family protein antibodies, anti-Oct-1 (sc-232x) and anti-Oct-4 (sc-9081x) antibodies, and anti-CTCF antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Bisulfite modification was performed as described (22Paulin R. Grigg G.W. Davey M.W. Piper A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5009-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The bisulfite-treated DNA was purified using Wizard DNA purification resin (Promega) and used as a template for PCR. The DNA region encompassing one of three CTCF-binding sites on the integrated pEE was amplified by PCR using a transgene-specific primer on the vector 5′-AAGGGGGATGTGTTGTAAGG-3′ (forward) and the nested H19-specific primers, 5′-TAACCTCATAAAACCCATAACT-3′ (reverse, outer) or 5′-AAAACTCAATCAATTACAATCC-3′ (reverse, inner). To determine the ability to maintain the unmethylated state within the ICR, we introduced a 3.8-kb construct (pEE, Fig.1 a) in various states of methylation into the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line P19. pEE consists of a proximal promoter region of H19 and a portion of the ICR that contains the entire dDMD region and three CTCF-binding sites (Fig. 1 a). This transgene, which was fully methylated with M.SssI in vitro, remained in a highly methylated state after many cycles of proliferation (Fig.1 b, lanes 4–6), whereas transfection of unmethylated pEE, or pEE methylated to a low density with M.HapII and M.HhaI, resulted in hypomethylation in the ICR (Fig. 1 b, lanes 7–12). On the other hand, the proximal promoter region of the transgenes, when either methylated at low density or unmethylated, became highly methylated through this proliferation (Fig. 1 c). From our observation that the demethylation activity is able to predominate over low-density methylation within the ICR on transgenes but not over hypermethylation, we speculated that a cis-acting sequence directed demethylation of low-density methylation within the ICR and prevented the accumulation of methylation. To identify the responsible cis-acting sequence, we next assessed the demethylation of five fragments derived from the dDMD region (fragments a–e, as shown in Fig.1 a). Each fragment was inserted into a non-CpG island sequence (Fig. 1 d). The plasmids were methylated in vitro with M. HapII and used for transfection. Only fragment b, located within the putative differential methylation control region, exhibited demethylation of HapII sites around the insert. In contrast, the other four fragments did not show apparent demethylation activity (Fig. 1 d). The demethylation activity of fragment b was confirmed with the deletion mutant pEEd260, where a 260-bp AvaII fragment, comprising fragment b and a 50-bp flanking region on each side, was removed. Deletion of this 260-bp sequence resulted in a loss of demethylation activity in the ICR (Fig. 1 e). These results suggested that the cis-acting element in fragment b was required for demethylation of low-density methylation within the ICR. To identify the core sequence that directs demethylation within the ICR, we searched for nuclear protein binding sites within the sequence of fragment b and found two tandemly repeated octamer motif-like sequences (OLSs), ATGCTAAT (termed site 1) and ATTCTAAT (site 2), with a 12-bp intervening sequence (Figs. 2 and3 a). This dyad structure of OLSs with various lengths of intervening sequences (11–13 bp) was conserved with three copies in the human H19 gene (hD0-hD2) and single copy in the rat H19 gene (Fig. 2). Therefore, we focused on these dyad octamer motif-like sequences (DOLSs) for further investigation. To assess the role of the DOLS in demethylation of the ICR, we introduced mutations into both or one of these OLSs in fragment b (Fig.3 a) and tested the relationship between protein binding to the OLS and demethylation activity of the OLSs. Whether nuclear protein factor(s) in P19 cells could bind to the OLSs was determined by EMSA. Fragment b formed multiple complexes with proteins in P19 nuclear extracts (Fig.3 b, lanes 2 and 3). Fragment b with a single mutation in one OLS (bm1 or bm2) could inhibit formation of the complexes (lanes 4 and 5), but fragment b with a double mutation (bm1m2) could not affect complex formation (lane 6). Therefore, the double mutation abolished formation of multiple complexes; we examined demethylation activity of the fragment b derivatives when inserted into non-CpG island DNA as described in Fig.1 d. As shown in Fig. 3 c, the transgene bearing the double mutation (bm1m2) remained in a highly methylated state, indicating that the demethylation activity exhibited by wild type fragment b was strongly depressed by the double mutation and significantly so by the single mutations (bm1 and bm2). These results revealed that the DOLS is the core sequence directing demethylation and that the dyad structure of binding sites and the binding of nuclear factors were necessary for effective demethylation. To determine whether the OLSs actually bind the Oct-family proteins, we used antibodies against Oct-1 and Oct-4 proteins for EMSA. Fragment o-wt can bind Oct-family proteins (23Schöler H.R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Balling R. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), Oct-1, Oct-4, and Oct-6, which are known to be expressed in P19 cells (24Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Schöler H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both site 1 and site 2 could bind to both the Oct-1 and Oct-4 proteins (Fig.4). Moreover, site 1 and site 2 also formed complexes with several proteins other than Oct-1 and Oct-4, although we could not determine these proteins. Because both sites could actually bind to Oct-family proteins, the mouse dyad octamer motif-like sequence, DOLS, was renamed dyad Oct-binding sequence or DOS. Two human DOLS elements, hD1 and hD2, are located in the repetitive DNA region near the CTCF-binding sites upstream of the H19 gene. hD1 has an additional OLS (OLS0, ATTAACAT), 22 bp upstream from the DOLS (OLS1 and OLS2). We also evaluated the demethylation activity of hD1, in a 74-bp fragment (hD1 in Fig. 3 a) and with mutations in these 3 OLS sites (hD1m in Fig.3 a). Unlike mouse DOS, the hD1 region exhibited weak demethylation activity in two trials (Fig. 3 d, I) and strong activity in one of three experiments (Fig.3 d, II). hD1m showed slight demethylation activity at all trials. We concluded that hD1 has detectable but weak demethylation activity in P19 cells. It is of interest whether the DOS is involved in the demethylation of low-density methylated CpG sequences within the ICR. To address this question, we introduced the Oct-binding sequence mutations into the 3.8-kb pEE construct (Fig. 5 a,pEEm1m2) and performed transfection assays to measure demethylation activity. As expected, the double mutation resulted in a highly methylated state within the ICR, a dramatic reduction of the demethylation activity (Fig. 5 b). These results indicated that the DOS directed demethylation of low-density methylation within the ICR. Furthermore, it is a critical question whether the DOS has the ability to protect against de novo methylation and for maintenance of the unmethylated state of the ICR. To determine whether the DOS exhibited these activities, we introduced unmethylated pEE and pEEm1m2 into P19 cells and repeated six independent experiments. The ICR in pEE bearing wild type DOS underwent slight de novo methylation in all experiments, whereas the double mutation in the DOS resulted in increased de novo methylation at all sites within the ICR (Fig. 5 c). This result indicated that the demethylation activity by the DOS is necessary for long-range maintenance of the unmethylated state within the ICR. Recently, CTCF-binding sites in the ICR have been shown to play an essential role in enhancer blocking activity in an unmethylated state-dependent manner (5Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 6Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M.

Biol. 2000; 10: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DOS can maintain the unmethylated state of a CTCF-binding site within the ICR, we compared the methylation status at a CTCF-binding site and the surrounding region using pEE and pEEm1m2. Because hemi-methylation on the top strand of the binding site, but not on the bottom strand, prevents CTCF binding (6Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), the methylation status of the top strand in the CTCF binding region was examined using the sodium bisulfite sequencing method (Fig. 6 a). Nine CpGs were examined and were methylated at 4.83% on pEE (10 methylated sites/207 sites determined), 38.0% (89/234), and 34.3% (71/207) on pEEm1m2 in pooled colonies from two independent experiments (Fig. 6 b). Finally, there was a possibility that the absence of CTCF in P19 cells could allow de novo methylation of the CTCF-binding site and that binding of CTCF is necessary for maintenance of the unmethylated state in the CTCF binding site. To address this possibility, we confirmed the existence of CTCF protein that could bind to the site examined by sodium bisulfite sequencing (Fig.6 c). These results revealed that the binding of CTCF protein could not maintain the unmethylated state of the recognition site within ICR lacking a functional DOS. These findings suggested that the DOS was necessary to maintain the unmethylated state of the CTCF-binding site and that DOS is an essential cis-acting sequence for the ICR to function as an insulator. We observed demethylation activity that affected low-density methylation but not hypermethylation within the ICR on transgenes in P19 cells (Fig. 1 b). Although we could not determine whether the demethylation activity was active or passive, this activity had features appropriate to an unmethylated state maintenance activity working in vivo. (i) Differential methylation of the ICR is established in the germ line and maintained in somatic cells throughout embryonic development. If demethylation activity affecting the ICR maintains the unmethylated state of the maternal allele during postimplantation development, this hypothetical activity should not affect the hypermethylated paternal ICR. (ii) TwoHapII sites are located 623 and 828 bp upstream of theH19 transcriptional start site and correspond to the sites examined in this experiment. These sites exhibit various methylation patterns on both alleles during early embryonic development in vivo (8Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9Tremblay K.D. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Mol. Cell.

Surani M.A. Development. 1995; 121: 4195-4202PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to the ICR. The hypothetical demethylation activity in vivo cannot maintain the hypomethylated state of the proximal promoter region. These two features were consistent with the observed demethylation activity in P19 cells. We determined that DOS is required for the demethylation activity. Unlike mouse DOS, the hD1 region showed weak demethylation activity except for one experiment (Fig. 3 d). This may be because of the low compatibility of the mouse P19 factors with the human sequence. Another possibility is that each DOLS of the human locus represents the weak demethylation activity in human cells, like in the P19 cells, and synergistically maintains the unmethylated state of seven CTCF-binding sites. Biallelic expression of IGF2 in Wilms tumor and colorectal cancer is associated with methylation of theH19 upstream repeat region on the maternal allele (26Frevel M.A. Sowerby S.J. Petersen G.B.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the role of DOLSs in the methylation is unknown because the DOLSs have not been examined for polymorphism and mutations. Further analysis of these tumors, the demethylation activity of DOLSs on the entire repeat region, and the responsible factors will contribute to understanding the molecular basis of the maternal methylation. Sodium bisulfite sequencing analysis of a CTCF-binding site and the surrounding region revealed that DOS maintains the unmethylated state in a sequence-independent manner (Fig. 6 b). However, as shown in Fig. 5 c, right panel, the de novo methylation frequency was different at three sites that were examined within the ICR: HaeII, AvaI, andBsu15I. This discrepancy may be due to the existence of another weak cis-acting element that demethylates the central region of ICR because we detected a remaining slight demethylation activity within the ICR on pEEm1m2 (Fig. 5 b). Several reports have shown that cis-acting elements with associated protein binding could regulate the unmethylated state of certain DNA regions. The Sp1-binding site (21Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 28Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), the intronic κB enhancer of the Ig-κ locus (19Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the EBNA-1-binding site (29Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) function as cis-acting elements for the maintenance of the unmethylated state within a CpG island, B-cell specific demethylation, and demethylation of the replication origin of the EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) genome, respectively. This paper is the first report we are aware of in which the cis-acting sequence is required for low-density methylation-specific demethylation, because the previously known Sp1, κB enhancer, and EBNA-1 sites could demethylate certain fully methylated DNA regions (29Hsieh C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Silke J. Rother K.I. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Matsuo K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we suggest that both the CpG density surrounding a certain cis-acting sequence and the binding ability of the responsible factor to its methylated binding site could determine whether a certain cis-acting sequence could demethylate the fully methylated surrounding area. Methylation of all CpG nucleotides on pEE completely prevented the ICR from demethylation, although methylation of the HapII and HhaI sites, adjacent to and spanning the DOS, was not sufficient to prevent the demethylation effect of the DOS (Figs. 1 b and5 b). The Oct-binding sequences did not include CpG dinucleotides but were surrounded by five CpG within 100 bp (Figs. 2and 3 a). Therefore, we speculate that hypermethylation-induced histone deacetylation forms a condensed chromatin configuration that abolishes the binding of the responsible protein to the DOS and that brings about repression of demethylation (Fig. 7). A cis-acting sequence is also reported to establish parent-of-origin-specific differential methylation, which directs imprinted expression, at the differentially methylated region 2 of the imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor gene. The 6-bp cis-acting sequence, termed the allele discrimination signal, inhibitsde novo methylation only on the paternal allele and establishes differential methylation in preimplantation embryos (32Birger Y. Shemer R. Perk J. Razin A. Nature. 1999; 397: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have shown that DOS is conserved in mouse, rat, and human, is located within the putative differential methylation control region suggested by in vivo experiments, functions on the low-density methylated but not hypermethylated ICR, is required for maintenance of the unmethylated ICR, and acts through binding of nuclear proteins in EC cells that mimic epiblast cells. These results suggest that the DOS on the mouse maternal allele prevents the ICR from undergoing de novo methylation, to maintain the differentially methylated ICR at least in early postimplantation stages (Fig. 7). However, de novo methylation occurs in the 3′ portion of the H19 gene in the blastocyst (11Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Razin A. Cedar H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Shemer R. Birger Y. Dean W.L. Reik W. Riggs A.D. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although the maternal ICR overcomes de novo methylation activity and remains unmethylated at this stage. Additionally, after demethylation of the paternal allele in female primordial germ cells, the unmethylated state of the ICR is maintained throughout the oocyte growth phase even as genome-wide de novomethylation progresses. Hence, the precise functions of DOS in both developing embryos and growing oocytes should be elucidated. Thus, our hypothesis is that DOS maintain the unmethyated state of the ICR against a de novo methylation wave at several developmental stages. The 1.6-kb deletion in Thorvaldsen's study (16Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) resulted in increased methylation of the remnant ICR on the maternal allele and decreased methylation on the paternal allele, though the methylation status of the maternal and paternal alleles are still different even without DOS. Because the functions of DOS revealed by our experiments cannot explain the loss of hypermethylation maintenance mechanisms, we speculate that these mechanisms exist independently of the unmethylated state maintenance mechanisms governed by DOS. Therefore the 1.6-kb deletion is not sufficient for the complete loss of the hypermethylated state maintenance mechanisms because hypermethylation of a certain DNA region itself can be a cis-acting signal for the preimplantation maintenance of the gametic hypermethylation (33Howell C.Y. Steptoe A.L. Miller M.W. Chaillet J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have also shown that DOS is required for maintenance of the unmethylated state at one of four CTCF-binding sites in the ICR and can maintain the unmethylated state of widely distributed CpGs within the ICR. These findings indicated that DOS directs the unmethylated state of CTCF-binding sites within the ICR and that the ICR, as a CTCF-dependent insulator, requires the unmethylated state maintenance sequence in addition to CTCF-binding sites (Fig. 7). Two other CTCF-dependent insulators, FII and DM1site 1 (34Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G.

Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 28Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), although the actual function of the site is unknown. Here, we suggest that the CTCF-binding site may be necessary but not sufficient for efficient enhancer blocking activity of the CTCF-dependent insulator that functions on the genome undergoing or previously modified by de novomethylation."

https://openalex.org/W1995070983,"Abstract The serine protease domain of activated protein C (APC) contains a Na+ and a Ca2+ site. However, the number and identity of the APC residues that coordinate to Na+ is not precisely known. Further, the functional link between the Na+ and the Ca2+ site is insufficiently defined, and their linkage to the substrate S1 site has not been studied. Here, we systematically investigate the functional significance of these two cation sites and their thermodynamic links to the S1 site. Kinetic data reveal that Na+ binds to the substrate-occupied APC withK d values of ∼24 mm in the absence and ∼6 mm in the presence of Ca2+. Sodium-occupied APC has ∼100-fold increased catalytic efficiency (∼4-fold decrease in K m and ∼25-fold increase in k cat) in hydrolyzing S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) and Ca2+ further increases thisk cat slightly (∼1.2-fold). Ca2+binds to the protease domain of APC with K d values of ∼438 μm in the absence and ∼105 μmin the presence of Na+. Ca2+ binding to the protease domain of APC does not affect K m but increases the k cat ∼10-fold, and Na+ further increases this k cat∼3-fold and decreases the K m value ∼3.7-fold. In agreement with the K m data, sodium-occupied APC has ∼4-fold increased affinity in binding top-aminobenzamidine (S1 probe). Crystallographically, the Ca2+ site in APC is similar to that in trypsin, and the Na+ site is similar to that in factor Xa but not thrombin. Collectively, the Na+ site is thermodynamically linked to the S1 site as well as to the protease domain Ca2+ site, whereas the Ca2+ site is only linked to the Na+site. The significance of these findings is that under physiologic conditions, most of the APC will exist in Na2+-APC-Ca2+ form, which has 110-fold increased proteolytic activity."

It has been shown that residues within the second extracellular loop and the juxtamembrane region are important for ligand binding (14Assil I., Qi, L. Arai M. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study we used the recently characterized oxidation-resistant SVG analog, [Tyr0,Gln1,Leu17]SVG (YQLS), which binds to CRFR1 and CRFR2 with high affinity and which can be cross-linked to CRF receptors with high efficiency (16Assil I. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), to map cross-linked residues. The results showed that Lys16 of SVG and Lys257 of CRFR1 (in the second extracellular loop) are within a molecular distance of 11.4 Å of each other. Unless indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. Na125I was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The peptides, hCRF-(1–41) (CRF), [Tyr0,Gln1]SVG (YQS), and [Tyr0,Gln1,Leu17]SVG (YQLS) were synthesized in the Massachusetts General Hospital Biopolymer Facility. They were HPLC-purified and analyzed by mass spectroscopy, amino-terminal sequencing, and acid hydrolysis. SVG was obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA) and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was purchased from Pierce. Tissue culture media were from the Massachusetts General Hospital Media Facilities (Boston, MA). Centricon 30 centrifugal filters were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The molecular mass markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the murine CRFR1 and various CRFR1 Lys to Arg mutants at 90% confluency using the DEAE-dextran method (15Assil I. Abou-Samra A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 5: E10115-E10121Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in 95% air, 5% CO2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (16Assil I. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Single and multiple Lys to Arg mutations were introduced into CRFR1 cloned in the pcDNA1 plasmid at the following sites: 257, 262, 257 and 262, 110 and 111, and 110, 111, and 113; the resulting mutants were named K257R, K262R, K257R/K262R, K110R/K111R, and K110R/K111R/K113R; respectively. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Nine of the ten c-Myc epitope tag sequences (QKLISEEDL) was introduced within the amino-terminal domain of mCRFR1 between Glu31 and Ser32 (17Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Stably transfected LLCPK-1 cells (90–95% confluent) and transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates (72 h after transfection) were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (17Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at 1:1000 dilution. The cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 2 more hours with 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (200,000 cpm/well) diluted in PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum. The supernatant was removed, and then the cells were washed and lysed with 1 n NaOH. The cell lysates were collected and counted in a Micromedic gamma counter. Binding assays were performed as described previously (16Assil I. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 17Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intact COS-7 cells transiently transfected with mCRFR1 or mCRFR1 mutants were plated into 24-well plates, and a binding assay was performed when cells reached 90–95% confluency. The cells were rinsed with a Tris-based binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). 125I-YQLS (100,000 cpm/well), prepared and purified as previously described (14Assil I., Qi, L. Arai M. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was added in the presence of increasing concentrations of the competing peptide for 2–4 h at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed three times with binding buffer and lysed with 1 n NaOH (0.25 ml, 3×). The cell lysates were collected, and the radioactivity was counted in an automated gamma counter. Cells expressing wild type or mutant receptors were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to reach 90–95% confluency. The cells were then rinsed with PBS.125I-YQLS or 125I-YQS (1,000,000 cpm/well) was added in HEPES binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 2–4 h at room temperature. The buffer was removed, the cells were rinsed with PBS to remove bound tracer, and DSS (0.5 mm) was added to the cells in PBS (pH 8.2) for 20–30 min. The cells were then rinsed with PBS, lysed with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed on a 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and autoradiographed using x-ray film or a phosphorimager screen. COS-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates and were allowed to reach 90–95% confluency. The cells were chilled on ice and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then challenged with YQLS at different concentrations in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthene (IBMX), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 15 min. The medium was then removed, and the cells were rapidly frozen on dry ice. Intracellular cAMP was extracted by thawing the cells in 1 ml of 50 mm HCl, and cAMP was then measured using radioimmunoassay (18Abou-Samra A.B. Harwood J.P. Manganiello V.C. Catt K.J. Aguilera G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the radioactive protein bands were cut, and the proteins were electroeluted in 1× SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm of glycine, and 0.1% SDS). The eluate was concentrated using a Centricon 30 unit (Millipore). CNBr (100 mm) was added to the sample and dissolved in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 24 h. CNBr and formic acid were removed by lyophilization (3×). The proteins were analyzed on a 5–20% gradient SDS gel or on Tricine/SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) according to the method of Scha¨gger and von Jagow (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) and autoradiographed using x-ray film or a phosphorimager screen. 125I-CRF and 125I-YQLS bind to CRFR1 with total specific binding of about 6 and 13%, respectively. As reported previously (16Assil I. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), addition of DSS caused covalent cross-linking of 125I-YQLS to mCRFR1. No cross-linking occurred with 125I-CRF. In contrast,125I-YQLS specifically cross-linked to cells expressing CRFR1 but not to cells transfected with the pcDNA1 plasmid (Fig.1A). The cross-linked receptor was resolved as a broad band of ∼80 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the glycosylated CRFR1 (Fig.1A). Addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled SVG buffer decreased the 125I-YQLS-CRFR1 cross-linked band in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that 125I-YQLS but not 125I-CRF cross-links to CRFR1 efficiently and specifically. Because DSS cross-links free amino groups lying at a molecular distance of 11.4 Å; the efficient cross-linking of 125I-YQLS to mCRFR1 provides an opportunity to determine which lysine residues in the ligand and the receptor are in close proximity to each other. Therefore we mutated the putative extracellular Lys to Arg residues in mCRFR1 and generated the following mutants: K257R, K262R, K257R/K262R, K110R/K111R, and K110R/K111R/K113R. The mutant receptor plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and cell surface expression was determined using a double antibody binding assay to the epitope tag. Expression of K257R, K262R, K257R/K262R, K110R/K111R, and K110R/K111R/K113R was 90.1 ± 0.4, 81.0 ± 1.9, 72.8 ± 0.6, 90.3 ± 0.5, and 82.6 ± 1.4% of that of wild type (Table I). Specific binding of125I-YQLS to K262R was similar to that of CRFR1 (Table I). In contrast, specific binding of 125I-YQLS to K110R/K111R and K110R/K111R/K113R was 245.9 ± 5.3 and 157.0 ± 2.9% of that of CRFR1 (Table I); whereas its specific binding to K257R and K257R/K262R was 56.1 ± 0.5 and 40.6 ± 2.6% of that of CRFR1, respectively (Table I). All mutants exhibited comparable apparent Ki values (Fig.2A and Table I). YQLS increased cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with K110R/K111R, K110R/K111R/K113R, and K262R with an Rmax that was 79.9 ± 17.3, 47.1 ± 1.3, and 54.4 ± 4.2% of that observed in cells transfected with the wild type CRF receptor (Fig.2B and Table I). Additionally, YQLS increased cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with K110R/K111R, K110R/K111R/K113R, and K262R with an EC50 that was similar to that observed in cells transfected with the wild type CRF receptor (Fig. 2Band Table I). In contrast, the EC50 of YQLS in cells transfected with K257R and K257R/K262R was greater than that observed in cells transfected with the wild type CRF receptor (Fig.2B and Table I), and their Rmax was 31.6 ± 4.7 and 45.2 ± 5.8% of the wild type (Fig. 2B and Table I). The binding and the cAMP data suggest that the lysine residue at position 257 is an important residue for SVG interaction.Table IExpression, ligand binding, and cAMP stimulation of CRFR1 mutant receptorsConstructRelative expressionBmaxKiRmaxEC50CRFR1100.0 ± 2.8100.0 ± 0.85.8 ± 1.3100.0 ± 18.40.22 ± 0.14K257R90.1 ± 0.456.1 ± 0.55.1 ± 3.431.6 ± 4.72.51 ± 2.13K262R81.0 ± 1.999.8 ± 0.47.0 ± 1.454.4 ± 4.20.15 ± 0.07K257R/K262R72.8 ± 0.640.6 ± 2.69.1 ± 1.445.2 ± 5.82.47 ± 2.10K110R/K111R90.3 ± 0.5245.9 ± 5.37.8 ± 3.179.9 ± 17.30.63 ± 0.56K110R/K111R/K113R82.6 ± 1.4157.0 ± 2.910.8 ± 5.847.1 ± 1.30.04 ± 0.01M230L85.3 ± 5.2167.4 ± 0.910.1 ± 0.179.9 ± 25.10.06 ± .053Percent of expression, specific binding, and cAMP accumulation levels were normalized to those obtained in the wild type CRFR1.

The data are presented as mean ± S.D. of 2–5 experiments with triplicate wells. Maximal cAMP accumulation is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate wells in one of two similar experiments. The different CRFR1 mutants were then cross-linked to125I-YQLS using DSS; the cells were lysed, and the labeled receptors were analyzed on a gradient SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The cross-linked mutant receptors appeared as diffuse bands that were similar in size to that of the wild type receptor (Fig.1C). Cross-linking efficiency to the mutant receptors was evaluated by loading equal amounts of radioactivity of cell lysates on SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the cross-linked mutated receptors, with the exception of that of K257R, was similar to or more than that of the wild type (Fig. 1C). This indicates that none of the Lys residues at positions 110, 111, 113, and 262 participates in the cross-linking reaction. In contrast, Lys257 in the second extracellular loop (EC2) appears to be an important cross-linking site. To confirm that the EC2 region is involved in the cross-linking reaction, CNBr-cleavage of wild type and mutant receptors was used. CRFR1 contains several methionine residues in its backbone; among them Met230 and Met276 flank the predicted cross-linking site, Lys257. CNBr cleavage is predicted to generate a 46-residue fragment from CRFR1 cross-linked to the 41-residue radioligand, 125I-YQLS. The predicted size of the cross-linked fragment (87 residues) is ∼9 kDa (the CNBr-cleaved fragments are schematically represented in Fig.3C). To resolve the small CNBr-cleaved fragments, equal amounts of radioactivity of the cross-linked receptor were loaded on high resolution Tricine/SDS-PAGE (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). As predicted, CNBr cleavage of 125I-YQLS-cross-linked CRFR1 produced a major ∼ 9-kDa band and a less intense 11-kDa band (Fig. 3A, CRFR1). The intensity of the 11-kDa band was variable from experiment to experiment and represents incomplete CNBr cleavage. The intensity of the ∼ 9-kDa band decreased dramatically in K257R as compared with the wild type (Fig.3A, R257), confirming that Lys257 is an important cross-linking site. Additionally, the ∼9-kDa fragment in K262R had a similar intensity to that of the wild type (Fig.3A, R262), indicating that Lys262 is not an important cross-linking site. However the ∼9-kDa band disappeared completely in K257R/K262R indicating that Lys262 participates in the cross-linking reaction only when Lys257 is mutated (Fig. 3A, R257/R262). These data identify the EC2 region as a cross-linking site. To positively identify the 9-kDa band a M230L mutant was constructed by changing the methionine residue at position 230 to leucine. The M230L mutant had an expression level and specific binding that were 85.3 ± 5.2 and 167.4 ± 0.9% of the wild type values, respectively (Table I). The apparent binding affinity was also similar to that of the wild type receptor (Table I). Additionally, YQLS increased cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with M230L with an EC50that was similar to that observed in cells transfected with the wild type CRF receptor (Table I). M230L was found to cross-link to125I-YQLS efficiently (Fig. 1C). The Leu230 mutation increased the size of the cross-linked CNBr-cleaved fragment from ∼9 to ∼11 kDa. The size of the CNBr fragment in M230L is identical to the less intense ∼11-kDa band seen in the wild type, consistent with an increase in the size of the fragment by 25 residues (CNBr cleavage occurs at Met205instead of Met230; Fig. 3C, M230). To identify the Lys residue within sauvagine that cross-links to the second extracellular domain of CRFR1, 125I-YQS was used as the radioligand. 125I-YQS contains a native methionine residue at position 17 that could be cleaved by CNBr (Fig.3D). The 125I-YQS radioligand is radiolabeled on Tyr0 (at position zero). CNBr cleavage of125I-YQS is predicted to result in a 17-amino acid fragment bearing the 125I label on Tyr0 and containing one lysine residue (Fig. 3D, K16). If Lys16 is cross-linked to CRFR1, a labeled receptor fragment of 63 residues is predicted (17 residues from YQS and 46 residues from CRFR1). In contrast, if cross-linking occurs through the other lysine residues of SVG (Lys22, Lys25, Lys27) then the receptor fragment is not labeled with125I. Analysis of the CNBr-cleaved,125I-YQS-cross-linked CRFR1 with high resolution Tricine-PAGE revealed a labeled band with a size of ∼6 kDa (Fig.3B). This band is smaller than the ∼9-kDa band produced from CRFR1 cross-linked to 125I-YQLS (Fig.3A). The difference in size between the ∼6- and ∼9-kDa bands reflects CNBr cleavage of SVG at Met17; this identifies Lys16, the only Lys residue in the cleaved fragment, as the cross-linking residue. Photoaffinity cross-linking of radiolabeled [Tyr0]ovine CRF to rat CRFR1 was previously reported; however, the cross-linked residues were not characterized (20Ruhmann A. Kopke A.K. Dautzenberg F.M. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 20: 10609-10613Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also reported that the oxidation-resistant sauvagine radioligand,125I-YQLS, which exhibits high affinity binding to the CRF receptors, cross-links efficiently to mCRFR1 through 1 (or more) of the 4 lysine residues of the ligand (positions 16, 22, 25, and 26) to 1 (or more) of the lysine residues of the receptor clustered at the juxtamembrane region (positions 110, 112, and 113) and/or the second extracellular loop (positions 257 and 262) (16Assil I. Shomali M. Abou-Samra A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study indicate that Lys16 of the ligand preferentially cross-links to Lys257 on the EC2 of mCRFR1. When Lys257 is mutated to Arg, the other Lys residue in EC2, Lys262, substitutes for Lys257, indicating that ligand binding to CRFR1 is not rigid and that residue 16 of CRFR1-bound YQS is within 11.4 Å from Lys257 more often than from Lys262 of CRFR1. It is interesting to note that the single mutation of Lys257 to Arg and the double mutation of Lys257and Lys262 to Arg result in mutant receptors with decreased binding activity and decreased cAMP accumulation efficiency. This suggests that Lys257 may be important for ligand-receptor interaction. In contrast, none of the other mutants has a decreased binding activity. The decreased binding of Lys257 is consistent with data from human CRFR1 and CRFR2 hybrids showing important regions for SVG interaction in the EC2 (Asp254) and at the junction of the EC2 with the fifth transmembrane domain (12Liaw C.W.

The nature of bimolecular interactions of polypeptide ligands with their cognate receptors from group B of G-protein-coupled receptors has been recently investigated. Polypeptide ligands, such as CRF and PTH, exhibit strong helical tertiary structures (21Jin L. Briggs S. Chandrasekhar S. Chirgadze N. Clawson D. Schevitz R. Smiley D. Tashjian A. Zhang F. J. Biol.

Important binding determinants, both in the amino terminus as well as the carboxyl terminus of the ligands, have been characterized. In general, cross-linking studies identified residues within the carboxyl terminus of the ligands that lie within close proximity to the amino terminus of their respective receptors and residues within the amino terminus of the ligands that lie within close proximity to the extracellular loops and the transmembrane domains of their respective receptors. However, differences were uncovered in some receptors. For instance, residues 1 and 13 of PTH-(1–34) cross-linked to Met425 in the third extracellular domain and Arg186 in the juxtamembrane region that is amino-terminal to transmembrane 1 of the PTH receptor type 1, respectively (23Bisello A.

Surprisingly, residues 6, 22, and 26 of secretin cross-linked to the most distal part of the amino terminus of the secretin receptor at positions Val4, Leu17, and Leu36, respectively (25Dong M. Wang Y. Miller L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 921: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and residue 23 of PTH cross-linked to a region between residues 23 and 40 of the PTH receptor type 1 (26Mannstadt M.

Our data that show that residue 16 of SVG and residue 257 of CRFR1 are in close proximity to each other indicate that the residues in close proximity in ligand-bound CRFR1 are different from those found in the other members of this family of G-protein-coupled receptors. These results should facilitate modeling of ligand-receptor interaction in CRF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2065681923,"GPI8 is a clan CD, family C13 cysteine protease and the catalytic core of the GPI-protein transamidase complex. InLeishmania mexicana, GPI8 is nonessential, and Δgpi8 mutants lack the GPI-anchored metalloprotease GP63, which is the major surface protein of promastigotes. We have identified the active site histidine and cysteine residues of leishmanial GPI8 and generated Δgpi8 lines expressing modified GPI8 proteins. This has allowed us to study the processing and trafficking of GP63 in wild type and Δgpi8 mutants. We show using pulse-chase labeling that in Δgpi8 non-GPI-anchored GP63 was glycosylated and secreted without further processing from the cell with a t 12 of 120 min. This secretion was prevented by growth of cells in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that glycosylation is necessary for secretion of non-GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, in wild type cells the majority of GP63 was rapidly glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and trafficked to the surface with defined processing intermediate forms. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation but did not prevent GPI anchor addition or trafficking. These results show that GPI-anchored and unanchored GP63 are trafficked via different pathways. In addition, the balance between GPI anchor addition and secretion of GP63 in Leishmania can vary depending on the activity of the GPI-protein transamidase, which has implications for the host-parasite interaction.

We show using pulse-chase labeling that in Δgpi8 non-GPI-anchored GP63 was glycosylated and secreted without further processing from the cell with a t 12 of 120 min. This secretion was prevented by growth of cells in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that glycosylation is necessary for secretion of non-GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, in wild type cells the majority of GP63 was rapidly glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and trafficked to the surface with defined processing intermediate forms. Tunicamycin inhibited glycosylation but did not prevent GPI anchor addition or trafficking. These results show that GPI-anchored and unanchored GP63 are trafficked via different pathways. In addition, the balance between GPI anchor addition and secretion of GP63 in Leishmania can vary depending on the activity of the GPI-protein transamidase, which has implications for the host-parasite interaction. glycosylphosphatidylinositol concanavalin A endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C wild type Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that is the causative agent of a variety of human diseases collectively known as the leishmaniases. The parasite lives within the gut of the sandfly vector as motile proliferative procyclic promastigotes and in the mouth parts as motile nonproliferative metacyclic promastigotes. Within a mammalian host, the parasite lives as a nonmotile amastigote form that proliferates within macrophages. The surface of the promastigote is thought to contribute to survival within the sandfly and also invasion of and initial survival within a mammal (1Handman E. Adv. Parasitol. 2000; 44: 1-39Google Scholar). The surface is covered with a protective coat known as the glycocalyx, which is predominantly made up of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored1 proteins, lipophosphoglycan, and glycoinositolphospholipids (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson M.A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A characteristic of Leishmania and other related trypanosomatids is the great abundance of GPI-anchored molecules on the cell surface, which is in contrast to higher eukaryotes in which the majority of surface proteins are attached via a transmembrane domain. The major surface protein of Leishmania promastigotes is the 63-kDa GPI-anchored protein known as GP63. It is present at about 5 × 105 molecules/parasite (4Bouvier J. Etges R. Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15504-15509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GP63 is present on the amastigote at a greatly reduced level (5Frommel T.O. Button L.L. Fujikura Y. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Medina-Acosta E. Karess R.E. Schwartz H. Russell D.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GP63 is a zinc metalloprotease active in a neutral to alkaline pH range (pH 7–10) and is site-specific in its proteolytic activity (7Bouvier J. Bordier C. Vogel H. Reichelt R. Etges R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Ip H.S. Orn A. Russell D.G. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is synthesized as an inactive precursor, which is activated via a cysteine switch mechanism (9Macdonald M.H. Morrison C.J. McMaster W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Latency is maintained by obstruction of the active site by the pro-region of the protein, with disruption of this complex resulting in an active enzyme. The precise mechanism and timing of this activation is not known, but it is not thought to be autocatalytic (9Macdonald M.H. Morrison C.J. McMaster W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The nascent protein has an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-signaling sequence at the N terminus and adjacent to the regulatory pro-region. A GPI anchor addition site and a hydrophobic tail are present at the C terminus. These three domains are cleaved during the trafficking and processing of the protein. The addition of a complete GPI anchor to a precursor protein occurs in the ER lumen by the simultaneous cleavage of the protein at the GPI anchor attachment site (near the C terminus) and addition of the GPI anchor in a transamidation reaction (10Sharma D.K. Hilley J.D. Bangs J.D. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Menon A.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GPI anchor is attached to the protein by amide linkage between the terminal ethanolamine phosphate group of the anchor and the nascent C-terminal carboxyl group of the protein (11Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The cleavage and anchor addition occur in one reaction catalyzed by a GPI-protein transamidase complex (12Maxwell S.E. Ramalingam S. Gerber L.D. Brink L. Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 250: 536-547Google Scholar, 13Ramalingam S. Maxwell S.E. Medof M.E. Chen R. Gerber L.D. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The complex has been well characterized in mammalian cells and yeast and contains at least four components; GAA1, GPI8, PIG-S (GPI16), and PIG-T (GPI17) (14Yu J.L. Nagarajan S. Knez J.J.

Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that GPI8 in mammalian cells associates directly with the protein to be anchored (20Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GPI8 is thought to be the catalytic subunit of the GPI-protein transamidase complex and belongs to family C13 of the clan CD cysteine proteases (22Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are characterized as having a cysteine nucleophile with a catalytic dyad in the order histidine, cysteine (22Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GPI-protein transamidase complex of trypanosomatids has not been characterized fully, although a cell-free assay for GPI anchoring in trypanosomes has been used to establish a reaction mechanism for GPI anchor addition (23Sharma D.K. Vidugiriene J. Bangs J.D. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16479-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Leishmania mexicana GPI8, unlike the mammalian and yeast homologues, has no transmembrane domain and appears to be a soluble homologue of the yeast and mammalian enzymes (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A L. mexicana mutant lacking GPI8 (Δgpi8) was deficient of GPI-anchored proteins, including GP63, yet remained viable in culture and was capable of infecting macrophages and also a mammalian host (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The production of this L. mexicana Δgpi8 line provided an opportunity to study the effect that GPI anchor deficiency has on the processing and trafficking of a GPI protein. Secretory transport in trypanosomatids is thought to follow the general pathway found in higher eukaryotes (25Clayton C. Häusler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26McConville M.J. Mullin K.A. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 122-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although endocytosis and exocytosis to the cell surface occurs via the flagellar pocket (27Weise F. Stierhof Y.D. Kühn C. Wiese M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4587-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 28Overath P. Stierhof Y.D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we have defined the active site residues of L. mexicana GPI8 and demonstrated that GPI8 interacts with other proteins to carry out the transamidation reaction. The trafficking of GP63 in wild type and Δgpi8 cell lines was compared, and the role that the GPI anchor plays in the forward transport of GPI-anchored proteins was examined. L. mexicana wild type (MNYC/BZ/M379) and Δgpi8 promastigotes were maintained in culture at 25 °C in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Neomycin (G418; Invitrogen) was added at 25 μg ml−1 typically and up to 500 μg ml−1 as required. Where necessary tunicamycin (Sigma) was added at 5 μg ml−1. Transfection of promastigotes with an episome was as described previously (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on plasmid pGL269 (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer sequences for each of the four sets of mutations were as follows (mutated nucleotides are in bold): H63A, OL330, 5′-CTCTTCTACCGCGCCACCGCCAATGCGC-3′, and OL331, 5′-GCGCATTGGCGGTGGCGCGGTAGT-3′; C94G, OL332, 5′-GACAGCTTCGCCGGCGACCCGCG-AAATG-3′, and OL333, 5′-CATTTCGCGGGTCGCCGGCGAAGCTGTC-3′; H174A, OL334, 5′-CTACGTCGCGGGGGCCGGCGCCAAGTC-3′, and OL335, 5′-GACTTGGCGCCGGCCCCCGCGACGTAG-3′; C216G, OL336, 5′-CCTGGCAGATACAGGCCATGCGATTGCG-3′, and OL337, 5′-CGCAATCGCATGGCCTGTATCT-GCCAGG-3′. pGL449 (H63A), pGL450 (C94G), pGL451 (H174A), and pGL403 (C216G) were sequenced to confirm that the correct mutation had been introduced. L. mexicana promastigotes were grown to mid-log phase and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and 6 × 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of labeling medium (1× minimum essential medium (ICN), 2 mml-glutamine, 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum), and 100 μCi of Expre35S35S ([35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix; NEN). The cells were grown at 25 °C for 6 h and washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets and medium fractions were stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. For pulse-chase labeling experiments, 3.6 × 107 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of labeling medium containing 100 μCi of Expre35S35S/time point. The cells were labeled for 12 min at 25 °C, washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in an equivalent volume of modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 25 °C. 100-μl aliquots of cells were removed at appropriate time points, and the cells and medium were stored at −80 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 200 μg ml−1, Pefabloc SC, 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin A, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenanthroline). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with GPI8 antibody as described previously (10Sharma D.K. Hilley J.D. Bangs J.D. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Menon A.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1× solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) to 1 ml and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to preclear. 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (resuspended to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in solubilization buffer) with 6 μl of αGPI8 were added to the supernatant, and the samples were mixed at 4 °C for 12 h. The samples were then washed three times in TEN-D (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) and once in TEN buffer (TEN-D buffer in the absence of detergent). 25 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation of GP63 antibody L3.8 was used (6Medina-Acosta E. Karess R.E. Schwartz H. Russell D.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 1 ml of IDB buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 190 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and precleared. The medium samples had an equivalent volume of 2× IDB buffer added and were then made up to 1 ml with 1× IDB, 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (resuspended to 0.5 mg ml−1 in IDB), and 10 μl of L3.8 antibody were added to the samples and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C, and the beads subsequently washed three times in GP63 wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and once in TEN. 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the samples prior to further analysis. Triton X-114 fractionation was performed following the method of Bordier (29Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 200 μl of Triton X-114 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% precondensed Triton X-114) on ice for 15 min and precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was overlaid onto a sucrose cushion (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 6% w/v sucrose, 0.06% precondensed Triton X-114) in a fresh Eppendorf tube. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature, and the upper aqueous layer was removed to a fresh tube. 0.5% precondensed Triton X-114 was added to this sample and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and then this upper layer was overlaid back on the original sucrose cushion. The sample was incubated at 30 °C for 3 min and centrifuged for 3 min at 300 × g at room temperature. The whole aqueous phase was removed to a fresh tube, leaving a small Triton X-114 pellet containing the membrane fraction. The aqueous phase was treated with 2% precondensed Triton X-114, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, transferred to 30 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged at 300 × g at room temperature for 3 min. The aqueous phase containing the soluble cell fraction was then transferred to a fresh tube, and the soluble and membrane fractions were subjected to further analysis. The cells were grown to stationary phase, the cells were harvested, and the medium was filtered and retained. The cells were lysed in 1× ConA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMnCl2) for 30 min and centrifuged to preclear, and 500 μl of ConA-Sepharose (resuspended to 4 mg ml−1 in ConA binding buffer) and protease inhibitors (200 μg ml−1Pefabloc SC, 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin A, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin) were added. To the medium 1 volume of 2× ConA binding buffer, 500 μl of ConA-Sepharose, and protease inhibitors were added. The samples were mixed for 12 h at 4 °C and washed four times in ConA binding buffer, and glycosylated proteins were eluted with an appropriate volume of elution buffer (1m methyl α-d-mannopyranoside in ConA binding buffer). The cells were pulse-chase labeled, and two samples were collected for each time point, washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and snap frozen. These samples were lysed in 200 μl of Triton X-114 buffer but with the absence of Triton X-114 and the addition of 0.05% Triton X-100, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged to preclear. The samples were then transferred to a fresh tube, 4 μl of PI-PLC (Sigma) was added to one sample from each time point, and all of the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 0.5% precondensed Triton X-114 was added to each sample, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C subsequent to Triton X-114 fractionation as described previously. We demonstrated previously that L. mexicana GPI8 is a member of the C13 family of cysteine endopeptidases and a component of the GPI-protein transamidase of the parasite (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We identified two cysteine (Cys94 and Cys216) and two histidine (His63 and His174) residues of the L. mexicana GPI8 that potentially could comprise the active site catalytic dyad from sequence alignment of yeast and human GPI8 homologues (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test whether these residues are essential for GPI-protein transamidase activity, each of the four residues was mutated individually in GPI8 by site-directed mutagenesis (H63A, C94G, H174A, and C216G). The mutated GPI8 genes, cloned in the shuttle vector pX, were transfected into the L. mexicana GPI8 deletion mutant (Δgpi8) to give lines Δgpi8[pXgpi8 H63A], Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C96G], Δgpi8[pXgpi8 H174A], and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G]. The Δgpi8 line itself is viable in culture and has been shown to be deficient in the major GPI-anchored surface protein of L. mexicana, GP63 (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Re-expression of GPI8 in Δgpi8 (the Δgpi8[pXGPI8] line) restored GPI-anchored GP63 to the cell surface (24Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with an antibody specific to GP63 was used to assess the effect of the GPI8 mutations on the ability of the GPI-protein transamidase complex to add GPI anchors onto GP63 (Fig.1 A). GP63 was present in wild type promastigotes (lane 1) but not detectable in Δgpi8 (lane 2). Re-expression of the native gene restored GP63 (lane 3). In Δgpi8expressing GPI8H174A or GPI8C216G, GP63 was not detected (lanes 6 and 7, respectively), whereas GP63 was present in cell lines expressing GPI8H63A or GPI8C94G (lanes 4 and 5). Immunofluorescence analysis of the different cell lines using an antibody that detects native GP63 showed surface expression of GP63 in Δgpi8[pXgpi8 H63A] and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C96G] but not in Δgpi8[pXgpi8 H174A] or Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G] (data not shown). To confirm that GPI8 was expressed in each of the cell lines transfected with mutated copies of GPI8, metabolic labeling of cells with Expre35S35S and subsequent immunoprecipitation with an antibody raised against recombinantL. mexicana GPI8 (10Sharma D.K. Hilley J.D. Bangs J.D. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Menon A.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was performed (Fig. 1 B). A 42-kDa protein, which is the predicted size of GPI8, was detected in cell lines expressing either GPI8 (lane 2) or one of the four GPI8 mutants (lanes 3–6) but not in Δgpi8(lane 1). These data demonstrate that although each of the four mutated GPI8 proteins is expressed in Δgpi8, only two of the mutated GPI8 proteins, GPI8H63A and GPI8C94G, can form part of a functional GPI-protein transamidase. The other two mutated proteins, GPI8H174A and GPI8C216G, result in inactive complexes. These findings provide convincing evidence that His174 and Cys216 are the catalytic active site dyad of L. mexicana GPI8. In yeast and mammalian cells GPI8 has been shown to form a complex with other proteins to form an active GPI-protein transamidase (20Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Meyer U. Benghezal M. Imhof I. Conzelmann A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the role of GPI8 in L. mexicana, the gene encoding nonfunctional GPI8C216G was expressed from an episome in wild type cells (to give cell line WT[pXgpi8 C216G]). This cell line was compared with wild type promastigotes expressing episomal GPI8 (cell line WT[pXGPI8]). Equal expression of GPI8 was verified in the two cell lines by metabolic labeling with Expre35S35S and subsequent immunoprecipitation with an α-GPI8 antibody (Fig.2 A). The expression of GPI-anchored GP63 was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B). WT cells expressing the functional episomal copy ofGPI8 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5) were found to express GP63 at levels similar to the wild type parasites (lane 1). An increase in the concentration of G418, and hence GPI8 levels, did not alter the levels of GP63 (comparelanes 3–5). However, cells expressing the mutated form ofGPI8 showed decreased levels of GP63 in the cells (comparelanes 1 and 6), and the amount of GP63 decreased as GPI8C216G expression increased (compare lanes 6–8). Overexpression of GPI8 did not appear to affect GP63 surface expression as examined by immunofluorescence, whereas expression of GPI8C216G in wild type cells drastically reduced the amount of GP63 on the cell surface (data not shown). At the highest concentration of antibiotic (500 μg ml−1), surface expression of GP63 was almost undetectable. Thus expression of GPI8C216G in wild type promastigotes produced a pronounced dominant-negative effect, which provides compelling evidence that GPI8 is required for transamidation activity and is likely to be part of a GPI-protein transamidase complex in Leishmania. To determine whether GP63 was being degraded or secreted in the Δgpi8 mutant, WT promastigotes, Δgpi8, and lines containing mutated GPI8 were labeled for 6 h with Expre35S35S and GP63 immunoprecipitated from their respective culture supernatants. With WT parasites (Fig. 3 A,lane 1), a small amount of three isoforms of GP63 were detected (of 63, 64, and 65 kDa, which are therefore designated 63s, 64s, and 65s (for secreted)), with the 63s isoform being the most abundant. In contrast, a large amount of the 65s isoform was detected in the medium in which Δgpi8 cells had been grown (lane 2). This 65s form secreted from Δgpi8cells was subsequently found to be an isoform of GP63 that lacks a GPI anchor. Re-expression of GPI8 in the Δgpi8 null mutant resulted in only small amounts of GP63 being secreted, with isoform sizes comparable with those secreted from WT cells (lane 3). Large quantities of the 65s isoform were detected also in the Δgpi8 cell lines expressing GPI8C216G(lane 7) and GPI8H174A (lane 6), as well as GPI8C94G (lane 5). However, the Δgpi8 cell line expressing GPI8H63A mimicked the situation in wild type cells with little GP63 secreted. Thus a high level of secretion was associated with cells having a nonfunctional GPI-protein transamidase. The presence of GP63 was also analyzed in the cell lysates (Fig.3 B) by immunoprecipitation with the same anti-GP63 antibody. Three isoforms of GP63 were detected in WT cells (of 63, 64, and 65 kDa, which are therefore designated 63c, 64c, and 65c (forcell-associated)), with the 63c isoform being most abundant. In the Δgpi8 cell line, only the 65c isoform was detected (lane 2). The two smaller isoforms of GP63 (63c and 64c) were present in Δgpi8[pXGPI8] lysates (lane 3) at approximately equal levels. Δgpi8cell lines expressing GPI8H174A (lane 6) or GPI8C216G (lane 7) were similar in cell-associated profiles to Δgpi8 with the 65c isoform predominating, whereas the Δgpi8 cell line expressing GPI8H63A (lane 4) was the same as wild type with abundant 63c isoform. The Δgpi8 cell line expressing GPI8C94G (lane 5) gave an intermediate pattern, with all three isoforms of GP63 present. These data confirm that GPI8C216G and GPI8H174A are nonfunctional enzymes, whereas GPI8H63A is fully functional and GPI8C94G is partially functional. Clearly, lack of an active GPI8 affects the processing and trafficking of the GPI-anchored protein GP63 when compared with WT cells. To examine these variations in more detail, wild type promastigotes and Δgpi8 and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G] cells were labeled with Expre35S35S for 12 min and then chased in cold medium for a period up to 300 min. GP63 was immunoprecipitated from the culture medium (Fig.4 A) or cells (Fig.4 B) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Only a very low level of35S-labeled GP63 was secreted from wild type parasites, whereas high levels of secreted GP63 could be detected over a 180-min chase period for both Δgpi8 and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G]. After 300 min, the level of GP63 secretion from WT cells was estimated to be only 13% of that secreted from Δgpi8 cells, with thet 12 for Δgpi8 GP63 secretion estimated to be 120 min (Fig. 4 C). This clearly demonstrates the higher rate of secretion of newly synthesized GP63 in cells with a nonfunctional GPI8. Two forms of GP63 were secreted from wild type cells, a 65s isoform and a 63s isoform (Fig. 4 A,WT, time 180). The processing of GP63 within the cells was also examined by partitioning the cells into soluble and membrane-associated fractions by either extraction with NaCO3 (data not shown) or Triton X-114 (Fig. 4 B). Both methods of fractionation produced similar results. In wild type cells, GP63 partitioned exclusively into the membrane-associated fraction at all time points. At the start of the chase, the major isoform of GP63 was 65c. After 20 min, the majority of 65c had been chased into 64c, and by 40 min 64c was in the process of being chased into 63c. By 180 min all detectable label was in the 63c isoform. In contrast to wild type cells, only the 65c isoform was detected in the Δgpi8 and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G] lines (Fig.4 B). Moreover, most of 65c remained in the soluble phase in Δgpi8 and Δgpi8[pXgpi8 C216G] cells. The timing of GPI anchor addition during the processing of GP63 was examined by determining which forms of GP63 have a GPI anchor. WT promastigotes were labeled with Expre35S35S for 12 min and then chased in cold medium for a period up to 180 min. The samples were taken at 0, 40, and 180 min, and the lysates were treated with or without PI-PLC followed by Triton X-114 fractionation and GP63 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5). At the start of the chase, the major 65c band was present in the membrane-associated fraction (lane 2), but after PI-PLC treatment it was found in the soluble fraction (lane 3), consistent with the GPI anchor having been removed. The samples from time 40 min and time 180 min showed the same pattern for the maturing GP63 following PI-PLC treatment. All forms of GP63 identified were found only in the soluble fraction following treatment. This demonstrates that GP63 GPI addition occurred very rapidly subsequent to translation and translocation to the ER. It should also be noted that a fourth minor isoform of GP63 could occasionally be detected (lanes 6 and7). Glycosylation of GP63 was examined by testing whether the protein bound to concanavalin A, which interacts withN-linked glycans ("
https://openalex.org/W1970135971,"We studied glucose and water passage across wild type (WT) glucose transporter Glut1 and its T310I pathogenic mutant, expressing them in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We found that the T310I mutation produced a 8-fold decrease in glucose transport (zero-trans influx, 13 ± 2% compared with WT), accompanied by a 2.8-fold increase in the osmotic water permeability (Pf 280 ± 40% compared with WT), and no change in the diffusional water permeability (Pd). The dependence of glucose and water transports on the amounts of mutant cRNA injected was identical exponential buildups (k = 19.7 ng), suggesting that they depend similarly on the quaternary structure. TheEa values for Pf were 16 ± 0.4 (WT) and 11 ± 1 kcal mol−1 (T310I). We report for the first time that 10 mm d-glucose andl-glucose inhibit Pf by ∼45% in the WT but not in the T310I mutant. In addition, 10 mm maltose reduces Pf (15–20%) in both cases. However, 5 mm l-glucose increased thePf of T310I, consistent with a cooperative effect. These experimental observations and an analysis of our three-dimensional model strongly suggest the presence of two channels per Glut1 monomer, one of which can be blocked by the mutation T310I.

Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar) and facilitate the transport of several monosaccharides. Among them, Glut1 is probably the one most extensively studied partly because of its relative abundance within the erythrocyte cell membrane. An extensive kinetic analysis of Glut1-mediated transport in human erythrocytes is consistent with a simple alternating conformational model for facilitative transport (2Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), although alternate mechanistic models have been proposed previously (3Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3898-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the transport of substrates would be accompanied by desolvation-solvation cycles that would store and then recover the associated energies as Glut1 conformation changes (5Widdas W.F. Baker G.F. Cytobios. 1991; 66: 179-204PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon hydropathy analysis of the primary sequence, a 12-transmembrane-spanning α-helical model for the structure of the Glut1 protein was first proposed by Mueckler et al. (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). They also recognized that several helices were amphipathic and therefore capable of forming a water-accessible pore. This idea received experimental support from demonstrations of moderate water permeability through Gluts (7Fischbarg J. Kuang K.Y. Vera J.C. Arant S. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A later analysis led to the hypothesis that perhaps five transmembrane helices can form a channel that is able to admit hexoses but too small for disaccharides (9Zeng H. Parthasarathy R. Rampal A.L.

A water-filled transport channel is highlighted in a recent review (11Barrett M.P. Walmsley A.R. Gould G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in which it is asked of MF proteins: “has nature hijacked a common structure for an aqueous pore?” An exploration of the hypothesis of a water-filled pore in Glut1 led to a series of experimental papers (12Hruz P.W.

This information was used in suggesting for Glut1 a scheme for helical packing (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F.

Additional models have been proposed for Gluts. Based on the similarity with an ion channel and general hints from aquaporin 1, Dwyer (18Dwyer D.S. Proteins. 2001; 42: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has described a three-dimensional spatial arrangement for Glut3, and we have recently modeled a three-dimensional structure of Glut1 (19Zuniga F.A.

Additional information on Glut1 structure can be deduced from Glut1 pathogenic mutations found in patients with the Glut1 deficiency syndrome discovered by Dr. D. C. De Vivo and colleagues (20De Vivo D.C. Trifiletti R.R. Jacobson R.I. Ronen G.M. Behmand R.A. Harik S.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 21Wang D.

In this disease, a Glut1 deficiency disrupts the glucose transport through the blood-brain barrier, which in turn can cause serious clinical complications. The presence of the mutated Glut1 results in reduced cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentrations (hypoglycorrhachia) and reduced erythrocyte glucose transporter activities in the patients (20De Vivo D.C.

The genetic abnormalities include hemizygosity, splice site mutations, deletions, insertions, and nonsense and missense mutations, as well as genetic transmission as the autosomal dominant trait (20De Vivo D.C.

In one of the missense mutants, a polar amino acid threonine at position 310 is replaced by a non-polar one, isoleucine (24Klepper J. Wang D. Fischbarg J. Vera J.C. Jarjour I.T. O'Driscoll K.R. De Vivo D.C. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which has also a larger side chain. The residue Thr-310 in helix 8 is conserved in Glut1 through Glut5 and also across species (26Bell G.I. Kayano T. Buse J.B. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Lin D. Fukumoto H. Seino S. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), suggesting that Thr-310 may play an important role for glucose permeation. In this paper, we concentrate on the functional and structural changes that the mutation induces. The effects of mutations of Glut1 on its Pf have not been reported in the literature. We find that in the mutant T310I glucose transport activity is decreased, and paradoxically, Pf is increased. We also report that in the C-less mutant the Pf is essentially unchanged. In addition, we find that d-glucose competes for water passage in the wild type but not the T310I mutant. Analyzing the data and our Glut1 structure, we offer an interpretation of these effects based on the existence of two channels per monomer. A 1913-bp Eco47III and HindIII hGLUT1 cDNA fragment derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was subcloned into a custom plasmid (pM) containing fragments of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin cDNA. This newly constructed plasmid was named pM-GLUT1 and was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing with the appropriate primers. The mutation T310I was introduced by PCR. Mutagenic primers were: 5′-AGGGCGCAATTGCGGTACCCAGCTTGCTG-3′ (forward 1); 5′-CCTGTGTATGCCATCATTGGCTCAGGTATCGTCAACACGGCC-3′ (forward 2); 5′-GAAGGGCCGTGTTGACGATACCTGAGCCAATGATGGCATACAC-AGG-3′ (reverse 1); and 5′-GCCTGCAACGGCAATGGCAGCTGGACGTGG-3′ (reverse 2). PCR was conducted on the pM-GLUT1 plasmid DNA using the above primers for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 C for 30s, annealing at 58 C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 C for 2 min. The right-sized PCR fragment was purified from the gel and cut with StuI and MunI. The gel-purified StuI and MunI fragment was then directionally ligated into the StuI and MunI sites of pM-GLUT1. The presence of the mutation T310I was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Capped, the runoff cRNA transcripts of both the wild type and the mutant T310I GLUT1 were synthesized from the pM-GLUT1 constructs after linearization at a unique NotI site using the mMESSAGE mMACHINETMkit and T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). The C-less mutant construct we used where all of the six cysteines existing in the wild type were mutated (133, 207, 347, and 429 into serines and 201 and 421 into glycines (27Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) was a gift from Dr. M. Mueckler. This plasmid was linearized at the XbaI site, and the cRNA was synthesized using the SP6 RNA polymerase. Oocytes were prepared as described previously (28Vera J.C. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Oocytes were removed from the ovaries ofX. laevis (NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI) and were defolliculated and separated (29Echevarria M. Kuang K. Iserovich P., Li, J. Preston G.M. Agre P. Fischbarg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1349-C1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The largest undamaged oocytes (stages V and VI) were transferred to Barth's medium ((in mm) 88 NaCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 1 KCl, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 10 Hepes; osmolarity: 178 mosm, pH 7.4). The oocytes were manually microinjected with 50 nl of either water or water plus cRNA (1 μg/μl) and were incubated at 18 °C for 3 days. Purified oocyte membranes were prepared according to the procedure of Garcia et al. (30Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After disruption of oocytes with a Pipetman, the oocyte ghosts were washed free of yolk as described previously (30Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ghosts were treated with 50 μl/oocyte ice-cold homogenization buffer ((in mm) 83 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 5 EDTA, 5 EGTA, 0.5 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 g/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.8) in a glass homogenizer. The total cell homogenate was centrifuged three times at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C in a microcentrifuge to pellet the yolk granules and melanosomes. The final supernatant was loaded in 4 ml of 15% sucrose and was spun at 165,000 × g for 80 min to generate the total membrane fraction. The membrane pellet was suspended in homogenate buffer at 5 μl/oocyte and stored at −80 °C. Ten μg of purified plasma membrane samples from oocytes injected with wild type, T310I, and H2O were fractionated in 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using Glut1-specific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as previously described (31Seidner G. Alvarez M.G. Yeh J.I. O'Driscoll K.R. Klepper J. Stump T.S. Wang D. Spinner N.B. Birnbaum M.J. De Vivo D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Glut1-specific signals were visualized and quantified by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reactions and then transformed into digital values using a scanner and SigmaScan Pro software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Groups of six oocytes were placed into 0.6 ml of Barth's solution containing 10 μCi of [3H]DOG (5 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 2 mm unlabeled DOG in the wells of a 24-well plate. After incubation for 10 min, the oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold Barth's solution containing 0.2 mm phloretin. Individual oocytes were then placed into vials, and 0.2 ml of 0.2 n NaOH plus 0.2% SDS was added. After the oocytes were dissolved, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was placed into each vial for counting. The results were expressed in picomoles of DOG uptake/10 min/oocyte. To measure oocyte volumes as a function of time, we used the method we first outlined in 1990 (7Fischbarg J. Kuang K.Y. Vera J.C. Arant S. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3244-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The oocytes were placed in a 0.3-ml glass-bottom chamber containing Barth's medium at room temperature. The temperature of the perfusing liquid could be set to a range of 5–37 C. The temperature setting was considered the working temperature given the low thermal capacity of the plastic chamber. The oocyte was loosely attached to the chamber bottom using a small amount of Cell-Tak® glue (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA (29Echevarria M. Kuang K. Iserovich P., Li, J. Preston G.M. Agre P. Fischbarg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1349-C1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The oocyte equatorial cross-section was viewed with a NikonTM inverted microscope equipped with a ×4 objective and a video camera (model NC-65, Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN). A computer with frame grabber digitized the oocyte image and calculated the oocyte area and volume every 6 s. For Pfmeasurements, the oocytes were superfused with isotonic Barth's solution (178 mosm) for a period of 60 s and then with hypotonic solution (15 mosm, obtained by omitting NaCl) for another 100 s. The Pf values were calculated from the induced change in oocyte volume as shown in Equation 1 Pf=(dV/dt)·[1/(A·Vw·ΔC)](Eq. 1) where A is the area (assumed spherical) of the oocyte, dV/dt is the rate of volume change, ΔC is the osmolarity gradient (all three at zero time), and Vw is the water molar volume (29Echevarria M. Kuang K. Iserovich P., Li, J. Preston G.M. Agre P. Fischbarg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1349-C1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We calculated Pd from the changes in oocyte volume resulting from H2O-D2O exchange. Initially, the oocytes were equilibrated for 10 min in Barth's solution prepared with D2O or “heavy” water (Sigma) as a solvent (heavy water-based Barth's solution). After such incubation, the bathing solution was replaced by Barth's solution for which the solvent was H2O (water-based Barth's solution). In response, the oocytes swelled because of the 10% faster self-diffusion coefficient for H2O compared with D2O. In other words, under these conditions, H2O diffuses into the oocyte faster than D2O can leave it. Fig. 3 shows a family of curves obtained from such experiments. To determine oocyte membrane diffusional permeability to H2O (Pd), we note that the extent of the cell volume change observed and the intracellular H2O concentration are linearly related (32Kitching J.P. J.E. Exp. Biol. 1959; 37: 73-82Google Scholar). Therefore, monitoring the oocyte volume transient yields information on the oocyte membrane diffusional exchange of D2O for H2O governed in turn by the oocyte membrane Pd. In mathematical terms, because the oocyte volume is much smaller than that of the external solution, the intracellular concentration of water (Ci) at time t during the D2O for H2O exchange can be taken as Equation 2(8Zhang R.

If the initial oocyte volume and surface area are Vo and A from Equation 1, the diffusional permeability Pd is as follows in Equation 3Pd=Vo/(τ·A)(Eq. 3) We found the values of Vo and A as described above, and τ was obtained by fitting the oocyte volume changes during H2O-D2O substitution (Fig. 3) to an exponential buildup curve (Equation 2) using Origin™ software. A sizable advantage of our method is that, if desired, it allows one to obtain the values for bothPd and Pf in the same experiment. This yields an accurate determination of thePf/Pd measurements, because both can be obtained from the same oocyte. An oocyte was incubated in heavy water-based Barth's solution for ∼5 min and then was transferred to the chamber described above, which also contained heavy water-based Barth's solution. The oocyte was challenged first with isotonic water-based Barth's solution to determine thePd and after that with hypotonic (15 mosm) water-based Barth's solution to determine thePf. Typical curves are shown in Fig. 3. For molecular modeling, we used a Silicon Graphics octane work station with InsightII software (Accelrys, Inc.) as described previously (19Zuniga F.A. Shi G.

To explore the cavities in Glut1, we had previously used the program HOLE (36Smart O.S. Goodfellow J.M. Wallace B.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2455-2460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 37Smart O.S. Neduvelil J.G. Wang X. Wallace B.A. Sansom M.S. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (376): 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), developed to explore the pore of ion channels. For the current purpose, as the internal structure of Glut1 appeared more complex than anticipated, we decided to use a combination of several algorithms, among them the program Swiss Pdb viewer (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9588) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously (22Klepper J. Fischbarg J. Vera J.C. Wang D. De Vivo D.C. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 46: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that glucose uptake by erythrocytes is only 35% of normal in a Glut1 deficiency syndrome patient affected with the T310I mutation in one of the alleles. However, work with erythrocytes does not allow one to quantify precisely the function of the mutant. We used instead the X. laevis oocytes expression system. Fig.1 shows the results of zero-trans DOG influx by oocytes expressing one of the proteins above. The unlabeled DOG concentration in the medium was 2 mm. As can be seen, the T310I mutant transports DOG at a rate of only ∼13 ± 2% of that of wild type Glut1. As mentioned below, the expression of the proteins referenced was assessed with the control experiments shown in Fig. 2.FIG. 2Western blot analysis of the expression of wild type and T310I mutant Glut1 in X. laevisoocytes membranes. Groups of three oocytes were incubated for 3 days after injection of 50 ng of cRNA or water (as a control). Positive controls were purified Glut1 and red blood cell membranes. The expression rate for the T310I mutant was 85% that of wild type (WT) and was used for normalization for all T310I data.RBC, red blood cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also utilized the C-less Glut1 mutant. In accordance with the data from Mueckler and Makepeace (27Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the uptake of DOG by the C-less Glut1 mutant (Fig. 1) was 80 ± 9% of that by wild-type Glut1. The uptake of DOG by water-injected oocytes was <1% than in oocytes expressing wild type Glut1. Fig. 1 shows the Pf values determined for oocytes expressing the proteins described. Interestingly, thePf for the pathogenic T310I mutant was approximately three times (280 ± 40%) larger than that for the wild type (after subtraction of the background Pf for water-injected oocytes). As for the C-less, the Pfdetermined (Fig. 1) was 69 ± 13% of that of the wild type (also after the subtraction of the background Pf for water-injected oocytes). Clearly this mutant, even if all six of the original cysteines in wild type Glut1 have been replaced, can transport glucose and water at rates near those obtained with the wild type (Fig.3). Fig. 4 shows the Pfand Pd data we obtained. The Pfvalues we determined here are comparable with those we reported earlier (39Loike J.D. Cao L. Kuang K. Vera J.C. Silverstein S.C. Fischbarg J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for the Pf of oocytes injected with GLUT1 cRNA (28 ± 2 here versus 23 ± 5 μm s−1) and water (control: 15.8 ± 1 hereversus 13 ± 1 μm s−1). As forPd values in oocytes, from what we know this is the first such report. We found that in contrast to the increase seen inPf for the T310I mutant (Fig. 4B), thePd for this mutant was quite similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 4B). Consequently, thePf/Pd ratio (Fig.4C) was approximately three times higher for the T310I mutant than for Glut1. The significance of these findings is considered under “Discussion.” ThePf/Pd ratio for water-injected oocytes presumably means that endogenous transporters or channels contribute to water passage. There is in fact evidence for the presence of some endogenous membrane proteins in oocytes (28Vera J.C. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). From our data, they could have some water permeability. We also determined the expression rate of the wild type and mutant Glut1 in oocyte membranes using Western blot analysis with Glut1-specific antibodies. We found that the expressions of wild type Glut1 and T310I mutant in X. laevis oocytes are very close (Fig. 2); the calculated expression ratio was used to normalize the Pf, Pd, and glucose uptake data obtained with oocytes injected with T310I mutant RNA. It has also been reported that the C-less expression by oocytes is comparable with that of the wild type (40Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously (28Vera J.C. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that in oocytes expressing wild type Glut1, the rate of DOG uptake characteristically depends on the amount of cRNA injected. The dependence of Pf on the amount of Glut1 cRNA injected has been also demonstrated (8Zhang R. Alper S.L. Thorens B. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our present case, the relatively high Pf of the mutant appeared useful for us to try to determine the dependencies of glucose transport and water permeability on the amount of T310I cRNA injected. Fig. 5A shows that they change in concert as the amount of the cRNA injected increases and that their dependence can be approximated to a single exponential buildupy = y0 + A [1 − exp(x/xc)]. In Fig. 5B, the values were normalized by subtracting y0 and dividing by the asymptotic maximal A for each set. The exponential constant xc was 19.7 ng. After normalization, the same Fig. 5B shows that DOG uptake and Pfdata practically overlap with each other, displaying the same exponential buildup dependence. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of the Pf for the T310I mutant. The data were fit to the standard expression:Pf = A exp(−ΔE/RT), where ΔE is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T = 310 K. The activation energies for water transport through the wild type and the T310I mutant were 17.0 ± 2.0 and 13.0 ± 0.5 kcal mol−1, respectively. Fig.7, A and B, shows the effects of external saccharides on the osmotic water flow across membranes of oocytes expressing either wild type Glut1 or the T310I mutant. The compounds used were (a) the normal substrate of Gluts, d-glucose, (b) the non-transported enantiomer, l-glucose, and (c) a disaccharide that inhibits glucose transport, maltose.

https://openalex.org/W1981569438,"Insulin is a potent negative regulator of the response of hepatic cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly, interleukin (IL)-6. The action of insulin is target-selective because it inhibits transcription of most but not all acute phase genes. We here show that ceruloplasmin (Cp), an acute phase reactant with important functions in iron homeostasis, is subject to a unique dual regulation by insulin. IL-6 increased Cp mRNA expression in HepG2 cells by ∼5-fold. Simultaneous treatment with insulin reduced this stimulation by half. Surprisingly, insulin by itself caused a 2–4-fold induction in Cp mRNA expression. The mechanism of induction by insulin was studied by transfecting into HepG2 cells chimeric constructs of the Cp 5′-flanking region driving luciferase. The activity of a 4800-bp segment of the Cp 5′-flanking region was increased 3-fold by insulin. Deletion and mutation analyses showed the requirement for a single hypoxia-responsive element in a 96-bp segment ∼3600 bp upstream of the initiation site. The domains required for the two activities of insulin were distinct: The distal, hypoxia-responsive element-containing site was sufficient for Cp transactivation by insulin; in contrast, an 848-bp region adjacent to the initiation site was sufficient for IL-6 transactivation of Cp and for the inhibitory activity of insulin. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in the induction of Cp by insulin was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and by the absence of insulin-stimulated Cp promoter activation in mouse Hepa c4 cells deficient in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity. Taken together these results show that insulin functions as a bidirectional, condition-dependent regulator of hepatic cell Cp expression. The unique regulation of Cp may reflect its dual roles in inflammation and iron homeostasis."

However, under normal physiological conditions blood is fluid, and yet a clot can form locally at the site of vascular injury. Fluidity of blood is maintained by the anti-thrombotic nature of the vascular endothelium, and thrombus formation is mediated in part by the activation of platelets. Contrary to the anticoagulant paradigm of endothelial function, it has been reported that quiescent endothelial cells can bind coagulation factor XI (FXI)1 and promote its activation and expression of its enzymatic activity in vitro(1Berrettini M.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present study examines the role of both human platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in the binding and activation of FXI, which participates in the initiation of the intrinsic or consolidation pathway of blood coagulation. FXI is a 160-kDa homodimeric protein found in plasma at a concentration of ∼30 nm complexed with high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (3Bouma B.N. Dodds W.J. van Mourik J.A. Sixma J.J. Webster W.P.

A. 1979; 76: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FXIIa, thrombin, and FXIa have been shown to activate FXI to FXIa in the presence of an artificial negatively charged surface (3Bouma B.N. Dodds W.J. van Mourik J.A. Sixma J.J. Webster W.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 296: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,5Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Two potentially physiologically relevant cellular surfaces that might promote blood coagulation within the vasculature are the platelet and the endothelial cell. FXI binds to activated platelets with high affinity (K D = 10 nm, Bmax = 1,500 sites/platelet) in the presence of HK (45 nm) and zinc ions (25 μm) (7Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or in the presence of prothrombin (1 μm) and calcium ions (2 mm) (8Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but this only occurs after the platelet has been pretreated with an agonist such as thrombin (7Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Activated platelets also promote the activation of platelet-bound FXI by thrombin, FXIIa, and FXIa with thrombin demonstrated to be the preferred activator (9Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Walsh P.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the platelet exists in the blood stream in a dormant form that exposes a surface for assembly of coagulation complexes only after appropriate stimulation. The negative charge associated with the endothelium comes in the form of constitutively expressed heparan sulfate and chondroitan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (11Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, the endothelium is constantly exposing a negative charge to plasma, yet coagulation does not ubiquitously occur. This anti-thrombotic property of the endothelium has been attributed to the potentiation of inhibitors of plasma serine proteases by glycosaminoglycans (12Marcum J.A. McKenney J.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It has been reported that FXI binds to HUVEC with a high affinity (K D = 4.5–6.9 nm, Bmax = 2.7–13 × 106 sites/cell) requiring HK and zinc ions (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HUVEC-bound FXI was activated to FXIa by FXIIa, and HUVEC-bound FXIa was able to generate FIXa (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that an otherwise phenotypically anticoagulant cell type is capable of generating procoagulant activity. We have examined the binding of FXI to endothelial cells and have found a discrepancy between the experimental results reported previously and our data. Using several assays with various controls, and under several assay conditions, we have shown that FXI does not associate with HUVEC but does bind specifically to high affinity receptors on activated platelets. Although we were able to reproduce the experimental results previously published (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we have shown that they represent an artifact of the binding assay utilized (13Schmaier A.H. Silver L. Adams A.L.

Our studies of endothelial cell and platelet interactions with FXI suggest that the activated platelet, not the endothelium, is the preferred surface for FXI binding and consequent activation by thrombin. FXI was purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). HK and thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The thrombin receptor activation peptide (SFLLRN-amide) and an HK-derived peptide comprising a portion of the FXI binding site referred to as the 31-mer HK peptide (SDDDWIPMDIQTDPNGLSFNPISDFAPDTTSPK) were synthesized at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania (Dr. John Lambris, Director). FXI was radiolabeled with 125I using the iodogen method (16Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼100 μg of protein was incubated with 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min in an iodogen-coated vial and centrifuged through a 1-cc Sephadex G-50 packed spin column at 200 × g for 5 min to separate125I-bound protein from free 125I. Radiolabeled protein (1 μl) was added to 99 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hepes-buffered saline and 100 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. This was vortexed and incubated in an ice bath for 5 min. The solution was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and half of the supernatant was removed and placed in a separate vial. Both vials, 100 μl of the supernatant (S) and 100 μl of the pellet (P), were measured for γ-emission in a Wallace Wizard 1470 automatic gamma counter. The following equations were used to determine percent radioactivity bound (Equation 1) and specific radioactivity (Equation2; SRA). %bound=(P)/(P+S)×100Equation 1 SRA=(P+S)/(mol protein added)=cpm/molEquation 2 Generally >98% radioactivity was bound to FXI, and the specific activity was 0.6–1.4 × 1018 cpm/mol. Each of the following components (50 μl) was mixed and incubated at 37 °C in an Amelung KC 4A microcoagulometer: FXI-deficient plasma, extracted phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine phospholipid vesicles (0.1 mg/ml), kaolin (5 mg/ml), 0.15 m NaCl, and125I-FXI. After 5 min, 50 μl of 40 mmCaCl2 was added, and the clotting time was measured. A plot of FXI concentration versus clotting time was compared with a standard curve generated from normal pooled plasma or from non-labeled FXI from the same lot number. Radiolabeled FXI retained >90% of the activity of non-labeled FXI, or 213–248 units/mg. The substrate PyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2366, Chromogenix, Môlndal, Sweden) was used to determine FXIa activity. The rate of cleavage of S-2366 (250 μm) by a 1:320 dilution of 125I-FXI was determined by the absorbance at 405 nm and compared with a standard curve generated by non-labeled FXIa. Contaminating enzyme in the zymogen preparations was removed by incubation with a benzamidine-coated agarose (Sigma) slurry for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis for the disappearance of the 30- and 50-kDa enzyme bands. No detectable (less than 0.1%) FXIa contaminated the radiolabeled zymogen preparation. HUVEC or HEK293 cells were grown to confluence in fibronectin-coated, silicone-treated microtiter wells. Plasmas (1:100 final dilution, George King Biomedical, Overland Park, KS) were added to these cell-containing wells or to empty silicone-treated wells. Platelets (1 × 107 cells) were added to some of these empty wells. Protease nexin 2 (PNII) (10 nm, gift from Dr. William van Nostrand, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY), corn trypsin inhibitor (100 nm, Hematological Technologies, Essex Junction, VT), hirudin (10 units/ml, Sigma), or Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (100 nm, Bachem, San Carlos, CA) was added to the reaction in some cases. The chromogenic substrate, S-2366 (250 μm), and calcium ions (4 mm) were added to the reaction, and A 405 was measured continuously for 1 h. HUVEC were isolated from fresh umbilical cords using techniques described elsewhere (17Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cotran R.S. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 60: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were seeded into dishes coated with 1% gelatin and grown to confluence in EGM-2 complete medium (2% fetal bovine serum, BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed after 24 h and then on alternate days until the cells reached confluence. Cells were passaged and were no longer used after the fifth passage. HEK293 and CHO cells were cultured similarly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HUVEC or HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were added to 5 ml (1.5 × 105 beads) of swelled Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads (Amersham Biosciences) that were washed in complete endothelial cell medium. After 30 min at room temperature the beads and cells were transferred to a spinner flask (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) and incubated under constant stirring (60 rpm) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Microcarrier bead cultures (0.5 ml) were mixed with 0.5 ml of trypan blue (Invitrogen) to determine the level of confluence because the microcarrier beads but not the cell-coated beads retained trypan blue staining. Platelets were prepared as described (18Walsh P.N. Mills D.C. White J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 36: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were obtained from platelet-rich plasma after centrifugation of whole blood collected into acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged through a BSA gradient and gel-filtered through a 50-ml Sepharose 2B column. Platelet eluates were counted electronically using a particle counter (Coulter Electronics, LOC, Hialeah, FL) and then washed once in 10 mm Hepes containing 5 mm EDTA and three times in 10 mm Hepes buffer without EDTA. Activation of platelets was measured by shape change, aggregation, and release of ADP using a Lumi-Aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). The amount of von Willebrand's factor (vWF) released by HUVEC after stimulation, a marker of endothelial cell activation, was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a goat anti-human vWF IgG primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human vWF IgG secondary antibody performed according the to manufacturer's instructions (Enzyme Research Laboratories). The absorbance at 490 nm was measured, and vWF concentrations were calculated by comparison to a standard curve determined in the presence of diluted normal pooled human plasma (George King Biomedical), where 100% plasma contains 10 ng/ml vWF. Binding studies were performed as described previously (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that HUVEC or CHO cells were grown to >90% confluence in 98-well fibronectin-coated plates instead of 48-well plates.125I-FXI in incubation buffer was added to cells at varying concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments 100 nm HK, 1 μm prothrombin, or 8 μm 31-mer HK peptide was added. In other experiments, 1% gelatin, 1% non-fat dry milk, 1% polyethylene glycol, or 1% Irish cream was substituted for BSA. Also fibronectin-coated 96-well plates were substituted with 96-well non-coated Primeria plates (BD PharMingen) or fibronectin-coated filter bottom plates in which the filter of individual wells could be removed and measured for radioactivity. To eliminate the effect of FXI binding to an artificial surface, HUVEC were placed into suspension non-enzymatically or cultured in suspension on microcarrier beads, and binding was measured using a procedure similar to that described previously for platelets (19Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HUVEC were grown to confluence on non-coated plates and detached using 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells (106) were triturated, washed, placed in a 15-ml conical flask, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 ×g, and resuspended in 5 ml of incubation buffer. In other cases, HUVEC or HEK293 cells grown to confluence on microcarrier beads were washed and resuspended in incubation buffer to a density of 106 cells/ml. Silicone oil (15 μl, DC500:DC200, 4:1) was centrifuged to the bottom of a 200-μl microcentrifuge tube with a narrow bore tip (Sarstedt, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The cell suspension (washed platelets, HUVEC or HEK293 cells) or microcarrier bead suspension (HUVEC or HEK293 cells) was added to the radiolabeled protein mixture (50 μl, each) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking by hand every 15 min. To separate the bound from the free protein, tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min in a vertical centrifuge (Model B, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Cedar Grove, NJ). The tubes were placed in a dry ice/ethanol slurry for 5 min, and the tips of the microtubes were amputated. Both the pellets (cell-bound proteins) and 10 μl of the supernatant (free protein) were measured for γ-emission. In order to determine the affinity and stoichiometry of FXI binding to the HUVEC surface, cells were grown to confluence in microtiter wells, washed, and then incubated with125I-labeled FXI for 1 h at 37 °C under the conditions reported previously (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted in the presence of zinc ions (100 μm) and in the presence or absence of HK (100 nm, Fig.1). In the absence of HK no evidence of saturable binding was detected at a concentration as high as 100 nm added FXI, i.e. ∼3× the physiological concentration. The small amount of detectable binding was not displaceable by an excess of non-labeled FXI. Non-saturable binding also occurred in the absence of cells. In the presence of HK, saturable binding was achieved by 100 nm added 125I-FXI both in the presence and absence of HUVEC (Fig. 1). The calculated K D values are 2.6 ± 0.7 and 12.1 ± 4.4 nm in the absence and presence of HUVEC, respectively. The calculated number of binding sites was 1.8 × 1010 ± 0.1 molecules/well in the absence of cells and 1.3 × 1010 ± 0.2 molecules/well (or 1.3 × 106 molecules/cell) in the presence of cells. The difference in the number of binding sites (27.8%) is equivalent to the surface area of the microtiter well base (28.3 mm2) that the monolayer of cells occupies, i.e.27.3% of the total surface area (103.7 mm2) covered by the incubation volume added (100 μl). This result suggests that the FXI binding detected was a property of the plastic surface of the microtiter wells and that binding was abrogated by the presence of the cells. Because the vertical sides of the microtiter wells themselves appeared to be playing a significant role in the amount of FXI bound, the number of binding sites detected may be influenced by volume rather than protein concentration. The number of binding sites increased by varying the volume within the range of 50–200 μl in the presence of zinc, 30 nm FXI, and 100 nm HK (Fig.2). A volume-dependent increase in the number of binding sites was detected when HUVEC, CHO cells, or empty wells were incubated with the reaction mixture (Fig. 2) but not in the absence of HK (data not shown). The significant amount of nonspecific background binding determined in the presence of HK may explain both the similarities and the discrepancies between our results and those described previously. To optimize the microtiter well assay, several experimental conditions were examined in order to block the binding of FXI/HK to the microtiter well in the absence of HUVEC. BSA was replaced with gelatin, Irish cream, polyethylene glycol, or non-fat dry milk. None of these blocking agents prevented the binding of FXI/HK to the microtiter wells; in fact BSA appeared to be the best blocking agent (data not shown). Furthermore, the microtiter plates themselves were replaced with Primeria brand microtiter plates, which allow for the growth of endothelial cells without precoating with a matrix protein. Binding of FXI in the presence of HK was still detected when these plates were used, suggesting that matrix coatings were not playing a role. Other cofactors known to mediate the binding of FXI to platelets (8Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were then substituted for HK; however, neither prothrombin nor an HK-derived peptide consisting of the 31-amino acid residue region responsible for the HK/FXI interaction was able to mediate FXI binding to the HUVEC surface in microtiter wells (data not shown). HUVEC were grown to confluence on Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads, and binding assays were conducted on cells in suspension similarly to the platelet binding experiments (20Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8903-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Microcarrier beads allow for a monolayer of anchorage-dependent cells to be manipulated in suspension. HUVEC-coated beads did not release vWF until pretreated with agonists (data not shown). Accordingly, HUVEC-coated beads either untreated or pretreated with thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP) were assayed in suspension (Fig.3 A). Only trace amounts of non-saturable, nonspecific, and non-displaceable FXI binding were observed in either case. Also HEK293 cells were grown to confluence on the beads and used in the suspension assay. No detectable FXI binding to HEK293 cell-coated beads was observed, and the results with HEK293 cells were similar to those with HUVEC grown on beads (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, saturable HK binding was detected to HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads but not to HEK293 cell-coated beads. 2T. R. Baird and P. N. Walsh, unpublished results. A titration with HK in the presence of zinc ions did not promote FXI binding to HUVEC or HEK293 cells at any concentration (data not shown). These results indicate that neither HUVEC nor HEK293 cells immobilized on microcarrier beads participate in FXI binding reactions. Also, HUVEC that had been dissociated from tissue culture dishes non-enzymatically did not support FXI binding in suspension (data not shown). To ensure that our inability to detect FXI binding to HUVEC was a consequence of the absence of specific FXI binding sites on HUVEC and not the result of a deficiency in the binding assay, cell-coated microcarrier beads were replaced with platelets. The binding of125I-FXI to platelets (Fig. 3 B) was specific, saturable, and reversible (K D = 8 nm, Bmax = 1319 sites/platelet), which is similar to previously published work (7Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16327-16333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the ordinate between Fig. 3,A (fmol/105 cells) and B(pmol/108 platelets) should be noted. A critical reaction in the initiation of the intrinsic or consolidation pathway of blood coagulation is the activation of FXI to FXIa. It has been shown that both activated platelets (9Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the HUVEC surface (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) facilitate the activation of FXI in purified systems. To investigate the role of platelets, HUVEC, HEK293 cells, and kaolin in the FXI-dependent initiation of blood coagulation in a plasma-based assay, we utilized the chromogenic substrate S-2366 to detect generation of enzymatic activity in the wells of microtiter plates with normal or coagulation factor-deficient plasma in the absence or presence of various protease inhibitors. This chromogenic substrate, S-2366, is cleaved by FXIa (K m ∼250 μm) and thrombin (K m ∼150 μm) but not by other activated coagulation factors such as FXIIa, kallikrein, FIXa, FXa, or FVIIa. Therefore, the generation of FXIa and thrombin was monitored as the change in absorbance at 405 nm over a period of 1 h, and the results are presented in Fig.4 as mOD/min. Neither incubation with HUVEC (4.2 mOD/min) nor HEK293 cells (3.4 mOD/min) resulted in the generation of significant amounts of amidolytic activity in normal plasma as measured by S-2366 hydrolysis. TRAP-activated platelets (43 mOD/min) but not unactivated platelets (8.2 mOD/min, Fig.4 A, inset) resulted in the generation of amidolytic activity, which was inhibited completely by PNII (3.3 mOD/min, a potent FXIa inhibitor) and partially by hirudin (16.3 mOD/min, a thrombin inhibitor) but not by corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI, 38 mOD/min, a FXIIa inhibitor). Kaolin, a contact pathway activating surface, also supported an increase in the rate of S-2366 hydrolysis (56 mOD/min), which was inhibited by PNII (3.6 mOD/min) and CTI (0.73 mOD/min) but not by hirudin (41 mOD/min). Rates were reduced to <1 mOD/min in the presence of Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone, a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, in all cases. To detect the generation of amidolytic activity caused by the generation of enzymes other than FXIa, clotting factor-deficient plasmas were used in the presence of TRAP-activated platelets (Fig.4 B). Amidolytic activity was reduced from 43 mOD/min in normal plasma (Fig. 4 A) to 15 mOD/min in FXI-deficient plasma (Fig. 4 B) and was completely inhibited by hirudin (3.7 mOD/min). It is possible that this residual platelet-dependent amidolytic activity in FXI-deficient plasma is a consequence of platelet FXI (23Lipscomb M.S. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) because this activity is also inhibited by PNII (Fig. 4 B). FXII- and HK-deficient plasmas showed no reduction in the rate of hydrolysis unless PNII or hirudin were present, consistent with the conclusion that thrombin can hydrolyze S-2366 and preferentially activates FXI on the platelet surface (8Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results of the experiments carried out in HK-deficient plasma, which were similar to those with normal plasma, suggest that the use of microtiter wells is valid in this assay. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that FXI interacts with specific, saturable, high affinity binding sites exposed on TRAP-activated platelets where it is activated by thrombin to initiate the consolidation phase of blood coagulation. FXI does not bind to either resting HUVEC or HUVEC activated with TRAP to release vWF even in the presence of HK and zinc ions when coated on microcarrier beads, contrary to previously published results performed in microtiter wells (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using a microtiter well assay, we were able to reproduce the results published previously (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for FXI binding in the presence of HK and zinc ions, i.e. saturable, specific, reversible high affinity (K D = 12 nm) binding of FXI to microtiter wells containing HUVEC (1.3 × 1010sites/well = 1.3 ± 0.2 × 106 sites/cell). However, we found a higher number of FXI binding sites in the absence of cells (1.8 ± 0.1 × 1010 sites/well) with high affinity binding (K D = 2.4 nm, Fig.1). This suggests that saturable, specific, high affinity binding of FXI observed in the presence of HK is a property of the artificial surface within the microtiter wells. In the absence of HK there was no detectable binding, similar to earlier reports (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recognize that the properties of cellular membranes can be vastly affected by minor manipulations, which can significantly differ between laboratories, thereby limiting comparisons between our results and those established previously. However, the large number of high affinity binding sites reported previously for FXI on the unactivated HUVEC surface (K D = 4.5–6.9 nm, Bmax = 2.7–13 × 106 sites/cell) (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests that the entire pool of plasma FXI should be bound under normal physiological conditions as determined by the following calculations. There are ∼7.23–9.03 × 1016molecules of FXI physiologically present in circulation (30 nm × 4–5 liters × 6.023 × 1023molecules/mol). Since there are ∼1–6 × 1013endothelial cells per adult vascular system (24Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar), there would be 2.7–78 × 1019 high affinity endothelial sites for FXI per adult, i.e. 373–8,637 more receptors than FXI molecules. Thus, FXI always would be associated with the endothelium, and none would be found free in plasma. Furthermore, a single endothelial cell could not accommodate 2.7–13 million molecules of FXI. The surface area of the HUVEC luminal membrane is ∼100 μm2, assuming a flat rectangular shape. If it is assumed that 2.7 × 106 FXI molecules occupy 100% of the cellular surface, 37 nm2 per binding site (100 μm2/2.7 × 106 sites) would be available, each with a radius of 3.4 nm ((37 nm2/π)−2). Thus, the diameter of the widest dimension of FXI when bound to its receptor would be 6.8 nm. The same calculation can be performed assuming 13 million sites/cell, providing a binding contact of 7.7 nm2 with a cylindrical maximum diameter of 3.2 nm. Therefore, the diameter of the FXI molecule interacting with the entire exposed endothelial cell surface would have to be ∼3.2–6.8 nm, assuming 100% occupancy and precluding cellular interaction with any other molecules. According to crystallographic data, the smallest dimension of the FVIIa (50 kDa) unit cell is 10 nm, FXa (58.8 kDa) is 5.5 nm, and FIXa (56 kDa) is 9 nm (25Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M.

Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The size of the FVIIa/tissue factor complex (90 kDa) is 4–5 nm in diameter, and the smallest dimension of the unit cell is 7.11 nm (28Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). These coagulation factors are all globular and elongated with molecular sizes at least three times lower than that of FXI (160 kDa). Therefore, it is unreasonable for a single endothelial cell to bind as many as 13 million molecules of FXI. To eliminate the high level of background binding detected in the presence of HK, we attempted to block the microtiter wells using a variety of potential blocking agents and microtiter plates themselves. The 27% decrease in the number of FXI binding sites detected when HUVEC were present compared with that detected in their absence is nearly identical to the 28% of a 96-well microtiter well surface area, including the sides, that is covered by HUVEC when incubated in 100 μl of buffer. Furthermore, we report about half as many sites per HUVEC as was reported earlier (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using smaller microtiter wells with approximately half the surface area. This strongly suggests that cells abrogate the number of binding sites by coating the base of the microtiter well. To test the hypothesis that the microtiter well surface was the cause of the high background binding, we determined the effect of incubation volume on FXI binding, which was predicted to be volume-dependent because an increase in volume would increase the available surface area of the microtiter well without changing the number of cells. As the volume of the reaction mixture was varied while maintaining the FXI (30 nm) and HK (100 nm) concentrations we found that the number of FXI binding sites detected per well increased in direct proportion to the incubation volume regardless of whether HUVEC, CHO cells, or empty wells were studied. The high number of detected binding sites is related not to the presence of cells but to the artificial surface contained within the microtiter wells, and it is a property of HK (13Schmaier A.H. Silver L. Adams A.L. Fischer G.C. Munoz P.C. Vroman L. Colman R.W. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 51-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,14Vroman L. Adams A.L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1969; 31: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which binds nonspecifically to plastic surfaces. The inability to detect specific binding sites in the microtiter well assay was suggestive but not conclusive proof of the absence of FXI receptors on HUVEC. Therefore, to reexamine the binding of FXI to HUVEC in comparison to platelets, HUVEC were grown to confluence on microcarrier beads and assayed in suspension. This method eliminates interference by artificial surfaces because only radioactive proteins bound to the cellular pellet are measured. Binding studies performed with HUVEC in suspension directly may have induced anoikis, or cell death caused by lack of surface contacts. However, neither quiescent nor TRAP-pretreated HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads bound FXI in the presence or absence of HK. The amount of FXI detected in the pellets of quiescent or activated HUVEC was no different when substituted with HEK293 cell-coated beads. The amount of FXI bound was negligible, in contrast to the 2.7–13 × 106 sites/cell previously reported (1Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When TRAP-activated platelets were used instead of HUVEC, specific and saturable FXI binding was detected in the presence of HK (45 μm) and zinc ions (25 μm). Platelets did not bind FXI in the absence of HK, zinc ions, or TRAP stimulation. The examination of the functional consequences of FXI binding to cellular surfaces supports the conclusion that activated platelets but not endothelial cells participate in the initiation of the consolidation phase of blood coagulation. Our studies were carried out in plasma, providing the advantage of incorporating all blood proteins in one reaction. To elucidate candidate FXI activators and cofactors as well as enzymes that may hydrolyze S-2366, studies were carried out in the presence or absence of various specific inhibitors, coagulation proteins, and cells. As predicted from the binding experiments, neither HUVEC nor HEK293 cells facilitate the activation of FXI. Activated platelets and kaolin support the activation of FXI via separate and distinct mechanisms as shown by the inhibition profile. The ability of hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor, to inhibit the rate of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of activated platelets but not kaolin suggests that thrombin is a major activator of FXI on platelets but not on artificial surfaces. However, the incomplete inhibition of amidolytic activity by hirudin on platelets suggests that FXI activation proceeds via another mechanism, possibly FXIIa. Kaolin supports the activation of FXI through FXIIa as seen by the complete inhibition of amidolytic activity in the presence of CTI but not hirudin. These conclusions are confirmed by the factor-deficient plasma studies. FXII-deficient plasma had no effect on the rate of hydrolysis in the presence of activated platelets, but in the presence of hirudin a condition in which FXIIa and thrombin are absent or inactive resulted in a 9-fold reduction in rate. On the other hand, the rate of hydrolysis on kaolin in FXII-deficient plasma was reduced by 4.5-fold and was reduced 18-fold by the combined absence of FXII and inactivation of thrombin by hirudin. The present studies demonstrate conclusively that activated platelets express saturable and specific high affinity receptors for FXI that are functionally important in promoting the initiation of the consolidation or intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. In contrast, neither resting nor thrombin-activated HUVEC have any capacity to interact specifically with FXI or to promote blood coagulation reactions involved in the initiation of the intrinsic pathway. These observations are consistent with the concept that the primary phenotype of resting endothelium is anticoagulant and non-thrombogenic, whereas the major function of activated (but not resting) platelets is to participate in the initiation of the consolidation pathway of blood coagulation, leading to the local explosive generation of thrombin at sites of vascular injury."

Two other GR transactivation domains are located in the ligand-binding region. The first, τ2, is a small region at the amino-terminal end of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (5Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). It contains sequences that are conserved among the steroid receptors and has been shown to mediate transactivation when fused to a DNA-binding domain (DBD) (5Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 16Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar). It also harbors a nuclear matrix targeting signal and interacts with Hic-5, a protein that associates with the nuclear matrix and also potentiates GR action (17Yang L. Guerrero J. Hong H. DeFranco D.B. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Tang Y. Getzenberg R.H. Vietmeier B.N. Stallcup M.R. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1420-1431PubMed Google Scholar). The other known transactivation domain of the GR, termed AF-2, is a larger region within the COOH terminus of the LBD. In other nuclear receptors it is thought to comprise a surface formed by α-helices 3, 5, 6, and 12 (19, 20). Helix 12, termed the AF-2 AD core, undergoes a conformational change upon binding of ligand that generates a surface for interaction with either corepressors or coactivator proteins, dependent on whether the ligand is an agonist or antagonist (reviewed in Ref. 1Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Coactivators include SRC1, TIF2/GRIP1, CBP/p300, and P/CAF, some of which are histone acetyltransferases (reviewed in Ref. 21Torchia J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Consistent with the fact that it interacts with histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent remodeling complexes, the GR is known to induce modification of chromatin structure. A number of target genes have glucocorticoid-inducible nuclease hypersensitive sites (22Becker P. Renkawitz R. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2015-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best studied of these is the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. The GR has been shown to activate this promoter by two distinct mechanisms, depending on its chromatin structure (25Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). When the promoter is organized into replicating chromatin, either as an episome or integrated into the genome, the GR induces a chromatin remodeling event in the nucleosome regions containing its binding sites (24Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is mechanistically necessary for transcriptional activation because it allows access of previously excluded transcription factors NF1 and Oct1 (25Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 27Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 28Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GR also facilitates the association of the basal transcription machinery with the promoter, which presumably activates transcription (28Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this form of the MMTV promoter is derepressed and then activated through GR action. When the MMTV promoter is introduced into cells as a transiently transfected reporter construct, it adopts a disorganized and accessible chromatin structure to which NF1 and Oct1 bind constitutively rather than in a hormone-dependent fashion (25Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 28Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This template does not undergo remodeling but is activated by GR, probably through increased association of the basal machinery. Once the MMTV template in organized chromatin is remodeled and derepressed, it is unclear whether GR activates it by the same mechanism employed at the transiently transfected MMTV template. One way to approach this question would be to assess the effect of various GR activation domain mutants on the ability of the two templates to be activated. These domains were defined using transiently transfected reporter constructs. It is not known whether these same domains would be necessary for activation of a promoter in repressed chromatin. There is conflicting information on the domains required for chromatin remodeling induced by the GR. Several studies indicate that the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent remodeling complexes are involved in transactivation by GR in mammalian cells (15Wallberg A.E. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Gustafsson J.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 20: 2004-2013Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 30Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8879-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Both in vivo (31Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and in vitro (32Ostlund Farrants A.K. Blomquist P. Kwon H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) studies suggest a role for the SWI/SNF complex in the induction of nuclease hypersensitivity by GR at the MMTV promoter. GR has also been shown to interact physically with the SWI/SNF complex (15Wallberg A.E. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Gustafsson J.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 20: 2004-2013Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Nie Z. Xue Y. Yang D. Zhou S. Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Wang W. Mol. Cell.

Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Recently, Wallberg et al. (15Wallberg A.E. Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Gustafsson J.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 20: 2004-2013Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) showed that activation by GR in yeast was dependent on the presence of Snf6, a member of the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex, SWI/SNF. This dependence was mediated through the τ1 domain, which was shown to interact directly with the yeast SWI/SNF complex in vitroand, when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, activate transcription on in vitro assembled chromatin in a SWI/SNF-dependent manner. However, Muchardt and Yaniv (29Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) showed that expression of the SWI/SNF ATPase, brahma, greatly potentiated GR-mediated promoter activation in a manner dependent on the GR DBD. Further complexity emerged from the studies of DiRenzo et al. (35DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) who showed that the estrogen receptor interacts functionally and physically with this complex in an AF-2-dependent fashion. Thus, multiple receptor domains have been implicated in interactions with the SWI/SNF complex but none of these studies assayed chromatin remodeling directly. In this study we examine the role of each of the activation domains in GR function in vivo. We have taken advantage of a GR mutant, C656G, which binds its ligand with higher affinity than wild type GR (36Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that this receptor is capable of remodeling chromatin and activating transcription from an MMTV promoter in ordered chromatin (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the context of the full-length C656G receptor, mutations were introduced into the previously defined activation domains. These mutations were assayed for their role in transcriptional activation of the transiently transfected and stably replicating MMTV templates as well as in GR-dependent chromatin remodeling at the latter. The results show that the GR uses its domains differently in the transactivation of the MMTV promoter in distinct nucleoprotein environments. In addition, through direct measurement of chromatin remodeling we have determined that the ligand-binding domain plays a critical role in mediating this process. Our findings strongly support the idea that the mechanism by which the GR modulates transcription is not only dependent on the nature of the target promoter but also on its chromatin configuration. The C656G expression vector, pCInH6HA-C656G, was made, as previously described (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), by insertion of C656G cDNA (kindly provided by Stoney Simons) into a pCI-nH6HA vector, such that the full-length receptor was fused with a histidine tag and a hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope at its NH2 terminus. The Δτ1 mutant was created as follows. A SalI site in the multiple cloning sequence was deleted from the C656G expression vector by digestion with XbaI (in the multiple cloning sequence) and EagI (just downstream of the multiple cloning sequence) and subsequent ligation with linker sequences. The resulting vector (C656GΔSalI) was digested with SalI andBsp120I, which cleave the receptor cDNA at sites within or at the COOH-terminal end of the τ1 domain, respectively. The cleaved ends were then ligated with the following complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-TCGACCAGCGTT-3′ and 5′-GGCCAACGCTGG-3′. The resulting product has amino acids 157–317 in the τ1 domain deleted (Δτ1). The AF2dm12 mutant (M770A/E773A) and Δτ1AF2dm12 mutants were created using a ChameleonTM double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primer used to change methionine 770 and glutamic acid 773 of the helix 12 domain of C656G and Δτ1 to alanines was 5′-AATTCCCAGAGGCGTTAGCTGCAATCATCACTAATCAG-3′. The other mutant receptors were generated using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations. The τ1 domain mutant, τ1EFW, was generated by first substituting tryptophan 234 with arginine (W234R) using the primers 5′-CACAAACGAGAGTCCCCGGAGATCAGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCTGATCTCCGGGGACTCTCGTTTGTG-3′. Mutations changing glutamic acid 219 to lysine and phenylalanine 220 to leucine (E219K/F220L) were then introduced into W234R with the primers 5′-GAAGGATTTGAAGTTATCCGCTGGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACCCAGCGGATAACTTCAAATCCTTC-3′. The τ2 domain mutant with a serine 573 to alanine substitution (S573A) was generated using the primers 5′-GCTCTGTTCCAGATGCAGCATGGAGAATTATG-3′ and 5′-CATAATTCTCCATGCTGCATCTGGAACAGAGC-3′. The helix 3 mutant with a lysine 597 to alanine amino acid substitution (K597A) was made using the primers 5′-GCAGTGAAATGGGCAGCGGCGATAC-3′ and 5′-GTATCGCCGCTGCCCATTTCACTGC-3′. Introduction of mutations was confirmed by manual sequencing using a T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell line 1471.1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). This cell line was derived from C127 mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells and contains multiple stably replicating copies of MMTV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusions in the context of bovine papilloma virus sequences, as previously described (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 1471.1 cells express moderate levels of GR. Transfections were carried out by electroporation using a BTX Electro SquarePorator T820 (Genetronics) as described previously (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCMVIL2R (interleukin 2 receptor Tac subunit expression vector) for cell sorting and varying amounts of receptor expression vector DNA (3–12 μg). Cells were also transfected with either 10 μg of pLTRluc (full-length MMTV long terminal repeat driving luciferase) or 10 μg of pMTVbgln (full-length MMTV long terminal repeat driving expression of the rabbit β-globin gene) for transient template assays. After electroporation, cells were plated in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The following day cells were treated with dexamethasone as indicated in the figure legends and sorted with goat anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) coupled with interleukin 2 receptor monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), as previously described (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sorted cells were either used immediately or frozen for later analysis. RNA was isolated as described previously (38Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNA induction was measured by S1 nuclease protection assay, as previously described (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with probes specific for MMTV and β-actin sequences overnight and then digested with S1 nuclease (25 units/10 μg of RNA). Digestion products were separated on 8% denaturing gels that were dried and exposed to phosphorimaging screens. Quantitation was carried out using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cell extracts for luciferase assays were made from transfected, nonsorted cells as previously described (39Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured using a Microlumat LB 96P luminometer (EG&amp;G Berthold). For each sample luciferase activity was normalized to the amount of cellular protein used in the assay. Dose-response curves and EC50 values were generated using GraphPad Prism software. Whole cell extracts were generated as follows. Sorted cells were resuspended in HEGDM (10 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium molybdate) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), after which NaCl was added to a final concentration of 250 mm. After incubation on ice for 20 min, cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Generation of cytosolic extracts was similar except that NaCl addition was omitted and incubation on ice was reduced to 5 min before centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Proteins (20–40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (3% stacking gel, 8% separating gel) and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine buffer with 20% methanol at 400 mA. Immunoblotting was carried out with polyclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Covance) diluted 1:1000. Detection was carried out using the Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate followed by scanning with a Fluorchem 8000 chemiluminescence imager (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Nuclei were isolated from magnetically sorted cells as previously described (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclei containing 75–100 μg of DNA were resupended in 100 μl of nuclei digestion buffer (2.5% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Nuclei were digested with SacI (10 units/μg of DNA) for 15 min at 30 °C or with λ-exonuclease (100 units/ml) and HaeIII (1000 units/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. Digestion was terminated with 5 volumes of nuclei stop buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction, precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA. DNA from nuclei cleaved with SacI was digested to completion with DpnII. Digestion products were detected by linear amplification using Taq polymerase and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide primer (MMTV sequence from +27 to +1 bp) followed by separation on 8% denaturing gels. Dried gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens. Quantitation of the radiolabeled digestion products was carried out using ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). Defining domains of the GR required for activation or repression of endogenous mammalian target promoters has been hampered by the fact that most cultured cell lines that express a known endogenous target gene also express endogenous GR. This makes it difficult to separate effects of transfected mutant receptors from those of the wild type resident receptor. We have circumvented this problem by using the rat GR mutant, C656G, which has higher affinity for ligand than the wild type GR. The receptor has been shown previously to fully activate the MMTV promoter at concentrations of ligand that are too low to induce the endogenous GR in our murine mammary adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of C656G and any activation domain mutants derived from it can be determined in the presence of endogenous GR. Although the C656G contains a point mutation in the LBD, we have shown that it does not affect its ability to induce remodeling or activation of the MMTV promoter in organized chromatin (37Smith C.L. Htun H. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, we introduced mutations into the C656G receptor to disable either the τ1 or AF-2 helix 12 domains, or both. The τ1 domain was originally characterized as a rather large region of the NH2-terminal area of the GR (5Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Later, a smaller core region was defined that was sufficient, when fused to a DBD, to activate transcription (40Dahlman-Wright K. Almlof T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, we deleted most of the τ1 domain to avoid missing any relevant sequences that might be necessary for activation in chromatin. Mutation of the AF-2 domain was more problematic because of the possibility of deleterious effects on ligand binding. We introduced two mutations, M770A and E773A, into the helix 12 region, which had been reported to have varying effects on ligand binding (41Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 42Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Lanz R.B. Rusconi S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2183-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When introducing mutations into the LBD of steroid receptors it was important to assess the effects of the mutation on ligand binding to separate ligand binding defects from actual transcriptional defects. To ensure that our receptors with LBD mutations respond appropriately to ligand, we carried out dose-response experiments to measure their ability to activate a transiently transfected MMTV-luciferase reporter. The EC50 values are shown in TableI. The dose-response curve for the AF2dm12 mutant, shown in Fig. 1 B, is right-shifted relative to that of C656G. Comparison of EC50 values for C656G and the AF2dm12 mutant indicates that the mutant was about half as sensitive to ligand as C656G (Table I). Whereas C656G has reached maximal activation at 1 nm dexamethasone, the AF2dm12 mutant reaches that point at 3 nm dexamethasone. However, the endogenous receptor was partially active at 3 nm so we were limited to using the lower dose of dexamethasone. At 1 nm dexamethasone the AF2dm12 mutant has reached 80–90% of its maximal activity. Thus, small (10–20%) transcriptional defects observed with receptors containing this mutation, as well as others with similar EC50 values, will be interpreted as a ligand binding effect in the experiments to follow. Deletion of the τ1 region alone had no effect on the dose response relative to C656G (data not shown). However, removal of the τ1 domain in the context of the AF2dm12 mutations (Δτ1/AF2dm12 receptor) restored the EC50 to that measured for C656G (Table I).Table IEC 50 values for receptors containing mutations in the ligand binding domainReceptorEC50C656G3.4 × 10−10AF2dm127.3 × 10−10Δτ1/AF2dm123.4 × 10−10K597A4.8 × 10−10S573A4.2 × 10−10AF2dm12/S573A1.2 × 10−9AF2dm12/K597A2.1 × 10−9Δτ1/AF2dm12/S573A1.4 × 10−9Δτ1/AF2dm12/K597A6.0 × 10−10Transfections and dose-response experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data representing two to six experiments for each receptor were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software.

https://openalex.org/W2003967557,"β-d-Glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, also called base J, is an unusually modified DNA base conserved among Kinetoplastida. Base J is found predominantly in repetitive DNA and correlates with epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes. We have previously identified a J-binding protein (JBP) in Trypanosoma, Leishmania, andCrithidia, and we have shown that it is a structure-specific binding protein. Here we examine the molecular interactions that contribute to recognition of the glycosylated base in synthetic DNA substrates using modification interference, modification protection, DNA footprinting, and photocross-linking techniques. We find that the two primary requirements for J-DNA recognition include contacts at base J and a base immediately 5′ of J (J-1). Methylation interference analysis indicates that the requirement of the base at position J-1 is due to a major groove contact independent of the sequence. DNA footprinting of the JBP·J-DNA complex with 1,10-phenanthroline-copper demonstrates that JBP contacts the minor groove at base J. Substitution of the thymine moiety of J with cytosine reduces the affinity for JBP ∼15-fold. These data indicate that the sole sequence dependence for JBP binding may lie in the thymine moiety of base J and that recognition requires only two specific base contacts, base J and J-1, within both the major and minor groove of the J-DNA duplex. β-d-Glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, also called base J, is an unusually modified DNA base conserved among Kinetoplastida. Base J is found predominantly in repetitive DNA and correlates with epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes. We have previously identified a J-binding protein (JBP) in Trypanosoma, Leishmania, andCrithidia, and we have shown that it is a structure-specific binding protein. Here we examine the molecular interactions that contribute to recognition of the glycosylated base in synthetic DNA substrates using modification interference, modification protection, DNA footprinting, and photocross-linking techniques.

Our discovery of a J-binding protein (JBP) in kinetoplastids that specifically bind J-containing DNA indicates that proteins mediate J function (9Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R. Wilm M. de Kort M. van der Marel G. van Boom J. van Leeuwen F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These proteins may then directly or indirectly lead to gene silencing and/or suppression of DNA recombination (6van Leeuwen F. Kieft R. Cross M. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5643-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10van Leeuwen F. Kieft R. Cross M. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasit. 2000; 109: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), both of which are involved in the mechanism of antigenic variation. Understanding how JBP specifically recognizes and binds J-DNA may represent a first step in elucidating the function of J and its mechanism of action. We have recently characterized the binding properties of recombinant JBP from Crithidia using synthetic J-DNA substrates that contained the glycosylated base in various sequences and contexts (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the JBP/J-DNA interaction is not just simple glucose recognition but rather requires the presentation of the glucose moiety within the major groove of a double-stranded DNA helix. The JBP/J-DNA interaction is not competed by free glucose or free base J, and JBP fails to recognize single-stranded J-DNA or a J-DNA/RNA duplex. Furthermore, the minimal J-DNA substrate for JBP recognition represents base J in the center of one helical turn of double-stranded DNA. These findings, as well as the relative sequence independence of JBP/J-DNA interaction in contrast to a 4-fold higher affinity of JBP for telomeric repetitive DNA, suggested that JBP may represent a structure-dependent binding protein. To examine how JBP specifically recognizes and binds the unique modified base in DNA, we analyzed the site-specific interactions of JBP with base and sugar moieties in duplex J-DNA using modification interference-protection, DNA footprinting, and photocross-linking techniques. We report that JBP makes only two critical base contacts with J-DNA as follows: with base J itself and with the base immediately 5′ (position J-1) on the same strand. The requirement for the base at position J-1 is due to a sequence independent contact in the major groove. Footprint analysis indicates that JBP also contacts the minor groove at base J, and additional analysis suggests that this contact may be sequence-specific. That JBP recognition includes both major and minor groove interactions may allow some indication of a potential J-DNA binding motif and help explain the effect of DNA structure on the affinity for JBP. T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. J-containing DNA oligos were synthesized as described previously (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 5-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-2′-deoxycytidine-containing DNA oligo was performed using a similar procedure as described for J (12de Kort M. Synthesis of Biologically Active Glycosylated NucleosidesPh.D. thesis. University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands2000Google Scholar). Standard non-modified oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Bromodeoxyuridine and bromodeoxycytidine-modified oligos were purchased from Oligos Etc. Oligos were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified by exclusion chromatography. Labeled oligos used in the modification-protection assays were gel-purified on a 20% sequencing gel. For double-stranded DNA substrates, the labeled oligo was annealed to its non-labeled complementary strand by heating in a 3-fold excess of the complementary strand for 5 min at 95 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The oligos were verified by native gel analysis to be double-stranded. The DNA strand corresponding to the base J-containing strand will be referred to as the J-strand and the complementary strand as the A-strand. Crithidia fasciculata JBP was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified by metal affinity chromatography as described previously (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The standard binding reaction (20 μl) contained 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 4 μg of α-casein and the indicated amounts of protein and radiolabeled DNA substrates. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1) using 0.5× TBE at 150 V for 60 min at room temperature. After drying, the gels were exposed to film and to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitation. Distamycin A (100 mm) was prepared in distilled water and stored at −20 °C. Chromomycin A3 (100 mm) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. The K d = [protein][DNA]/[protein-DNA] was measured as the concentration of JBP at which half of the maximal target J-DNA was bound as described previously (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This method was adapted from Ording et al. (13Ording E. Kvavik W. Bostad A. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). End-labeled DNA was resuspended in 15 μl of H2O in a microcentrifuge tube. Partial depurination was obtained by adding 1.5 μl of piperidine formate, pH 2, and incubating at 25 °C for 15 min. Partial depyrimidation was obtained by adding 20 μl of hydrazine and incubating for 25 min at 25 °C. Both reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of stop solution (0.3 M NaAc, 0.5 mm EDTA). After two ethanol precipitations, the pellet was washed with 95% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8). The reaction times and reagent concentrations here are approximate and were adjusted depending on the length or base composition of the oligonucleotide. The modified oligo was then annealed to the complementary strand (present at 2–3-fold molar excess) and used as a substrate in the JBP binding reaction, as described above. The reaction conditions were such that ∼80% of the input DNA was bound by the enzyme. Binding was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 25 °C, after which time the different samples were loaded onto the 6% native gel. After autoradiography of the wet gel, bound and free DNA were excised, eluted in TE buffer, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dried. Further purification was performed using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen), as directed by the manufacturer. The isolated modified DNA was then subjected to piperidine cleavage at 95 °C for 30 min (14Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8989) Google Scholar) followed by drying and resuspension in 30 μl of H2O. After another cycle of drying and resuspension, the samples were dried and dissolved in 15 μl of formamide loading buffer and loaded on a 20% sequencing gel (14Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8989) Google Scholar). The cleavage patterns were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimagery. G + A and C + T Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders of the labeled DNA were loaded on the same gel for comparison (but not shown). To quantitate the degree of interference at each base following modification, percent bound was determined by phosphorimagery and normalized to the position where modification had the least effect on JBP binding. This resulted in a degree of interference for each band or base. JBP does not bind DNA that lacks base J (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, by representing base J removal as the maximal level of inhibition (100%), the data are expressed as relative percent inhibition. The labeled DNA oligo was premethylated by treatment with 0.5% dimethyl sulfate for 5 min at 25 °C. Modification was halted by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (14Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8989) Google Scholar), and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation as described above. The modified oligo was hybridized to the complementary strand and incubated with purified JBP protein as described above. Protein-bound and free DNA fractions were recovered after native gel electrophoresis, cleaved with piperidine, and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above for the missing-base interference assay. Binding reactions were scaled up 5-fold and fractionated by native gel electrophoresis. The reactions were constituted such that about half of the input DNA was bound by the enzyme. A discrete JBP/[32P]J-DNA complex was resolved from free labeled J-DNA and excised separately from the gel. The gel slices were then soaked in 300 μl of TE containing 0.5% DMS for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by washing the gel slice 2× with stop buffer (1.5 m sodium acetate, pH 7, 1m β-mercaptoethanol) and eluting the DNA by soaking overnight at 37 °C in stop buffer. DNA was precipitated, cleaved with piperidine, and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. Binding reactions were scaled up and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described for the methylation protection assay. The free and bound DNAs were then digested in situ by the nuclease activity of the 2:1 1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex (15Papavassiliou A.G. Silverstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9402-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis, the entire gel was immersed into a clean Pyrex dish containing 200 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Next, 20 ml of a solution containing 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.45 mm CuSO4 (prepared just prior to use by mixing 1 ml of 40 mm 1,10-phenanthroline in 100% ethanol, 1 ml of 9 mm cupric sulfate in water, and 19 ml of H2O) was added to the solution. In situ digestion of the free and complexed J-DNAs was initiated by the addition of 20 ml of a freshly prepared 58 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid solution (1:200 dilution of 3-mercaptopropionic acid in H2O) and was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 20 ml of freshly prepared 28 mm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline in 100% ethanol and allowing the resulting solution to stand for 2 min. The gel was then rinsed with distilled water, and free and bound J-DNAs were eluted from the gel as described above. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and run on a 20% sequencing gel and analyzed as described above. The 20-mer bromo-substituted DNA substrate was prepared by 5′-end labeling of the Br-containing A-strand, followed by hybridization to the unlabeled J-strand. Cross-linking reactions (20 μl) containing 0.1 pmol of DNA and 0.5 pmol of JBP in a standard reaction mixture were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in a microtiter plate. The samples were then irradiated for the times indicated using a 312 nm transilluminator situated 2.2 cm above the samples (on ice). The samples were denatured in 1% SDS followed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The cross-linked adducts were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. The extent of cross-linking is expressed as percent of input DNA in the protein adduct representing an average of three independent experiments. We have shown previously that JBP recognizes J only in duplex DNA and that the binding is relatively independent of the DNA sequence context (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (TableI). To characterize further the sequence dependence of JBP binding, we tested the ability of JBP to recognize the thymine moiety of base J. A synthesized DNA substrate containing the glucose linked to cytosine binds JBP with ∼17-fold lower affinity (Table I) than J-DNA in which the glucose was attached to the thymine base. Thus, JBP was able to distinguish between thymine and cytosine bases containing the glucose moiety. The difficulty in synthesizing modified DNA substrates containing glucosylated A or G has precluded further analysis of the thymine specificity of JBP binding. However, this result suggests JBP makes a specific contact with the thymine moiety of base J.Table ISummary of dissociation constants (K d ) of JBP bound to J-DNA of various sequences and context1-a See Ref.10van Leeuwen F.

To identify precisely the bases in J-DNA that contribute to the binding of JBP, we used a missing-base footprint-interference analysis (13Ording E. Kvavik W. Bostad A. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,16Brunelle A. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This method allows the importance of every base in the J-DNA substrate for JBP binding to be analyzed. In this approach the DNA is sparingly depurinated or depyrimidinated and then reacted with JBP. The bound and unbound fractions of J-DNA were separated, cleaved with piperidine, and analyzed on a sequencing gel to determine the positions of base removal. Positions where removal of the base greatly reduced binding of the JBP protein were taken as bases directly involved in J-DNA recognition. When the VSG-G J-DNA substrate was used, the missing-base interference analysis revealed that two bases on the J-containing strand are important for JBP binding (Fig.1 A). The data for both the J- and A-strand (not shown) are summarized in Fig.1 C. As expected, the removal of base J (position 0) has the greatest effect on JBP binding, essentially shifting all the DNA to the unbound fraction (Fig. 1 A). However, unexpectedly, the specific removal of the adjacent base at position −1 on the same J-strand (referred to as position J-1) resulted in a similar inhibition of JBP binding (Fig. 1, A and C). This effect is independent of sequence, because we see a similar result if the base at position J-1 is G, C, or T (Figs. 1 and 2and data not shown). In other positions surrounding J and J-1 on the same J-strand as well as all positions of the A-strand, only a minor or less striking effect of base removal was seen. This minor effect extends to ∼4–6 bp flanking base J, depending on the substrate analyzed (see below). This is similar to the minimal J-DNA substrate of 5 bp of duplex required flanking base J for JBP binding (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two potential exceptions to this minor effect are positions J −2 and J +1 (Fig. 1 A). However, when these effects are quantitated (Fig.1 C), we see that removal of these bases result in ∼30% inhibition or less (31 and 19% for J −2 and J +1, respectively) compared with the maximal interference due to J removal. Therefore, we include these as minor or less important effects (see “Discussion”).Figure 2Modification-interference analysis of VSG-1J and Tel-1J. Analysis of J-DNA substrates VSG-1J and Tel-1J was performed as in Fig. 1. A summary of the data is shown, using the same symbols as in Fig. 1 C. The results presented are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Disregarding the obvious effect at J-1, overall the substrates analyzed indicate a relatively symmetrical binding site surrounding base J (Figs. 1 C and 2 A). However, the interference pattern for the telomeric substrate may indicate an asymmetrically bound protein with minor interference effects extending preferentially along the 5′-side (minus positions) of base J (Fig. 2 B). It may be significant that this apparent differential binding pattern reflects the differential binding affinity of JBP for this substrate (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Table I). However, further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Whereas the missing-base interference analysis allows the investigation of every base in J-DNA and its requirement for JBP binding, it does not distinguish between potential critical minor or major groove interactions. Treatment of DNA with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylates the N-7 of guanines in the major groove and the N-3 of adenosines in the minor groove (14Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8989) Google Scholar, 17Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We performed the reaction under conditions where only guanine methylation led to strand breakage. This procedure allowed us to address specific contacts in the major groove by testing whether pre-methylation of certain guanines affects JBP binding. By using the VSG-G substrate, we found that the presence of methylated guanine at position J-1 significantly interfered with JBP binding (Fig.1, B and C). This suggests that the requirement for the base at position J-1 for JBP binding represents a specific contact in the major groove with JBP. However, once JBP is bound none of guanines on either strand, including the J-1 position, are protected from methylation (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). On the contrary, we see hypermethylation at the J-1 position, indicative of a local conformational change upon JBP binding. This lack of methyl protection, especially at J-1, suggests that once JBP is bound, it does not tightly interact with DNA surrounding base J. JBP binding requires the presence of the glucose moiety in the major groove of DNA (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Chaing S.-Y. Welch J.J. Rauscher F.J. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that the methylation interference pattern indicates decreasing effects with increasing distance from base J along the DNA substrate (Figs. 1 B and2). This is consistent with the idea that JBP lies within the major groove of J-DNA. It is also apparent from the methylation interference pattern that this major groove occupancy is biased toward the minus positions in J-DNA (Figs. 1 B and 2). This is also reflected in the missing-base interference data and is especially evident in the analysis of VSG-G and Tel-1J substrates (Figs.1 B and 2 B). These results are consistent with the asymmetric orientation of JBP in the major groove, preferentially bound on the minus positions, or 5′, of base J. Specific contacts between JBP and purine bases in the major groove can be inferred from the DMS protection and interference studies described above. To probe pyrimidine-specific contacts and further elucidate the major groove occupancy by JBP, we have investigated the photocross-linking of JBP to duplex J-DNA molecules substituted at single positions with either 5-bromocytosine or 5-bromouracil. The bromine in the pyrimidine ring is situated within the major groove of the DNA helix. Upon excitation by UV light, a covalent adduct between the activated pyrimidine and protein can result if a substituent of the polypeptide is situated in close proximity. The substrates used for UV cross-linking were 20-mer J-DNA duplexes (VSG-G). Bromopyrimidines were introduced at six positions in the A-strand which was then 5′-end-labeled and hybridized to an unlabeled complementary J-oligo (Fig.3 A). Control experiments established that bromo substitution had no effect on the ability of JBP to bind J-DNA (data not shown). Cross-linking of bromo-J-DNA to JBP was assayed by the formation of an SDS-stable complex of ∼120 kDa detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 B). For all substrates tested, the formation of a protein-DNA adduct was absolutely dependent on 312 nm UV irradiation, and the yield of photoproduct (especially in the case of the +1 BrdUrd substrate) increased with duration of UV exposure (Fig.3 B). Cross-linking of control J-DNA lacking the brominated nucleotide (A*/J) was minimal (0.05% cross-linking). Obvious variability in the efficiency of cross-linking was observed according to the position of the bromo-substituted pyrimidine base. The highest level of cross-linking (1.6%) was obtained for the +1 bromodeoxycytidine J-DNA (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that JBP was in intimate contact with the +1C base in the major groove of the J-DNA helix. Taken together with the missing-base interference data, the residue at positions +1 on the A-strand is in close proximity with JBP in the major groove but does not make an essential base contact. The remaining base substitutions on the minus positions of the J-DNA substrate resulted in little increase in cross-linking than the non-modified control. This lack of cross-linking on the minus positions includes the base in the −1 position on the A-strand which is hydrogen-bonded to the essential J-1 base. Chromomycin A3 and distamycin A are reversible minor groove-binding drugs with sequence preference for GC- or AT-rich regions, respectively. This specificity in DNA interaction has proven useful for selective disruption of the DNA binding activity of minor groove-binding proteins (18Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Huang M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23999-24004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). With the presence of several GC-rich regions present in our J-DNA substrates, we asked whether chromomycin A3 would specifically disrupt JBP binding. As we demonstrated previously by using the gel shift assay, JBP binds with high affinity to short J-DNA substrates resulting in a shifted JBP·J-DNA complex (11Sabatini R. Meeuwenoord N. van Boom J.H. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 958-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we used the gel shift assay to ask whether minor groove-binding drugs would inhibit JBP binding. Chromomycin A3 at 0.5–1.0 μm nearly completely blocks JBP binding to the Tel-1J substrate (Fig.4 A). However, using another J-DNA substrate with a GC-rich element farther away from base J (VSG-1J), we see an inability of chromomycin A3 to inhibit effectively JBP binding even up to 30 μm (Fig.4 B). When base J is moved to replace a thymine adjacent to this GC-rich element (i.e. VSG-A), we now see nearly 90% inhibition of JBP binding at 0.5 μm chromomycin A3 (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, distamycin A at concentrations up to 10 μm, 5-fold greater than the concentration which completely blocks the interaction of TBP with the TATA element (19Chaing S.-Y. Welch J.J.

Data were compared with pepstatin A, a well known competitive inhibitor of pepsin. Steady-state analysis reveals that the substituted piperidine likewise behaves as a competitive inhibitor. Pre-equilibrium binding studies indicate that the substituted piperidine can displace a fluorescently labeled statine inhibitor from the enzyme active site. Simulation of the stopped-flow fluorescence transients provided estimates of the K d values of 1.4 ± 0.2 μm and 39 ± 2 nm for the piperidine and the fluorescently labeled statine, respectively. The effects of combinations of these two inhibitors resulted in a series of parallel lines when plotted by the method of Yonetani and Theorell (Yonetani, T., and Theorell, H. (1964) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 106, 234–251), suggesting that the two inhibitors bind in a mutually exclusive fashion to pepsin. Fitting of the entire data set to the appropriate equation yielded an α factor of 8 ± 1. The magnitude of this factor (∞ > α > 1) can be explained by a conformational distinction between the enzyme species that bind each inhibitor. The effects of pH on the inhibition constants for pepstatin A and the substituted piperidine also suggest that the inhibitors bind to distinct conformational forms of the enzyme. No inhibition by the piperidine was observed at acidic pH, while pepstatin A inhibition is maximal at low pH values. Inhibition by the piperidine was maximal when a group with pK 4.8 ± 0.2 was deprotonated and another group with pK 5.9 ± 0.2 was protonated. Most likely these two groups are the catalytic aspartates with perturbed ionization properties as a result of a significant and unique conformational change. Taken together, these data suggest that the enzyme can readily interconvert between two conformers, one capable of binding substrate and pepstatin A and the other capable of binding the substituted piperidine.

A significant number of peptidomimetic inhibitors, designed as stable bisubstrate analogues (with statine, hydroxyethylene, or fluorostatone isosteres), have been developed. Some of these have even reached clinical trials, but were abandoned later due to a limited bioavailability or excessive production costs. New structural classes of nonpeptidic inhibitors, with improved physicochemical properties, were identified (5Lam P.Y.S. Eyerman C.J. Hodge C.N. Ru Y. Bacheler L.T. Meek J.L. Otto M.J. Rayner M.M.

Three-dimensional crystal structures of some of these inhibitors bound to their target enzymes have been reported (5Lam P.Y.S. Eyerman C.J. Hodge C.N. Ru Y. Bacheler L.T. Meek J.L. Otto M.J.

However, attainment of structural information is not always straightforward. In these cases the inhibitor modality and binding site have to be inferred from kinetic analysis of enzyme inhibition. Peptidic inhibitors with tetrahedral intermediate isosteres usually bind to aspartyl proteases in an extended conformation with the pro-S C-3 hydroxyl group displacing the catalytic water and hydrogen bonding to the catalytically essential aspartates (10Bott R. Subramanian E. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6956-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These inhibitors usually are competitive with respect to the substrate peptide (11Marcinisczyn J. Hartsuck J.A. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7088-7094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kati W.M. Pals D.T. Tsaisrivongs S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7621-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and if the amino acid sequence of the natural peptidic substrate is available, optimization of such inhibitors is straightforward. The situation is more complex for non-peptidic inhibitors, where a significant distortion of the enzyme active center is observed upon inhibitor binding (13Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J-P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H.P. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F.K. Wostl W. Chem.

These dramatic structural changes are difficult to predict, hence rational optimization of inhibitors is precluded in the absence of structural information. Recently a series of 4′-substituted piperidines has been identified as potent renin (14Vieira E. Bingelli A. Breu V. Bur D. Fischli W. Hirth G. Marki H.P. Muller M. Oefner C. Scalone M. Stadler H.

A renin crystal structure with a potent piperidine bound indicates significant conformational shift (opening) of the flap and relocation of the Trp39 side chain to accommodate the 4′ substituent (13Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J-P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H.P. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F.K. Wostl W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The protonated nitrogen of the piperidine moiety is positioned between the two catalytic aspartates making two strong hydrogen bonds. These compounds are potent inhibitors of renin in vitro (subnanomolar IC50 values) and show blood pressure decreasing activity in sodium-depleted marmosets (6Guller R. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Fischli W. Hirth G. Jenny C. Kansy M. Montavon F. Muller M. Oefner C. Stadler H. Vieira E. Maurice W. Wolst W. Marki H.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Substituted piperidines are also active against parasitic aspartyl proteases and display activity against malaria in cell culture (16Bur D. Fischli W. Matile H. Ridley R.G. Wostl W. WO Patent 99/12532 A2. 1999; (March 18)Google Scholar). Attempts to model piperidines in the porcine pepsin active site suggested that it is possible to design piperidine-based inhibitors for a number of aspartyl proteases, assuming that most of these enzymes can adopt conformations similar to renin (15Bursawich M.G. West C.W. Rich D.H. Org. Lett. 2001; 3: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, no direct structural or kinetic evidence has been presented to address the nature of the interactions between these inhibitors and aspartyl proteases in solution. Also, the physicochemical properties of these compounds (e.g. poor aqueous solubility and the potential to form aggregate structures in solution) can lead to general nonspecific inhibition of some aspartyl proteases at high inhibitor concentrations. 2J. Marcinkeviciene, unpublished results. Hence, it is important to establish the mode of specific inhibition of aspartyl proteases by these compounds through solution-phase kinetic and equilibrium methods. In this study we sought to fill this void by studying the interactions of a 4′-substituted piperidine with the aspartyl protease porcine pepsin. Using a combination of steady-state kinetics and pre-equilibrium binding methods we show here that the substituted piperidines are active site-directed inhibitors that may bind to an enzyme conformer that is distinct from the enzyme form that binds substrate and more traditional peptide-tetrahedral isostere inhibitors. The rhodamine green-labeled statine inhibitor was synthesized using a 2-chlorotrityl chloride solid support and utilizing standardO-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) coupling conditions. The inhibitor was cleaved from the solid support, dissolved in a 0.1 msodium bicarbonate buffer, and labeled with rhodamine green succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) inN,N-dimethylformamide. The labeled peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and lyophilized to dryness. The substituted piperidine inhibitor was prepared in a manner similar to that previously reported (15Bursawich M.G. West C.W. Rich D.H. Org. Lett. 2001; 3: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Lohri B. Vieira E. WO Patent 00/631713 A1. 2000; (October 26)Google Scholar). Briefly, triisopropylsilyl-protected 4-hydroxyphenylmagensium bromide was added to t-butoxycarbonyl-protected 4-piperidone. The resulting carbinol was eliminated with phosphorus oxychloride in pyridine, and the olefin was converted to the (S,S)-diol using the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. The benzylic tertiary alcohol was then removed using Raney nickel, and the triisopropyl silyl group was cleaved with tetrabutylammmonium fluoride and replaced with an allyl ether using potassium carbonate and allyl bromide to provide the protected (R,R)-diol. The 2-naphthylmethyl ether was then introduced by alkylation with the corresponding alkyl bromide and potassium tert-butoxide, the allyl ether was removed using tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) palladium (0), and the remaining ether group was introduced by alkylation using potassium carbonate and bromomethyl-2-napthyl ketone. Porcine pepsin (Sigma) activity was measured under steady-state conditions following fluorescence signal increase (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 490 nm) upon the cleavage of the Ac-ED(EDANS)KPILFFRLGK(DABCYL)E-NH2substrate (Bachem). Assays were performed in 96-well plates using a SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS (Molecular Devices) microplate spectrofluorometer. Typically, 0.1 ml of 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0 or 3.0, containing 40 nm pepsin was mixed with 0.004 ml of inhibitor in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration in the assay was 2%), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.02 mm substrate in the same buffer (final concentration of enzyme was 20 nm and substrate 0.01 mm). Mutual exclusivity and HPLC experiments contained 0.6 nm enzyme. Enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance at 278 nm (ε278 = 51,000m−1 cm−1) and reconfirmed by active site titration with pepstatin A (Sigma) as a tight binding inhibitor (at [E] ≫ K i) at pH 3.0. Inhibitor potency was evaluated by fitting inhibition data to the binding isotherm, vv0=11+[I]IC50nEquation 1 where v is the reaction velocity at different concentrations of inhibitor I; v 0 is the control velocity in the absence of inhibitor; and n is the number of the inhibitor molecules bound to the enzyme. Inhibitor modality under steady-state conditions was determined by measuring the effect of inhibitor concentration on initial velocity as a function of substrate concentration. Data were fit globally to the following equation for competitive inhibition (18Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). v=Vmax[S][S]+Km1+[I]KiEquation 2 Mutual exclusivity studies were performed at one fixed substrate concentration varying pepstatin A and piperidine concentrations, and data were evaluated according to Ref. 19Yonetani T. Theorell H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 234-251Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar. v=Vmax1+KmS1+I1K1+I2K2+I1I2αK1K2Equation 3 Alternatively, an HPLC assay was used to determine kinetic parameters and inhibition under different pH conditions. For this assay 0.2-ml reactions were set up in Eppendorf tubes (identical conditions as the fluorescence assay). After 5 min the reaction was stopped by boiling, and the mixture was injected onto a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (Waters). Reaction products were eluted with a linear 0–80% acetonitrile gradient monitoring absorbance at 490 nm. The kinetic parameters, V and K m, as well asK i, were measured at different pH values using 50 mm citrate, pH 2.0–4.0, and 50 mm acetate, pH 4.0–6.0, buffers. Data for the pH profiles, which go from a slope 0 to −1 at higher pH values, were fit to Equation 4. y=C/(1+K/H)Equation 4 Bell-shaped pH profile was fit to Equation 5. y=C/(1+H/Ka+Kb/H)Equation 5 In both equations y is the experimental value of the parameter, C is a pH-independent value, and K is the dissociation constant for the ionizable group. Pre-equilibrium binding studies were conducted using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow fluorometer (Leatherhead, UK). Experiments were performed by rapid mixing of equal volumes of the reagents in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 15 °C. The complex of pepsin (0.5 μm) and rhodamine green-modified statine inhibitor (rg-E-V-N-benzA-stat-A-E-F-OH, 5 μm) was mixed in the stopped-flow chamber with pepstatin A (2 μm) or piperidine (20 μm). The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and fluorescence was followed using a narrow band filter (545 ± 10 nm, Melles Griot). Data were collected for 10 s, and traces were fit to a single exponential equation to obtaink obs. Data were reproducible despite a low signal to noise ratio. For each experiment about 5–10 transients were averaged. The instrument dead time was 1.2 ms. Simulations were performed using KINSIM and FITSIM software. Initially, fitting was optimized by incremental adjustment of individual rate constants by visual inspection of the generated theoretical curve with the experimental data using KINSIM. Once a reasonable fit was obtained, final parameter calculation was made by the use of the program FITSIM. Pepsin demonstrates maximal enzymatic activity near pH 3.0 (20Cornish-Bowden A.J. Knowles J.R. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At this pH the enzyme is potently inhibited by pepstatin A. The substituted piperidine (Fig. 1), however, is ineffective as a pepsin inhibitor at this pH. The pH profile for the kinetic parameter V/K of pepsin was measured from pH 2 to 6 (Fig.2 A). The data display a single titration that is well fit by Equation 4 to yield a pK value of 5.1 ± 0.3. These data are in good agreement with previous studies reported in the literature (21Lin Y. Fusek M. Lin X. Hartsuck J.A. Kezdy F.J. Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18413-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second titration with a pK of 1.5 (a feature associated with the general-base aspartate) is not obvious from our experiments, since we did not extend the pH range low enough. The pH profile for inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin A displays a remarkably similar titration curve (Fig.2 B) with a pK value of 5.6 ± 0.1. In stark contrast to the above results, the pH profile for inhibition of pepsin by the substituted piperidine (Fig. 2 C) displays a maximum at pH 5.0 and appears to involve two distinct titration events in the same pH range. Fitting the data to Equation 5 revealed two ionizable groups involved in piperidine binding. Inhibition by the substituted piperidine is maximal when a group with pK = 4.8 ± 0.2 is deprotonated and another group with pK = 5.9 ± 0.2 is protonated. Attempts to alternatively fit these data to one titration event, with maximal inhibition requiring deprotonation of a single group, were unsatisfactory. All subsequent experiments were performed at pH 5.0.Figure 2Effect of pH onV/K of the reaction catalyzed by pepsin (pK = 5. 1 ± 0.3) (A),K i for pepsin inhibition by pepstatin A (pK = 5.6 ± 0.1) (B), andK i for pepsin inhibition by the substituted piperidine (pK 1 = 4.8 ± 0.2 and pK 2 = 5.9 ± 0.2) (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Evaluating the potency of the substituted piperidine in pepsin assays we noticed that the IC50, defined by Equation 1, increased linearly with increasing substrate concentration (data not shown), suggesting that this inhibitor competes for the substrate binding site (22Chou T.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 235-247PubMed Google Scholar). To verify this interpretation, the velocity of the enzymatic reaction was evaluated with systematic variations in substrate and inhibitor concentration. These data were fit globally to the steady-state equation for competitive inhibition (Equation 2) and yielded a calculated value of K i of 3.2 ± 1.5 μm (Fig.3 A). The competitive nature of this inhibition was further confirmed by fitting the data for each inhibitor concentration in Fig. 3 A individually to the Michaelis-Menten equation and thus deriving apparent values ofK m and V max. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, the apparent K m value increased linearly with increasing inhibitor concentration, while the value of V max was unaffected by the presence of inhibitor; this pattern is consistent with competitive inhibition (23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). To confirm further the hypothesis that the piperidine derivative is binding by engaging the active site aspartates, we performed mutual exclusivity studies. Pepstatin A, a naturally occurring peptidic inhibitor containing the statine isostere, is known to bind aspartyl proteases at their active sites, with the hydroxyl of the statine moiety hydrogen bonding to the catalytic aspartates (24James M.N. Sielecki A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 299-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the substituted piperidine is binding at the active site, a mutual exclusivity pattern should be observed when these two inhibitors are varied at one fixed concentration of the substrate. Yonetani-Theorell plots (19Yonetani T. Theorell H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 234-251Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig.4) constructed from the data obtained by varying the piperidine concentration at different fixed concentrations of pepstatin A showed parallel lines. Fitting these data to Equation 3yielded K i values of 2.1 ± 0.2 nm and 1.5 ± 0.1 μm for pepstatin A and the piperidine, respectively, and an interaction coefficient α of 8 ± 0.9. This latter value, ∞ > α > 1, is indicative of negative interactions between the binding of the two inhibitors, but requires a more complex mechanism than simple competition for a common enzyme species. Yonetani and Theorell (19Yonetani T. Theorell H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 234-251Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar) suggest several potential explanations for such a value of α; these include ion-dipole interactions, hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions, and protein conformational changes involved in differential inhibitor binding (19Yonetani T. Theorell H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 106: 234-251Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The rhodamine green (rg) dye-modified statine inhibitor displays a strong fluorescence signal at 530 nm when excited at 295 nm (Fig. 5,trace 1). This fluorescence is modestly enhanced when the inhibitor binds to pepsin (Fig. 5, trace 2) under equilibrium binding conditions. Under the same conditions the enzyme's tryptophan fluorescence at 340 nm is quenched (Fig. 5, inset trace 2), most likely as a result of the spectroscopic properties of the dye (absorbance at 340 nm) in solution. Although the magnitude of the signal change is small, the change in signal at 530–550 nm is unique to the inhibitor-pepsin complex and thus provides a convenient means of following complex formation and dissociation. We therefore used this signal to assess the ability of the substituted piperidine to displace the fluorescent peptide inhibitor from pepsin under pre-equilibrium conditions. When the preformed rg-peptide·pepsin complex (0.5 and 5 μm, respectively) was mixed with an equal volume of 20 μmsubstituted piperidine, a time-dependent diminution of fluorescence signal was observed which could be fit to a first order decay curve with k obs = 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1 (Fig. 6). A similar decay of fluorescence intensity was observed when the preformed rg-peptide·pepsin complex was mixed with an equal volume of 2 μm pepstatin A (data not shown), indicating that both pepstatin A and the substituted piperidine were similarly capable of displacing the rg-modified peptide from pepsin.Figure 6Binding transient obtained after mixing the complex of 0.5 μm pepsin and 5 μm dye-modified inhibitor with 20 μm substituted piperidine. Thesolid line represents fitting of the data to a single exponential decay. The calculated k obs value was 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Conformational adjustments in enzyme active sites are common features of the reaction pathways for many enzymes. Conformational changes have been experimentally observed to attend binding of substrates, reaction intermediates, and inhibitor molecules to enzymes. A number of aspartyl proteases have been reported to undergo “flap” closing when bisubstrate analogues (peptide with statine or hydroxyethylene isosteres) occupy the substrate binding site (25Rodrigues E.J. Debouck C. Deckman I.C. Abu-Soud H. Raushel F.M. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Marcinkeviciene J. Luo Y. Graciani N. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23790-23794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Established hydrogen bonds between the residues within the flap and complementary carbonyl oxygens and amide protons of the peptide serve to align the scissile peptide sequence in the protease active site. These peptidomimetic inhibitors usually show slow binding behavior, which could be attributed to tightening of the enzyme-inhibitor complex as a result of flap closing. Totally different conformational changes have been observed in the three-dimensional structure of the renin active site upon non-peptidic inhibitor binding (13Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J-P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H.P. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F.K. Wostl W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This novel binding pattern bares little resemblance to the extended β-sheet structure of the substrate, but nevertheless renders potent inhibition of the enzyme. Our present study of pepsin inhibition by a substituted piperidine (Fig. 1) revealed several unique features as well. Aspartyl protease-catalyzed peptide cleavage involves a general-acid, general-base chemical mechanism in which two active site aspartates are in opposite states of protonation (27Suguna K. Padlan A.E. Smith C.W. Carlson W.D. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7009-7013Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This is generally reflected in bell-shaped pH profiles for the free enzyme (logV/K) and for the enzyme-substrate complex (logV). We reconfirmed that pepsin cleaves the peptide substrate used in this study by the same chemical mechanism, and the pK of 5.1 (for the general-acid aspartate) determined here for the free enzyme is in a good agreement with the value reported earlier (21Lin Y.

The general-base aspartate pK is not reflected in the Fig. 2 A pH profile, since experimental conditions were not extended to low enough pH. A similar pH profile was observed for the inhibition by pepstatin A (Fig. 2 B), reconfirming that the enzyme-inhibitor complex is similar to the enzyme-substrate complex, and that pepstatin A binds to the monoprotonated form of the proteases, as has also been demonstrated by 13C NMR (28Piana S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), neutron Laue diffraction (30Coates L. Erskin P.T. Wood S.P. Myles D.A.A. Cooper J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13149-13157Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and isothermal titration calorimetry (31Xie D. Gulnik S. Collins L. Gustchina E. Suvorov L. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16166-16172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) methods. A very different pH profile was observed for the piperidine pK i (Fig. 2 C), suggesting either that other ionizable groups are critical for piperidine binding or that the pK values of the catalytic aspartates are significantly perturbed. A similar decrease in affinity at acidic pH was observed in the binding of a cationic inhibitor to HIV protease (32Hyland L.J. Tomaszek T.A. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8454-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This observation was interpreted as evidence that the cationic inhibitor binds exclusively to the unprotonated enzyme, forming an ionic bond to Asp-25′, which is normally protonated in the catalytically competent enzyme. An alternative explanation for these results would be a large shift of both aspartate pK values as a result of a significant conformational change. Our data suggest that the substituted piperidines most likely bind to a monoprotonated form of the enzyme (indicated by the bell-shaped pH dependence) in which the pK of both aspartates is perturbed. We cannot exclude the alternative possibility that the piperidine inhibition pH profile reflects ionization of critical groups other than the active site aspartates, although the demonstration of competitive inhibition by the piperidine (Fig. 3) and the known interactions of these inhibitors with the active site aspartates of renin (13Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J-P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H.P. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F.K. Wostl W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) make this alternative explanation less likely. Substituted piperidine binding in the active site of pepsin is evident from the combined data of steady-state inhibition and pre-equilibrium binding studies. Even though drastic structural rearrangements were observed upon piperidine binding in the case of renin, we did not notice any time dependence of the pepsin inhibition. It has been suggested previously that peptidomimetic inhibitors and piperidines bind to the dynamic ensemble of pre-existing enzyme conformations, stabilizing the geometry of the binding site (15Bursawich M.G. West C.W. Rich D.H. Org. Lett. 2001; 3: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that two conformers of pepsin (one binding statines and the other binding piperidines) are in rapid equilibrium and can be stabilized by appropriate inhibitors. The energy barrier for interconversion between these two conformers cannot be significant, as our data suggest facile competition between the statines and the piperidine (see Figs. 4 and 6). To further address interconversion between these proposed conformers we performed displacement experiments under pre-equilibrium conditions. The preformed complex of pepsin and rhodamine green-modified statine inhibitor (E-rgStat) was mixed in a stopped-flow chamber with an excess of piperidine (Pip). The molecular processes that attend interactions between pepsin and these inhibitors can be described by either of the following two kinetic schemes. E­rgStat⇌k1k−1E+rgStat⇌rapidE′+rgStatE′+Pip⇌k−2k2E′­PipScheme 1 E­rgStat⇌k1k−1E+rgStatE+Pip⇌k−2k2E­Pip⇌rapidE′­PipScheme 2 We do not have any independent evidence of the exact path ofE and E′ interconversion (i.e. does it occur at the level of the free enzyme or subsequent to inhibitor binding), since no biphasic behavior was observed in the overall process, even on a stopped-flow time scale. Nevertheless our pH and mutual exclusivity data clearly point out that different final conformations are stabilized by the piperidine and statine inhibitors. The E-rgStat complex has an increased fluorescence signal (compared with free rgStat, Fig. 5) as a result of energy transfer from pepsin tryptophans to the dye; the diminution of this signal upon mixing with the piperidine (under pre-equilibrium conditions) indicated formation of an E′-Pip complex. The rate constant for the overall displacement reaction was independent of enzyme, rgStat, or Pip concentrations, and thus k 1[rgStat] ≪k 2[Pip] ≫ k −1. Under these conditions the measured k obs is equivalent to the dissociation rate constantk −1 (33Fireke C.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Simulation of the reaction course (FITSIM software) using data from Fig. 6 and either of the schemes described above yielded the following individual rate constantsk 1 = (1.00 ± 0.04) 107m−1 s−1,k −1 = 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1,k 2 = (3.5 ± 1.0) 105m−1 s−1 andk −2 = 0.5 ± 0.2 s−1. The calculated K d value of the rhodamine green-modified statine inhibitor thus is 39 ± 2 nm, and theK d value for the piperidine is 1.4 ± 0.2 μm. These values are in good agreement with the values obtained by independent methods: equilibrium titration of the rhodamine green-modified statine with pepsin gave a K d of 42 ± 7 nm (data not shown), and theK d for the piperidine inhibitor calculated from the mutual exclusivity experiment was 1.5 ± 0.1 μm. These data suggest that even when the enzyme conformation is stabilized by a statine inhibitor, it can readily undergo rearrangement to adopt a novel conformation induced by the binding of a non-peptidic inhibitor. The monophasic nature of these displacement time courses and the excellent agreement between the dissociation constants measured by this method and by independent experiments indicate that the interconversion between conformers E and E′ does not impart a rate limitation to the kinetics of ligand exchange for pepsin. This suggests that despite the stabilization of each conformer by one or the other inhibitor, the enzyme can nevertheless undergo rearrangements of the active site to adopt the alternative conformation rapidly upon ligand binding/dissociation. The catalytic competence of these two conformers could be interpreted in terms of an iso uni-bi kinetic mechanism, which has been proposed for HIV protease (32Hyland L.J. Tomaszek T.A. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8454-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and pepsin (34Northrop D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism the enzyme is challenged to adopt more than two conformations, differing in geometry, protonation state, and proton localization (34Northrop D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) during catalytic turnover. We do not have enough evidence to define the nature of the conformer that binds the substituted piperidine, but a more complete understanding of these interconverting conformational states of the enzyme may help to define novel mechanisms for aspartyl protease inhibition. This may also serve to define limitations for specific inhibitor classes (e.g. the piperidines) under physiologically relevant pH conditions. Note Added in Proof—While this work was under review an interesting perspective on piperidine and other non-peptidic inhibitors of aspartyl proteases was published by Bursawich and Rich (35Bursawich M.G.
