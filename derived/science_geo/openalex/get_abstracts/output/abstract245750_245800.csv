https://openalex.org/W2135328571,"Hypersynchronous neuronal firing is a hallmark of epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying simultaneous activation of multiple neurons remains unknown. Epileptic discharges are in part initiated by a local depolarization shift that drives groups of neurons into synchronous bursting. In an attempt to define the cellular basis for hypersynchronous bursting activity, we studied the occurrence of paroxysmal depolarization shifts after suppressing synaptic activity using tetrodotoxin (TTX) and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blockers. Here we report that paroxysmal depolarization shifts can be initiated by release of glutamate from extrasynaptic sources or by photolysis of caged Ca(2+) in astrocytes. Two-photon imaging of live exposed cortex showed that several antiepileptic agents, including valproate, gabapentin and phenytoin, reduced the ability of astrocytes to transmit Ca(2+) signaling. Our results show an unanticipated key role for astrocytes in seizure activity. As such, these findings identify astrocytes as a proximal target for the treatment of epileptic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2068128334,"Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is the central enzyme of the NAD biosynthetic pathway. Three human NMNAT isoforms have recently been identified, but isoform-specific functions are presently unknown, although a tissue-specific role has been suggested. Analyses of the subcellular localization confirmed NMNAT1 to be a nuclear protein, whereas NMNAT2 and -3 were localized to the Golgi complex and the mitochondria, respectively. This differential subcellular localization points to an organelle-specific, nonredundant function of each of the three proteins. Comparison of the kinetic properties showed that particularly NMNAT3 exhibits a high tolerance toward substrate modifications. Moreover, as opposed to preferred NAD+ synthesis by NMNAT1, the other two isoforms could also form NADH directly from the reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide, supporting a hitherto unknown pathway of NAD generation. A variety of physiological intermediates was tested and exerted only minor influence on the catalytic activities of the NMNATs. However, gallotannin was found to be a potent inhibitor, thereby compromising its use as a specific inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase. The presence of substrate-specific and independent nuclear, mitochondrial, and Golgi-specific NAD biosynthetic pathways is opposed to the assumption of a general cellular NAD pool. Their existence appears to be consistent with important compartment-specific functions rather than to reflect simple functional redundance.

For many years the pyridine nucleotides have been recognized as vital to all organisms because of their essential role in energy transduction. They participate as coenzymes in a multitude of metabolic hydrogen transfer reactions. Recently, however, an entirely unexpected role of NAD and NADP has been discovered that is now the subject of intense investigations; these molecules represent important factors in a variety of signaling pathways (1Berger F. Ramirez-Hernandez M.H. Ziegler M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). On the one hand, NAD+ is a substrate for covalent protein modifications such as mono-ADP-ribosylation, poly-ADP-ribosylation, and protein deacetylation. These processes participate in the regulation of critical cellular events such as replication, telomere maintenance, apoptosis, and transcription as well as gene silencing (1Berger F.

On the other hand, NAD(P)+ is the direct precursor of two calcium-mobilizing messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). 3The abbreviations used are:NAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateNHDnicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotideNMNATnicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNMNHreduced nicotinamide mononucleotideSir2silent information regulator2Wldsslowed wallerian degenerationEGCGepigallocatechin gallate 3The abbreviations used are:NAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateNHDnicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotideNMNATnicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNMNHreduced nicotinamide mononucleotideSir2silent information regulator2Wldsslowed wallerian degenerationEGCGepigallocatechin gallate These molecules are involved in a variety of signaling pathways including the regulation of intracellular insulin levels and its secretion, T-cell activation, or cate-cholamine secretion (6Clapper D.L.

The discovery of NAD-dependent regulatory mechanisms has also led to the realization that NAD(P) biosynthesis has to be an ongoing process to fuel these pathways. That is, although the metabolic redox reactions are not accompanied by any net consumption of pyridine nucleotides, their participation in signaling pathways requires a steady resynthesis to maintain a stable cellular concentration. nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase green fluorescent protein reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide silent information regulator2 slowed wallerian degeneration epigallocatechin gallate nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase green fluorescent protein reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide silent information regulator2 slowed wallerian degeneration epigallocatechin gallate Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase (NMNAT) is a central enzyme in NAD biosynthesis (10Magni G.

The first primary structures of a human NMNAT (NMNAT1) and its counterparts from other species were only recently established (11Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A.

Biochem. 1999; 193: 99-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several studies over the past few years have already revealed important regulatory functions of this enzyme. For example, overexpression of NMNAT extends the life span of yeast cells (18Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This effect has been attributed to the activation of NAD-dependent protein deacetylation catalyzed by the family of silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) proteins whose pharmacological activation by resveratrol or overexpression caused life span extension in a variety of organisms (19Lin S.J. Defossez P A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 20Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L.

Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a spontaneous mutation in mice has been discovered that leads to the overexpression of a chimeric protein composed of the full-length NMNAT1 and the N terminus of the ubiquitin assembly protein, Ufd2a (22Conforti L. Tarlton A. Mack T.G. Mi W. Buckmaster E.A. Wagner D. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11377-11382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mutant mice show a slowed Wallerian degeneration (Wlds). This axonal degeneration is a self-destructive process observed after an axonal injury or during neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson or Alzheimer disease (23Bedalov A. Simon J.A. Science. 2004; 305: 954-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The axons of the Wlds-mouse are protected from degeneration because of the enhanced biosynthesis of NAD by NMNAT1. It has now been demonstrated that the ensuing silencing of genes involved in the degeneration process is the reason for the delayed axon degeneration and that it is mediated via the activation of SIRT1, the mammalian ortholog of the yeast Sir2 protein (24Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Considering the fundamental role of NMNAT in NAD biosynthesis and as a regulator in signaling processes, it was an exciting discovery that there is more than one protein possessing NMNAT activity. Two other human NMNATs (NMNAT2 and NMNAT3) have now been cloned and partially characterized (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Yalowitz J.A. Xiao S. Biju M.P. Antony A.C. Cummings O.W. Deeg M.A. Jayaram H.N. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the roles of these new isozymes in NAD biosynthesis and NAD-dependent signal transduction pathways have remained unclear. The proteins appear to differ in their tissue-specific expression and, possibly, in their subcellular localization (11Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Yalowitz J.A. Xiao S. Biju M.P. Antony A.C. Cummings O.W. Deeg M.A. Jayaram H.N. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although endogenous NMNAT1 was localized exclusively to the nucleus (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), NMNAT2- and NMNAT3-GFP fusion proteins were targeted to the cytosol, although NMNAT3 was also partially found within the mitochondria (27Zhang X.

Surprisingly, the oligomeric state of the three human NMNAT isoforms appears to differ considerably. As deduced from the crystal structures NMNAT1 is a homohexamer (28Garavaglia S. D'Angelo I.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13148-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas NMNAT3 is a homotetramer (27Zhang X. Kurnasov O.V. Karthikeyan S. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed NMNAT2 has been suggested to be a homodimer (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Only NMNAT1 has been extensively studied with regard to physical and kinetic properties (31Magni G. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Emanuelli M. Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of NMNAT2 were reported for the generation of NAD+ (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas no functional studies of NMNAT3 have been conducted, except for the fact that it does synthesize NAD+ from NMN and ATP (27Zhang X. Kurnasov O.V. Karthikeyan S. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the rather different tertiary structures of the proteins, their functional characteristics could also differ substantially. We aimed our study, therefore, at comparing the catalytic properties of the individual human NMNAT isozymes. To this end, the three proteins were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Moreover, to understand their specific physiological functions, we established their subcellular localization. The results revealed both a strict compartment-specific expression of NMNAT2 and -3 in the Golgi complex and mitochondria, respectively, and substantial differences in the substrate specificities of the three isoforms. Analysis in the presence of mRNA in two human cell lines also found that all three isoforms can be expressed simultaneously. Therefore, the existence of three NMNAT isoforms appears to be consistent with important compartment-specific functions rather than to reflect simple functional redundance. cDNA Cloning for Prokaryotic Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human NMNATs—Human NMNAT1 was cloned into the pQE30 prokaryotic expression vector (Qiagen) as described previously (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human NMNAT2-cDNA and NMNAT3-cDNA were amplified from cDNA prepared from human brain and human heart mRNAs (kindly provided by Antje Ludwig), respectively. The primers for amplification were 5′-ATG ACC GAG ACC ACC AAG AC-3′ and 5′-CTA GCC GGA GGC ATT GAT GT-3′ for human NMNAT2 and 5′-ATG AAG AGC CGA ATA CCT GTG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT TGT CTT GCC CTC AG-3′ for human NMNAT3. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 58 °C. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR-2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNAs encoding human NMNAT2 and NMNAT3 were subsequently cloned into the pQE30 vector using the KpnI (sense) and HindIII (antisense) recognition sites for NMNAT2 and the KpnI (sense) and SalI (antisense) recognition sites for NMNAT3. Thereby, the recombinant proteins were extended by an N-terminal His6 tag. Prokaryotic Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human NMNATs—His-tagged human recombinant NMNAT1 was expressed and purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as described previously (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For overexpression, the NMNAT2 and NMNAT3 vector constructs were transformed into E. coli (M15) cells. Overnight cultures were transferred to 350 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Overexpression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 or 1 mm for expression of NMNAT2 or NMNAT3, respectively, at an optical density of 0.6 (600 nm) of the cells. Protein expression was carried out for 12 h at 30°C or 4 h at 37°C for NMNAT2 and NMNAT3, respectively. The cells were then harvested and broken up using a French press (SLM Instruments) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 × complete-mini protease inhibitor-mix (Roche Applied Science), 10 μg/ml lysozyme, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for NMNAT2 and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl for NMNAT3). The overexpressed proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The purified proteins were stored at 4 °C, except NMNAT2, which was rather unstable and, therefore, stored at -80 °C and thawed shortly before use. Measurements of NMNAT Activity—The enzymatic activities of the three human NMNATs for the forward reaction were measured and quantified by a photometric assay as described previously (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine substrate specificities and kinetic data for the reverse reaction, the activity was calculated from product quantification of reverse phase HPLC separations of the reaction mixture. The purified human recombinant NMNATs were incubated with the indicated substrates in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl). The reaction was allowed to run for the indicated time at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by diluting the sample 1:10 with ice-cold water immediately followed by centrifugation through a Centricon microfiltration device (Millipore, size exclusion 5 kDa). The filtrate was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (33Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were quantified by peak integration. The equilibrium of the NMNAT reaction was determined by incubating the enzymes with varying amounts of ATP and NMN or NAD+ and pyrophosphate. After various time intervals the concentrations of the nucleotides were measured by HPLC, whereas the change of the pyrophosphate concentration was assumed to be identical with that of NAD+. The amount of enzyme used was sufficient to establish the equilibrium within 15 min, as detected by additional measurements after 60 min which indicated no further changes in the concentrations of the reactants. The equilibrium constant was calculated as KD = [NAD][PPi]/[ATP][NMN] using the values measured at 60 min. To measure NADH synthesis from NMNH and ATP, a solution of NADH was incubated in the presence of phosphodiesterase I from snake venom. The resulting NMNH was purified by HPLC and used as substrate assuming the same molar extinction coefficient at 340 nm as NADH (6200 cm-1m-1). Eukaryotic Expression of Recombinant Human NMNATs—The cDNAs encoding human NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 were cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-4™ eukaryotic expression vector (Sigma) providing the recombinant proteins with an N-terminal FLAG tag. NMNAT3 was cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-5™ eukaryotic expression vector (Sigma) providing the recombinant protein with a C-terminal FLAG tag. The HindIII (sense) and BamHI (antisense) recognition sites were used for NMNAT1-cDNA cloning, the HindIII recognition site was used for NMNAT2-cDNA cloning, and the EcoRI (sense) and KpnI (antisense) recognition sites were used for NMNAT3-cDNA cloning. For eukaryotic expression of the proteins, cells were transiently transfected with the NMNAT-FLAG constructs by either calcium phosphate precipitation or using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Where indicated, cotransfection with plasmids encoding an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein targeted to the Golgi complex (Clontech) or GFP targeted to the mitochondria (Invitrogen) was carried out. Cells were analyzed by immunostaining after 24-48 h of transfection. To visualize NMNAT1 and NMNAT3, cells were fixed for 45 min at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. To visualize NMNAT2 cells were fixed for 20 min at -20 °C with methanol. The samples were then blocked with 10% fetal calf serum and immunostained with the monoclonal ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody (Sigma). Mitochondria were visualized by Mitotracker (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To conduct a detailed functional characterization of the three different human NMNAT isozymes, their cDNAs were cloned into the pQE30 prokaryotic expression vector, and the respective proteins were overexpressed in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 1, all three proteins were overexpressed, and their molecular weights were in accordance with the predicted sizes. The pQE30 vector endows proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag enabling purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. NMNAT1 and -3 were purified to homogeneity in one step. The NMNAT2 preparations, however, contained impurities (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the major protein in these preparations was NMNAT2, and nucleotide converting activities other than those expected for this type of enzyme were not detected (not shown). To determine and compare the affinities (Km values) of human NMNAT1, -2, and -3 for their substrates, NMN and ATP, the coupled photometric assay was used. NMNAT1 exhibited the highest affinity for these substrates (see TABLE ONE) as well as the highest specific activity. The values for NMNAT1 (11Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and 2 (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) are in accordance with those previously reported. NMNAT3 has not been kinetically characterized so far. Both NMNAT1 and -3 showed no preference with regard to the pyridine mononucleotides (NMN and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), TABLE TWO), whereas NMNAT2 preferred NMN over NaMN.TABLE ONEKinetic parameters of NMNAT isozymesKm NMNKm ATPKm PPiKm NAD+Vmax NAD synthesisVmax NAD+ cleavageVmax NADH cleavageNMNAT13440937592560.58.5NMNAT2322041119701.13.01.7NMNAT3209293901303.612.82.9 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOSubstrate specificity of NMNAT isozymesPyridine mononucleotide transfer activityNMNNaMNNMNAT110098NMNAT210052NMNAT3100100Purine nucleotide transfer activityATPITPGTPNMNAT110067NMNAT210053NMNAT31002719Pyrophosphorolytic activityNADNGDNHDNAADNADPNAADPNADHNADPHPARADPRNMNAT1100265593NDND53NDNDNDNMNAT2100537983ND98NDNDNDNMNAT310057981001ND994NDND Open table in a new tab NMNAT1 is known to also catalyze the reverse reaction. That is, it generates ATP (and NMN) from NAD+ and pyrophosphate. Using the HPLC-based assay, this capacity was also tested for NMNAT2 and -3. These two isozymes, too, catalyze the pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of NAD+ with high efficiency (TABLE ONE). Using NMNAT1 or NMNAT3, we estimated the equilibrium constant for the reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, it was similar for both enzymes and amounted to about 0.3. This result is somewhat surprising, because it indicates that the equilibrium is actually in favor of the pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of NAD+. Presumably, under physiological conditions the pyrophosphate concentration limits the reverse reaction. NMNAT1 has been known to accept a variety of dinucleotides as substrates (31Magni G. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Emanuelli M. Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using a number of commercially available dinucleotides we compared the substrate specificities of the three NMNATs for the reverse reaction. NMNAT3 proved to be the most flexible of the three isozymes and converted NAAD, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD), and NADH to the same extent as NAD+. Moreover, it even cleaved NGD rather efficiently (TABLE TWO). Although NMNAT2 also accepted NHD as substrate, it did so to lower extent. NMNAT1 displayed the highest selectivity and strongly preferred NAD+ and NAAD, the presumed physiological substrates. It degraded NADH and NHD far less effectively and NGD only by about 26% under the conditions of the assay. It is interesting to note that the sensitivity toward nucleobase modifications in the dinucleotide is similarly reflected in the preference for the substrates of the forward reaction. For example, compared with the other two isoforms, NMNAT3 cleaved NGD with the highest efficiency and also exhibited the highest activity to synthesize this dinucleotide from GTP (TABLE TWO). The same is valid for cleavage of NHD and its synthesis from ITP (TABLE TWO). All three NMNAT isoforms essentially failed to cleave the phosphorylated dinucleotides NADP+, NADPH, and NAADP+ (TABLE TWO). A rather unexpected observation was the highly efficient cleavage of NADH by NMNAT2 and -3 compared with their NAD synthesis activities (TABLE ONE and Fig. 2). In this reaction the hitherto uncharacterized metabolite NMNH should be formed. Indeed, ATP was observed as a product along with a metabolite that retained the absorbance at 340 nm, typical for the reduced form of NAD (Fig. 2). As opposed to NADH, it was hardly retained on the HPLC column, as would be expected for NMNH in the method used for nucleotide separation. To verify the ability of NMNATs to synthesize NADH from NMNH and ATP, the following experiment was conducted. NADH was cleaved to NMNH and AMP by phosphodiesterase I from snake venom. NMNH was then purified by HPLC (Fig. 3A). As can be inferred from Fig. 3, in the presence of NMNATs NADH was generated from NMNH and ATP. Therefore, these enzymes can use both the oxidized (NMN) or reduced (NMNH) forms of nicotinamide mononucleotide for NAD+ or NADH synthesis, respectively. At the concentrations used (125 μm NMNH or NMN and 0.5 mm ATP), NMNATs 1 and 2 generated the corresponding dinucleotide at similar rates, whereas NMNAT3 exhibited a preference toward NMNH as substrate (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Synthesis of NADH from NMNH and ATP by human NMNATs. A, NMNH was obtained by cleavage of NADH using phosphodiesterase I followed by HPLC purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A chromatogram of the purified compound is shown. B, recombinant NMNAT3 was incubated in the presence of 125 μm NMNH and 500 μm ATP for 15 min. Nucleotides were separated from the protein by microfiltration (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then analyzed by HPLC. C, recombinant NMNAT3 was incubated in the presence of 125 μm NMN and 500 μm ATP. All other steps were exactly as for the sample in panel B. The two additional peaks (at about 9 and 12 min) detectable at 257 nm correspond to AMP and ADP and were minor contaminants of ATP. D, similar experiments as shown for NMNAT3 in panels B and C were also conducted with NMNATs 1 and 2. The generated NAD+ and NADH were quantified by peak integration, and the ratio of NAD+ and NADH produced was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although it has been realized that the synthesis as well as the concentration of NAD have critical impacts on a multitude of regulatory processes, mechanisms that regulate NAD synthesis are still unknown. We tested the influence of a variety of physiological intermediates (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, ADP, AMP, GTP, NADP+, NAADP+, ADP-ribose, poly-ADP-ribose) on the activity of the NMNAT isoforms (TABLE THREE).

https://openalex.org/W2006231275,"Development of therapeutic agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral infection using short interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors exemplifies a powerful new means to combat emerging infectious diseases. Potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS coronavirus (SCV) in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. Observations of SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence and lung histopathology and immunohistochemistry consistently showed siRNA-mediated anti-SARS efficacy by either prophylactic or therapeutic regimens. The siRNAs used provided relief from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage. The 10-40 mg/kg accumulated dosages of siRNA did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results suggest that a clinical investigation is warranted and illustrate the prospects for siRNA to enable a massive reduction in development time for new targeted therapeutic agents."

A number of histone methyltransferases (HMTases) with distinct functions have been identified.

Nucleosome, the bead-like unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotic cells, consists of DNA wound around a protein core made up of eight histone molecules. Covalent modifications of the N-terminal tails of the core histones have emerged as key regulatory mechanisms of gene expression (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 3Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These histone modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, create both synergistic and antagonistic signals that correlate with the transcriptional activity of a gene, through recruiting/dispelling some protein complexes or through changing the structure of chromatin to allow access for RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Moreover, these histone modifications and the consequent changes in chromatin structure may serve as an epigenetic marking system that is responsible for establishing and maintaining the heritable programs of gene expression during cellular differentiation and organism development (4Boggs B.A. Cheung P.

Methylations of histone lysine residues, with exception of H3 lysine 79, are catalyzed by a family of SET domain-containing proteins (6Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The SET domain is an evolutionarily conserved, ∼130-amino acid sequence motif. It was originally identified in members of polycomb group (PcG), trithorax group (trxG), and Su(var) genes and was named after the genes Su(var)3–9, Enhancer of zeste (E(z)) and trithorax (trx) (7Tschiersch B.

Independent studies indicated that the C-terminal region of the encoded protein interacts with Huntington disease (HD) protein huntingtin, and thus it was also named as huntingtin interacting protein B (HYPB), implying its roles in pathogenesis (24Faber P.W.

Furthermore, it contains several other important functional features such as auto-methylation activity, a novel transcriptional activation domain, and the hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II association. Our findings suggest that HYPB may serve as a linker between histone H3-K36 methylation and transcriptional regulation in mammals and provide useful implications for elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of HD. Plasmids—The HYPB cDNA was obtained from a cDNA library of CD34+ HSPCs as described previously (23Zhang Q.H. Ye M. Wu X.Y. Ren S.X. Zhao M. Zhao C.J. Fu G. Shen Y. Fan H.Y. Lu G. Zhong M. Xu X.R.

A 3′-segment was obtained from KIAA1732-pBluescript plasmid (gift from Dr. O. Ohara) (27Nagase T. Kikuno R. Hattori A. Kondo Y. Okumura K. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For HMTase activity assays and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, fragments of HYPB cDNA were subcloned into pGEX-5X1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to create the N-terminal GST-tagged HYPB bacterial expression plasmids. A fragment of human MLL cDNA was PCR-amplified from HL60 cells and cloned into pGEX-5X1 vector. For transactivation assays, fragments of HYPB cDNA were subcloned into pBIND vector (Promega) to create CMV-driven Gal4-tagged HYPB mammalian expression plasmids. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, a fragment of HYPB cDNA was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV4 vector (Sigma) to create a CMV-driven FLAG-tagged HYPB mammalian expression plasmid. All PCR-amplified products described above were confirmed by sequencing. The arginine 1122-to-histidine mutant of HYPB, the lysine 36-to-arginine mutant of H3, and the WW domain-deleted HYPB construct were created with bridge-PCR mutagenesis strategy.

Bacterial Protein Expression—Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacture's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining of SDS-PAGE gel. Beads-bound fusion proteins were used for in vitro HMTase activity assays, GST-pull down assays, or store at –80 °C. HMTase Activity Assays—The in vitro HMTase activity assay was performed as described previously (28Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 30-μl reaction system containing histone substrates, enzymes, 200 μCi of S-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]-l-methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in HMTase activity buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 250 mm sucrose) was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Different histone substrates, including core histones (Roche Applied Science), nucleosomes purified from micrococcal nuclease-digested HEK293 cell nuclei (29Mizzen C.A. Brownell J.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 675-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Fang J. Wang H. Zhang Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), or recombinant N terminus of H3, were used, respectively. The reaction products were separated by NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen) or SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Gels were dried, and detection of radiation was performed using Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection, SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used following the manufacture's protocol. Transactivation Assays—In 12-well plates, HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of a CMV-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid, 100 ng of pG5luc reporter plasmid (Promega), and 1 μg of Gal4-HYPB expression plasmids. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the lumat LB 9507 tube luminometer (Berthold), and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.48-17.51Google Scholar). Luciferase activity values were normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-HYPB, FLAG-STAT5A or Gal4-HYPB expression plasmids, respectively. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of mixture protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 20 mm NaF to inhibit phosphatases. For each immunoprecipitation, 400 μl of cell lysate were incubated with anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 5 h at 4°C. Then 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and rotated for 2 h at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins, 20 μl of anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) were added directly in the lysates and rotated for 2 h at 4°C. Bound immune complexes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Both the complexes and flow-throughs were analyzed by Western blotting. GST Pull-down Assays—HEK293 cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of mixture protease inhibitor and 20 mm NaF. GST pull-down assay was performed as described with minor modifications (32Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). In brief, GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were rinsed with RIPA buffer and incubated with the cell lysates for 3 h at 4°C.Thecomplexes were washed four times with buffer H (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerine, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.007% β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to Western blotting. Structural Features of HYPB Protein—To evaluate structural characteristics of HYPB protein and identify promising regions for experimental investigation, the protein sequence was subject to several sequence analysis programs. By using the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) server (33Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar), two remarkable conserved regions were identified: 1) a SET domain with the adjacent AWS (associate with SET) and PostSET domains (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, both the AWS and Post-SET domains are rich in cysteine, suggesting that the AWS-SET-Post-SET region may mediate an HMTase activity. 2) A WW domain located near the C terminus of HYPB protein (Fig. 1A). This domain is wide-spread in eukaryotic species and may mediate protein-protein interaction, especially interacting with proline-rich regions and SH3 motifs (34Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). SAPS (Statistical Analysis of Protein Sequences) program was then used to evaluate other sequence properties of HYPB protein, including compositional extremes, clusters and runs of charge and other amino acid types, and repetitive structures, etc. (35Brendel V. Bucher P. Nourbakhsh I.R. Blaisdell B.E. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As a result, a significantly low charged region (residues 1634–1863) was identified (Fig. 1A). This region includes 230 amino acids, 220 of which are uncharged. Within the charged amino acids, there are 9 negatively charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) and only 1 positively charged amino acid (Lys). Thus, this region displays high net negative charge and therefore is indicated with “0/–”. Furthermore, this region is significantly rich in glutamine and proline (14.3 and 16.5%, respectively). It has been known that long uncharged segments are frequent in the zinc finger-containing proteins and also occur in a number of other transcription factors (36Brendel V. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5698-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and net negative charge is one of the most common characteristics observed among transcriptional activation domains (37Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 38Abedi M. Caponigro G. Shen J. Hansen S. Sandrock T. Kamb A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Taken together, these remarkable features suggest that the low charged region of HYPB protein is likely to carry biologically significant function. A BLAST search against public protein databases reveals that HYPB shares significant similarity with SET2 protein, a well defined Saccharomyces cerevisiae H3-K36 HMTase (39Strahl B.D. Grant P.A.

Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Both HYPB and SET2 contain the AWS-SET-PostSET region and the WW domain, while SET2 lacks the low charged region. To further determine the similarities between HYPB and SET2 proteins, we performed a sequence alignment using FASTA program (46Pearson W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, HYPB and SET2 display 45.7 and 29.0% identities in the AWS-SET-PostSET region and the WW domain, respectively. Furthermore, the C terminus of HYPB shares 24.8% identity with the corresponding region of SET2, which is separate from the WW domain. Taken together, these data suggest that HYPB and SET2 may be functional homologue and that the regions of high similarities may define functionally important domains within these proteins. HYPB Protein Possesses SET Domain-dependent HMTase Activity— Within the SET domain, an H(R)ϕϕNHSC motif (where ϕ indicates a hydrophobic residue) has previously been shown to be an important catalytic site. For SUV39H1 protein, a histidine-to-arginine mutation of the first histidine (His320) in the 320HϕϕNHSC326 motif resulted in a 20-fold higher catalytic activity (8Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the H(R)ϕϕNHSC motif is correlated with the HMTase activity. Notably, HYPB protein contains a 1122RϕϕNHSC1128 motif (Fig. 2A, boxed), implying that it may possess an HMTase activity. In vitro HMTase activity assay was performed to determine the potential HMTase activity of HYPB. A fragment of HYPB protein (residues 915–1211) fused with GST was used as enzyme and core histone as substrate. GST-SUV39H1 (residues 82–412), GST-MLL (residues 3745–3966), and GST-mG9a (residues 621–1000) were used as positive controls. Results indicate that GST-HYPB, as well as GST-SUV39H1 and GST-mG9a, possess HMTase activity that transferring 14C-labeled methyl group onto histone H3 (Fig. 2B, left). Furthermore, recombinant N terminus of H3 (residues 1–47; Fig. 2B, right) and nucleosomes purified from HEK293 cells (Fig. 2C) are also methylated by GST-HYPB. It is interesting that HYPB displays higher activity of methylating nucleosomes than that of methylating purified histones, suggesting that the native nucleosome structure may effectively promote the HMTase activity of HYPB protein. Notably, GST-MLL does not exhibit detectable HMTase activity in these experiments, which is consistent with the previous hypothesis that the HMTase activity requires the combination of the SET domain with adjacent cysteine-rich regions (8Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar), although weak HMTase activity of MLL protein had been observed in certain context (47Nakamura T. Mori T. Tada S. Krajewski W.

Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, significant radiation signals located at the position of the GST-HYPB protein are detected (Fig. 2B, top panels, Enzymes), and they are much stronger than the nonspecific signals (asterisk), suggesting that the HYPB enzyme is methylated in these experiments. To further determine whether histone is required for this process of auto-methylation, we examined the auto-methylation activity in the presence or absence of core histone or GST, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2D, the auto-methylation signal of HYPB protein is consistently detected (top panel, HYPB), indicating that the auto-methylation of HYPB protein is independent of the existence of histone. To further investigate the contribution of 1122RϕϕNHSC1128 motif to the HYPB HMTase activity, we created a mutant in which the arginine 1122 was replaced with histidine (Fig. 2A, arrow) and then examined the changes of the activities. As a result, both the HMTase activity and auto-methylation activity were significantly impaired by this mutation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the methyltransferase activities of HYPB protein modifying both histone and itself are SET domain-dependent, and the arginine 1122 is necessary for these activities. HYPB Protein Selectively Methylates H3-Lysine 36—We next investigated the site specificity of H3 methylation by HYPB protein. A series of recombinant GST-tagged mouse histone H3 (residues 1–47) proteins with several lysine-to-arginine substitutions were used as substrates. As summarized in Fig. 3A, H3N is a wild-type mouse H3 fused with an N-terminal GST. N4, N9, and N27 are double lysine-to-arginine mutants as indicated (28Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). K36R is a mutant in which lysine 36 is replaced with arginine. The previously defined HMTase mG9a, which exhibits selectivity to lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3, was used as a positive control. As indicated by Fig. 3B, only K36R fails to be methylated by GST-HYPB protein (Fig. 3B, lane 10), while the wild-type H3 (H3N) and the other lysine-to-arginine mutants (N4, N9, and N27) can be methylated (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–9). In contrast, GST-mG9a can methylate these substrates except N4 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–5). These results indicate that HYPB protein possesses the specificity for methylating lysine 36 of H3. The Low Charged Region of HYPB Protein Is Evolutionarily Conserved in Vertebrates and Shows Transcriptional Activation Activity—The fact that the low-charged region of HYPB protein displays significant structural features promoted us to investigate the biological function of this region. Generally, functional sequences are subject to evolutionary selection; the purifying (negative) selection causes the functional sequences change more slowly than the bulk, nonfunctional sequences (49Miller W. Makova K.D. Nekrutenko A. Hardison R.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2004; 5: 15-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore we initially investigated the evolutionary conservation of the structural features of this low-charged region. By using the SAPS program, we found similar low charged regions, immediately followed by the WW domains, in the putative homologues of other five vertebrates, namely Rattus norvegicus (Rn), Mus musculus (Mm), Gallus gallus (Gg), Tetraodon nigroviridis (Tn), and Fugu rubripes (Fr). The low charged region of human HYPB protein share 92, 90, 73, and 42% amino acid identities to its homologues of rat, mouse, chicken, and fish, respectively. We aligned these sequences and compared their charge distribution and amino acid composition, taking reference from the average amino acid frequencies of Swiss-Prot data base (supplemental Fig. 1). The comparisons led to the following observations: 1) all these sequences are rich in uncharged amino acids (>95%; the average frequency in Swiss-Prot is ∼77%), 2) they display high ratio of negatively charged amino acids to positively charged ones (≥3.5:1; the average ratio in Swiss-Prot is 1.06:1), and 3) they are rich in glutamine and proline (≥14.30 and ≥11.90%; the average frequencies in Swiss-Prot are 3.94 and 4.83%, respectively). Thus, statistically, the structural features in the low charged region of HYPB protein are conserved in vertebrates. To investigate whether the low charged region of HYPB protein could function as a transcriptional regulatory domain, different regions of HYPB protein fused with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Gal4 protein were examined for their effects on a Gal4 recognition sites-driven luciferase reporter gene (5Gal4-luc; Fig. 4A).

Therefore, E-cadherin is an important tumor-suppressor gene. To understand how E-cadherin gene expression is regulated in cancer cells, we have used E-cadherin-positive and -negative expressing cells to find out the possible up- or downregulating transcription factors in human E-cadherin regulatory sequences. Functional analysis of human E-cadherin regulatory sequences constructs indicated that AML1, Sp1, and p300 may play important roles in promoting E-cadherin expression. In addition, we found there are four HNF3-binding sites in human E-cadherin regulatory sequences. The exogenous HNF3 can enhance the E-cadherin promoter activity in metastatic breast cancer cells and the metastatic breast cancer cells stably transfected with HNF3 showed re-expression of E-cadherin. The HNF3 stable transfectants changed from mesenchymal-like into epithelial morphology. The transwell assays showed the re-expressed E-cadherin reduced cell motility of metastatic breast cancer cells. These results suggested HNF3 may play important roles in the upregulation of the E-cadherin promoter, with the consequent re-expression of E-cadherin, thus reducing the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. These findings suggested HNF3 plays important roles in the upregulation of the E-cadherin gene and may be able to reduce the motility of metastatic breast cancer cells."

Cell. 2004; 96: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that PrPC is proteolytically shed from the cell surface by a zinc metalloprotease that has similar properties to the α-secretase cleavage of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (26Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11170-11178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of these proteolytic cleavages and of the fragments generated is critical to a full understanding of the biological functions of PrP and may also impact on the role of the protein in prion diseases. However, the role of the β-cleavage in the function of PrPC has not been addressed. In the current study, we show that PrP expressed in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line undergoes both α- and β-cleavage and that β-cleavage is increased upon exposure of the cells to ROS, occurs at the cell surface, and can be inhibited by a free radical quencher. We also show that β-cleavage does not occur in a mutant of PrP that lacks the octapeptide repeats (PrPΔoct) nor in two disease-associated mutants of PrP (PG14 and A116V). This lack of β-cleavage of the PrP mutants correlates with the sensitivity of cells to ROS, indicating that this cleavage event may be part of the mechanism by which PrPC protects cells against oxidative stress. cDNA Constructs and Cell Culture—The construction of wtPrP, PrPΔoct, and PG14 in pIRESneo has been described previously (12Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A116V was generated from wtPrP using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers: sense, 5′-CAGGGGCTGCGGTAGCTGGGGGCAGTAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTACTGCCCCAGCTACCGCAGCCCCTG-3′. The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured and transfected by electroporation, and pooled, stable cell lines were obtained by antibiotic selection as described previously (27Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Copper was routinely administered to the cells as CuSO4 in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) to provide a source of both albumin and histidine for the Cu2+ to complex to. When the cells had reached confluence, the monolayer was washed twice with Opti-MEM before incubation with the relevant compounds for the specified periods of exposure in Opti-MEM. Cells were harvested into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture). The protein content of each lysate was determined using bicinchoninic acid in a microtiter plate assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells at confluence were incubated for1hat4°C with 0.5 mg/ml Biotin sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS), washed three times with 50 mm glycine to quench the biotinylation reaction, and then incubated for various times at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm CuSO4 and 100 μm H2O2 in Opti-MEM. Cell lysates were made 1% (w/v) with respect to N-lauroylsarcosine and incubated for 30 min with 0.5% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose. The protein A-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1% (v/v) 3F4 antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added to 0.5% (w/v), and incubation continued for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The remaining pellet was resuspended in dissociation buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To measure copper-induced endocytosis, biotin-labeled cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 μm CuSO4 presented as a histidine chelate. PrP remaining at the cell surface was removed by digestion with trypsin as previously described (12Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. Curr.

Enzymic Deglycosylation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—Samples were deglycosylated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Europa Bioproducts, Ely, UK) for 16 h at 37 °C as described previously (27Walmsley A.R.

Samples (containing 15 μg of total protein) or immunoprecipitates were resolved by electrophoresis through 14.5% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, resolved proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked by incubation for 1 h with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) dried milk powder. Incubations with primary antibodies 3F4 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA), SAF32 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), 6H4 (Prionics, Zurich, Switzerland), or anti-actin and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were performed for1hinthesame buffer. Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was performed for1hinPBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Bound peroxidase conjugates were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences).

The data wereexpressedasthepercentageinhibitionofactivitycomparedwiththeuninhibited control. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto coverslips and grown to 50% confluence. The fate of cell surface PrPC was monitored by prelabeling cells with antibody 3F4 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated in Dulbecco's PBS in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min and blocked overnight in PBS containing 3% (v/v) goat serum. Finally, coverslips were incubated with AlexaFluor 488® rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h and mounted on slides using fluoromount G mounting medium (SouthernBiotech). Individual cells were visualized using a DeltaVision Optical Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision Inc.). Data were collected from 30–40 0.1-μm-thick optical sections, and three-dimensional data sets were deconvolved using the softWoRx program (Applied Precision Inc.). The images represent individual Z-slices corresponding to the middle of the cell. Assessment of Cell Number by Hoescht 33342 Staining—Cells (1 × 104/well) in 96-well tissue culture plates were cultured overnight in serum-free medium. After 24 h, this was replaced with 5% FCS-containing medium supplemented with H2O2 (100 μm), CuSO4 (8 μm), or both reagents. After a further 48 h, the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 5 min, and the adherent cell monolayers were stained with the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoescht 33342 (8.8 μm). Once dry, the fluorescence of each well was measured on a Synergy HT (Bio-Tek) (350-nm excitation and 450-nm emission wavelengths) in order to determine the cell number in each well. Measurement of Intracellular Oxidative Activity and Glutathione Peroxidase Activity—The level of intracellular free radicals was determined following exposure of the cells to H2O2 (100 μm), CuSO4 (8 μm), or both reagents in 5% FCS-containing medium for 6 h using 100 μm dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate as described previously (17Zeng F. Watt N.T. Walmsley A.R. Hooper N.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured using 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 mm glutathione, and 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase at room temperature upon the addition of 0.1 ml of cumene hydroperoxide (1.5 mm) as described previously (17Zeng F. Watt N.T. Walmsley A.R. Hooper N.M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All analyses were subject to Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of variance. p < 0.001 were considered highly significant. Changes in cell number, intracellular radical generation, and glutathione peroxidase activity in the cells expressing the mutant PrPs are all compared against wtPrP-expressing cells. PrPC in SH-SY5Y Cells Is Subject to α- and β-Cleavages—The proteolytic processing of murine PrPC containing the 3F4 epitope (wtPrP) stably expressed in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was examined using antibodies that recognize different epitopes in the protein (Fig. 1). To remove the problems of interpreting the immunoblots because of the variable glycosylation states of full-length PrP and of the C-terminal fragments, samples were deglycosylated prior to immunoblotting. Antibody SAF32, which recognizes an epitope within the octapeptide repeats, as expected detected full-length PrP but neither the C1 nor C2 fragments in the cell lysate (Fig. 1B). Antibody 3F4, which recognizes the engineered epitope MHKM (residues 108–111 of murine PrP), detected both full-length PrP and the C2 fragment of molecular mass 21 kDa but not the C1 fragment, since α-cleavage destroys the epitope recognized by this antibody (Fig. 1C) (20Chen S.G.

Antibody 6H4, which recognizes an epitope in the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 144–152), detected full-length PrP, C2, and the C1 fragment of molecular mass 17 kDa (Fig. 1D). Although the C1 fragment was detected at a similar level of intensity as full-length PrP, the C2 fragment was present at a significantly lower level. These data indicate that in SH-SY5Y cells PrPC is subject to both α- and β-proteolytic cleavages to generate C1 and C2 fragments, respectively, as reported for other cell lines and in brain tissue (19Shyng S.-L.

Cell. 2004; 96: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). β-Cleavage of PrPC Is Up-regulated When Cells Are Subjected to Oxidative Stress—Since there is some evidence to suggest that β-cleavage of PrPC is mediated by ROS (25McMahon H.E. Mange A. Nishida N. Creminon C. Casanova D. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2286-2291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of H2O2 and Cu2+ on the formation of the C2 fragment (Fig. 2). Changing the cell medium from serum-containing to serum-free Opti-MEM caused an increase in the production of C2 (Fig. 2, A and D) due to the removal of survival factors on withdrawal of the serum from the medium (15Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm H2O2 and 10 μm Cu2+, there was a further increase in the level of C2 above that observed in the serum-free medium-treated cells within 10 min (Fig. 2, A and D). In contrast to the changes in C2, the levels of neither full-length PrP (Fig. 2, B and E) nor the C1 fragment (Fig. 2, B and F) altered with the removal of serum or upon treatment of the cells with H2O2 and Cu2+. These observations indicate that ROS increased the production of C2 via β-cleavage but had no effect on α-cleavage. To confirm that β-cleavage of PrPC is indeed a ROS-mediated event, the effect of the hydroxyl radical quencher Me2SO was examined (Fig. 3). When cells expressing wtPrP were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM in the presence of Me2SO, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the production of C2 (Fig. 3, A and C), consistent with β-cleavage being a ROS-mediated process.FIGURE 3Formation of C2 is blocked by the hydroxyl radical scavenger Me2SO. SH-SY5Y cells expressing wtPrP were exposed to various concentrations of Me2SO for 5 h in Opti-MEM. Samples (15 μg of total protein) were digested with PNGase F before immunoblot analysis with antibody 3F4 (A) or an anti-actin antibody (B). C, multiple immunoblots were analyzed by densitometry and expressed as mean pixel intensity for the C2 fragment (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ROS-mediated β-Cleavage of PrPC Occurs at the Cell Surface—To determine whether cell surface PrPC was subject to ROS-mediated β-cleavage, cells expressing wtPrP were first surface-biotinylated prior to treatment with 100 μm H2O2 and 10 μm Cu2+ (Fig. 4). Following immunoprecipitation of PrP with antibody 3F4, biotinylated full-length PrP and C2 were visualized by immunoblotting with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Immediately following biotinylation, negligible biotinylated C2 was detected in the cell lysate, although significant amounts of biotinylated full-length PrP were present. However, an increase in the level of biotinylated C2 fragment was clearly evident following incubation of the cells in serum-free Opti-MEM for 10 min, and this was further increased upon treatment of the cells with H2O2 and Cu2+, indicating that C2 is formed from PrPC exposed at the cell surface. The Octapeptide Repeats Are Required for the ROS-mediated β-Cleavage of PrPC—To determine whether ROS-mediated β-cleavage of PrPC required the octapeptide repeats, we examined the proteolytic processing of PrPΔoct that lacks the copper-binding octapeptide repeat region (12Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Lysates from cells expressing PrPΔoct were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies SAF32, 3F4, and 6H4 (Fig. 5, B–D). SAF32 failed to detect PrPΔoct, since this mutant lacks the epitope for this antibody but was detected by 3F4 and 6H4. Although antibody 6H4 clearly detected the C1 fragment in cells expressing PrPΔoct, neither antibody 6H4 nor 3F4 detected the C2 fragment. These data indicate that the octapeptide repeats are required for PrPC to undergo β-cleavage. ROS-mediated β-Cleavage Is Defective in Two Disease-associated Mutants of PrP—We examined next the proteolytic processing of two disease-associated mutants of PrP. PG14 contains an extra nine copies of the octapeptide repeat and is associated with familial human prion disease (29Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. McCombie W.R. Goldgaber D. Swergold G.D. Wills P.R.

Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Lysates from cells expressing the two mutants were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies SAF32, 3F4, and 6H4 (Fig. 5, B–D). Although in cells expressing either PG14 or A116V, all three antibodies detected full-length protein, and 6H4 detected the C1 fragment, there was no detection of the C2 fragment in either cell line by antibody 3F4 or 6H4 even after prolonged exposure of the immunoblots (Fig. 5, B and D). Even upon treatment of the cells expressing PG14 or A116V with H2O2 and Cu2+ for up to 60 min, there was no evidence for the production of C2, whereas under identical conditions, C2 was clearly formed in cells expressing wtPrP (data not shown). These data indicate that in cells expressing two disease-associated mutants of PrP, although C1 is formed normally, C2 is not formed upon exposure of the cells to ROS. One possible explanation for the lack of ROS-mediated β-cleavage in cells expressing either PG14 or A116V is that the mutants fail to traffic to the cell surface where this processing occurs. Previously, however, we (12Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and others (32Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have shown by surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence microscopy that PG14 is localized at the cell surface. Although the A116V mutant is expressed at a lower level than wtPrP in the SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 6A), the amount of this mutant at the cell surface as revealed by surface biotinylation was very similar to that of wtPrP (Fig. 6B). The cell surface localization of A116V was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6C). Like wtPrP, the A116V construct gave a similar pattern of cell surface staining, which could be abolished by incubation of the cells with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which cleaves the GPI anchor, releasing the protein from the membrane. Since neither the PrPΔoct nor the PG14 mutants are endocytosed when cells are exposed to Cu2+ ions (12Perera W.S.S. Hooper N.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we considered that the lack of β-cleavage may correlate with a deficiency in copper-mediated endocytosis. However, when cells expressing A116V were exposed to a concentration of Cu2+ ions sufficient to promote endocyt"

We show that CaMKIIα is associated with the CaMKII-binding proteins densin-180, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit, and α-actinin in postsynaptic density-enriched rat brain fractions. Residues 819-894 within the C-terminal domain of α-actinin-2 constitute the minimal CaMKII-binding domain. Similar amounts of Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα holoenzyme [P-T286]CaMKII bind to α-actinin-2 as bind to NR2B (residues 1260-1339) or to densin-180 (residues 1247-1495) in glutathione-agarose cosedimentation assays, even though the CaMKII-binding domains share no amino acid sequence similarity. Like NR2B, α-actinin-2 binds to representative splice variants of each CaMKII gene (α, β, γ, and δ), whereas densin-180 binds selectively to CaMKIIα. In addition, C-terminal truncated CaMKIIα monomers can interact with NR2B and α-actinin-2, but not with densin-180. Soluble α-actinin-2 does not compete for [P-T286]CaMKII binding to immobilized densin-180 or NR2B. However, soluble densin-180, but not soluble NR2B, increases CaMKII binding to immobilized α-actinin-2 by ≈10-fold in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. A His6-tagged NR2B fragment associates with GST-densin or GST-actinin but only in the presence of [P-T286]CaMKII. Similarly, His6-tagged densin-180 or α-actinin fragments associate with GST-NR2B in a [P-T286]CaMKII-dependent manner. In addition, GST-NR2B and His6-tagged α-actinin can bind simultaneously to monomeric CaMKII subunits. In combination, these data support a model in which [P-T286]CaMKIIα can simultaneously interact with multiple dendritic spine proteins, possibly stabilizing the synaptic localization of CaMKII and/or nucleating a multiprotein synaptic signaling complex.

Alternative splicing of the four CaMKII genes (α, β, γ, and δ) gives rise to ∼30 known mRNA/protein products. CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ predominate in the brain and are involved in normal regulation of synaptic transmission (1Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr286 (numbered as in CaMKIIα) enhances the affinity for calcium/calmodulin and confers autonomous (calcium-independent) activity after calmodulin dissociates. Consequently, CaMKII is capable of integrating information conveyed by the amplitude, frequency, and duration of local calcium transients to which it is exposed. Autophosphorylation at Thr305/306 occurs only in the absence of bound calcium/calmodulin and blocks subsequent calmodulin binding (reviewed in Ref. 5Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev.

The specificity of changes in synaptic responses to their dedicated inputs implies that postsynaptic actions of CaMKII, such as modulation of the trafficking and activity of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, are exquisitely regulated in a spatial and temporal manner (7Griffith L.C.

To specifically address this issue, it is critical to have a thorough understanding of the molecular bases for these interactions and the factors regulating complex formation. Prior studies have identified dissimilar high affinity CaMKII-binding domains in the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and in densin-180. These interactions are differentially regulated by calcium/calmodulin-binding, autophosphorylation at Thr286, and phosphorylation of the binding proteins (10Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol.

Here, we report an initial molecular dissection of the CaMKII-binding domain in α-actinin-2 and explore the relationship of this interaction to CaMKII binding with densin-180 and NR2B. The data indicate that CaMKII itself may serve as a structural scaffold for the assembly of a postsynaptic signalosome. Antibodies—Western blotting was performed with mouse anti-CaMKIIα (Affinity Bioreagents), mouse anti-α-actinin (Sigma) antibodies, or mouse anti-NR2B (BD Transduction Laboratories). The goat anti-CaMKII antiserum was described previously (25McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-densin-180 serum was raised against a GST fusion protein including residues 1247-1290 and 1378-1412 of densin-180. Goat anti-densin-180 serum was generated by co-injection of peptides corresponding residues 451-470 and 652-671 of densin-180. A detailed characterization of the densin antibodies will be published separately. 3Y. Jiao, A. J. Robison, Y, Nikandrova, and R. J. Colbran, manuscript in preparation. Coimmunoprecipitation—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Forebrains were quickly removed and homogenized on ice in 0.32 m sucrose containing 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (Buffer 1, 8 ml per forebrain) using a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-glass device. All remaining steps were performed at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was removed and re-centrifuged (9,200 × g, 15 min). The 9,200 × g pellet was resuspended in Buffer 1 (8 ml per forebrain) and centrifuged again (10,200 × g, 15 min). The new pellet (crude synaptosomes) was resuspended in Buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm microcystin; 4 ml per forebrain), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was diluted in Buffer 2 to 2 mg/ml protein and used for immunoprecipitations using anti-CaMKII, anti-densin, or preimmune antibodies (5 μl of goat serum per 2 mg of protein) (see above). Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce, 25 μl) were added after 2 h, and the incubation continued overnight. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with Buffer 2 (1 ml each). Proteins were eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. GST- and His6-tagged Fusion Proteins—The α-actinin-2 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Beggs (Harvard). Desired fragments of α-actinin-2, NR2B, or densin-180 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) restriction enzyme sites as described (10Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 14Strack S. Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25061-25064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCR products were ligated into the pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) or pRSET-A (Qiagen) vectors and transformed into BL21-DE3 Gold Escherichia coli bacteria. After induction of protein expression, glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His6 fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) or His-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's protocol. His6-NR2B was solubilized and purified in the presence of 8 m urea; the urea was then removed by dialysis. GST-densin-(1247-1495) represents the entire C-terminal tail of the A splice variant; GST-densin-(1247-1405) represents the C-terminal tail of the A variant without the PDZ domain; and GST-densin-(1247-1542) represents the entire C-terminal tail of the D variant (14Strack S. Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25061-25064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GST-NR2B includes amino acids 1260-1339, with the point mutation S1303A (20Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). His6 fusion proteins were densin-(1247-1542), actinin-(547-894), and NR2B-(965-1339). Purified protein concentrations were determined using Bradford (Bio-Rad) or bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) assays. CaMKII Isoforms and Truncation Mutants—Murine CaMKIIα, Xenopus CaMKIIβ, porcine CaMKIIγB, and rat CaMKIIδ2 were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (25McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CaMKIIγB and CaMKIIδ2 cDNAs were generous gifts from Dr. C. M. Schworer in the laboratory of Dr. H. Singer (Albany Medical College, NY). The C-terminal truncation mutants of CaMKIIα-(1-420) and CaMKIIα-(1-380) were generated as described (20Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and were monomeric as determined by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). CaMKII Autophosphorylation—CaMKII isoforms were selectively autophosphorylated at Thr286/287, as described (25McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, kinase (5 μm subunit) was incubated on ice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm calmodulin, and 40 μm ATP. After 90 s, the reaction was stopped with EDTA (12.5 mm final). CaMKIIα-(1-420) and CaMKIIα-(1-380) were autophosphorylated using identical conditions, except that ATP was increased to 200 μm, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for 5 min. GST Cosedimentation Assays—Purified GST fusion proteins or GST alone (≈250 nm full-length protein) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with [P-T286]CaMKII or Thr287-autophosphorylated CaMKIIβ/γ/δ (≈250 nm) and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, 25 μl of packed resin) in pull-down (PD) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100; 500-μl final volume). Where indicated, His6-tagged fusion proteins (≈250 nm each) were included with the kinase. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed in 500 μl of PD Buffer 6 times for 5 min each. Beads were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes, and sedimented proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were stained using Ponceau S and digitally scanned to quantify protein loading using ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Pilot studies showed that pixel densities of individual protein bands are linearly related to the amount of protein loaded on the gel in the range of 0.04-2.5 μg per lane for both GST and CaMKIIα (0.7-42 pmol). Amounts of CaMKIIα sedimented on the beads were normalized to the recovered GST fusion protein, and background binding to GST alone was subtracted. Statistical comparisons (one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post-hoc tests) were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software). To confirm the identity of Ponceau-stained proteins, membranes were immunoblotted for CaMKII or His6-tagged proteins using affinity purified polyclonal goat anti-CaMKII primary antibodies (25McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or monoclonal mouse anti-His6 antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). CaMKII Overlay Assays—Nitrocellulose membranes containing immobilized GST fusion proteins (1-5 μg) were incubated with [32P-T286]CaMKII (50 nm subunit), washed and autoradiographed, essentially as described (25McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10043-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Where indicated, [32P-T286]CaMKII was incubated on ice for 30 min with soluble GST fusion proteins before addition to the membrane. Films exposed within the linear range were digitally scanned, and band intensities (determined using ImageJ) were normalized to GST protein loading (see above). Biotinylated Densin-180 Overlay—GST-densin (200 μg) was incubated at a 1:20 molar ratio with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Unconjugated biotin was removed by dialysis, and biotinylated protein was stored in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 0.1% Triton X-100 at -80 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes containing GST-actinin (5 μg) were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk powder in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and then incubated with 2 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) with or without biotinylated GST-densin-(1247-1542) (65 nm) in the same buffer. After washing in TTBS (5 times, 5 min each), bound alkaline phosphatase was detected colorimetrically. CaMKII Is Associated with Multiple CaMKII-binding Proteins in PSD-enriched Fractions—PSD-enriched synaptosomal fractions isolated from adult rat forebrain were enriched in CaMKII and three CaMKII-binding proteins, α-actinin, NR2B, and densin-180. About 50% of the CaMKIIα, but less than 20% of the CaMKAPs, were solubilized from the PSD-enriched fraction using Triton X-100. CaMKII immunoprecipitates from this solubilized extract also specifically contained α-actinin, densin-180, and occasionally NR2B (Fig. 1). Densin-180 immunoprecipitates also contained CaMKII and NR2B, but no detectable α-actinin (Fig. 1). These data confirm previous observations that CaMKII, α-actinin, NR2B, and densin-180 are enriched in PSDs. The effects of solubilization conditions and the differential regulation of each interaction 4A. J. Robison, R. K. Bartlett, M. A. Bass, and R. J. Colbran, submitted for publication. preclude definitive conclusions about the nature of specific protein-protein interactions in PSDs. However, the data are consistent with the existence of multiprotein complexes containing CaMKII in vivo. The CaMKII-binding Region of α-Actinin-2—The α-actinin isoforms are inverted dimers in the native state, containing N-terminal actin-binding domains, four spectrin repeats, and two putative C-terminal EF hand domains (Fig. 2A) (27Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 703-800PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether α-actinin-2 binds directly to CaMKII and to delineate the CaMKII-binding domain, GST fusion proteins containing various portions of the C-terminal domain of α-actinin-2 were used in co-sedimentation assays. GST-actinin-(547-894) effectively bound Thr286-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα ([P-T286]CaMKII) with similar efficacy to the GST-densin-(1247-1542) control (Fig. 2B and also see Fig. 3). Similar amounts of non-phosphorylated CaMKIIα and [P-T286]CaMKII associated with GST-actinin-(547-894) under these conditions. 4A. J. Robison, R. K. Bartlett, M. A. Bass, and R. J. Colbran, submitted for publication. Truncation of 80 amino acids from the C terminus (GST-actinin-(547-814)) reduced CaMKII binding to the very low nonspecific levels detected with GST alone. Moreover, C-terminal fragments (GST-actinin-(809-894) and GST-actinin-(819-894)) bound similar amounts of [P-T286]CaMKII as did GST-actinin-(547-894). Interestingly, the CaMKII-binding C-terminal domain (75 amino acids) displays 70% amino acid sequence identity (84% similarity) across three α-actinin isoforms that interact with CaMKII (15Walikonis R.S. Oguni A. Khorosheva E.M. Jeng C.J. Asuncion F.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 423-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dhavan R. Greer P.L. Morabito M.A. Orlando L.R. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7879-7891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Deletion of the more highly conserved extreme N- or C-terminal regions within this domain to yield GST-actinin-(839-894) or GST-actinin-(819-885) abrogates CaMKII binding (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, determinants for [P-T286]CaMKII interactions with α-actinin-2 appear to be distributed within a minimal functional binding domain of residues 819-894.FIGURE 3CaMKII isoform binding to α-actinin-2, NR2B, and densin-180: role of the C-terminal association domain. A, Thr286/287-autophosphorylated CaMKIIα (wild type (WT) or C-terminal truncated), CaMKIIβ, CaMKIIγB, or CaMKIIδ2 were incubated with GST, GST-densin-(1247-1495), GST-NR2B, or GST-actinin-(819-894). The top panel shows a Ponceau stained gel of the GST fusion protein preparations used in these experiments. The lower panels show CaMKII immunoblots of proteins isolated on glutathione-agarose (P: 40% of total pellet) and the soluble proteins remaining in the supernatant (S: 2% of total).

Comparable amounts of [P-T286]CaMKII bound to GST-actinin-(547-894), GST-NR2B, or GST-densin-(1247-1542) (Fig. 3, A and C). The ratio of binding of CaMKII to GST-densin-(1247-1542) and to GST-actinin-(547-894) was 0.9 ± 0.1 and 0.8 ± 0.2, respectively, when normalized to NR2B (Fig. 3C). However, in gel overlay assays, [32P-T286]CaMKII bound to GST-actinin-(547-894) very weakly when compared with the strong binding to GST-NR2B and GST-densin-(1247-1542) (Fig. 3). In fact, binding of [32P-T286]CaMKII to immobilized GST-actinin-(547-894) was not consistently above the very weak nonspecific interaction with GST alone (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that, unlike NR2B and densin-180, the CaMKII-binding domain of α-actinin-2 is unable to refold into a binding-competent conformation on the membrane. CaMKII Isoform Selectivity—Proteins encoded by the four CaMKII genes are highly similar within their N-terminal catalytic and regulatory domains (89-93% amino acid sequence identity) but are more divergent in the C-terminal association domains (53-89% amino acid sequence identity) (28Tobimatsu T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17907-17912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Representative splice variants of each gene were autophosphorylated at Thr286 (CaMKIIα) or at Thr287 (CaMKIIβ/γB/δ2) and then used in glutathione-agarose cosedimentation assays. The four CaMKII isoforms bound with similar efficacy to GST-NR2B and GST-actinin-(819-894). In contrast, GST-densin-(1247-1495) selectively interacted with CaMKIIα (Fig. 3); binding of CaMKIIβ and CaMKIIγB was reduced ∼13-fold relative to binding of CaMKIIα. Although GST-densin-(1247-1495) appeared similarly ineffective in binding CaMKIIδ2 by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A), this could not be quantitated from the Ponceau-stained membrane, because CaMKIIδ2 and GST-densin-(1247-1495) co-migrate on the gel. Role of the C-terminal Association Domain of CaMKIIα—The role of the C-terminal domain in binding to each of the CaMKAPs was investigated using CaMKIIα truncations at either residue 420 or residue 380. Both proteins are monomeric but can be Thr286-autophosphorylated to a similar extent as the wild type kinase using modified reaction conditions, as assessed by immunoblotting using phospho-Thr286-specific antibodies and by the generation"
https://openalex.org/W1976709850,"FTY720 is a novel immunomodulatory agent that inhibits lymphocyte trafficking and prevents allograft rejection. FTY720 is phosphorylated in vivo, and the phosphorylated drug acts as agonist for a family of G protein-coupled receptors that recognize sphingosine 1-phosphate. Evidence suggests that FTY720-phosphate-induced activation of S1P1 is responsible for its mechanism of action. FTY720 was rationally designed by modification of myriocin, a naturally occurring sphingoid base analog that causes immunosuppression by interrupting sphingolipid metabolism. In this study, we examined interactions between FTY720, FTY720-phosphate, and sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, the enzyme responsible for irreversible sphingosine 1-phosphate degradation. FTY720-phosphate was stable in the presence of active sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, demonstrating that the lyase does not contribute to FTY720 catabolism. Conversely, FTY720 inhibited sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity in vitro. Treatment of mice with FTY720 inhibited tissue sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity within 12 h, whereas lyase gene and protein expression were not significantly affected. Tissue sphingosine 1-phosphate levels remained stable or increased throughout treatment. These studies raise the possibility that disruption of sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolism may account for some effects of FTY720 on immune function and that sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase may be a potential target for immunomodulatory therapy.

Importantly, while FTY720 prevents the migration of lymphocytes to allogeneic graft tissue and other sites of inflammation, it does not diminish the activation, proliferation, or effector functions of B and T lymphocytes in response to antigen stimulation (13Pinschewer D.

Genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that interactions between FTY720 and the S1P1 receptor are primarily responsible for the effect of the drug on lymphocytes (5Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). While FTY720-P was first recognized as an S1P1 receptor agonist, exposure to the drug also results in receptor internalization and down-regulation on the surface of lymphocytes. This latter effect is thought to be the major mechanism of action, since reconstitution of mice with hematopoietic progenitors or lymphocytes lacking S1P1 expression emulates the effects of FTY720 treatment on lymphocyte egress and trafficking (17Allende M.L. Dreier J.L. Mandala S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15396-15401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Graler M.H. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that FTY720 might interact not only with sphingoid base phosphate receptors but also with enzymes involved in sphingoid base metabolism. Such enzymes might affect FTY720 or FTY720-P catabolism and pharmacokinetics. Conversely, FTY720 or FTY720-P might influence key enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism and thereby contribute to the mechanism of drug action and its pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Intracellular S1P levels are regulated by its synthesis from sphingosine by SK and its catabolism by lipid phosphatases and by SPL, a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for the irreversible degradation of S1P to ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal (19Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored interactions between FTY720, FTY720-P, and SPL. FTY720-P was stable for prolonged periods in the presence of highly active SPL, suggesting that SPL is not responsible for metabolism of the drug. Conversely, FTY720 inhibited SPL activity in vitro, and treatment of mice with clinically relevant doses of FTY720 inhibited SPL activity in thymic extracts within 12 h of drug administration, concomitant with the onset of lymphopenia. In contrast, no appreciable effect on SPL expression was observed. These studies raise the possibility that disruption of S1P metabolism may be partly responsible for the effects of FTY720 on immune function and that SPL may be a potential target for immunomodulatory therapy. Materials—FTY720 and FTY720-P were kindly provided by Volker Brinkmann of Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). The human SPL adenoviral expression system was kindly provided by Timothy Hla (University of Connecticut Health Center). C17 and C18 sphingosines, Pso, and S1Ps were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [4,5-3H]d-erythro-DHS1-P was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals including 1-butanol and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma. FTY720-P Metabolism—Whole cell extracts of HEK293 cells expressing human SPL via an adenoviral expression system were prepared as described previously (20Reiss U. Oskouian B. Zhou J. Gupta V. Sooriyakumaran P. Kelly S. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Saba J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1281-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These extracts contain ∼1430 pmol/mg of protein/min of SPL activity, based upon activity against DHS1-P substrate. HEK293 cells expressing GFP via the adenoviral expression system were employed as controls. Twenty nmol of FTY720-P were suspended in SPL reaction buffer (21Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 25 μl of whole cell extract plus 25μl of extraction buffer (0.5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 11% glycerol, 0.2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate) were added to initiate the reaction. At various time points, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.3 ml of concentrated HCl, 1 ml of 1 m KCl, and 1.5 ml of chloroform to the tube. The sample was mixed by vortexing and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. Organic phase was collected, dried down using a speed vac and resuspended in methanol. After derivatization with OPA, the sample was injected onto the HPLC for quantification. The HPLC analysis was conducted using a Beckman system Gold 125 solvent module with a Spectra-Physics SP8410 fluorescence detector and a C18 (2Brinkmann V. Yonsei Med. J. 2004; 45: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) Luna 3-μm, 75 × 4.6-mm column from Phenomenex (CA). The mobile phase was methanol:10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 m TBAP in water = 83:16:1, v/v/v, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The calculation of the FTY720-P in each sample was based on the integration of the peaks of interest. For comparison, 20 nmol of S1P were incubated with extracts from HEK293 cells overexpressing SPL or control HEK293 cells, and extraction of S1P was performed as for FTY720. Recovery of S1P was determined by HPLC quantitation, as described below for S1P measurements in mouse tissues. Confirmation of FTY720-P by LCMS—Samples corresponding to FTY720-P peak identified on HPLC were evaluated by LCMS to confirm FTY720-P by mass analysis. Twenty microliters of sample were injected into the LCMS, and mass spectrum scans from 300 to 500 m/z and specific ions m/z 388 and 410 were quantified for FTY720-P. A reverse phase C18 column from Phenomenex (2.1 mm × 15 cm) was used. Two mobile phases were used: solution A is water: methanol:acetic acid (69:30:1) containing 5 mm ammonium acetate, and solution B is methanol:acetic acid (99:1) containing 5 mm ammonium acetate. The program for those two mobile phases was started with 50% solutions A and B, continued for 2 min, and then solution B was increased to 100% in 6 min, continued for 5 min in 100% solution B, and finally solution B was decreased back to 50% in 2 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The retention time is 11.2 min. SPL Enzyme Assay—Tissues were homogenized by sonication in 9 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A and antipain). SPL assays were conducted using 100 μg of protein per assay and radioactive [4,5-3H]DHS1-P substrate, as described previously (20Reiss U. Oskouian B. Zhou J. Gupta V. Sooriyakumaran P. Kelly S. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Saba J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1281-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For in vitro enzyme assays, whole cell extracts were prepared from adenovirally infected HEK293 cells expressing SPL or GFP control and assayed as described above. For in vitro FTY720 and FTY720-P experiments, the drug was incubated with whole cell extracts prepared from HEK293 cells infected with an adenoviral vector expressing human SPL. The drug was incubated with extracts for 30 min, followed by addition of extracts to reaction buffer and substrate to initiate the reaction. Competition assays were performed using 100 μg of protein from thymic extracts of mice treated with 1 mg/kg body weight of FTY720 and euthanized at 24 h after drug administration. Assays were conducted using increasing concentrations of cold DHS1-P substrate, from 10–40 nmol. Drug Treatments and Leukocyte/Lymphocyte Counts—Four-week-old FVB mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were maintained in a pathogen-free facility in microisolator cages. A single dose of FTY720 at 1 mg/kg in sterile water was injected intraperitoneally at time 0. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at various time points post-injection, followed by tissue harvest. Blood counts were determined by Coulter and manual differential. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the approved Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. S1P Measurements—S1P was isolated by two-phase lipid extraction, derivatized with OPA, and quantitated by HPLC essentially as described (22Jiang Q. Wong J. Fyrst H. Saba J. Ames B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17825-17830Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Fyrst H. Herr D.R. Harris G.L. Saba J.D. J.

Biochem. 2000; 281: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All tissues were weighed prior to snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and were stored in –100 °C until processing. One nmol of PSo and PSo-P were added as internal standards before homogenization of tissues. Lipids were extracted with a 1-ml mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:2 ratio). Samples were incubated at room temperature with sonication for 3 h and then dried by SpeedVac. One ml of 0.1 n NaOH in methanol was added for 1 h at 37°C to achieve hydrolysis. After addition of 4 ml of chloroform and 4 ml of 1 m KCl, samples were mixed and phases separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was isolated and mixed with 0.3 ml of concentrated HCl and 6 ml of chloroform. The phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was collected and dried for S1P determination. All samples for S1P determination were re-dissolved in methanol. After derivation with OPA, samples were injected onto HPLC for quantification. The mobile phase was methanol:10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2:1 m TBAP in water = 83:16:1, v/v/v, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. SPL Expression—To evaluate the effect of FTY720 and FTY720-P on SPL gene expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing 7.8 kb of sequence upstream of the SPL ATG start codon. The transfected cells were treated for 24 h with 3 μm FTY720 or FTY720-P (the maximal dose at which no cytotoxicity was appreciated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay), at which time luciferase activity was determined, as described (25Oskouian B. Mendel J. Shocron E. Lee Jr., M.A. Fyrst H. Saba J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18403-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blotting of mouse tissue extracts was performed using a peptide affinity-purified polyclonal sera raised against the murine SPL C-terminal peptide: NH2-V-T-Q-G-N-Q-M-N-G-S-P-K-P-R-COOH. SPL Does Not Catabolize FTY720-P—FTY720 demonstrates a long elimination half-life after single dose administration (2Brinkmann V. Yonsei Med. J. 2004; 45: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Known routes of drug metabolism include conversion to FTY720-P by SK, and ω oxidation of the octyl side chain, followed by β oxidation. We were interested in determining whether FTY720 might function as a substrate for SPL, which recognizes phosphorylated long chain bases varying in chain length, hydroxylation, and saturation. To test this possibility, FTY720-P was incubated under standard SPL assay conditions with HEK293 cells demonstrating high levels of SPL activity by virtue of an adenoviral SPL expression system. Incubation proceeded for various lengths of time, after which FTY720-P was recovered by two-phase lipid extraction, derivatized with the fluorescent compound OPA, and quantitated by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1a, FTY720-P remained stable for up to 24 h in the presence of SPL. In contrast, S1P levels diminished under the same conditions in cells expressing high levels of SPL but not in control cells expressing GFP (Fig. 1b). S1P degradation correlated with an increase in SPL reaction products, as determined using a standard SPL assay (Fig. 1c). Our results indicate that, under these conditions, S1P is degraded in an SPL-dependent fashion, whereas FTY720-P does not serve as a substrate for SPL. Inhibition of SPL Activity by FTY720 in Vitro—We considered it likely that the structural features that allow FTY720 to be recognized by SK, FTY720-P to be recognized by S1P receptors, and both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the drug to be effectively translocated by long chain base transporters, as well as the access of FTY720 to intracellular compartments, would support interactions with other enzymes of long chain base metabolism (6Mandala S.

To evaluate whether either FTY720 or FTY720-P affect SPL activity, whole cell extracts were prepared from HEK293 cells expressing high levels of SPL and incubated with varying concentrations of FTY720 or FTY720-P. As shown in Fig. 2a, FTY720 inhibited SPL activity in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, with effects occurring at concentrations as low as 300 nm with maximal effects observed at 30 μm. In contrast, FTY720-P was inhibitory only at 30 μm and was not as potent as FTY720 at this dose (Fig. 2b). Although treatment with FTY720 is associated with low (nanomolar) circulating drug levels, local concentrations within cells and subcellular compartments may be considerably higher, since FTY720 is actively transported into cells by transporters that recognize long chain bases (9Honig S.M. Fu S. Mao X. Yopp A. Gunn M.D. Randolph G.J. Bromberg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SPL by FTY720 in Vivo—To determine whether SPL enzyme activity is influenced by FTY720 administration in vivo, 4-week-old female FVB mice were given 1 mg/kg FTY720 by intraperitoneal injection, and tissue SPL activity in thymus was assessed over time. As shown in Fig. 3a, inhibition of SPL was noted as early as 12 h after FTY720 treatment and peaked at 36 h, with a maximum inhibition of 40%. SPL inhibition occurred concomitant with lymphopenia (TABLE ONE) and was consistent with the timing of lymphopenia reported previously (4Chiba K. Yanagawa Y. Masubuchi Y. Kataoka H. Kawaguchi T. Ohtsuki M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5037-5044PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether the inhibition of SPL activity in homogenates of tissues isolated from FTY720 treated animals is a reversible phenomenon, tissue SPL activity was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of cold DHS1-P substrate. As shown in Fig. 3b, enzyme inhibition (21%) observed in tissues from animals treated with drug for 24 h was partially overcome (reduction to 14% inhibition) by a 2-fold increase in cold substrate, whereas the level of inhibition in the presence of 40 nmol of cold substrate (25%) was similar to that observed with 10 nmol of substrate (standard assay conditions). We conclude that the inhibition of SPL by FTY720 is at best partially reversed by competition with excess substrate under these conditions.TABLE ONELymphocyte counts after FTY720 treatmentTime in hoursLymphocytes (1000/μl)an = 4 animals per time point.S.D.07.710.96121.440.15243.230.14362.070.74482.830.26a n = 4 animals per time point.

Chem. 2005; 280: 18403-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and other physiological conditions, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and other stress conditions. 3B. Oskouian and J. D. Saba, unpublished observations. Therefore, we examined SPL expression in the tissues of mice treated with FTY720, as well as in cell lines exposed to FTY720. Neither SPL gene expression as determined by an SPL-luciferase reporter system (Fig. 4a) nor tissue SPL protein expression as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4b) were significantly affected by FTY720 treatment at doses that inhibited enzyme activity. Although small changes in protein expression may not be detectible by immunoblotting, these studies suggest that the major effect of the drug on SPL activity is not by altering SPL expression. FTY720 Administration Does Not Reduce Tissue S1P Levels—SK is responsible for S1P synthesis, whereas SPL and S1P phosphatases are responsible for S1P catabolism. Since FTY720 interacts with both SK and SPL and may potentially influence the efficiency of both S1P synthesis and degradation, we were interested to determine the sum effect of FTY720 administration on tissue S1P levels. Interestingly, FTY720 treatment was associated with a slight increase in thymic tissue S1P at 36 h, followed by a return to baseline levels by 48 h (TABLE TWO). S1P levels increased somewhat more dramatically in splenic tissue after FTY720 treatment. DHS1-P levels remained stable throughout 48 h of treatment (data not shown). These findings indicate that, despite potential competition with sphingosine by FTY720 as a substrate for SK, tissue S1P levels do not decrease and may even increase transiently during FTY720 administration, consistent with FTY720-mediated inhibition of SPL.TABLE TWOS1P levels in mouse tissues after FTY720 treatmentTime in hoursThymusSpleenS1PaValues are picomoles per gram of wet weight tissue; n = 4 animals per time point.S.D.S1PaValues are picomoles per gram of wet weight tissue; n = 4 animals per time point.S.D.03152.001053.9010229.65357.02243000.691382.1015121.314009.99363917.48184.6718482.30302.34483194.451162.6912365.84128.65a Values are picomoles per gram of wet weight tissue; n = 4 animals per time point. Open table in a new tab In summary, these studies demonstrate that FTY720 inhibits the activity of SPL, the major enzyme responsible for irreversibly removing S1P from the sphingosine-S1P cycle. This effect is observed in vitro and in vivo at therapeutic doses of the drug and occurs concomitant with drug-induced lymphopenia. These studies suggest that FYT720, in addition to interacting with SK and S1P receptors, also interacts with SPL and that inhibition of SPL by FTY720 may potentially contribute to some aspects of drug function (Fig. 5). This notion is consistent with the observation that deoxypyridoxine, a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes including SPL, is a potent immunosuppressant and prolongs allograft survival (26Scountzou J. Malisiovas N. Antoniadis A. Trakatellis A. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1989; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 27Campbell R. Kurtz G. Norton-Reel D. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Loss of SPL expression and concomitant changes in long chain base metabolism produce significant phenotypes in several developmental model systems (28Mendel J. Heinecke K. Fyrst H. Saba J.D. J. Biol.

Whether loss of SPL expression in mammals has any effect on lymphocyte trafficking or immunity should be clarified with the generation and characterization of mouse SPL knock-out models.

The lysosomal enzymes, now modified with M6P, bind to M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi network and are translocated to the endosome and subsequently to the lysosome. Recognition of lysosomal hydrolases by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is the initiating step in lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. Lysosomal hydrolases that are known substrates for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase exhibit low Km values, whereas non-lysosomal glycoproteins bearing similar glycans have higher Km values (1Reitman M.L.

Based on the presence of disulfide-linked α2 and γ2 dimers and quantitative protein sequencing, an α2β2γ2-subunit structure with a molecular mass of 540 kDa was proposed (6Bao M. Booth J.L.

Lysosomal storage diseases are caused by a genetic deficiency of one or more lysosomal enzymes. Enzyme replacement therapy, the therapeutic administration of the missing lysosomal enzyme, is a proven or potential treatment strategy for many lysosomal storage diseases (8Grabowski G.A. Barton N.W. Pastores G. Dambrosia J.M. Banerjee T.K. McKee M.A. Parker C. Schiffmann R. Hill S.C. Brady R.O. Ann. Intern. Med. 1995; 122: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Raben N.

The cation-independent M6P receptor is widely expressed on the surface of many cells and can be used for efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis of therapeutic enzymes (10Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D.

Access to the cDNA(s) for the α- and β-subunits may allow reconstitution of phosphorylation in vitro as well as other strategies to improve the quality of lysosomal enzyme therapeutics. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is absent or unregulated in a group of diseases of lysosomal targeting termed mucolipidosis (13Hasilik A. Waheed A. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is absent in mucolipidosis II (ML II; MIM 252500, I-cell disease), it is reduced in ML IIIA (MIM 252600; pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), and in ML IIIC (MIM 252605, mucolipidosis III, variant form) it is unregulated. Mutations in the γ-subunit gene have been demonstrated to be the molecular basis of MLIIIC (7Raas-Rothschild A. Cormier-Daire V. Bao M. Genin E. Salomon R. Brewer K. Zeigler M. Mandel H. Toth S.

Because cells from ML IIIC patients retain GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity, whereas the substrate recognition is unregulated, the catalytic domain of the enzyme is predicted to reside on α- and/or β-subunits of the enzyme. Cloning of the human α- and β-subunit gene will allow us to understand the genetic basis of ML II and ML IIIA. In this paper we describe the cloning of a single cDNA and gene that encodes a precursor of the α- and β-subunits of human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (gene symbol, GNPTAB). Transfection of the α/β-subunits precursor cDNA with or without co-transfection of the regulatory γ-subunitcDNA resulted in an increase in GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity on low molecular weight substrate. This demonstrates that the α/β-subunits precursor cDNA encodes the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Oligonucleotides, cDNA Libraries, Clones, Plasmid Vectors—Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at University Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Mouse liver Marathon Ready™ cDNA and human whole brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). A human placental cDNA library in λgt10 (catalog 77399) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). SuperScript™ human brain cDNA library was purchased from Invitrogen. pCR2.1, pUC19, pcDNA 3.1(–), and pcDNA6/V5/His-A were purchased from Invitrogen. Amino Terminal Sequencing of Protein and Peptides—Bovine Glc-NAc-phosphotransferase was isolated as previously described (19Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207524) Google Scholar). The gel was either electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or subjected to in-gel Lys-C digestion. The protein bands on the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was stained for 1 min with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, and excised. Protein bands in the gel were stained, excised, and subjected to in-gel reduction, S-Carboxyamidomethylation, and Lys-C digestion in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were resolved by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed with a linear gradient in acetonitrile. Individual peaks were examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/Ionization-mass spectroscopy to identify a peak containing a single mass. Strategies for peak selection, reverse phase selection, and Edman microsequencing has been described (22Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Proteins on the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and Lys-C-derived peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. (Foster City, CA) model 492 protein sequencer at the Molecular Resource Facility in the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. 3′-RACE for the Mouse β-subunit—A primer 5′-gaccgatgaaacaaaaggcaacc-3′ that spans 441–463 nucleotides upstream from the first amino acid of the mouse β-subunit in a mouse cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number L36434) was used to amplify the 3′-end of the cDNA from mouse liver Marathon-Ready cDNA by nested 3′-RACE. Primers AP1 5′-ccatcctaatacgactcactatagggc-3′ and AP2 5′-actcactatagggctcgagcggc-3′ were used as reverse primers for the first and second PCR, respectively. The cycling parameters for the first PCR were 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and annealing/extension at 68 °C for 4 min. The second PCR used the same parameters for 20 cycles. A ∼3.2-kb product was gel-purified, subcloned into pCR2.1, and sequenced on both strands. Screening of Human Placental cDNA Library and 3′-RACE for Human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase cDNA—A 1.1-kb fragment was amplified from the partial mouse β-subunit cDNA by PCR using a forward primer 5′-agtttggttagcccagtgacacc-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-aaatcctgcaggttaaaggtaggtcgtg-3′ and used to screen a size-selected human placental cDNA library in λgt10 under reduced stringency (55 °C, 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate)). Inserts from positive clones were subcloned into pCR2.1 using λgt10 LD-Insert Screening Amplimer Set (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and sequenced. The remaining portion of the cDNA was cloned by a combination of a walking strategy and RACE. The 3′-end of the cDNA was amplified from human whole brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA by nested 3′-RACE, first using primers 5′-agtttggttagcccagtgacacc-3′ and AP1 5′-ccatcctaatacgactcactatagggc-3′, then using primers 5′-cccaaagaaaaacgcttcccgaag-3′ and AP2 5′-actcactatagggctcgagcggc-3′. The cycling parameters for the first PCR were 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and annealing/extension at 68 °C for 4 min. The second PCR used the same parameters for 20 cycles. A 3.4-kb product was gel-purified, subcloned into pCR2.1, and sequenced on both strands. Construction of the Full-length cDNA Encoding Human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits Precursor—A full-length human precursor cDNA was constructed by splicing three pieces of cDNA, the 1118-nucleotide fragment of I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone 682681 (GenBank™ accession number AA204698), a 1703-nucleotide fragment from the placental clone, and a 2698-nucleotide fragment from the 3′-RACE product by ligation at two BbsI restriction sites and subcloning into pUC19. The full-length cDNA (5.6 kb) was excised and subcloned into the NotI site of pcDNA 3.1(–). Instability of a 5-adenosine repeat (nucleotides 2925–2929) was identified as an occasional problem that results in deletion of 1 adenosine, introducing a frame-shift. This problem was prevented by replacing a 215-bp nucleotide fragment between the MfeI and DraIII sites with an MfeI- and DraIII-cleaved PCR product. The product was amplified by using the cDNA as a template with a forward superprimer 5′-gaagacacaattggcatacttcactgatagcaagaatactgggaggcaactaaaagatac-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-actgcatatcctcagaatgg-3′. The sequence aaaaa was replaced by aagaa (underlined in the forward primer sequence) that does not alter the amino acid sequence. Construction of Expression Plasmids for the Precursor—To generate expression plasmids for the precursor, the following modifications were made. The 3′-untranslated region was removed by further subcloning an ∼3.8-kb NheI-BglII fragment from the cDNA between NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA6/V5/His-A. The sequence around the initiation codon was modified in an attempt to improve expression. A ∼1.1-kb fragment between the NheI site in the polylinker and the XhoI site in the cDNA was replaced by NheI- and XhoI-cleaved PCR products amplified using various forward primers described below and a reverse primer, 5′-ctaaaggtaggcaagtggctc-3′. Forward primers were 5′-cgtggcgggctagccaccatgxyzttcaagctcctgcagagaca-3′, where xyz is ctg, ggg, gcg, and gtg, generating a second amino acid of Leu, Gly, Ala, and Val, respectively. Screening of a Human Genomic BAC Library—A 107-bp fragment was amplified by PCR from a SuperScript™ human brain cDNA library using primers 5′-tgcagagacagacctatacctgcc-3′ and 5′-actcacctctccgaactggaaag-3′. The cycling parameters were 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 79 °C for 1 min. The product was used as a probe for screening a human genomic BAC library by Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). Four genomic clones were identified, and BAC 14951 was isolated and sequenced as described previously (23Pan H. Wang Y. Chissoe S. Bodenteich A. Wang Z. Iyer K. Clifton S. Crabtree J. Roe B. Genet.

Briefly, fragments in the 1–3-kbp range were randomly sheared from the purified BAC DNA (50 μg), blunt-ended, and subcloned into SmaI site of pUC18. A random library was generated by transforming Escherichia coli strain XL1BlueMRF′ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by electroporation. ∼1200 colonies were picked from each transformation, and the sequencing templates were isolated by a cleared lysate-based protocol from the cultured library (24Bodenteich A. Chissoe S. Wang Y. Roe B. Venter J. Automated DNA Sequencing and Analysis Techniques. Academic Press, Ltd., London1993: 42-50Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed as previously described (25Chissoe S.L. Bodenteich A. Wang Y.-F. Wang Y.-P. Burian D. Clifton S.W. Crabtree J. Freeman A. Iyer K. Jian L. Ma Y. McLaury H.-J. Pan H.-Q. Sharan O. Toth S. Wang Z. Zhang G. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Roe B.A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). After base-calling with the ABI analysis software, the analyzed data were transferred to a Sun workstation cluster for base-calling and assembly using Phred and Phrap programs (26Ewing B. Hillier L. Wendle M. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 175-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ewing B. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4901) Google Scholar), respectively. Overlapping sequences and contigs were analyzed using Consed (28Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). Gap closure and proofreading was performed using either custom primer-walking or PCR amplification of the region corresponding to the gap in the sequence followed by subcloning into pUC18 and cycle-sequencing with the universal pUC primers. In some instances additional synthetic custom primers were necessary for at least 3-fold coverage for each base. Northern Blot Analysis—A cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1252–3356 of the cDNA was excised by XhoI and EcoRV from the plasmid containing the full-length cDNA. The cDNA was labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP using random hexamer priming with a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Readiprime II random prime labeling System, Amersham Biosciences) and used to probe a human MTN™ (multi-tissue northern) blot from BD Bioscience following the manufacturer's recommendation, except that all the washing steps were performed at 65 °C. The membrane was exposed to a BIOMAX MS x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen for 16 h at –80 °C. Expression of the Precursor in 293T Cells—The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were transfected with empty vector or vector containing cDNA using FuGene-6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested by scraping at 72 h post-transfection and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2) on ice for 30 min (14Varki A.P. Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was assayed for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity as described below and protein concentration by Bradford assay (Pierce). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase Assay—GlcNAc-phosphate transferred to α-methylmannoside was determined using [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc as described previously (29Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One unit of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is defined as 1 pmol of GlcNAc phosphate transferred to α-methylmannoside/h in a reaction containing 150 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 100 mm α-methylmannoside. Alignments of Deduced Protein Sequences—GlcNAc-phosphotransferase sequences derived from databases were assembled and translated. Deduced protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55998) Google Scholar) as implemented by MacVector™ 7.2 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) Bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase Protein Sequence—Bovine Glc-NAc-phosphotransferase was purified 488,000-fold to apparent homogeneity as previously described (19Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The bands corresponding to the α-subunit dimer (320 kDa) and β-subunit (56 kDa) were excised and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing. Duplicate samples were subjected to in situ Lys-C digestion and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and several isolated peptides were subjected to amino-terminal microsequencing. The α-subunit bands generated a single amino-terminal sequence of MLLKLLQRQTY and internal peptide sequences of VPMLVLDXAXPTXVXLK and DLPSLYPSFLSASDVFNVAKPK. The β-subunit bands generated an amino-terminal sequence of DTFADSLRYVNKILNSKFGFTSRKVPAH and internal peptide sequences of ILNSK, TSFHK, FGFTSR, and SLVTNCKPVTDK. Two of the internal sequences, ILNSK and FGFTSR, overlap with the amino-terminal sequence. Molecular Cloning of a Partial Mouse GlcNAc-phosphotransferase β-subunit cDNA—Bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase β-subunit peptide sequences were used to search the EST data base using the TBLASTN algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71439) Google Scholar). The search identified a mouse cDNA (GenBank™ accession number L36434) that was previously incorrectly annotated as a basic domain-leucine zipper transcription factor (32Cordes S.P. Barsh G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The 1846-bp murine clone contained highly homologous sequences to the determined β-subunit amino-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequences. The amino-terminal sequence of the bovine β-subunit began at nucleotide 799 of the mouse cDNA. The 798-bp sequence 5′ to this revealed an in-frame open reading frame that lacked evidence for either a signal peptide or an initiator methionine, suggesting the β-subunit might be derived from a larger precursor. The murine clone was extended by 3′-RACE as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding a ∼4600-bp partial cDNA. Attempts to extend the 5′-sequence by 5′-RACE, library screening, and data base searching were unsuccessful. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of Human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α- and β-subunits Precursor cDNA—A 1.1-kb fragment from the mouse cDNA was used to screen a human placental cDNA library in λgt10 under reduced stringency. Several positive clones were isolated, and the clone with the largest insert (3.4 kb) was sequenced. The remaining portion of the cDNA was cloned by a combination of a walking strategy, 3′-RACE, and data base searching. The placental sequence was used to design nested 3′-RACE primers that allowed the isolation of a 3′-RACE product from human brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA. The 3426-nucleotide 3′-RACE product contained a 1761-nucleotide coding region and a 1665-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region. The placental sequence was also used to search the EST data base using the BLASTN algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71439) Google Scholar). The search identified an I.M.A.G.E. clone 682681 (GenBank™ Accession Number AA204698) which contained a 1271-bp insert composed of a 164-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region and 1106-nucleotide coding region that overlapped the 5′ portion of the placental sequence. Together, these strategies allowed the isolation of a full-length cDNA that spanned 5597 bp. The cDNA sequence for human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase has been deposited to GenBank™ and the accession number is AY687932. Deduced Structure of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits Precursor—The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor are shown in Fig. 1. The 5597-bp cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of 1256 amino acids. The cDNA appears to encode an precursor with the α-subunit in the 5′-position and the β-subunit in the 3′-position. Sequences highly homologous to all the amino-terminal and internal-peptide sequences of both the α- and β-subunit of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase are represented in the predicted human protein sequence (89 and 100% identity in the α- and β-subunits, respectively). The precursor protein has a predicted molecular mass of 143,582 Da, of which 104,706 and 38,894 Da are for the α- and β-subunits, respectively. The sequence contains 17 consensus sites for N-glycosylation in the α-subunit and 3 in the β-subunit. It also contains 22 cysteine residues, 18 in the α-subunit and 4 in the β-subunit.FIGURE 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor. The predicted protein sequence is shown below the DNA sequence. The putative transmembrane domains are underlined. Sequences homologous to the experimentally identified bovine α- and β-subunits amino acid sequences are indicated by dashed underlines. The amino terminus of the β-subunit is indicated by an arrow. The 20 potential sites for N-linked glycosylation are indicated by asterisks. An in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiation codon is double-underlined. A potential polyadenylation signal is shown by dotted underline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence surrounding the proposed initiation codon (ggggtgatgc) has a guanosine in position –3 and a cytidine in position +4, yielding a non-preferred translation initiation sequence (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). There is an in-frame stop codon 129 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon. The cDNA has a single potential polyadenylation signal (ATAAAA) 13–18 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail, although the signal was not the more commonly found AATAAA or ATTAAA. Membrane Topology of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α- and β-subunits—Examination of a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity plot (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol.

The signaling mechanisms regulating RV-induced airway epithelial cell responses have not been well studied. We examined the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in RV-induced interleukin (IL)-8 expression. Infection of 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells with RV39 induced rapid activation of PI 3-kinase and phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase. RV39 also colocalized with cit-Akt-PH, a citrogen-tagged fluorescent fusion protein encoding the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt, indicating that 3-phosphorylated PI accumulates at the site of RV infection. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase and Akt attenuated RV39-induced NF-κB transactivation and IL-8 expression. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase also blocked internalization of labeled RV39 into 16HBE14o- cells, suggesting that the requirement of PI 3-kinase for RV39-induced IL-8 expression, at least in part, relates to its role in viral endocytosis.

Inhibition of PI 3-kinase also blocked internalization of labeled RV39 into 16HBE14o- cells, suggesting that the requirement of PI 3-kinase for RV39-induced IL-8 expression, at least in part, relates to its role in viral endocytosis.

Viral infections trigger the majority of asthma exacerbations (1Johnston S.L. Pattemore P.K. Sanderson G. Smith S. Lampe F. Josephs L. Symington P. O'Toole S. Myint S.H. Tyrrell D.A. Holgate S.T. Br.

The precise mechanisms by which RV induces asthma or COPD exacerbations are unknown, but numerous studies suggest a role for IL-8, a CXC chemokine with the neutrophil-attractant Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif. IL-8 and neutrophils are found in the nasal secretions and sputum of patients with RV-induced asthma exacerbations (5Grunberg K. Smits H.H. Timmers M.C. De Klerk E.P.A. Dolhain R.J.E.M. Dick E.C.

Together, these data suggest that RV may stimulate asthma exacerbations by inducing bronchial epithelial cell production of IL-8, leading to a neutrophilic inflammatory response. The human RVs include more than 100 serotypes that are divided into two groups based on their cellular receptors. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 is the airway epithelial cell receptor for major subgroup RVs (e.g. RV14, RV16, and RV39), whereas the low density lipoprotein receptor functions as the receptor for minor subgroup RVs (e.g. RV1B and RV2). Thus, antibodies to ICAM-1 inhibit major subgroup RV infection of epithelial cells (18Terajima M. Yamaya M. Sekizawa K. Okinaga S. Suzuki T. Yamada N. Nakayama K. Ohrui T. Oshima T. Numazaki Y. Sasaki H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 (-L759): L749PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In endothelial cells, ICAM-1 cross-linking increases phosphorylation and activation of pp60 Src (19Wang Q. Pfeiffer G.R. Gaarde W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47731-47743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Etienne-Manneville S. Manneville J.-B. Adamson P. Wilbourn B. Greenwood J. Couraud P.-O. J.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 5755-5761PubMed Google Scholar). The p85 regulatory subunit of class 1A PI 3-kinase serves as a substrate for both Src (22Haefner B. Baxter R. Fincham V.J. Downes C.P. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7937-7943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and focal adhesion kinase (23Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 24Chen H.-C. Appeddu P. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), suggesting that ICAM-1 ligation by RV could also activate PI 3-kinase. Other viruses with different membrane receptors also activate PI 3-kinase. Adenovirus attachment and endocytosis, via the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, promotes phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, as well as activation of the PI 3-kinase p110 catalytic subunit, in SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cells (25Li E. Stupack D. Klemke R. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis of adeno-associated virus, which binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycan, activates PI 3-kinase in HeLa cells (26Sanlioglu S. Benson P.K. Yang J. Atkinson E.M. Reynolds T. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9184-9196Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Finally, respiratory syncytial virus activates PI 3-kinase in A549 lung carcinoma cells (27Thomas K.W. Monick M.M. Staber J.M. Yarovinsky T. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 492-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that RV binding to ICAM-1 could induce IL-8 expression in part by activation of PI 3-kinases. All PI 3-kinases share a catalytic core domain that interacts directly with ATP, PI, and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Members of the PI 3-kinase family are divided into three classes according to their structure and in vitro substrate specificity, as reviewed in Ref. 28Wymann M.P. Zvelebil M. Laffargue M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar. Class 1A PI 3-kinases α, β, and γ are tightly bound with a regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, or p55γ) that contains Src homology 2 domains with affinity for phosphotyrosine residues in pYXXM motifs found in growth factor receptors, their substrates, and adaptor proteins. The major substrate for the class I PI 3-kinases in vivo appears to be PI(4,5)P2, and the major product appears to be PI(3,4,5)P3 (29Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When activated, class IA PI 3-kinases regulate cellular functions by recruiting PI(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins to the plasma membrane. Most of these proteins, the prototype of which is the serine threonine kinase Akt, bind to 3-phosphorylated PIs through a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. We therefore examined the contributions of PI 3-kinase and Akt to RV-induced responses in human airway epithelial cells. We found that infection with RV39 induced rapid activation of PI 3-kinase and phosphorylation of Akt, as well as accumulation of 3-phosphorylated PI at the site of RV infection. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase and Akt attenuated RV39-induced nuclear factor (NF)-κB transactivation and IL-8 expression. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase also blocked internalization of labeled RV39, suggesting that the requirement of PI 3-kinase for RV39-induced IL-8 expression, at least in part, relates to its role in viral endocytosis. Cell Culture—16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells originating from bronchial epithelial tissue transfected with pSVori-containing the origin-defective SV40 genome (30Cozens A. Yezzi M. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W. Widdicomb J. Gruenert D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Steven White (University of Chicago). The cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 200 mm of l-glutamine. Differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cell cultures obtained from lung transplant donor tracheas (University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) were cultured at an air-liquid interface, as described (31Sajjan U. Keshavjee S. Forstner J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4188-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thawed passage 1 cells were seeded into 12-mm collagen-coated Transwell-clear inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The cells were grown under submerged conditions in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (Clonetics) containing epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (65 ng/ml), all-trans-retinoic acid (5 × 10-8m), bovine serum albumin (1.5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), epinephrine (0.5 μg/ml), triiodothyronine (6.5 ng/ml), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin (50 μg/ml). At confluence, the cells were shifted to a 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial cell growth medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing all the above growth factors and hormones and grown at air-liquid interface to promote mucociliary differentiation. The epithelium is pseudostratified with ciliated cells interspersed among mucus secreting cells. Periodic acid Schiff staining shows the presence of goblet cells and luminal glycoproteins, and immunostaining with antibody to tracheo-bronchial mucin has confirmed that the periodic acid Schiff-positive material is mucin. These cultures also show an acceptable transepithelial electrical resistance of 500-540 Ω/cm2. RV Infection—RV39 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Viral stocks were generated by incubating HeLa cells with RV in serum-free medium until 80% of the cells were cytopathic. For most experiments, HeLa cell lysates were harvested, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). To remove soluble factors of HeLa cell origin, RV was concentrated and partially purified by centrifugation with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off Centricon filter (2,000 rpm for 2 h at 4°C; Millipore, Billerica, MA) (32Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Intact virus fails to go through the filter and is concentrated. For experiments measuring PI 3-kinase activation or phosphorylation of Akt, we harvested HeLa cell supernatants rather than lysates to further decrease the possibility of contamination by HeLa cellular proteins. For fluorescent labeling (see below), partially purified and concentrated RV39 (as above) was overlayered on a sucrose pad consisting of 30% sucrose, 1 m NaCl, and 20 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5) and ultracentrifuged (65,000 rpm, 402,000 × gmax for 2 h at 16 °C). The supernatant was carefully removed, and the solid clear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, divided into aliquots, and stored at -80 °C. All titrations were performed by infecting confluent HeLa monolayers with serially diluted RV (range, undiluted to 10-9) and assessing cytopathic effect 5 days after infection. The cells were infected with RV39 for 1 h (or less, depending on experimental design) at 33 °C. Unless otherwise noted, 16HBE14o- cells were infected with RV39 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. Mucociliary differentiated cultures were infected at a 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID50)/ml of 6 × 105 to 3 × 106. TCID50 values were determined by the Spearman-Karber method (33Johnston S.L. Tyrrell D.A.J. Lennette E.H. Schmidt N.J. Diagnostic Procedures for Viral, Rickettsial, and Chlamydial Infections. 1997: 553-563Google Scholar). For experiments including sham infection, the cells were incubated with an equal volume of HeLa cell lysate or supernatant. In some experiments, purified RV39 was UV-irradiated on ice for 30 min using a UVB CL-1000 cross-linker at 1200 μJ/cm2 (32Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The effect of UV irradiation was confirmed by the absence of a cytopathic effect on HeLa cell monolayers. Selected cultures were pretreated for 1 h with the chemical PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 in dimethyl sulfoxide (both from Sigma) or carrier alone. In other experiments, the cells were incubated with anti-ICAM-1 antibody (20 μg/ml; Serotec, Raleigh, NC) for 1 h prior to infection, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α neutralizing antibody (0.1-1.0 μg/ml) (R & D, Minneapolis, MN) immediately after infection. As a control, equal concentrations of irrelevant mouse anti-human IgG (Sigma) were used. Measurement of IL-8 Protein Levels—The cells were grown to 80% confluence, serum-starved for 24 h, and then infected with RV39 for 1 h. Inoculum was then replaced with serum-free medium. Conditioned medium was collected 48 h post-infection, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and then frozen at -80 °C. For mucociliary cultures, RV was applied to the apical surface for 1 h. Forty-eight hours post-infection, apical washings and basolateral supernatants were collected from the basolateral compartment. IL-8 protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R & D Systems). Measurement of IL-8 Promoter Activity and NF-κB Transactivation—The -162/+44 fragment of the human IL-8 promoter subcloned into luciferase (-162/+44 hIL8/Luc) was obtained from Dr. Allan Brasier (34Denning G.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. Anning Lin. 16HBE14o- cells were grown to 50% confluence, washed in Optimem (Invitrogen), and incubated with plasmid DNA, Lipofectamine, and Optimem (Invitrogen). After 4 h, the solution was replaced with minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next morning, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then treated with RV39 for 1 h. Inoculum was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, and the were cells harvested for analysis 24 h post-infection. Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. Changes in promoter activity were normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing luciferase light units by Renilla luciferase light units. The results were then reported as fold increase over the empty vector/untreated control. Expression of genetic mutants was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from primary human mucociliary-differentiated tracheal epithelial cell cultures using TRIzol reagent (Sigma), electrophoresed on 1.25% SeaKem Gold agarose gels (Reliant RNA gel system; Cambrex, Rockland, MN), and then transferred onto Immobilin-NY Plus membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Probe template was prepared from RNA extracted from primary cells by reverse transcription-PCR with the IL-8 primers 5′-ATG ACT TCC AAG CTG GCC GTG GCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCT CAG CCC TCT TCA AAA ACT TCT C-3′ (antisense). 32P-Radiolabeled probe was prepared using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (-dCTP) (Amersham Biosciences). Probe hybridization was performed with Ultrahyb buffer as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). PI 3-Kinase Assay—After RV infection, 16HBE14o- cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). Precipitates were incubated with PI(4,5)P2 and [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 20 μl of 6 m HCl and 150 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The organic phase was then was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min. Lipids were dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (95:5) and subjected to thin layer chromatography. The plates were dried, and activity was assessed by autoradiography. Immunoblotting—After the relevant treatment, 16HBE14o- cells were lysed, cellular proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with antibodies against Ser473 phospho-Akt, total Akt, Ser32/36 phospho-IκBα total IκBα (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or p85 PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The signals were amplified and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). Fluorescent Microscopy—For fluorescent labeling of RV39, 0.4 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3 was added to a 0.1-ml aliquot of purified, concentrated virus to raise pH to 8.5. The virus was then incubated in the dark for 1 h with 250 μg of Alexa-fluor 555 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester, an amine-reactive probe (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The reaction was quenched with 0.5 ml of 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and labeled virus was dialyzed three times against Tris buffer (in the dark, 12 h at 4 °C). The virus was concentrated by precipitation with a final 6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitation in 0.5 m NaCl for 4 h at 4°C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid was completely aspirated, and the virus was resuspended in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for stability. This virus maintained infectivity, with no reduction in TCID50 compared with unlabeled virus. To visualize RV39 internalization into 16HBE14o- cells, cells on collagen-coated slides (Becton Dickson Labware, Bedford, MA) were infected with Alexa fluor-labeled virus (1 × 106 TCID50/ml) or an equal volume of Alexa fluor-labeled cell lysate from uninfected HeLa cells for 15 min at 33 °C. The cells were then washed extensively, fixed in PBS with 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C, washed three times further with PBS, and mounted with ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. We also monitored the infection of 16HBE14o- cells stably transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or cit-Akt-PH (39Marshall J.G. Booth J.W. Stambolic V. Mak T.

Cell. 2004; 15: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), a citrogen-tagged fusion protein encoding the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (provided by Dr. Joel Swanson, University of Michigan). Fifteen min after infection with labeled RV39, the cells were washed, fixed and mounted as above, and visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Colocalization was quantified by NIH Image software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc). Nuclear extracts were obtained from 16HBE14o- cells, and electrophoretic mobility assay was conducted as previously described (41Li J. Johnson X.D. Iazvovskaia S. Tan A. Lin A. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284 (-L315): L307Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract (4 μg) was incubated at room temperature for 10 min in binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of dI-dC). Radiolabeled probe (75,000 disintegrations/s) was added, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 20 min. Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel and electrophoresed at room temperature for 4 h in 0.5% Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. The gels were dried, and binding was assessed by autoradiography. IKK Assay—Endogenous IKK was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with an anti-IKKγ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Activity of the immune complex was assayed in 30 μl of kinase buffer in the presence of 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (3 μg/sample) as a substrate (30 °C for 15 min), as described (38Nemoto S.

Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semidry transfer. After Ponceau staining, the membrane was exposed to film, and substrate phosphorylation was assessed by optical scanning. Equal levels of immunoprecipitated IKK were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-IKKγ antibody. Measurement of RV39 Binding and Internalization—35S-Labeled virus was generated by infecting HeLa cells with RV39 in the presence of [35S]methionine and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) for 24 h, lysing the cells by freeze-thaw, and concentrating by centrifugation with a Centricon filter, as above. 16HBE14o- cells were then infected [35S]methionine-labeled RV39 for either 1 h at 4 °C (binding) or 30 min at 33 °C (internalization) (42Baravalle G. Brabec M. Snyers L. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine virus binding, 16HBE14o- cells grown in 12-well plates were incubated with 5 × 104 cpm [35S]methionine-labeled RV39/well in 0.5 ml of minimum essential medium for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were washed at 4 °C with PBS, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured in cell lysates by liquid scintillation counting. To quantify internalization, 16HBE14o- cells in 12-well plates were detached with 2 mm EDTA, washed, and incubated with 5 × 104 cpm [35S]methionine-labeled RV39/2 × 105 cells in minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were warmed to 33 °C for 30 min, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS to remove noninternalized virus, and lysed for measurement of cell-associated radioactivity. Data Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences identified by ANOVA were pinpointed by the Student Newman-Keuls' multiple range text. RV39 Infection Increases IL-8 Expression in Cultured Airway Epithelial Cells—16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with RV39 (1 h at 33 °C). Forty-eight hours after infection, cell supernatants were collected for measurement of IL-8 protein by ELISA. RV39 increased IL-8 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Equal volumes of HeLa cell lysate from uninfected cells had no effect. Concentrations of RV39 as low as 0.1 MOI increased IL-8 protein secretion (data not shown). To test whether IL-8 expression was transcriptionally regulated, cells were transfected with the -162/+44 fragment of the full-length human IL-8 promoter subcloned into a luciferase reporter, infected with RV39 (1 h at 33 °C), and incubated for an additional 24 h (Fig. 1B). RV39 increased IL-8 promoter activity by about 5-fold, consistent with the notion that IL-8 is transcriptionally regulated by RV39 infection. We tested whether RV39 infection increases IL-8 expression in differentiated human tracheal epithelial cells. Passage 1 cells, isolated from the tracheas of lung transplant donors, were grown at air-liquid interface for 2 weeks. After RV39 infection, washings from the apical surface and"

Unfortunately, >80% of pancreatic cancer patients bear inoperable, locally advanced, chemoresistant tumors demonstrating the urgent need for development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat this disease. Here we report that the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12 dioxooleana-1,9 dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) antagonizes PC cell growth by inducing apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that the cytotoxicity of CDDO-Im is accompanied by the rapid and selective depletion of mitochondrial glutathione that results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species, oxidation of the cellular glutathione pool, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and phosphatidylserine externalization. The parent compound CDDO as well as the methyl ester of CDDO also depleted mitochondrial glutathione, demonstrating that this effect is mediated by the triterpenoid nucleus of these agents. Cotreatment with sulfhydryl nucleophiles completely prevented apoptosis and loss of viability induced by CDDO-Im, whereas alkylation of intracellular thiols by diethylmaleate or cotreatment with dithiothreitol decreased the accumulation of a biotinylated derivative of CDDO, TP-301, in PC cells, suggesting that intracellular reduced thiols are functional targets of the electrophilic triterpenoid nucleus of CDDO and its derivatives. In conclusion, our report is the first to identify mitochondrial glutathione as a target of CDDO and its derivatives and demonstrates that depletion of this antioxidant in the mitochondria is an effective strategy to induce cell death in PC cells. These results suggest that CDDO and its derivatives may offer a clinical benefit for the treatment of PC. Surgical resection is the only curative strategy for pancreatic cancer (PC).

Tumor resection is still the most effective treatment for PC. However, because of local invasion and/or metastasis, only ∼15-20% of PC patients qualify for surgical intervention. For locally advanced, unresectable, and metastatic disease, treatment is palliative at best and usually consists of 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Unfortunately, despite the moderate success of gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycitidine), median survival rates remain under 6 months for patients with metastatic disease (2National Cancer Institute (2002) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Fast Stats: Pancreatic Cancer http://seer.cancer.gov.Google Scholar, 3Li D.

Med. 2003; 34: 145-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Oxidized GSH (GSSG) must be converted back to GSH by the action of glutathione reductase, an enzyme that utilizes the pyridine nucleotide NADPH as a cofactor. The ratio of GSH/GSSG, a direct measure of the redox status of the cells, decreases during cell death due to NADPH oxidation and GSH extrusion, and the exogenous addition of GSSG has been demonstrated to trigger apoptosis (7Filomeni G. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Hancock J.T. Desikan R. Neill S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In addition, electrophilic agents like diethylmaleate, N-ethylmaleimide, and ethacrynic acid form adducts with GSH and induce apoptosis, suggesting that cell death can also be triggered in the absence of pyridine nucleotide oxidation by directly decreasing GSH levels (10Coffey R.N.

Interestingly, mitochondria are unable to synthesize GSH, thus depending on its import from the cytosol by the action of an unidentified carrier system (13Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Maintenance of adequate mitochondrial GSH (GSHm) levels is critical for scavenging ROS produced during mitochondrial metabolism as well as for prevention of apoptosis (14Fernandez-Checa J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Accordingly, depletion of GSHm has been shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α and ceramide, and conversely, artificially increasing GSHm levels abrogates this effect (15Colell A.

Furthermore, GSH has been reported to directly modulate the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) and apoptosis by interacting with a dithiol protein site (17Chernyak B.V. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting GSH and/or GSHm levels may be an effective therapeutic strategy to induce cell death or sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. The novel triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) is effective in inducing apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell types including leukemia (19Inoue S. Snowden R.T. Dyer M.J.

Furthermore, recent reports demonstrate that the C28 imidazolide derivative of CDDO, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im), is 5-fold more potent than CDDO as an antitumor agent in vivo and in vitro (29Place A.E.

CDDO and CDDO-Im reportedly disrupt intracellular redox balance in multiple myeloma cells, thereby activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and exhibit some selectivity in apoptosis induction between tumor and normal cells (23Chauhan D.

In addition, a recent report demonstrated that CDDO induced cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that this agent directly targets the mitochondria to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (21Konopleva M. Tsao T. Estrov Z. Lee R.M. Wang R.Y. Jackson C.E. McQueen T. Monaco G. Munsell M. Belmont J. Kantarjian H. Sporn M.B. Andreeff M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7927-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that the cytotoxic effects of CDDO-Im in PC cells are mediated by perturbations in GSHm, leading to caspase-independent apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that CDDO-Im rapidly and selectively decreases GSHm and that this occurs prior to loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alkylation of intracellular sulfhydryls or cotreatment with reducing agents abrogates the accumulation of a biotinylated derivative of CDDO in PC cells, suggesting that reduced sulfhydryls are direct molecular targets of this agent. Thus, we hypothesize that CDDO-Im may be effective in treating PC by triggering apoptosis in PC cells via perturbations in GSHm. Chemicals and Biochemicals—CDDO-Im and the biotinylated derivative of CDDO, TP-301, were synthesized as described (31Honda T. Janosik T. Honda Y. Han J. Liby K.T. Williams C.R. Couch R.D.

The annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate and the WST reagent were obtained from Roche Applied Science. 5-(and-6)-Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), MitoTracker CMXRos, and MitoTracker Green were all obtained from Invitrogen. The calpain inhibitor E64d was obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), z-VAD-fmk was from Alexis Biochemicals (Axxora LLC, San Diego, CA), antibodies specific for caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), and the anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. Cell Culture—PANC1 and COLO357 cells were a generous gift of Dr. Paul Chiao (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Both cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The concentrations of CDDO-Im and other agents used and the treatment intervals are indicated below and under “Results.” Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Biochemical Assay for GSH and GSSG—Briefly, 5 × 106 to 1.5 × 107 cells were cultured under normal conditions and treated as indicated. Cells were then collected, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 55 μl10mm HCl. After incubation on ice for 5 min, insoluble cellular debris was spun down, and protein concentration was measured from 5 μl of supernatant using a commercially available BCA protein kit. The remaining supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of 10% metaphosphoric acid and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Proteins were precipitated at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 10 μl of a 4 m triethanolamine solution. 25 μl of the supernatant were derivatized for exclusive measurement of GSSG by the addition of 2.5 μl of a 1 m ethanolic solution of 2-vinylpyridine and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 25 μl of the untreated and derivatized supernatants were mixed with 75 μl of buffer G (100 mm KPO4, 10 mm EDTA, 240 μm NADPH, 0.3 mg/ml 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), and 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase, pH 7.5), absorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader after 10 min of incubation at room temperature, and GSH concentrations were calculated from a standard curve of GSSG. Results are expressed as picomoles of GSH per microgram of protein. The GSH/GSSG ratio is calculated as follows: [(pmol of GSH in untreated supernatant) - (pmol of GSH in 2-vinyl pyridine-treated supernatant)]/(pmol of GSH in untreated supernatant). For measurement of GSH and GSSG in the mitochondrial fraction, mitochondria were isolated from 1.5 × 107 cells by density centrifugation using a commercially available kit (Pierce) and washed twice in isolation buffer (75 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), and mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm HCl. Protein concentrations and total GSH content were measured as described above. These experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Results presented are means ± S.D. of representative experiments. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Annexin V Positivity—After appropriate treatments, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice in annexin binding buffer (5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer containing a 1:30 dilution of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide and incubated in the dark for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with annexin binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a 488-nm argon excitation laser. Results presented are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—After appropriate treatments, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml MitoTracker CMXRos and 15 ng/ml MitoTracker Green and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using a 488-nm argon excitation laser. Results presented are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Measurement of ROS Generation—COLO357 and PANC1 cells were treated with CDDO-Im for 30 min. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and loaded with the ROS-sensitive probe CM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and washed twice in PBS, and FL1 fluorescence was examined by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using a 488-nm argon excitation laser. Results presented are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. DNA Fragmentation Assay—COLO357 and PANC1 cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 1.5 × 106 cells/plate. 24 h after seeding, cells were treated for an additional 36 h with various concentrations of CDDO-Im. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold PBS twice, and resuspended in 500 μl of sonication buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). Cells were homogenized by passing through a 22-gauge needle and incubated in ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was precipitated, and the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) once to remove excess protein. DNA was then purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was run on a 1.8% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide and photographed under a UV light source. Western Blotting—COLO357 and PANC1 cells were treated with 1 and 1.5 μm CDDO-Im, respectively, for 14 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 45 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Cells were homogenized by passing through a 22-gauge needle and incubated on ice for 20 min. Insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were assayed for protein concentration using the BCA kit from Pierce. 25 μg of protein were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) followed by immunoblotting. Signals were detected using a Phosphor-Imager (Storm 860, version 4.0; Amersham Biosciences). CDDO-Im Inhibits PC Cell Growth In Vitro by Inducing Apoptosis—A previous report suggested that CDDO was effective in decreasing the proliferation of PC cells in culture, but neither the mechanism of action nor the effect of the more potent CDDO derivatives was investigated (33Suh N. Wang Y. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Dmitrovsky E. Hickey W.F. Maue R.A. Place A.E. Porter D.M. Spinella M.J. Williams C.R. Wu G. Dannenberg A.J. Flanders K.C. Letterio J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nathan C.F. Nguyen L. Porter W.W. Ren R.F. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Subbaramaiah K. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of CDDO-Im on the growth of PC cells. The results shown in Fig. 1, A and B indicate that CDDO-Im significantly prevents the growth of COLO357 and PANC1 cells at nanomolar doses with 96-h IC50 values of 167 and 396 nm, respectively (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the results in Fig. 1, C and D demonstrate that the observed inhibition of cell growth is accompanied by increased PS exposure (96-h EC50 = 250 and 419 nm, respectively), suggesting that apoptosis mediates the growth inhibitory effects of CDDO-Im. To further investigate the growth inhibitory mechanism of CDDO-Im, we examined the short term viability of PC cells treated with this synthetic triterpenoid by measuring PS exposure and ΔΨm. As the results presented in Fig. 2, A and B illustrate, CDDO-Im effectively decreased the viability of both COLO357 and PANC1 cells in a time-dependent manner and suggest that apoptosis induction by CDDO-Im is accompanied by rapid decreases in ΔΨm, resulting in 96% mitochondrial depolarization by 24 h (p < 0.0001). Finally, we examined the genomic integrity of PC cells treated with CDDO-Im and observed the characteristic apoptotic DNA laddering pattern (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that CDDO-Im prevents the growth of PC cells by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.FIGURE 2CDDO-Im-induced apoptosis is accompanied by decreased ΔΨm and DNA fragmentation. A and B, COLO357 (A) and PANC1 (B) cells were treated with CDDO-Im for various times and analyzed for annexin V staining and ΔΨm by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, COLO357 and PANC1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CDDO-Im for 36 h, and genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CDDO-Im Induces a Rapid and Selective Decrease in GSHm Levels in PC Cells—A previous report suggested that the cytotoxicity of CDDO-Im is mediated by alterations in intracellular redox homeostasis (30Ikeda T. Sporn M. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5551-5558PubMed Google Scholar). Because GSH levels are critical regulators of redox homeostasis and also because our results indicated that CDDO-Im induces mitochondrial dysfunction in PC cells, we quantitated biochemically the total GSH content (GSH plus GSSG) in whole-cell and mitochondrial fractions from COLO357 cells treated with CDDO-Im. Interestingly, the results presented in Fig. 3, A and B demonstrate that treatment of COLO357 cells with CDDO-Im resulted in a time-dependent and dose-dependent decrease in total GSHm levels (46% loss at 120 min; p < 0.03) without marked effects on total whole-cell GSH (GSHwc) levels, and similar observations were made in PANC1 cells (not shown). Because adequate GSHm levels are necessary to prevent the accumulation of ROS (34Fernandez-Checa J.C. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Mari M. Miranda M. Ardite E. Biofactors. 1998; 8: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we investigated further to determine whether treatment of PC cells with CDDO-Im resulted in increased levels of ROS as measured by the oxidation of CM-H2DCFDA acetyl ester. Indeed, as the results in Fig. 3C illustrate, treatment with 1 μm CDDO-Im significantly (p < 0.01) increased accumulation of ROS by 3.2-fold in COLO357 and 2.3-fold in PANC1 cells, suggesting that the decrease in GSHm levels impairs the antioxidant capacity of PC cells. Biochemical measurements in whole-cell acid extracts of COLO357 cells treated with various doses of CDDO-Im for 2 h (Fig. 3D) demonstrated that this agent at 1 μm also induced a significant (p < 0.05) 2.3-fold decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio, suggesting that the increased accumulation of ROS resulted in oxidation of the GSH pool, and similar results were obtained in PANC1 cells (not shown). Finally, the results in Fig. 3E demonstrate that the parent compound CDDO (5 μm), as well as the methyl ester of CDDO at 1 μm, also induced a profound depletion of GSHm in PANC1 cells within 3 h; similar observations were made in COLO357 cells (not shown), demonstrating that the triterpenoid nucleus of these agents mediate the perturbations in GSHm. Taken together, our observations suggest that the triterpenoid nucleus of CDDO-Im induces perturbations in GSHm that occur prior to the initiation of apoptosis and lead to increased accumulation of ROS and subsequent oxidation of the GSH pool. Sulfhydryl Containing Nucleophiles Prevent the Cytotoxicity Induced by CDDO-Im in PC Cells—Because CDDO-Im displays two potential electrophilic Michael acceptor sites at position 1 and 9 of the triterpenoid nucleus (Fig. 4A), we investigated to determine whether reducing nucleophilic agents would abrogate the cytotoxicity of this agent. As shown in Fig. 4, B-E, BME, DTT, and GSH, but not ascorbic acid, effectively prevented PS exposure and ΔΨm loss in PC cells treated with CDDO-Im. More importantly, BME cotreatment (2 mm) significantly prevented the loss of GSHm by 37% (p < 0.05) in PANC1 cells treated with 1.5 μm CDDO-Im and by 52% (p < 0.03) in COLO357 cells treated with this agent at 1 μm (Fig. 5A). Similar observations were made using DTT (not shown). The finding that BME prevented the decrease in GSHm levels in PC cells led us to investigate whether this agent would also prevent the accumulation of ROS in COLO357 cells treated with CDDO-Im. Supporting a critical role for GSHm in preventing accumulation of ROS, our experiments demonstrated that BME completely prevented the increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence in COLO357 cells treated with 1 μm CDDO-Im (Fig. 5B). In contrast, BME was ineffective in preventing the increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence induced by treatment of COLO357 cells with 100 μm H2O2 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that ROS generation is downstream of the redox perturbation induced by CDDO-Im.FIGURE 5BME prevents depletion of GSHm and subsequent ROS generation in PC cells treated with CDDO-Im. A, COLO357 and PANC1 cells were treated with 1 or 1.5 μm CDDO-Im (CDDOim), respectively, alone or in combination with BME. GSHm levels were quantitated after 3 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, COLO357 cells were treated with 1 μm CDDO-Im (CDDOim) or 80 μm H2O2 for 30 min with or without BME (2 mm) cotreatment and loaded with the ROS-sensitive probe CM-H2DCFDA (DCF). FL1 fluorescence was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, COLO357 cells were treated with 15 μm TP-301 (TP301D) for 6 h alone or in combination with DTT or DEM. Cells were then fixed in 2% para-formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with avidin conjugated with PE followed by flow cytometry analysis of the cellular PE content. Inset, COLO357 cells were seeded in chamber slides and treated with 15 μm TP-301 for 6 h alone (TP301-D) or in combination with DEM"
https://openalex.org/W2149221810,"The Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a key regulator of mitosis. It is reported that the human peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase Pin1 binds to Plk1 from mitotic cell extracts in vitro. Here we demonstrate that Ser-65 in Pin1 is the major site for Plk1-specific phosphorylation, and the polo-box domain of Plk1 is required for this phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Pin1 by Plk1 does not affect its isomerase activity but rather is linked to its protein stability. Pin1 is ubiquitinated in HeLa S3 cells, and substitution of Glu for Ser-65 reduces the ubiquitination of Pin1. Furthermore, inhibition of Plk1 activity by expression of a dominant negative form of Plk1 or by transfection of small interfering RNA targeted to Plk1 enhances the ubiquitination of Pin1 and subsequently reduces the amount of Pin1 in human cancer cells. Since previous reports suggested that Plk1 is a substrate of Pin1, our work adds a new dimension to this interaction of two important mitotic regulators."

ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to HDL apolipoproteins and thus modulates HDL levels and atherogenesis. Unsaturated fatty acids, which are elevated in diabetes, impair the ABCA1 pathway in cultured cells by destabilizing ABCA1 protein. Here we examined the cellular pathway that mediates the ABCA1 destabilizing effects of fatty acids. The long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C completely reversed fatty acid-induced ABCA1 destabilization, indicating that fatty acids need to be activated to their CoA derivatives to enhance ABCA1 degradation. Unsaturated but not saturated fatty acids stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activity, the PLD inhibitor 1-butanol prevented the unsaturated fatty acid-induced reduction in ABCA1 levels, and the PLD2 activator mastoparan markedly reduced ABCA1 protein levels, implicating a role for PLD2 in the ABCA1 destabilizing effects of fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids and mastoparan increased phosphorylation of ABCA1 serines. PLD2 small interfering RNA abolished the ability of unsaturated fatty acids to inhibit lipid transport activity, to reduce protein levels, and to increase serine phosphorylation of ABCA1. The diacylglycerol analog oleoylacetylglycerol also reduced ABCA1 protein levels and increased its serine phosphorylation, suggesting that PLD2-generated diacylglycerols promote the destabilizing phosphorylation of ABCA1.

We found that linoleate-induced ABCA1 degradation was associated with increased PLD2 activity and phosphorylation of ABCA1 serines. Inhibiting PLD2 with 1-butanol or depleting PLD2 with siRNA reduced or abolished the ability of linoleate to promote ABCA1 phosphorylation and degradation. Thus, unsaturated fatty acids activate a PLD2 signaling pathway that phosphorylates ABCA1 serines and destabilizes the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLipoproteins and ApoA-I—LDL and HDL were prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.019–1.063 and 1.125–1.21 g/ml, respectively, and HDL was depleted of apoE and apoB by heparin-agarose chromatography (30Mendez A.J.

Washed cells were then incubated for 16 h with medium containing 5 mg/ml BSA in the presence or absence of 125 μm fatty acids (molar ratios to BSA of 0–1.8) or 100 μm diacylglycerol (DAG) analogs. Fatty acids were added from a stock solution bound to BSA at a 3.5 molar ratio and were adjusted to lower ratios by adding fatty acid-free BSA. To induce ABCA1, 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP was added to the medium for J774 and RAW 264.7, and 10 nm mifepristone was added to the medium for ABCA1-expressing BHK.

ApoA-I-mediated lipid efflux is expressed as the fraction of 3H-labeled lipid released into the medium after subtraction of values obtained in the absence of apoA-I.Immunoblot—Cells were washed and dislodged from the dish at 0 °C in buffer containing protease inhibitors. To isolate PLD2 or ABCA1, cell proteins were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors, and the extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against PLD2 or ABCA1 (Novus Biologicals). The antibody-antigen complex was isolated by protein A-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and electrophoresed in SDS using a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Each gel lane received immunoprecipitated protein corresponding to equal amounts of cells. For immunoblots of PLD2 from RAW 264.7 cells, PLD2 protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation with PLD2 antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblots of whole membrane ABCA1 from J774 cells, microsomal membranes were isolated from homogenized cells by ultracentrifugation, membrane proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and ABCA1 was identified by immunoblot analysis (20Oram J.F.

ABCA1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, and 32P-ABCA1 was visualized by autoradiography. ABCA1 phosphoserines, phosphothreonines, and phosphotyrosines were assayed by immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated ABCA1 using phosphoserine (Biomol), phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies that recognize a broad range of serine-, threonine-, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, respectively. ABCA1 serine phosphorylation was quantitated using OptiQuant software (Packard Instrument).PLD Activity—PLD activity was determined as described (29Chahdi A. Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

The samples were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 100 μl of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1) of which 25 μl was placed on a silica gel-plated sheet for thin layer chromatography in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (65:15:2) (v/v/v). Regions containing phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol were counted for 3H radioactivity after iodine staining.PLD2 siRNA Transfection—PLD2 siRNA (Ambion) was transfected into RAW 264.7 macrophages using siPORT™ Lipid (Ambion) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1 μlof20 μm siRNA was mixed with 41.5 μl of DMEM/BSA, and 2 μl of siPORT™ Lipid was diluted in 5.5 μl of DMEM/BSA and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the incubation, the diluted siPORT™ Lipid was combined with the diluted siRNA and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Total 50 μl of siRNA-siPORT™ Lipid complexes was applied to 200 μl DMEM/BSA in each well of a 24-well plate containing cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages at ∼70% confluence.RESULTSLong-chain Unsaturated Fatty Acids Inhibit ApoA-I-mediated Lipid Efflux in ABCA1-expressing BHK Cells—We previously demonstrated that long-chain unsaturated fatty acids decreased apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux in J774 macrophages in the presence of cAMP analog (22Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or LXR/RXR ligands (23Wang Y. Kurdi-Haidar B. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 972-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) by increasing ABCA1 degradation. To examine the effects of fatty acids in ABCA1-expressing BHK cells, we incubated BHK cells with mifepristone for 16 h in the presence or absence of different fatty acids. To avoid direct interactions of fatty acids with apoA-I, we performed lipid efflux assays during subsequent 2-h incubations with apoA-I but in the absence of fatty acids. Because ABCA1 is continually synthesized during this period, this assay provides a minimum estimate of the damaging effects of fatty acids on ABCA1 function.Similar to our previous results with 8-Br-cAMP-treated J774 macrophages, unsaturated fatty acids palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate, and arachidonate significantly decreased apoA-I-mediated [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 1A) and [3H]phospholipid (Fig. 1B) efflux in ABCA1-transfected BHK. Measurements of ABCA1 protein levels prior to the lipid efflux assays showed a much greater reduction in ABCA1 protein in response to treatment with these fatty acids (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, saturated fatty acids octanoate, palmitate, and stearate had no significant effect on either lipid efflux or ABCA1 levels. These results show that unsaturated fatty acids have the same inhibitory effect in both cAMP-treated murine macrophages and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells.Formation of CoA Derivatives Is Required for Fatty Acid Inhibition of ABCA1—To test whether free fatty acids need to be metabolized to inhibit ABCA1, we used triacsin C to inhibit long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, which converts free fatty acids into acyl-CoA as the first step of fatty acid metabolism. Both J774 (Fig. 2, A–C) and ABCA1-transfected BHK cells (Fig. 2, D–F) were incubated with or without triacsin C in the presence or absence of linoleate for 6 h, and apoA-I mediated lipid efflux and ABCA1 protein were measured. Triacsin C completely reversed the inhibitory effects of linoleate on apoA-I mediated cholesterol (Fig. 2, A and D) and phospholipid (Fig. 2, B and E) efflux and ABCA1 protein levels (Fig. 2, C and F). These results indicate that the free fatty acids have to be transported into the cell and metabolized to inhibit ABCA1.FIGURE 2CoA acylation is required for fatty acid inhibition of ABCA1. A and B, cholesterol-loaded J774 macrophages were incubated for 16 h with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP and 1 mg/ml BSA, then incubated for 6 h with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP and either 5 mg/ml BSA alone or BSA plus 125 μm linoleate (BSA molar ratio of 1.8) in the presence or absence of 10 μm triacsin C.

Unsaturated fatty acids palmitoleate, oleate, and linoleate significantly increased 32P incorporation into ABCA1 while saturated fatty acids palmitate and stearate had no or little effect, indicating unsaturated but not saturated fatty acids increase ABCA1 phosphorylation.

Immunoblots of immunoprecipitated ABCA1 showed that linoleate treatment increased phosphorylation of serine but not threonine (Fig. 3B). ABCA1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also unaffected by linoleate (data not shown). Quantitation by computer analyses revealed that the phosphoserine content of ABCA1 was doubled by linoleate treatment (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Linoleate promotes ABCA1 serine phosphorylation.

After 60 min, there was no difference in the phosphoserine content of ABCA1 in cells treated without or with linoleate, perhaps because of increased degradation of the phosphorylated protein.Unsaturated Fatty Acids Impair ABCA1 through a PLD2 Pathway—Because fatty acids can activate protein kinases through different signaling pathways, we examined the possibility that phospholipases play a role in the fatty acid-induced phosphorylation and destabilization of ABCA1. J774 cells were incubated with or without different inhibitors of phopholipase pathways in the presence or absence of linoleate for 6 h, and cholesterol efflux was measured (Fig. 4A). The inhibitory effect of linoleate was largely reversed by the PLD inhibitor 1-butanol but not by its isoform 2-butanol, which does not inhibit PLD (39Kotter K. Klein J. Brain Res. 1999; 830: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Neither the phospholipase A2 inhibitor ONO-RS-082 nor the phospholipase C inhibitor D609 affected linoleate inhibition of ABCA1. These results suggest that a PLD pathway is involved in the fatty acid-mediated impairment of ABCA1 activity.FIGURE 4PLD is required for linoleate-mediated inhibition of ABCA1. A, cholesterol-loaded J774 macrophages were incubated for 6 h with 0.5 mm 8-Br-cAMP and either 5 mg/ml BSA alone or BSA plus linoleate (BSA molar ratio of 1.8) in the presence of absence of 10 μm ONO-RS-082, 50 μg/ml D609, 0.4% (v/v) 1-butanol, or 0.4% 2-butanol.

https://openalex.org/W1968217876,"Detection and sequencing of mutations from clinical specimens is often complicated by the presence of an excess of nonmutated cells. To facilitate the detection and sequencing of minority mutations from clinical specimens, we developed wild-type blocking polymerase chain reaction (WTB-PCR). This technique allows sensitive detection of minority mutations in a tissue sample containing excess wild-type DNA. In WTB-PCR, a nonextendable locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotide binds tightly to a region of wild-type DNA known to develop point mutations. This LNA sequence blocks amplification of wild-type DNA during PCR while permitting amplification of mutant exon 15. Our results show that the LNA blocking oligonucleotide inhibits amplification of wild-type DNA in a dose-dependent manner. WTB-PCR was able to detect mutant DNA in clinical samples of melanoma tissue containing an excess of nonmelanoma cells. This method was also able to detect small amounts of point mutated or tandem mutated DNA diluted with a much larger concentration of wild-type DNA. This rapid and simple assay overcomes the limitations of current methods to detect minority mutations. The potential applications of WTB-PCR include early diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers."

The small GTPase RhoA and its regulators ECT2 and MgcRacGAP have been implicated in furrow ingression in mammalian cells, but the signaling upstream of these molecules remains unclear. We now show that the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)1 is sufficient to initiate cytokinesis. When mitotically synchronized cells were treated with the Cdk-specific inhibitor BMI-1026, the initiation of cytokinesis was induced precociously before chromosomal separation. Cytokinesis was also induced by the Cdk1-specific inhibitor purvalanol A but not by Cdk2/Cdk5- or Cdk4-specific inhibitors. Consistent with initiation of precocious cytokinesis by Cdk1 inhibition, introduction of anti-Cdk1 monoclonal antibody resulted in cells with aberrant nuclei. Depolymerization of mitotic spindles by nocodazole inhibited BMI-1026-induced precocious cytokinesis. However, in the presence of a low concentration of nocodazole, BMI-1026 induced excessive membrane blebbing, which appeared to be caused by formation of ectopic cleavage furrows. Depletion of ECT2 or MgcRacGAP by RNA interference abolished both of the phenotypes (precocious furrowing after nocodazole release and excessive blebbing in the presence of nocodazole). RNA interference of RhoA or expression of dominant-negative RhoA efficiently reduced both phenotypes. RhoA was localized at the cleavage furrow or at the necks of blebs. We propose that Cdk1 inactivation is sufficient to activate a signaling pathway leading to cytokinesis, which emanates from mitotic spindles and is regulated by ECT2, MgcRacGAP, and RhoA.

Chemical induction of cytokinesis will be a valuable tool to study the initiation mechanism of cytokinesis. One of the dynamic mitotic processes, anaphase, is also the beginning of cytokinesis. During anaphase, two sister chromatids separate and move to spindle poles, and the cell elongates, as do the pole-to-pole spindles. Simultaneously, a cleavage furrow starts to form in the equatorial plane. Positioning of the cleavage furrow is induced by signals from the mitotic spindle during early anaphase. The molecular mechanism of cleavage furrow positioning and its regulation remains largely unknown. Recent data suggest that a signal emanating from the central spindle is critical to initiate cytokinesis (1Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

Therefore, MgcRacGAP is required for both mitosis and cytokinesis.The molecules in the signaling pathways regulating cytokinesis downstream from RhoA are not well documented, but a Rho effector kinase, ROCK, was found to accumulate at the cleavage furrow and shown to phosphorylate intermediate filaments at the furrow (13Kosako H.

Another Rho effector, citron kinase, is critical for cytokinesis, as dominant-negative citron kinase strongly inhibits cytokinesis (14Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H.

In anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles as Cdk1 activity decreases. Expression of a destruction-resistant cyclin B reportedly inhibits cytokinesis, suggesting that cyclin B negatively regulates cytokinesis and M phase exit (18Wheatley S.P. Hinchcliffe E.H. Glotzer M.

However, Cdk1 activity is required for M phase entry, making it difficult to study the regulation of cytokinesis by Cdk1. Although a number of Cdk inhibitors have been reported, these did not show a narrow specificity to Cdks. Recently, a novel kinase inhibitor, BMI-1026, has been shown to specifically inhibit Cdks, leading to forced mitotic exit (20Seong Y.S. Min C. Li L. Yang J.Y. Kim S.Y. Cao X. Kim K. Yuspa S.H. Chung H.H. Lee K.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7384-7391PubMed Google Scholar). BMI-1026 specifically inhibits mitotic Cdks but not other mitotic kinases such as Plk1 and Aurora A. Furthermore, mitotically arrested U2OS cells treated with BMI-1026 exhibit G1-like morphology with incomplete chromosome separation following membrane blebbing in the presence of nocodazole (20Seong Y.S.

In this study, we utilized this novel Cdk1 inhibitor to investigate the mechanism of cytokinesis related to the Rho signaling pathway. We show that cytokinesis can be induced in mitotic cells by BMI-1026. We also found that RhoA and two Rho regulators, ECT2 and MgcRacGAP, are essential to furrow ingression induced by BMI-1026. These observations suggest that inhibition of Cdk1 activity is sufficient to induce cytokinesis, which is regulated through ECT2, MgcRacGAP, and RhoA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Synchronization—The HeLa cell line and its derivative, which expresses GFP-histone H2B, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin G plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Synchronization of the cell cycle was carried out by double thymidine block (21Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

After the second thymidine treatment, cells were released into fresh medium containing 40 ng/ml of nocodazole (Sigma) to arrest the cells at prometaphase. In some experiments, mitotic cells were collected by the knock-off (mechanical disruption) procedure after nocodazole treatment at a concentration of 40 ng/ml for 6-10 h. The remaining adherent cells were used as interphase cells. BMI-1026 has been described (20Seong Y.S. Min C. Li L. Yang J.Y. Kim S.Y. Cao X. Kim K. Yuspa S.H. Chung H.H. Lee K.S.

Purvalanol A, PNU112455A, and Cdk4 inhibitor were from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA.Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Samples were separated and analyzed on 6 or 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBS for 30-60 min at room temperature, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1-6 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG. The signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then washed with PBS. Samples were incubated with PBS containing 2% serum for 1 h and then with a rabbit anti-survivin antibody (Abcam) and a mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. Samples were then treated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) and DAPI (Sigma). Images were observed with the Zeiss Axiovert S-100 fluorescence microscopy using Openlab software (Improvision).RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNAs of 21 nucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO), and used as siRNAs.

X65324) was used as a control. HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and transfected with siRNA as follows. In a tube, Opti-MEM I (250 μl) was mixed with 15 μl of the stock RNA. In a second tube, 60 μl of Opti-MEM I was incubated with 15 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 8 min at room temperature. The two mixtures above were combined, gently mixed, and incubated for 22 min at room temperature. The entire mixture was then added to the cells in 2 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Knockdown levels of the proteins were estimated with Western blotting 24-48 h after transfection.Delivery of FITC Antibody into Cultured Cells—FITC-conjugated anti-p34Cdk1 antibody (anti-Cdc2 p34; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was delivered into HeLa cells using Provectin (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates. FITC-conjugated anti-p34Cdk1 antibody or FITC-labeled goat IgG (control) was diluted in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and added into tubes which contained Provectin dry film. The Provectin/antibody mix was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then brought the volume up to 250 μl with serum-free medium. The mixture was transferred onto cells and incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium. The culture was supplemented with serum and continued to incubate for 12 h. Cells were fixed with methanol, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cell morphology was examined using the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. For quantitative analysis, at least 400 cells were counted from three independent slides.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells synchronized at prometaphase, were treated with BMI-1026 (200 nm) with or without nocodazole (40 ng/ml) or taxol (1 μm) for 3 h. Cells were fixed with methanol and followed by acetone for 5 min each at -20 °C. After incubation for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-survivin polyclonal antibody at 1:200 (R&D Systems) and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody at 1:500 (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing three times with PBS, cells were labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probe). Nuclei were stained with DAPI and were examined with the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells expressing GFP-histone H2B were cultured in a 35-mm dish on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert S-100 inverted microscope equipped with an environmental chamber. Time-lapse images were captured at 3-min intervals by the Photometric digital camera controlled by Openlab software.RESULTSCdk1 Inhibition Precociously Induces Cleavage Furrow Ingression in Mitotic Cells—To test the effects of the Cdk1 inhibition on cytokinesis, HeLa cells expressing GFP-histone H2B were arrested at prometaphase by nocodazole, released from the arrest, and then treated with the Cdk inhibitor BMI-1026. The morphological changes were recorded by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, BMI-1026 potently induced cleavage furrow ingression. Furrow ingression was observed at an earlier time point in BMI-1026-treated cells (10-15 min after release from nocodazole) than untreated cells (90 min after release from nocodazole). Moreover, although untreated cells started cytokinesis after chromosome separation, furrow ingression was initiated before chromosome separation in BMI-1026-treated cells. This phenotype, induced by BMI-1026 after nocodazole release, was very similar to the Cut phenotype (23Saka Y. Yanagida M. Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, a population of BMI-1026-treated cells did not undergo abscission, and the emerging daughter cells subsequently merged to generate cells with aberrant nuclei. As BMI-1026 specifically inhibits mitotic Cdk but not other mitotic kinases such as Plk1 and Aurora A (20Seong Y.S. Min C. Li L. Yang J.Y. Kim S.Y. Cao X. Kim K. Yuspa S.H. Chung H.H. Lee K.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7384-7391PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that Cdk1 inhibition induces cytokinesis initiation. To confirm that BMI-1026 induces cytokinesis by inhibiting the Cdk1/cyclin B complex, we tested other Cdk inhibitors. Purvalanol A displays a narrow specificity to Cdk1/cyclin B (IC50 = 4 nm) compared with that to Cdk1/cyclin A (IC50 = 70 nm), Cdk2/cyclin E (IC50 = 35 nm), and Cdk5/p35 (IC50 = 75 nm). As shown in Fig. 1B, Purvalanol A induced furrow ingression in mitotic cells as BMI-1026 did. In contrast, the Cdk2/Cdk5-specific inhibitor PNU112455A or Cdk4 inhibitor did not display this activity. These results suggest that Cdk1 inhibition is sufficient to induce cleavage furrow ingression.We also utilized another method to inhibit Cdk1. We introduced affinity-purified anti-Cdk1 monoclonal antibody to asynchronous HeLa cells by Provectin. Consistent with the requirement of Cdk1 for the entry to M phase, the appearance of mitotic cells was strongly inhibited by anti-Cdk1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that anti-Cdk1 effectively inhibited Cdk1 in these cells. A population of anti-Cdk1-transfected cells should enter M phase before Cdk1 was effectively inhibited. The inhibition of Cdk1 by anti-Cdk1 antibody after M phase entry might induce cleavage furrow ingression before chromosome separation as BMI-1026 did. Although control IgG-transfected cells generate cells with single nuclei, anti-Cdk1-introduced cells frequently contained multiple nuclei of different sizes (Fig. 2). These results support that inhibition of Cdk1 after M phase entry induces precocious cleavage furrow ingression before chromosome separation. Efficient generation of multinucleate cells by anti-Cdk1 also support the notion that abscission did not occur frequently after cleavage furrow ingression induced by Cdk1 inhibition. All of these results suggest that Cdk1 inhibition is sufficient to induce cleavage furrow ingression in mitotic cells.FIGURE 2Introduction of anti-Cdk1 antibody induces cells with aberrant nuclei. A, FITC-conjugated anti-p34Cdk1 antibody or FITC-conjugated control IgG was delivered into HeLa cells using Provectin and cultured for 12 h. Cells were then fixed with methanol, and nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cell morphology was examined under fluorescence microscope. B, quantitative analysis. At least 400 cells were counted from three independent slides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Normal Mitotic Spindles Are Required for Furrowing Induced by Cdk1 Inhibition—There is accumulating evidence that cytokinesis is induced by signals emanating from overlapping mitotic spindles (1Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test whether spindles are required for furrow ingression induced by BMI-1026, we performed similar assays in the presence of the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole. HeLa cells were arrested at prometaphase by nocodazole, and BMI-1026 was added without removal of nocodazole. In the presence of a high concentration of nocodazole (300 ng/ml), mitotically rounded cells spread without cleavage furrow ingression within 30 min after BMI-1026 treatment (Fig. 3A, top panels), suggesting that the induction of furrow ingression by BMI-1026 requires mitotic spindles. Induction of cell spreading by BMI-1026 was consistent with a previous report that BMI-1026 causes precocious mitotic exit in U2OS cells (20Seong Y.S. Min C. Li L. Yang J.Y. Kim S.Y. Cao X. Kim K. Yuspa S.H. Chung H.H. Lee K.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7384-7391PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we examined the effects of partial depolymerization of mitotic spindles on induction of furrow ingression by BMI-1026. In the presence of a low concentration of nocodazole (40 ng/ml), BMI-1026 induced excessive membrane blebbing in most of the cells (Fig. 3A, middle panels). Strong tubulin staining was observed in these blebs (see Fig. 7), but survivin was not concentrated in the blebs (data not shown). To test the possibility that incomplete depolymerization of mitotic spindles is responsible for this phenotype induced by BMI-1026, the microtubule stabilizing agent taxol was utilized in place of nocodazole. As shown in Fig. 3A, BMI-1026 also potently induced membrane blebbing in the presence of taxol. Localization of tubulin, but not survivin, was evident on the blebs induced by BMI-1026 in the presence of taxol (Fig. 3B, see also Fig. 7). However, survivin was concentrated at the structures, which could be identified as the midzone created by abnormal cytokinesis (Fig. 3B). We further tested the localization of two Rho regulators, ECT2 and MgcRacGAP, which are known to localize at the midbody during cytokinesis (4Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These proteins were localized at structures that were similar to the midbody, although cytokinesis was abnormal in these cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, BMI-1026 appeared to induce both excessive blebbing and furrowing in the presence of taxol. Presumably, furrowing was initiated at the sites where microtubule bundling was evident and thus chromosomal passenger proteins and Rho regulators accumulated. Taken together, these results suggest that perturbation of normal mitotic spindles, but not their complete disappearance, is responsible for excessive membrane blebbing induced by BMI-1026.FIGURE 3Mitotic spindles are required for BMI-1026-induced cytokinesis. A, a failure to induce cytokinesis by BMI-1026 in the presence of nocodazole. HeLa cells arrested with 300 ng/ml (upper) or 40 ng/ml (middle) nocodazole or 50 nm taxol (bottom) were treated with 200 nm BMI-1026, and then their morphologies were recorded by time-lapse microscopy. Similar results were obtained with at least two independent experiments. B, HeLa cells arrested with 50 nm taxol were treated with BMI-1026 for 30 min. Cells were then fixed with methanol and stained with the antibody for the indicated proteins or DNA (DAPI).

Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We first tested whether cleavage furrow ingression induced by BMI-1026 after release from nocodazole is affected by knockdown of ECT2 or MgcRacGAP. HeLa cells expressing GFP-histone H2B were transfected with siRNAs for ECT2 or MgcRacGAP, arrested with nocodazole, released to fresh medium, and then treated with BMI-1026. These siRNAs efficiently knocked down ECT2 and MgcRacGAP as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Whereas BMI-1026 induced precocious cleavage furrow ingression in 97% of control siRNA-transfected cells (n = 100), most of ECT2- or MgcRacGAP-siRNA-transfected cells spread without furrowing within 80 min after BMI-1026 treatment (Fig. 4B). Only a small population of ECT2-siRNA-transfected cells (10%) or MgcRacGAP-siRNA-transfected cells (16%) exhibited furrowing (n = 100). These results suggest that ECT2 and MgcRacGAP are required for BMI-1026-induced cytokinesis.FIGURE 4ECT2 and MgcRacGAP are essential for BMI-1026-induced furrow ingression and bleb formation. A, knockdown of ECT2 and MgcRacGAP in HeLa cells. HeLa cells expressing GFP-histone H2B were transfected with siRNA for luciferase (control), ECT2, or MgcRacGAP, and then synchronized by the thymidine/nocodazole protocol. Knockdown levels were estimated by immunoblotting analysis using antibodies specific to ECT2, MgcRacGAP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). B, effects of ECT2 or MgcRacGAP knockdown on BMI-1026-induced precocious furrowing.

HeLa cells expressing GFP-histone H2B were transfected with siRNA for ECT2 or MgcRacGAP, arrested with nocodazole (40 ng/ml), and then treated with BMI-1026. Whereas most of the control siRNA-treated cells (98%, n = 100) exhibited excessive blebbing (Fig. 4C, left, 30 min) and then spread (Fig. 4C, left, 72 min), most of ECT2 siRNA- or MgcRacGAP-siRNA transfectants did not show this phenotype (Fig. 4C, middle and right). Only a minor fraction of ECT2 siRNA-transfected cells (5%) and MgcRacGAP siRNA-transfected cells (17%) showed excessive blebbing (n = 100). These results suggest that ECT2 and MgcRacGAP are required for the excessive blebbing induced by BMI-1026.RhoA Knockdown Reduces BMI-1026-induced Precocious Furrowing and Membrane Blebbing—It has been reported that Rho GTPases play a critical role in cell division (24Mabuchi I.

https://openalex.org/W2005837830,"Type 1 fimbriae of enterobacteria are heteropolymeric organelles of adhesion composed of FimH, a mannose-binding lectin, and a shaft composed primarily of FimA. We compared the binding activities of recombinant clones expressing type 1 fimbriae from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium for gut and uroepithelial cells and for various soluble mannosylated proteins. Each fimbria was characterized by its capacity to bind particular epithelial cells and to aggregate mannoproteins. However, when each respective FimH subunit was cloned and expressed in the absence of its shaft as a fusion protein with MalE, each FimH bound a wide range of mannose-containing compounds. In addition, we found that expression of FimH on a heterologous fimbrial shaft, e.g. K. pneumoniae FimH on the E. coli fimbrial shaft or vice versa, altered the binding specificity of FimH such that it closely resembled that of the native heterologous type 1 fimbriae. Furthermore, attachment to and invasion of bladder epithelial cells, which were mediated much better by native E. coli type 1 fimbriae compared with native K. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae, were found to be dependent on the background of the fimbrial shaft (E. coli versus K. pneumoniae) rather than the background of the FimH expressed. Thus, the distinct binding specificities of different enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae cannot be ascribed solely to the primary structure of their respective FimH subunits, but are also modulated by the fimbrial shaft on which each FimH subunit is presented, possibly through conformational constraints imposed on FimH by the fimbrial shaft. The capacity of type 1 fimbrial shafts to modulate the tissue tropism of different enterobacterial species represents a novel function for these highly organized structures.

The capacity of type 1 fimbrial shafts to modulate the tissue tropism of different enterobacterial species represents a novel function for these highly organized structures. Fimbrial lectins, which are filamentous organelles of bacterial adhesion, are generally classified according to the structure of the carbohydrates they recognize (1Ofek I. Hasty D.L. Doyle R.J. Bacterial Adhesion to Animal Cells and Tissues.ASM Press, Herndon, VA. 2003; Google Scholar). Their specificity is usually defined as the simplest carbohydrate structure, typically a monosaccharide, that best inhibits lectin-mediated adhesion. This is referred to as the primary sugar specificity of the lectin (2Ofek I. Hasty D.L. Abraham S.N. Sharon N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 485: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within lectins possessing the same primary sugar specificity, differences in the binding of different oligosaccharides is often observed. This is referred to as the fine sugar specificity (2Ofek I. Hasty D.L. Abraham S.N. Sharon N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 485: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type 1 fimbriae, the primary sugar specificity of which is for d-mannose, are expressed in Escherichia coli as well as almost in all enterobacteria. Based primarily on studies of E. coli type 1 fimbriae, it is known that these organelles are heteropolymers composed of a major subunit and at least three minor subunits (3Maurer L. Orndorff P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 640-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Orndorff P.E. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 736-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Klemm P. Christiansen G. Mol. Gen.

The minor subunit FimH is responsible for the sugar specificity of type 1 fimbriae because inactivation of the fimH gene abolishes the binding activity of the bacteria without any apparent effect on fimbrial expression (3Maurer L. Orndorff P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 640-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Minion F.C. Abraham S.N. Beachey E.H. Goguen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, isolated FimH mimics many of the mannose-specific binding reactions of type 1 fimbriae (9Tewari R. MacGregor J.I. Ikeda T. Little J.R. Hultgren S.J. Abraham S.N. J. Biol.

On the other hand, FimA is the major subunit that makes up >95% of the fimbrial shaft and is structurally and antigenically heterogeneous among different species (11Ghosh S. Mittal A. Ganguly N.K.

FimH has been crystallized, and the sugar-binding region was mapped to the N-terminal half (residues 1–156) of the molecule, whereas the region that associates with the fimbrial shaft was mapped to the C-terminal half (residues 160–277) of the FimH molecule (23Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Because fimbrial proteins are not typically soluble in solution, FimH was crystallizable only when bound to its periplasmic chaperone, FimC (23Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). One of the earliest indications of heterogeneity in the fine sugar specificity among type 1 fimbriae from different strains was the finding that the binding reactions mediated by various enteric type 1 fimbriae exhibit differing sensitivities to competition with defined mannose-containing compounds (24Firon N. Ofek I. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 120: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Firon N. Ofek I. Sharon N. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 1088-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reports proposed that the receptor-binding pocket on Salmonella type 1 fimbriae is different from that found on the fimbriae of E. coli or other enteric bacteria. Subsequently, heterogeneity in fine sugar specificity was discovered even within the same species (26Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Significantly, it was found that different E. coli type 1 fimbriae can be classified into those that bind either trimannose or monomannose and those that recognize trimannose only (26Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been suggested in the literature to explain these interspecies and intraspecies differences in the fine sugar specificity of the type 1 fimbrial lectin. Madison et al. (27Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the interspecies (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) differences in fine sugar specificity is influenced by the fimbrial shaft, which may induce distinct conformational changes in its FimH subunit. Sokurenko et al. (26Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) found that the intraspecies heterogeneity in the fine sugar specificity of type 1 fimbriae from different E. coli isolates can be attributed to the allelic variation in the primary amino acid structure of FimH. The heterogeneity between different enterobacterial species and within the same species has been implicated in contributing to different infectious processes. For example, it has been argued that uropathogenic E. coli clones emerge in a process called pathoadaptation to express type 1 fimbriae with specificity for monomannose and trimannose, whereas fecal isolates are specific for trimannose only (28Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Dykhuizen D.E. Ofek I. Wu X.R. Krogfelt K.A. Struve C. Schembri M.A. Hasty D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8922-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of the interspecies differences among enterobacteria discussed above has not been studied. Here, we investigate whether the fimbrial shaft-driven modulation of the fine sugar specificity of various enterobacterial species influences tissue tropism. We show that the apparent heterogeneity in binding among type 1 fimbriae is modified by the fimbrial shaft and is responsible for variations in tissue tropism.

The human BEC line 5637 (ATCC HTB-9) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate.

Briefly, cells were plated onto 96-well plates, incubated for 24–48 h, and then fixed overnight with 2.5% paraformaldehyde. The monolayers were washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS). 100 μl of each bacterial strain to be tested (A600 nm ∼ 1.0) in PBS was incubated with the monolayers for 30–60 min at room temperature on a rotating shaker. Non-adherent bacteria were removed by washing the cell monolayers three times with PBS. 50 μl of Luria broth was applied to each monolayer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. MTT (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS at 2 mg/ml, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C until used. 50 μl of 2 mg/ml MTT was added to all wells, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to allow reduction of MTT to formazan by live bacteria. 150 μl of isopropyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid at a ratio of 24:1 was added to each well to solubilize the formazan, and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm using a Tecan Sunrise remote microplate reader. Bacterial Invasion Assay—Bacterial invasion of BECs was determined as described previously (31Duncan M.J. Li G. Shin J.S. Carson J.L. Abraham S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5637 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and grown to confluence. Bladder cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100 bacteria/host cell by the addition of 100 μl of each bacteria to be tested diluted in serum-free cell culture medium containing 10 mg/ml BSA (A600 nm ∼ 0.05). Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing the membrane-impermeable antibiotic gentamycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen) to kill extracellular bacteria. Incubation was continued for an additional 1 h, after which each well was washed three times with PBS, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and plated onto Luria broth-agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics. Aggregation of Mannose-containing Glycoproteins—The aggregation of various mannosylated glycoproteins by various type 1 fimbriated bacteria was undertaken as described previously (30Thankavel K.

Sharon N. Nature. 1977; 265: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of bacterial cells were washed twice with sterile PBS before being resuspended in PBS. 980 μl of each bacterial suspension (A600 nm ∼ 1.75) was transferred to a cuvette. 20 μl of the glycoprotein being tested (10 mg/ml in PBS) was then added to each cuvette. The cuvettes were covered with Parafilm and shaken gently for 1 min, at which point they were placed into a spectrophotometer, and a reading at 600 nm was taken. As a control, 980 μl of bacterial suspension (A600 nm ∼ 1.75) was mixed with 20 μl of PBS. Subsequent readings were taken at 600 nm after a total elapsed time of 5 and 15 min and every 15 min thereafter for 1 h. The A600 nm reading dropped as the bacteria aggregated and settled at the bottom of the cuvettes. Aggregation was expressed as absorbance as a function of time. To measure agglutination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 950 μl of each bacterial suspension (A600 nm ∼ 1.75) was transferred to a cuvette. 50 μl of a 0.5% (w/v) suspension of S. cerevisiae was added to each cuvette, and the absorbance was measured as described above. The type 1 fimbriae-deficient E. coli strain ORN103 was used as a control. All glycoproteins employed in this assay were purchased from Sigma and are listed in TABLE TWO.TABLE TWOInteractions of various type 1 fimbriated bacteria and MalE/FimH fusion proteins with glycoproteinsGlycoproteinsGlycoprotein aggregation by bacteria expressing fimbriae from different speciesGlycoprotein binding by various MalE/FimH moleculesEcaEc, E. coli; Kp, K. pneumoniae; St, S. typhimuriumKpStFimHEFimHKFimHSS. cerevisiae mannan++++++p-Aminophenyl α-d-mannopyranoside/BSA++++++Horseradish peroxidase+––+++Porcine thyroglobulin+––+++Bovine pancreas RNase B–––+++Soybean agglutinin–––+++Human colostrum IgA–––+++Chicken ovalbumin–––+++Galactose/BSAbGlycoproteins with little or no mannose––––––FetuinbGlycoproteins with little or no mannose––––––a Ec, E. coli; Kp, K. pneumoniae; St, S. typhimuriumb Glycoproteins with little or no mannose Open table in a new tab DNA Manipulations—Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) were used as recommended by the supplier. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). A complete list of the plasmids that were generated as well as their gene products are described in TABLE ONE. Determination of the DNA Sequences of the fimF, fimG, and fimH Genes of E. coli and K. pneumoniae—The sequences of the E. coli strain J96 and K. pneumoniae strain IA551 fimF and fimG genes carried on the pSH2 and pBP7 plasmids, respectively, were determined using primers FimF1 (5′-TCG CCA ATT ATC AAC TGC CAC-3′) and FimF2 (5′-CCT GTA TCG TCG CAC TTG C-3′) for fimF and primers FimG1 (5′-TAA TGG CGA CAC AGG TGC-3′) and FimG2 (5′-ATG ACC AGG CAT TTA CCG AC-3′) for fimG. The sequence of the E. coli strain J96 fimH gene on the pSH2 plasmid was determined using primers KP1 (5′-TGG TCG GTA AAT GCC TGG TCA TTC-3′) and KP2 (5′-CAT TAG CAA TGT CCT GTG ATT TCT-3′), derived from the published fimH sequence of E. coli K12 strain PC31 (5Klemm P. Christiansen G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To obtain the sequence of the K. pneumoniae strain IA551 fimH gene, a 3.5-kb PvuI-SalI fragment containing fimHK was released from the pBP7 plasmid, gel-purified, blunt-ended, and cloned into the SmaI site of the pUC19 cloning vehicle. This construct was named pKT201, and the insert was sequenced completely using an automated fluorescence sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Generation of malE/fimHE, malE/fimHK, and malE/fimHS Gene Fusion Constructs—Plasmids pSH2, pBP7, and pISF101, which contain the entire type 1 fim gene clusters of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium, respectively, were used as the PCR templates to generate fimHE, fimHK, and fimHS (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium fimH genes, respectively) DNA sequences. The PCR products were cloned into plasmid vector pMAL-p2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) using standard techniques as described previously (30Thankavel K. Shah A.H. Cohen M.S. Ikeda T. Lorenz R.G. Curtiss R. II I Abraham S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5797-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to produce plasmids pKT100, pKT213, and pKT304. Primers KP7 (5′-GCC GGA ATT CTG TAA AAC CGC CAA TGG TAC C-3′) and KP8 (5′-GGG CAA GCT TCT ATT ATT GAT AAA CAA AAG TCA C-3′) were used to generate the fimHE and fimHK DNA fragments employed in this study. Primers KP9 (5′-GCC GGA ATT CTG CCG TAA TTC AAA CGG GAC G-3′) and KP10 (5′-GGG CAA GCT TCT ATT AAT CAT AAT CGA CTC GTA G-3′) were used to generate the fimHS DNA fragment. Construction of Bacterial Strains Expressing Hybrid Type 1 Fimbriae— These strains were produced as described previously (27Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5.0-kb BamHI fragment from plasmid pSH2 or a 5.5-kb BamHI-SalI fragment from plasmid pBP7 was inserted into a similarly cut site in a pUC18 cloning vector to make plasmids pBM20 and pBM10, respectively. These fragments contained E. coli or K. pneumoniae fimH as well as the minor fimbrial subunit genes fimF and fimG, which are thought to allow optimal functional activity of FimH on a heterologous fimbrial filament (27Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids were then transformed into E. coli strain ORN103 that had been previously transformed with either pUT2002 (E. coli FimH- type 1 fimbriae) or pMD7 (K. pneumoniae FimH- type 1 fimbriae). Transformant designations such as FimHE-ShaftE and FimHK/ShaftE show the presence of FimH and the fimbrial shaft, the source of each (E for E. coli and K for K. pneumoniae), and the presence of one or two plasmids (hyphen or slash, respectively). Plasmid pMD7 (in this work, used interchangeably with pBP799 (27Madison B. Ofek I. Clegg S. Abraham S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was produced by replacing the BglII-SalI fragment of pBP7 (containing the majority of K. pneumoniae fimH) with a short linker made from oligonucleotides MD1 (5′-GAT CTT TGA TAA GAG CTC TGA TAG-3′) and MD2 (5′-TCG ACT ATC AGA GCT CTT ATC AAA-3′). A depiction of the plasmids created and a description of the fimbrial phenotype of each strain produced are given in supplemental Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, respectively. To rule out the possible effects of heterologous FimF and FimG, two additional plasmids were created by PCR to clone fimH alone and to insert it into SacI-SphI-cut pUC18. The following primers were used to clone E. coli fimH: forward, 5′-GAG AGC TCA ACC CGA AGA GAT GAT TGT A-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCC GCA TGC TTA TTG ATA AAC AAA AGT CAC-3′. The forward primer 5′-GAG AGC TCA ACC CGA AGA GAT AAT TGT C-3′ was used to clone K. pneumoniae fimH in conjunction with the reverse primer used to clone E. coli fimH. Sequencing of each fimH clone was performed to verify that the amino acid sequence of each FimH protein was correct. The plasmids carrying K. pneumoniae or E. coli fimH (designated pMD108 and pMD109, respectively) were then transformed into E. coli strain ORN103 that had been previously transformed with either pUT2002 or pMD7 to create hybrid type 1 fimbriae in the absence of heterologous FimF and FimG. Protein Sequence Analysis—Software programs used to analyze the DNA-derived protein sequence data have been described (30Thankavel K. Shah A.H. Cohen M.S. Ikeda T. Lorenz R.G. Curtiss R.

Assays for Fimbriation—Bacterial cell expression of type 1 fimbriae was confirmed by mannose-sensitive yeast agglutination. Purification of MalE/FimH Fusion Proteins, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—The fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (10Thankavel K. Madison B. Ikeda T. Malaviya R. Shah A.H. Arumugam P.M. Abraham S.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis and immunostaining of specific proteins were performed as described previously (10Thankavel K. Madison B. Ikeda T. Malaviya R. Shah A.H. Arumugam P.M. Abraham S.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using antisera raised against FimHE-(1–100). Verification of FimA and FimH Expression—To examine the relative amounts of the FimA shaft subunit and the FimH adhesin subunit expressed by each bacterial strain, each strain was grown statically for 48 h and washed with PBS by centrifugation. Bacteria (∼1 × 1010) of each strain were boiled in acid for 5 min to dissociate the fimbrial subunits, neutralized by the addition of NaOH, brought to 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for an additional 2 min (33Dodd D.C. Eisenstein B.I. Infect. Immun. 1982; 38: 764-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and 100 μg of total protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed using rabbit antisera raised against E. coli FimA or FimHE-(1–100). Mouse BEC and GEC Overlay Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (10Thankavel K. Madison B. Ikeda T. Malaviya R. Shah A.H. Arumugam P.M. Abraham S.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified fusion proteins (MalE/FimHE, MalE/FimHK, and MalE/FimHS) and MalE were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, the nitrocellulose blot was overlaid with 5 × 106 biotinylated mouse BECs or GECs in the presence and absence of 100 mm methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. BECs and GECs were biotinylated as described previously (12Muller K.H. Collinson S.K. Trust T.J. Kay W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the blot was rinsed several times with PBS, and the bound cells were probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin, followed by the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. Glycoprotein Overlay Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (30Thankavel K. Shah A.H. Cohen M.S. Ikeda T. Lorenz R.G. Curtiss R. II I Abraham S.N. J. Biol.

Here, the homophilic interaction of JAM-C is presented and functionally characterized to mediate tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions. Recombinant soluble JAM-C in fluid phase bound to immobilized JAM-C as assessed in a purified system; moreover, JAM-C-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells adhered to immobilized JAM-C. The homophilic interaction of JAM-C was mediated by the isolated amino-terminal Ig domain (D1), but not the carboxyl-terminal Ig domain (D2), of the molecule. Dimerization of JAM-A is dependent on the sequence RVE in the amino-terminal Ig domain. This motif is conserved in JAM-C (Arg64-Ile65-Glu66), and a single amino acid mutation in this motif (E66R) abolished the homophilic interaction of JAM-C. The lung carcinoma cell line NCI-H522 was found to express JAM-C. NCI-H522 cells adhered to immobilized JAM-C, as well as to JAM-C-transfected CHO cells, but not to mock-transfected CHO cells or to CHO cells transfected with the JAM-C mutant (E66R). Adhesion of NCI-H522 cells to JAM-C protein or JAM-C-transfected CHO cells was abolished in the presence of soluble JAM-C or the isolated D1. Furthermore, the adhesion of NCI-H522 cells to endothelial cells was significantly blocked by soluble JAM-C or the isolated D1. Thus, JAM-C undergoes a homophilic interaction via the Arg64-Ile65-Glu66 motif on the membrane-distal Ig domain of the molecule.

At their final carboxyl terminus all three molecules have a class-II PDZ domain binding motif, which predisposes them to interact with PDZ domain-containing molecules, such as the ones found in tight junctions (1Bazzoni G.

A dual function has been suggested for JAMs that appear to regulate both leukocyte/platelet/endothelial cell interactions in the immune system and tight junction formation in epithelial and endothelial cells (2Ebnet K.

The expression pattern of JAM-B (also called VE-JAM, human JAM-2, mouse JAM-3) is more restricted, as it localizes on vascular and lymphatic endothelium and especially at high endothelial venules (6Palmeri D. van Zante A.

The homophilic interaction of JAM-A is regulated by the dimerization of the molecule, which requires the RVE residues at positions 58-60 of the VH fold (16Kostrewa D. Brockhaus M. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E.

However, direct evidence for cell-cell adhesion events mediated through a homophilic interaction of JAM-C has not been reported so far.During blood-borne tumor cell metastasis the circulating tumor cells that have detached from the primary tumor interact with the vascular endothelium. This interaction is a crucial step preceding the invasion of the target organ by the tumor cells (19Engers R. Gabbert H.E. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 126: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Integrins, and especially β1 integrins, as well as other cell adhesion receptors play an important role in mediating interactions of several tumor cells, including non-small lung carcinoma and melanoma cells, with endothelial cells (20Seftor R.E Seftor E.A Hendrix M.J. Cancer Metastasis. Rev. 1999; 18: 359-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Yoshimasu T. Sakurai T. Oura S. Hirai I. Tanino H. Kokawa Y. Naito Y. Okamura Y. Ota I. Tani N. Matsuura N. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The process of tumor cell metastasis is thought to share many similarities with the multi-step process of leukocyte extravasation (22Giavazzi R. Foppolo M. Dossi R. Remuzzi A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 3038-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Whether JAM-C or any other JAM family member may be expressed on tumor cells (especially of epithelial origin) and whether JAM-C may participate in tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions has not been studied so far.These diverse observations have prompted us to investigate the homophilic interaction of JAM-C, to characterize this interaction biochemically, and to study its functional consequences in tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions. We identified JAM-C-expressing tumor cells and have demonstrated that the homophilic interaction of JAM-C mediates cell adhesive events between JAM-C-expressing tumor cells and the endothelium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant soluble human JAM-C (sJAM-C) was produced as previously described (18Chavakis T. Keiper T. Matz-Westphal R. Hersemeyer K. Sachs U.J. Nawroth P.P. Preissner K.T. Santoso S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55602-55608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Fc-JAM-A, Fc-JAM-B, antibodies against human JAM-B, and tumor necrosis factor-α were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Purified I domain of Mac-1 was provided by Dr. D. Tuckwell (School of Biological Sciences, Manchester, UK). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) Gi11 against human JAM-C and biotinylated Gi11 were described previously (9Santoso S. Sachs U.J.H. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar); respective isotype-matched control antibodies, as well as secondary antibodies, were from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Blocking mAb against CD18 was from Alexis (Gruenberg, Germany), and blocking mAb against CD29 was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and were cultivated as previously described (23Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T. Nagashima M. Morser J. Arnold B. Preissner K.T. Nawroth P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (NCI-H522 and NCI-H322M) that both have mutant p53 function were provided from the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD) and were cultivated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) (24Roschke A.V. Tonon G. Gehlhaus K.S. McTyre N. Bussey K.J. Lababidi S. Scudiero D.A. Weinstein J.N. Kirsch I.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8634-8647PubMed Google Scholar).Production of Soluble Recombinant JAM-C IgG Fusion Proteins—Fc fusion proteins of soluble recombinant JAM-C (Fc-JAM-C), the amino-terminal first Ig domain of JAM-C (Fc-D1), and the carboxyl-terminal second Ig domain of JAM-C (Fc-D2) were produced in High-Five insect cells as previously described (25Peterson J.A. Visentin G.P. Neman P.J. Aster R.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs of JAM-C encoding for the soluble JAM-C (nucleotides 128-766; Val33-Gly-243, numbering according to NCBI/AF448478), D1 (nucleotides 128-457; residues Val33-Thr141), and D2 (nucleotides 428-766; residues Glu132-Glu243) were amplified from the full-length JAM-C in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4 by PCR using Turbo Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were inserted by blunt-end ligation into the EcoRV site of pIgplus vector (R & D Systems) and were subcloned into the DH5α high efficiency competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Plasmids from positive clones were then shuttled into pIB/V5-His Topo expression vector (TA expression kit; Invitrogen) by PCR of JAM-C pIgplus constructs using TaqGold polymerase (Applied Biosystem) and pIgplus-specific primers. All three JAM-C pIB constructs were subcloned as described above. Plasmids from selective clones were purified using QIAprep (Qiagen) and verified by nucleotide sequencing on an ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer 3100 (Applied Biosystems) prior to transfection. Aliquots of 2·106 High Five insect cells in 1 ml of Express Five SFM medium were transfected with 1 μg (or 5 μg) of plasmids using Cellfectin as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 3 days, stably transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing blasticidin (80 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Culture supernatants derived from stable cell lines were then analyzed by immunoblotting using mAb against V5 peptide (dilution 1:1000), horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:100.000), and chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). JAM-C fusion proteins from ∼2 liters of culture supernatants were purified using Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by silver staining. Purified JAM-C fusion proteins were dialyzed in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After determination of protein concentration using bicinchoninic assay (BCA; Perbio), JAM-C proteins were stored at -20 °C.Stable Expression of JAM-C Wild-type (Glu66) and Mutant Isoforms (Arg66) and JAM-A in CHO Cells—Full-length mutant JAM-C in pcDNA4 encoding for Arg66 JAM-C isoform was produced from wild-type JAM-C (Glu66) pcDNA4 vector by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as previously described (9Santoso S. Sachs U.J.H. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For the construction of primer pair encompassing nucleotides 212-250, two mismatches (GA ->AG) at positions 230 and 231, respectively, were introduced. After subcloning, constructs were validated by nucleotide sequencing analysis for subsequent transfection studies (see above). JAM-C expression vector was then transfected into the CHO cells by the use of Effectene (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant JAM-C were selected with Zeocin (200 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and were analyzed by flow cytometry using mAb Gi11.CHO cells were transfected with full-length JAM-A construct as previously described (9Santoso S. Sachs U.J.H. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected with Zeocin and subcloned for homogeneous JAM-A expression. Surface expression was measured by flow cytometry using mAb F11 specific for JAM-A (4Kornecki E. Walkowiak B. Naik U.P. Ehrlich Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10042-10048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described below.Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of JAM-C on CHO cells transfected either with JAM-C or the mutant JAM-C isoform (Arg66), as well as on the non-small lung cancer cell lines NCI-H522 and NCI-H322M, was analyzed with mAb Gi11 and fluorescein-labeled secondary anti-body as previously described (9Santoso S.

For the analysis of Fc-JAM-C binding to CHO cells, 40-μl cell suspensions (5·106/ml) were incubated with 40 μl of JAM-C IgG fusion proteins (80 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h in U-bottom microtiter wells. After centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 90 s, cells were washed with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (washing buffer; Invitrogen) and stained with 100 μl of fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG at 4 °C for 30 min. Labeled cells were resuspended in 300 μl of washing buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences).In Vitro Binding Experiments—Binding of Fc-JAM-C to immobilized sJAM-C was performed according to a previously described protocol (15Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E. Brockhaus M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30970-30976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T. Nagashima M. Morser J. Arnold B. Preissner K.T. Nawroth P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Microtiter wells were coated with 50 μl of sJAM-C (20 μg/ml; 1 μg/well) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (50 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) in TBS at room temperature for 1 h and then blocked with 2% BSA in TBS. After washing twice with TBS, increasing concentrations of Fc-JAM-C were added to the wells in blocking buffer. After incubation for 60 min, peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:3000; Dianova) was added and incubated for an additional 60 min, followed by addition of the substrate 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS). Binding was quantified at 405 nm with a microplate reader (BIO-TEK, Winooski, VT). In other experiments Fc-JAM-C, Fc-D1, or Fc-D2 (each at 2 μg/ml) were added and allowed to react for 60 min. Microtiter wells were then washed three times. Bound fusion proteins were detected as described above, except that bound antibodies were measured using ortho-phenyldiamine (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as substrate in a microplate reader at 492 nm (TECAN). In all experiments, nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was used as blank and was subtracted to calculate specific binding.BIAcore Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Real-time protein-protein interaction was examined using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 2000 (Biacore AB). Purified sJAM-C or the I domain of Mac-1 (each 50 μg/ml) was immobilized on a research-grade CM5 sensor chip via the amine coupling method as recommended by the manufacturer (Biacore) to the level of 560 and 1079 resonance units, respectively. A flow cell without sJAM-C or I domain was used as reference, the background signal from the reference being subtracted from every surface plasmon resonance data set. Various concentrations (10-100 μg/ml) of 30 μl of Fc-JAM-C, Fc-D1, Fc-D2, or Fc alone in surface plasmon resonance running buffer (20 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) were injected serially using BIAcore control software (KINJECT) at 25 °C with a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Measurements (n = 3) were performed in two steps: association, which corresponds to the sample injection, followed by a dissociation step, which corresponds to buffer injection. Between two consecutive measurements, chip surfaces were regenerated with SDS 0.5%. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software version 3.2. The KD constants of both the homophilic and heterophilic interactions were calculated using the 1:1 Langmuir interaction model.CHO Cell Adhesion Assay—Microtiter wells were coated with 50 μl of purified JAM-C (1 μg/well) for 2 h at 37°C and blocked with 3% BSA in HBS buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, ph 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with HBS buffer, 50 μl of CHO cell suspensions (4 × 106 cells/ml) were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Microtiter wells were then washed twice with 150 μl of HBS. Adherent cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at 4 °C for 30 min, stained with crystal violet, and quantified by measuring absorbance at 590 nm on a microplate reader.Fluorescence Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of the non-small lung cancer cell lines NCI-H522 and NCI-H322M, or different CHO cells to immobilized proteins (sJAM-C, Fc-JAM-C, Fc-JAM-A, Fc, or BSA), to surface-adherent mock-transfected CHO cells (transfected with plasmid pcDNA3) or to CHO cells transfected with either JAM-C or the mutant JAM-C isoform (Arg66) or to tumor necrosis factor α-prestimulated (6 h, 10 ng/ml) surface-adherent confluent HUVEC was tested according to a previously described protocol (9Santoso S. Sachs U.J.H. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Chavakis T. Keiper T. Matz-Westphal R. Hersemeyer K.

Briefly, wells were coated with different proteins (each 1 μg/well) in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 3% BSA in HBS. In cell-cell adhesion experiments, mock-transfected CHO cells, CHO cells transfected with either JAM-C or the mutant JAM-C isoform (Arg66), or HUVEC cells were grown to confluency onto 96-well plates. Fluorescence-labeled cells (NCI-H522 and NCI-H322M) or fluorescence-labeled CHO cells (5 × 104/well) were washed twice and added to immobilized proteins or to surface-adherent cells for 60 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of effectors. After washings, adhesion of cells was quantified as the percentage of total cells added using a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT).RESULTSHomophilic Interaction of JAM-C—We have previously shown that JAM-C undergoes a heterophilic interaction with the leukocyte integrin Mac-1, although it has not been clarified yet whether JAM-C may also interact in a homophilic manner. Therefore, we investigated whether JAM-C is capable of interacting homophilically. In particular, we tested whether Fc-JAM-C that was used as fluid phase ligand bound to immobilized sJAM-C (solid phase ligand). A dose-dependent and saturable binding of Fc-JAM-C to immobilized JAM-C was detected (Fig. 1A). Binding was not affected at all in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the homophilic interaction of JAM-C takes place in a cation-independent manner (not shown). In contrast, no binding of Fc or Fc platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) fusion protein to immobilized JAM-C was observed (data not shown). Additionally, excess sJAM-C in the fluid phase blocked the binding of Fc-JAM-C to immobilized JAM-C (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the homophilic interaction of JAM-C was compared with the heterophilic binding of JAM-C to the immobilized I domain of Mac-1. As shown in Fig. 1B, the IC50 of sJAM-C for inhibiting the homophilic interaction of JAM-C was higher than the IC50 of sJAM-C for inhibiting the interaction between Fc-JAM-C and the I domain of Mac-1, indicating that the homophilic binding of JAM-C may be stronger than the heterophilic interaction with Mac-1. Taken together, JAM-C can undergo a homophilic interaction.The Amino-terminal Ig Domain of JAM-C Mediates the Homophilic Interaction—We then sought to determine which domain of JAM-C mediates the homophilic binding. To do so, domains 1 and 2 (amino- and carboxyl-terminal Ig domains of JAM-C, respectively) were produced as Fc fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). The binding of Fc-D1 and Fc-D2 to immobilized sJAM-C was compared with the binding of Fc-JAM-C. As shown in Fig. 2B, Fc-D1 was capable of interacting with sJAM-C, whereas no binding of Fc-D2 to sJAM-C was noticed. Thus, the aminoterminal Ig domain D1 of JAM-C is responsible for the homophilic interaction.FIGURE 2D1 mediates the homophilic interaction of JAM-C. A, Fc-JAM-C (lane 2), Fc-D1 (lane 3), and Fc-D2 (lane 4) from culture supernatants of transfected stable insect cells were purified by Protein G column. Purified proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and were visualized by silver staining in comparison to indicated molecular weight standards (lane 1). B, the binding of Fc, Fc-JAM-C, Fc-D1, and Fc-D2 to immobilized sJAM-C is shown. Specific binding is represented as absorbance at 492 nm. Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) of a typical experiment; similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further determine the specificity of the homophilic binding of JAM-C, real-time interaction between purified JAM-C proteins was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3). sJAM-C was attached to the sensor surface, and the binding of various JAM-C fusion proteins was tested at a concentration of 30 μg/ml. Sensograms were plotted and aligned (overlay mode). Although specific interaction between sJAM-C with Fc-JAM-C and Fc-D1 was noted, a very weak binding was observed with Fc-D2 and no binding was detectable with Fc alone.FIGURE 3Surface plasmon resonance-BIAcore analysis of the homophilic interaction of JAM-C. A, sensograms show the plot of relative response in resonance units (RU) in time (sec) for various analytes (Fc-JAM-C, Fc-D1, Fc-D2, and Fc as control). Association phase corresponds to successive analyte (30 μg/ml) injection (▾) over immobilized sJAM-C. Dissociation phase starts with injection of the running buffer (→). B, the sensograms of all analytes obtained with reference flow cells without sJAM-C were subtracted from the sensograms obtained with immobilized sJAM-C, and specific sensograms were aligned and normalized. C, sensograms show the plot of relative response in resonance units (RU) in time (sec) for the binding of Fc-JAM-C (30 μg/ml) to immobilized I domain of Mac-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When we normalized the association phase of the sensograms, an overlapping of the Fc-JAM-C and Fc-D1 curves was observed during the dissociation phase (Fig. 3), indicating that the isolated D1 domain binds as strongly as the entire JAM-C protein. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal Ig domain D1 alone is sufficient to support a homophilic JAM-C interaction. Failure of the Fc-JAM-C and Fc-D1 to dissociate suggests a high overall affinity for the homophilic interaction. Indeed the KD value for the JAM-C interaction was 0.96 + 0.07 × 10-8m (n = 3). When the heterophilic interaction of Fc-JAM-C with immobilized I domain of Mac-1 was analyzed, a KD value of 3.50 + 1.30 × 10-8m (n = 3) was estimated.The Arg64-Ile65-Glu66 Motif in the Amino-terminal Ig Domain of JAM-C Is Important for the Homophilic Interaction—The sequence RVE in the amino-terminal Ig domain of JAM-A has been reported to mediate dimerization of the molecule due to the formation of salt bridges between Arg58 and Glu60, and vice versa, on two separate JAM-A molecules (16Kostrewa D. Brockhaus M. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Mueller F. Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Bartfai T. Winkler F.K. Hennig M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As this tripeptide is conserved in JAM-C (Arg64-Ile65-Glu66), we next investigated whether this sequence is responsible for the homophil"
https://openalex.org/W2058030624,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) is a key negative regulator of cell proliferation that is frequently disregulated in human cancer. Many viral oncoproteins (for example, HPV E7 and E1A) are known to bind to the pRb pocket domain via a LXCXE binding motif. There are also some 20 cellular proteins that contain a LXCXE motif and have been reported to associate with the pocket domain of pRb. Using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal calorimetry titration, we show that LXCXE peptides of viral oncoproteins bind strongly to the pocket domain of pRb. Additionally, we show that LXCXE-like peptides of HDAC1 bind to the same site on pRb with a weak (micromolar) and transient association. Systematic substitution of residues other than conserved Leu, Cys, and Glu show that the residues flanking the LXCXE are important for the binding, whereas positively charged amino acids in the XLXCXEXXX sequence significantly weaken the interaction.

There are other contact points on viral oncoproteins for pRb, but the major interaction is through the LXCXE motif. The crystal structure of the pRb-AB domain of SV40 large T antigen shows that two-thirds of the total surface interaction between the two proteins is via the LXCXE motif (18Kim H.Y. Ahn B.Y. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).

As viral oncoproteins utilize the LXCXE motif, it was proposed that cellular proteins would also interact with the pRb through this sequence (27Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L.

However, this model of interaction would not account for the binding of a protein like HDAC3 to pRb, as it lacks any LXCXE-like motif (37Chan H.M. Smith L. La Thangue N.B.

There are also reports that suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 do not utilize their LXCXE-like sequences for interaction with the small pocket of pRb (39Chen T.T. Wang Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5571-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Dick F.A. Dyson N.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6224-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Kennedy B.K. Liu O.W. Dick F.A.

Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). How pRb recruits the class I HDACs to the repressor complex at the promoter remains a subject of controversy (41Kennedy B.K. Liu O.W. Dick F.A. Dyson N. Harlow E. Vidal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similar conflicting reports abound in the literature regarding the interaction of other proteins (for example, BRG1) with the pRb (31Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 32Strober B.E. Dunaief J.L. Guha Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Some reports suggest direct interaction between BRG1 and pRb-AB, whereas other reports contradict this notion (38Dahiya A. Gavin M.R. Luo R.X. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 799-805Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Chen T.T. Wang Y.J. Mol. Cell.

One report suggested that BRG1 and HDAC1 interact separately with pRb via differing modes of interaction (38Dahiya A. Gavin M.R. Luo R.X. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 799-805Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Because the assays reported in the literature were based on inhomogeneous protein preparations, we decided to use homogeneously purified proteins and check for pRb-AB/protein or peptide associations using direct in vitro experiments. These experiments included NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), gel filtration, and mass spectrometry. This multimethod approach can unambiguously characterize the interaction between pRb and LXCXE sequences. We studied a series of LXCXE peptides or protein domains derived from HDAC1, BRG1, PAI2, and the N-terminal pRb (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE). The LXCXE sequences of two viral oncoproteins (HPV E7 and SV40 large T antigen) were also tested. Our results confirm reports that LXCXE sequences of HPV E7 and SV40 large T antigen form tight complexes with pRb-AB. We found, however, that the IXCXE motifs of HDAC1 form only weak complexes with pRb-AB, whereas other LXCXE sequences that were reported to bind directly to pRb-AB clearly showed no binding. Using various LXCXE sequences and the mutant peptides from E7 and HDAC1, we could show that this interaction is complex and involves residues other than the conserved Leu, Cys, and Glu. Taken together, our data allowed for identification of amino acids that are important for the binding of LXCXE-like sequences to pRb.TABLE ONEITC and NMR titration results data for small pocket of pRb and various peptide/protein domains KD values were determined by NMR in case of fast exchange or weak binders.

(18Kim H.Y. Ahn B.Y. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The mutant pRbs (pRb-AB K713S and pRb-AB C706F) were constructed from the pRb-AB with the help of a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For expression of the protein, the Escherichia coli strain BL21 STAR™ (DE3) (Invitrogen) was used. Cells were cultured according to standard procedures in LB or M9 minimal medium (44Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.1-A2.2Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% glucose and 1 mm MgSO4, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 15N-labeled NH4Cl2 for uniform 15N labeling. 15N-Labeled lysine for specific 15N labeling was used. Protein induction was carried out at 18 °C overnight by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Compared with the pRb pocket domain used in the structural study of Lee et al. (19Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) (residues 372–589 and 635–787) and Kim et al. (18Kim H.Y. Ahn B.Y. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (residues 378–578 and 645–772), there is an extra lysine in our pRb-AB construct (Lys-791).In the first step of purification the crude cell lysate, after the sonication, was passed through the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The eluent from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was subjected to the MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) anionic exchange chromatography column. The final buffer of the protein solution was 50 mm NaH2PO4 ·H2O, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8.The pRb-N and BRG1 LXCXE domains were also cloned into the pET30 LIC/Xa vector. Protein expression was carried out in a manner similar to that of pRb-AB except that induction was performed at 24 °C overnight. The proteins were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose column followed by size exclusion chromatography.The identity of proteins was confirmed with SDS-PAGE, Western blot, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry. Final protein samples used for all of the studies were more then 95% purified as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Final purity of protein preparations used in this study.A, pRb-AB. B, pRb-N. C, BRG1 LXCXE-containing domain. SDS-PAGE analysis combined with the mass spectrometry, Western blot, and NMR spectroscopy showed the protein to be purified close to homogeneity.

TABLE ONE shows the peptides used in our study.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Binding of various peptides to pRb-AB was measured by ITC using a MicroCal Omega VP-ITC system (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The peptides, at concentrations between 200 and 400 μm, were titrated into 20–50 μm pRb-AB at 20–22 °C. pRb-AB was dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4 ·H2O, pH 7.8, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer, and all of the peptides were dissolved in the same buffer. After subtraction of the dilution heats, calorimetric data were analyzed with the ORIGIN V5.0 (MicroCal). For all of the titrations, the stoichiometry of ligand binding to pRb was close to 1.0.Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was carried out on an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry API 165 PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex (Langen) spectrometer coupled with high pressure liquid chromatography (column, Macherey-Nagel EC 125/2 Nucleosil 300-5 C4 MPN; pump system, Microgradient System 140B/C, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (solvent A, water, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, MeCN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; gradient 10–95% solvent B), a photodiode array, Agilent HP1100PDA, and Masschrom software from Biomultiview. Protein and peptides were mixed at 1:3–5 molar ratio, and the complex was passed through an analytical S75 Superdex (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column. The peak corresponding to the complex was collected and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore). Samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry for both the protein and peptides.NMR Spectroscopy—15N uniformly labeled or specifically 15N-labeled lysine samples of pRb-AB were used for binding studies. Several 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded to observe chemical shift behavior of lysine resonances upon addition of peptides. NMR spectra were recorded on the AV900 MHz with Cryo-Probe or DRX 600 MHz Bruker spectrometers with standard TXI probe heads. 128 increments for the uniformly labeled samples and 72 increments for the 15N-labeled lysine samples were recorded in an indirect dimension. The protein concentration used was ∼0.5 mm. Concentrations of peptides used were between 2 and 5 mm depending on the solubility of a particular peptide. Both protein and peptide samples were dissolved in the same buffer as pRb-AB (50 mm NaH2PO4 ·H2O, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.3). The measurement time was 16 h/HSQC for the 0.5 mm sample and extended up to 24 h for more diluted samples.RESULTSThe LXCXE Sequence of HPV E7 and SV40 Large T Antigen Bind Tightly to the Small Pocket of pRb, Whereas the IXCXE Sequence of HDAC1 Associates Transiently—We used the following peptides in the first round of our study: the LXCXE peptides from the HPV E7, SV40 large T antigen, and PAI2 proteins, the IXCXE peptides from HDAC1, and a peptide derived from the transactivation domain of E2F-1. LXCXE-containing fragments of BRG1 and the N-terminal domain of pRb were also used (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE). We first measured the binding of these various peptides to pRb-AB using ITC. In our construct of pRb-AB, domains A and B comprise amino acids 379–578 and 642–791, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, for the binding between the pRb pocket and the IXCXE peptide of HDAC1 (17-mer) was difficult to measure but could be estimated to be ∼10 μm (Fig. 3A and TABLE ONE), which is weaker compared with the binding of the LXCXE-containing peptides from HPV E7 or SV 40 large T antigen (Fig. 3, B and C) and the peptide derived from the transactivation domain of E2F-1 (TABLE ONE). Three HDAC1 peptides were tested: the HDAC1 peptide of TABLE ONE (17-mer), a shorter version, RIACEEEFS, and a peptide extended by two N-terminal residues and one C-terminal residue (SS and E), respectively (20-mer). ITC showed the pRb-AB binding for all three peptides. For the two latter peptides, quantification of the data was difficult to obtain.FIGURE 3ITC titration curve for various LXCXE peptides with the pRb-AB.Top, the raw data of ITC experiments, each performed at 20–22 °C. Bottom, the integrated heat changes, corrected for the heat of dilution, and fitted curve based on a single site model. A, pRb-AB titrated with HDAC1 peptide (17-mer). B, pRb-AB titrated with HPV E7 peptide. C, pRb-AB titrated with large T antigen peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also checked the strength of this binding using mass spectrometry. The pRb-AB and the IXCXE HDAC1 peptide were mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio and passed through a S75 analytical Superdex column. A mass corresponding only to pRb-AB was detected in the eluent. The same procedure was used for the LXCXE peptide of the large T antigen, and in this case the masses of both the protein and the peptide were observed (data not shown).We next used NMR spectroscopy to check the binding. NMR measurements consisted of monitoring changes in chemical shifts and line widths of the backbone amide resonances of 15N-enriched pRb samples upon addition of unlabeled peptides (45Meyer B. Peters T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 864-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 46Pellecchia M. Sem D.S. Wüthrich K. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 11: 211-219Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As the assignment of the NMR spectra was not possible up to now (and not intended), NMR resonances influenced by binding to known binding partners (E7 peptide, E2F peptide, T Ag peptide) were identified (only Lys-713 has been assigned using a 15N-labeled lysine sample of the pRb-AB K713S mutant) (supplementary Fig. S1A). From the published crystal structure of the complex between the pRb small pocket and the HPV E7 peptide and from a number of biochemical and biophysical assays, it has been shown that several lysine residues of pRb participate in the LXCXE-pRb interface (18Kim H.Y.

Dyson N. Harlow E. Vidal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8720-8725Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, the crystal structure of the pRb ·E7 peptide shows that there are four lysine residues that are close to and make contact with the E7 peptide backbone (viz. Lys-713, Lys-720, Lys-722, and Lys-765); besides these lysines, there are two more lysine residues near the LXCXE binding site (namely, Lys-729 and Lys-740) (18Kim H.Y. Ahn B.Y. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). All of these lysine residues are situated in the B domain of pRb (40Dick F.A. Dyson N.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6224-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 47Brown V.D. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1390-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). We therefore prepared a 15N-labeled lysine sample of pRb-AB and carried out titration with this sample (the HSQC spectrum of the 15N uniformly labeled pRb-AB contained resonances from 361 residues and was too crowded to be of practical use in these types of experiments (supplementary Fig. S1B). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled lysine pRb-AB exhibited 27 cross-peaks corresponding to the total of 27 lysines present in pRb-AB (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4A, surface of the B domain of pRb bound to the LXCXE peptide from HPV E7, taken from the Protein Data Bank file 1GUX (32Strober B.E.

Upon addition of the E7 peptide, five resonances were perturbed (arrows), indicating that these lysines are involved in the binding to pRb-AB, including the resonance peak from Lys-713 (at the chemical shifts for 1H 7.91 ppm, and for 15N 123.9 ppm; the assignment of this peak is described in supplementary Fig. S1A).

The process involving the fission of caveolae from the apical plasma membrane (PM) and fusion with the basolateral PM is termed transcytosis. Caveolae “pinch off” from the apical PM through a process requiring the recruitment of the GTPase dynamin to the caveolar necks as regulated by another protein intersectin (1Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon fission, caveolae form vesicular carriers that shuttle through the cytosol and deliver their cargo to the subendothelium by fusion with the basolateral PM (3Palade G.E. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1979; 463: 11-32PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of caveolar fusion may involve the same machinery as other vesicular carriers, i.e. the SNARE proteins of the syntaxin, synaptobrevin/cellubrevin, and SNAP-23/25 families (4Predescu N.D.

However, the organization of SNARE proteins and their function in the fusion of caveolae in ECs are incompletely understood. It is known that syntaxin, cellubrevin, SNAP-23, and the cytosolic factors N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and α- and γ-SNAP are key components of the endothelial multimolecular transcytotic complex, the assembly of which depends on the membrane fusion ATPase, NSF, which can be inhibited by alkylation of NSF by N-ethylmaleimide (7Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that N-ethylmaleimide interferes with transcytosis in ECs (4Predescu N.D. Horvat R. Predescu S. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3014-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H937-H949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the SNARE hypothesis, membrane fusion occurs when SNARE proteins on opposing membranes form four helix bundles, bringing the membranes in close apposition, thus providing the driving force necessary for fusion (9Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 10Rothman E.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural studies have shown several states of association between caveolae and their target PM, varying in proximity, stability, and readiness for fusion (11Palade G.E. Bruns R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, the pre-fusion states of caveolae have not been experimentally clarified, and the sequence of events responsible for caveolar fusion and the spatial distribution of the SNARE proteins on the endothelial PM remains uncertain. Unlike intracellular membrane fusion events or regulated exocytosis for which in vitro assays are available (12Avery J. Ellis D.J. Lang T. Holroyd P. Riedel D. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), an assay for the in vitro reconstitution of caveolar fusion does not exist. A recently described cell-free preparation for exocytosis in PC12 cells demonstrated that sonication of these cells grown on coverslips results in PM patches capable of fusion with secretory vesicles (14Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on this approach, we have developed an assay for caveolar fusion involving endothelial PM patches and isolated biotin-labeled caveolae. We monitored membrane interactions during the fusion event via the specific detection of biotin-streptavidin complexes on the PM sheets. We correlated fluorescence microscopy (FM) analysis with gold labeling electron microscopy (EM) on ultrathin sections of PM sheets subjected to the fusion reaction. The results identified (i) the presence on PM sheets with numerous docked and fused streptavidin-labeled caveolae, (ii) cholesterol-dependent clustering of SNAP-23 and syntaxin-4 (Synt-4), and (iii) PM target (t) SNARE clusters as the preferential sites for caveolar fusion. Fluorescent staining of ultrathin sections of PM sheets highly correlated with the ultrastructure within the same area. Thus, the fusion of caveolae occurring at specialized cholesterol-rich t-SNARE clusters on the basolateral PM is responsible for exocytosis in ECs and is thereby integral to the mechanism of transcytosis. endothelial cells plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor target vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor fluorescence microscopy electron microscopy syntaxin-4 methyl-β-cyclodextrin antibodies caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline small interfering RNA detergent-resistant membranes. Human lung microvascular ECs were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD).

Relevant antibodies (Abs) were obtained from the following sources: anti-caveolin-1 (Cav-1) Abs and anti-Synt-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) from BD Transduction Laboratories, anti-SNAP-23 polyclonal antibody (pAb) from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany), and Synt-4 pAb from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ECs grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were briefly sonicated in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm EGTA as described (12Avery J.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PM patches attached to the coverslips were either fixed and subjected to morphological analysis by FM or EM or used in a cell-free assay for caveolar fusion. PM sheets were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.1) for 30 min at room temperature, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.3 m sodium cacodylate for 15 min, dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol dilutions and hexamethyldisilizane, dried, mounted on stubs, coated with a 2-nm layer of platinum/palladium, and then examined and photographed using a Hitachi field emission scanning electron microscope. PM sheets were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 15 min, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon 812. After polymerization for 48 h at 60 °C, ultrathin sections were cut perpendicular to the PM sheets, mounted on EM grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and finally examined using a Joel JEM 1220. For immunogold labeling EM, PM patches were prepared by brief sonication of ECs grown on EM gold grids coated first with Formvar and then with a thin layer of poly-l-lysine. PM sheets attached to the EM grid were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min; quenched with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the primary Abs, followed by 6-nm gold-conjugated reporter Abs; diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBS; and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g before use. In control experiments, the primary Abs were omitted. After washing by transfer through six successive PBS drops, gold-labeled PM sheets were post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, followed by EM examination. Randomly chosen areas of PM sheets were photographed at the initial ×20 magnification. To quantify the distribution of gold particles and to estimate the size of SNARE clusters, we used three sets of micrographs (36 per set representing ∼200 μm2 of PM surface) from three different experiments for each antigen. The clusters were classified based on their number of gold particles (between three and six or more than six gold particles). The size of the gold clusters was estimated using at least 50 clusters per experimental set. In control experiments, PM sheets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS; quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS; and then sequentially incubated for 30 min with the primary Abs diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA in PBS, followed by a 45-min incubation with the reporter Abs diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBS as described (13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). For cholesterol depletion, PM sheets were treated with 10 mm MCD as described (13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and immunostained for Cav-1 and SNAP-23. RNA oligonucleotides designed as described (16Nichols J.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). EC monolayers (70-80% confluent) were transfected with Cav-1 siRNA using FuGENE 6 reagent at an siRNA/lipid ratio of 1:3. A four-nucleotide mismatch was used as control. To address caveolar fusion experimentally, we used the basolateral endothelial PM as the target PM and the isolated caveolae. Isolation of Biotin-labeled Caveolae—Freshly prepared PM sheets bearing attached caveolae were biotinylated as described (2Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the PM sheets were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 5 mg/ml EC cytosol in the presence of 1 mm GTP and an ATP-regenerating system to allow the GTP-dependent fission of biotinylated caveolae as described (1Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fusion Reaction—The standard fusion assay consisted of PM sheets present on one coverslip (∼100-150 patches) and the biotin-labeled caveolae released from PM patches present on three coverslips. To initiate docking and fusion, 900 μl of fusion buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm ATP); 100 μl of an ATP-regenerating system; and 5 mg/ml EC cytosol were added over the PM sheets, followed by addition of isolated caveolae and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The patches were placed on ice, washed, fixed, and stained for biotin and SNARE proteins. Plastic coverslips containing PM sheets subjected to the fusion reaction were extensively washed; fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature; rinsed twice in PBS; blocked with 1% BSA in PBS; and subsequently immunostained for SNAP-23, followed by another quenching step and simultaneous application for 30 min of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect bound anti-SNAP-23 antibody and streptavidin-Texas Red to visualize biotin-labeled caveolae. The PM patches were then washed with PBS; post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; and dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol dilutions, followed by embedding with Quetol 651 (EM Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ultrathin sections were cut perpendicular to the PM patches and mounted on Formvar-coated EM grids. The grid to be examined was sited on a glass slide, covered with a coverslip using transparent tape, and imaged by FM. All images were collected with identical acquisition parameters. The same grid was subjected to 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin labeling, followed by uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining and examined by transmission EM. Endothelial SNARE Proteins Are Concentrated in Clusters and Co-localize with Cav-1 on Endothelial PM Sheets—To analyze the distribution of t-SNARE proteins in endothelial membranes, we adapted the recently described PM sheet system (12Avery J. Ellis D.J. Lang T. Holroyd P. Riedel D. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Basolateral endothelial PM sheets were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” by brief sonication of confluent EC monolayers grown on polylysinecoated coverslips. In confluent ECs, tight junctions are formed, and cell polarity is subsequently established. Under these conditions, the apical PM is oriented away from the substrate, thus facilitating the removal of the apical PM and cytosolic structures, whereas the basolateral PM sheets with their membrane protein complexes and caveolar profiles remain attached to the coverslip. These basolateral PM sheets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated first with anti-Cav-1 pAb and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated reporter Ab. Cav-1 is known to decorate caveolar coats in different stages of membrane invagination. Cav-1 immunostaining revealed the characteristic vesicular organization (Fig. 1A). Cav-1 clusters were numerous and non-uniformly scattered on the PM sheet. A high resolution scanning EM approach showed a large number of caveolae (Fig. 1B, panels b1 and b2) and, occasionally, caveolar clusters attached to the PM. Fig. 1B shows highly magnified caveolar profiles (panels b3-b5) and caveolar clusters attached to the PM (panels b6 and b7). We also observed some actin cables (panel b2), but no other cell components were detected, indicating that cytosolic structures were removed during the sonication. We very rarely observed membrane folding, and no apparent membrane damage was produced by the sonication. Further morphological analysis by pre-embedding EM of cross-sections through PM sheets (Fig. 1C and panel c1) showed a well preserved membrane structure suitable for studying caveolar fusion in relation to the organization of SNARE proteins located on the inner leaflet of the PM. Given the lack of knowledge about the localization of SNARE proteins in EC membranes, we analyzed the membrane distribution of SNAP-23 and syntaxin. For syntaxin immunostaining, we used anti-Synt-4 pAb. Synt-4, the syntaxin-1 isoform present in ECs (Fig. 2A), has been shown to be the t-SNARE partner of SNAP-23 and cellubrevin in non-neuronal cells (18Lafont F. Verkade P. Gally T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining showed, for both SNAP-23 (Fig. 2B, panel b1) and Synt-4 (panel b2), dense puncta and diffuse staining throughout the ECs with significant PM localization. A detailed analysis of endothelial t-SNARE proteins distribution on the inner leaflet of the PM by FM indicated that there was a wide distribution in a dense punctate staining pattern for both proteins (Fig. 2C, panels a1 and b1). Synt-4 puncta were smaller and more discrete, most likely due to the transmembrane domain of Synt-4 and its ability to homo-oligomerize (13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), whereas SNAP-23 puncta were more numerous and less distinct, possibly due to the lack of a transmembrane domain and its higher mobility (17Foster J.L. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the basolateral PM endothelial SNARE proteins associate in small clusters.FIGURE 2Expression and distribution of Synt-4 and SNAP-23 in endothelial cells and on PM sheets.A, a cultured EC lysate subjected to 5-20% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Synt-4 mAb shows the expression of Synt-4.

Scale bars = 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined by double immunofluorescence the relationship between Cav-1 (Fig. 2C, panels a2 and b2), the marker for the caveolar microdomains on the PM sheets (because no cytosolic Cav-1 was present), and the two t-SNARE proteins. Cav-1 was shown to co-localize prominently with both SNAP-23 (panel a3) and Synt-4 (panel b3) clusters. The spatial distribution of SNAP-23 and Synt-4 on endothelial PM sheets was also investigated by 6-nm immunogold labeling EM. The majority of gold particles detecting SNAP-23 (Fig. 3, panel a) or Synt-4 (panel b) were distributed in clusters of three to six gold particles (solid circles) or in larger clusters of more than six gold particles (dashed circles). Frequently, SNAP-23 (panels a1-a4) and Synt-4 (panels b1-b3) immunogold labeling indicated their association with densely stained vesicle-like structures. Because the number of clathrin-coated vesicles in ECs is low compared with caveolae (3% from the total vesicle population (3Palade G.E. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1979; 463: 11-32PubMed Google Scholar)) 4D. N. Predescu and S. A. Predescu, unpublished data. and the clathrin cage was not detected, these structures are likely caveolae. Quantification of the spatial distribution of gold particles on the PM sheets indicated ∼3000 units/50 μm2 of PM surface (TABLE ONE). About 62% of the total number of gold particles detecting SNAP-23 and 71% of the total number of gold particles detecting Synt-4 consisted of clusters of three to six gold particles. The larger clusters consisting of more than six gold particles represented 29% for SNAP-23 and 18% for Synt-4 (TABLE ONE). The distribution of gold particles per unit surface and within the clustered area showed a high density of the recognized antigen. The size of the clusters ranged between 100 and 150 nm. An average of only 10% of the total number of gold particles counted were found singly or in pairs. Control experiments in which specific Abs were omitted showed low background staining (<2%) on a similar endothelial PM surface, and this was always due to gold particles found singly or in pairs, whereas the gold aggregates represented <0.3%.TABLE ONESNAP-23 and Synt-4 cluster sizeAntigenCluster size (no. of Au particles)One or twoThree to sixMore than six%SNAP-2396229Synt-4117118 Open table in a new tab Double immunofluorescence for Synt-4 (Fig. 4A, panel a1) and SNAP-23 (panel a2) indicated partial co-clustering (panel a3), suggesting the existence of binary SNARE complexes (9Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Extensive examination revealed ring-shaped subdomains where SNAP-23 and Synt-4 clusters were highly concentrated and more ordered than the surrounding clusters (Fig. 4, A, panel a3 (circles); and B). The surface density of these ring-shaped membrane subdomains formed by five to six individual co-clusters was 7-8 units/100 μm2. To analyze the association of Cav-1 with these SNARE co-clusters, we applied triple fluorescent staining. The degree of co-localization was determined from three different triple immunofluorescent staining sets. The scoring criteria for co-localization are described in the legend of Fig. 4C. Briefly, to optimize staining for each Ab, the primary Abs were applied sequentially but in a different order for each experimental set. Reporter Abs were applied together for 30 min at room temperature, and each set of experiments was performed in triplicate. The results indicate that 47% of the Cav-1-positive puncta overlapped either SNAP-23 or Synt-4 clusters (TABLE TWO). Moreover, 14% of the Cav-1-positive spots corresponded to a SNAP-23/Synt-4 co-cluster (TABLE TWO). For most of the remaining Cav-1-positive puncta, co-localization was not noticeable, whereas for a small percentage, clear co-localization could not be determined. Thus, these results indicate the preferential localization of caveolae at sites on the PM containing t-SNARE clusters. This spatial organization of SNARE clusters and their co-localization with Cav-1 may be required for efficient and rapid caveolar fusion with the target membrane.TABLE TWOCo-localization of Cav-1-positive puncta with SNARE clustersCav-1-positive puncta%Synt-416 ± 2.0SNAP-2331 ± 3.4SNAP-23/Synt-414 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab Formation of t-SNARE Clusters Is Cholesterol-dependent—Clustering of t-SNARE proteins and their co-localization with Cav-1 suggest that cholesterol may be involved in mediating the formation of the SNARE clusters. Thus, to examine the role of cholesterol in SNAP-23 clustering, PM sheets were treated with 15 mm MCD (13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). SNAP-23 staining was markedly altered (Fig. 5A, panel a2) relative to control experiments (panel a1). We observed that the clusters became larger and less distinct, and Cav-1 staining essentially disappeared (Fig. 5, A, panel a3; and B, panel b3). The small Synt-4 clusters (Fig. 5B, panel b1) disappeared and formed large spots when PM sheets were treated with MCD (panel b2). Cholesterol depletion also increased the Synt-4 staining intensity, most likely due to increased accessibility of anti-Synt-4 mAb to its epitope. This dependence of SNARE clustering on the membrane cholesterol content directed us to investigate the association of SNARE proteins with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) by flotation on density gradients (18Lafont F. Verkade P. Gally T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In control experiments, both SNAP-23 and Synt-4 were present mainly in the high density gradient fractions (Fig. 5C); nonetheless, a small fraction of the two SNARE proteins cofloated with Cav-1, a marker for DRMs, in the top fractions of the gradient. This finding suggests that the SNAP-23 and Synt-4 clusters partially overlapped the DRMs. However, the buoyant properties of all three proteins were markedly affected upon cholesterol depletion (Fig. 5D), indicating that the endothelial SNARE proteins were associated with these PM cholesterol-rich microdomains. We next investigated whether Cav-1 removal upon cholesterol depletion is responsible for cluster dispersion. We used the siRNA approach to suppress Cav-1 expression (16Nichols J.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated an 80% decrease in Cav-1 protein expression 48-72 h after siRNA transfection (Fig. 6A, panel a1). Under these conditions, caveolin-2 protein expression was not affected (panel a2). Transfection with a control mismatched siRNA sequence also did not affect Cav-1 expression (panel a3) or its spatial distribution on the PM patches (panel a4). Down-regulation of Cav-1 expression was also monitored by FM on PM patches prepared from ECs transfected with siRNA (Fig. 6, B, panel b1; and C, panel c1). On the same patches, SNAP-23 staining was not detectably altered (Fig. 6, B, panel b2); however, Synt-4 clusters became somewhat bigger and less discrete (C, panel c2). A control PM patch immunostained for Synt-4 is shown in Fig. 2C (panel b1). Based on these findings, Cav-1 knockdown does not alter the stability of SNAP-23 clusters. However, the small changes in Synt-4 staining caused by Cav-1 down-regulation may reflect the disruption of either protein/protein interactions or protein-cholesterol complexes, which in turn may slightly affect the stability of Synt-4 clusters. Docking and Fusion of Caveolae with the PM in a Cell-free System—We visualized by EM docked caveolae in intact cultured ECs, apparently intermediate states in the fusion reaction. Caveolae were found close to the PM but not yet opened to the subendothelial space, tethered and docked, waiting for fusion of their membrane with the basolateral PM (Fig. 7). The region of close apposition between the two membranes extended over 50 nm, more than half the diameter of a typical caveola (panels a-d). The two membranes were <5 nm apart (panels a1-d1), half the length of the coiled bundle of vesicular (v) and t-SNARE proteins forming during exocytosis (19Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nature. 2000; 406: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SNARE pairing had occurred. Because caveolar fusion is difficult to monitor in whole ECs, its basis remains unclear. Thus, to study caveolar fusion experimentally, we used the basolateral endothelial PM and isolated caveolae and monitored fusion by correlative FM and EM analyses. We took advantage of the purity of the PM preparation and the large number of attached caveolae to isolate a pure caveolar fraction. PM sheets and the attached caveolae were labeled with biotin (2Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to assess caveolar fusion via biotin-streptavidin complex formation. Biotin-labeled caveolae were released by the GTP-dependent process (1Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and aliquots were analyzed biochemically for their biotin, Cav-1, and cellubrevin contents and morphologically using 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin labeling and negative staining EM. The released caveolae were immunoreactive to the caveolar marker Cav-1 (Fig. 8A, panel a) and the v-SNARE protein cellubrevin (panel b). Moreover, significant biotinylation of caveolar proteins was detected using streptavidin reagents by dot blotting (panel c) and EM analyses. The electron micrographs shown in Fig. 8B and in more detail in panels b1-b4 show a relatively homogeneous population of caveolae labeled with 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin. The released caveolae and freshly prepared naïve PM sheets were incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon fusion, the membrane patches were washed, fixed, and stained for biotin and SNAP-23 or Synt-4. Fig. 8C shows numerous streptavidin-Texas Red-positive puncta, indicating caveolar attachment to the membrane. In addition, there was significant co-localization between the SNAP-23 clusters and biotin-streptavidin complexes (Fig. 8C, circles), indicating that fusion of caveolae occurred at the specialized sites containing the SNAP-23 clusters (panels c1-c3). Similar findings were obtained when co-localization between Synt-4 and streptavidin-Texas Red was examined on PM patches subjected to the fusion reaction (data not shown). In control experiments in which unlabeled caveolae were used (data not shown) or the cytosol was omitted from the fusion reaction (Fig. 8D), no streptavidin-Texas Red staining was detected. The extent of co-localization between the streptavidin-Texas Red-positive puncta and two SNARE proteins was analyzed on two sets of PM patches (n = 24 per set) obtained from three different fusion reactions per experimental set. This analysis indicated that ∼50% of the streptavidin-Texas Red-labeled caveolae corresponded to a SNAP-23 or Synt-4 cluster (TABLE THREE). An average of 22% of the streptavidin-Texas Red-positive puncta did not co-localize with the SNARE clusters, whereas for the remaining 28%, co-localization could not be established with accuracy.TABLE THREECo-localization of biotin-streptavidin-Texas Red complexes with SNAP-23 and Synt-4 clustersBiotin-streptavidin-Texas RedPositiveNegative%SNAP-2352 ± 6.820 ± 7.1Synt-449 ± 7.324 ± 8.0 Open table in a new tab Imaging of the Caveola/PM Interaction Using Correlative FM and EM—The fusion assay allowed the assessment of the apposition and binding of the two participating membranes, but not the degree of their commitment toward fusion. In addition, the individual caveolae are under the resolution of FM; and thus, their fusion activity may have been underestimated. For these reasons, we carried out high resolution FM on ultrathin sections of Quetol 651-embedded PM sheets, which had been subjected to the fusion reaction and fluorescently labeled prior to embedding. We correlated this assessment with gold labeling EM on the same sections. We determined whether (i) the fluorescent staining pattern correlated with the ultrastructure seen on the same section, (ii) docking and fusion of caveolae as assessed by biotin-streptavidin complex detection occurred preferentially at sites of t-SNARE clusters on the PM sheets, and (iii) caveolae were committed to fusion with their target PM. The EM grids containing the ultrathin sections of fluorescently labeled PM sheets were imaged by FM at low magnification to obtain a spatial map of SNAP-23/fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PM sheets present on the EM grid. Fig. 9 (panel A) shows three PM patches (PM1-PM3) with sharp, distinct SNAP-23 clusters. The selected region of interest (box) was further examined at higher magnification for both SNAP-23 (panel a1) and biotin (panel a2). Streptavidin-Texas Red-positive spots, most likely docked and fused caveolae, were detected co-localizing with SNAP-23 clusters as shown in panel a3 (spots *1-*3, 4*, and 5*) and in more detail in panels 1*, 2*, 4*, and 5*. The same sections (subjected to 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin labeling, followed by uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining) were examined by transmission EM. The improved resolution of FM on ultrathin sections, the high specificity of the biotin/streptavidin interaction, and the lack of background allowed us to correlate with high fidelity the fluorescent pattern (panel a3, box) and the caveolae seen on electron micrographs (panel a4) of the same sections. Fluorescent puncta (spots *2, *3, and 4*) correlated with 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin-labeled individual caveolae within the same region. Because of low efficiency of gold labeling, not all of the fluorescent stained caveolae were labeled by 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin (panel a4, arrowhead). Fig. 9 shows, on the same sections, 8-nm gold-conjugated streptavidin-labeled caveolae either closely attached to the PM (panels a5-a8) or already open to the subendothelial space (panel a9), indicating that fusion with the PM had occurred. We have developed a cell-free system to assess caveolar fusion having the appropriate geometry and molecular machinery required by the two participating membranes. We used intact sheets of basolateral endothelial PM generated by brief sonication of endothelial monolayers grown on coverslips. A pure fraction of functional caveolae capable of fusion was obtained by the GTP-dependent release from freshly prepared PM sheets. The caveolae were biotin-labeled prior to fission to facilitate their detection by means of the biotin-streptavidin complex following the interaction with the PM. Using these approaches, we carried out a detailed analysis of the distribution of SNAREs on the target endothelial PM. We observed a generalized clustering of t-SNARE proteins as evidenced by both SNAP-23 and Synt-4 forming individual clusters distributed throughout the PM. Immunogold labeling EM showed a high density of t-SNARE proteins on the cytosolic leaflet of the PM. The majority of gold particles detecting SNAP-23 or Synt-4 were found as clusters of 100-150 nm in diameter. Strikingly, SNAP-23 and Synt-4 also co-localized and formed patches of five to seven co-clusters/100 μm2 of PM surface. We observed that a total of 61% of the Cav-1-positive puncta co-localized with t-SNARE clusters (either SNAP-23 or Synt-4 clusters), representing 47% of the total, and with SNAP-23/Synt-4 co-clusters, representing 14% of the total. Because the ECs provide a suitable system for studying membrane fusion due to their high transcytotic activity, we were able to visualize with high optical resolution and thereby quantify the existence of binary complexes of SNAP-23 and Synt-4 and their co-localization with Cav-1. An important question is why there is only a 14% co-localization of Cav-1-positive puncta with the SNAP-23/Synt-4 co-clusters. An explanation of this finding may be the fact that, at any given time, approximately one-third of the total caveolar population of a typical EC is open to the basolateral side of the cell. Thus, while attached to the PM, the caveolae are expected to co-localize with the SNAP-23/Synt-4 co-clusters only during the fusion event. As membrane fusion is a very rapid process and Cav-1/t-SNARE interactions are short-lived, at any given time, relatively few caveolae are expected to co-localize with the t-SNARE co-clusters, as evident from our data. We surmise that co-localization of Cav-1-positive puncta with the organized clusters and co-clusters represents the sites of fusion of caveolae with the PM. Interestingly, our in vitro fusion assay data demonstrating that ∼50% of the fused caveolae co-localized with SNAP-23- or Synt-4-positive puncta are in close agreement with the morphological evidence of 61% co-localization discussed above. Moreover, our results are in the range of values obtained for docking and fusion of secretory granules during regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells (13Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that t-SNARE clustering is dependent on membrane cholesterol. We have shown previously that the endothelial SNARE proteins associate with cholesterol in endothelial multimolecular transcytotic complexes (7Predescu A.S. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the present study points to the important role of PM cholesterol as a requirement for the formation of t-SNARE clusters. Rings of cholesterol consisting of 6-8 units transiently formed at the line of fusion between the PM and caveolar membrane were detected on freeze-fractured and thin-sectioned membranes (20Simionescu N. Lupu F. Simionescu M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These previous results are in agreement with our observations showing the importance of PM cholesterol in the mechanism of t-SNARE clustering. Therefore, our results suggest that the cholesterol-dependent association of t-SNARE proteins in clusters and co-clusters is a key determinant of fusion of caveolae during exocytosis. The cholesterol-dependent clustering of t-SNARE proteins and their distribution on flotation gradients demonstrated that a small fraction of t-SNARE proteins was associated with Cav-1, a marker of DRMs, whereas a larger pool of SNARE proteins was localized in the cholesterol-rich microdomains of the PM distinct from DRMs. In other cell types, SNARE proteins display different association with DRMs ranging from 20% in PC12 cells to 70% in adipocytes, suggesting an important role of lipid rafts in membrane fusion and probably in regulating SNARE function (21Salaun C. Declan J.J. Chamberlain L.K. Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The functional significance of these pools of t-SNARE proteins in the mechanism of caveolar fusion to the PM is not clear. As caveolar fusion was shown to occur mainly with t-SNARE clusters in the target PM, a possible function of these two pools may be to hold t-SNARE proteins in reserve in distinct PM microdomains until they are needed for caveolar fusion. The docking and fusion of caveolae with the target PM and the involvement of caveolae in the transcytotic pathway in ECs were further assessed by correlative FM and EM. Optical imaging with virtually no background by high resolution FM on ultrathin sections of PM sheets correlated with the ultrastructure of the same region, i.e. the streptavidin-Texas Red-positive spots were identified with high fidelity by EM with the individual docked and fused caveolae. These EM results reinforce the observation that the t-SNARE clusters are the preferential sites for caveolar fusion with the target PM. Moreover, the results unequivocally show that caveolar fusion with the PM occurs in our system. In summary, our results demonstrate that clusters of endothelial t-SNARE proteins (SNAP-23 and Synt-4) form in cholesterol-rich microdomains of the PM and that these clusters are the preferential sites for caveolar fusion with the target PM during exocytosis. These findings support the hypothesis that caveolar interaction with t-SNARE clusters is essential for fusion and, as such, is important in the regulation of transcytosis across the endothelial barrier.

In all of these pathogenic organisms, the flagellin proteins are heavily glycosylated with a 2-keto-3-deoxy acid, pseudaminic acid (5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid).

By studying the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid, methods can be developed for combating these pathogenic organisms.Pseudaminic acid shares great structural similarity with another 9-carbon 2-keto-3-deoxy acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc or sialic acid) (Fig. 1B). The biosynthesis of sialic acid has been well studied and the enzyme directly responsible for forming sialic acid is known as sialic acid synthase or N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (SAS or NeuB). Sialic acid synthase catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate with N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAc) to form sialic acid and phosphate (12Blacklow R.S. Warren L. J. Biol.

The tetrahedral intermediate then collapses to form orthophosphate and the open chain form of sialic acid that cyclizes to the pyranose form in solution. Formation of the tetrahedral intermediate was proposed to proceed in a stepwise fashion through an oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Two other well studied PEP condensing enzymes that utilize very similar mechanisms are 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of PEP and d-arabino-5-phosphate (17Levin D.H.

Three genes that show homology to neuB were identified in C. jejuni, where one encoded a sialic acid synthase (neuB1) and the other two genes were thought to encode proteins that modify the flagellin proteins (neuB2 and neuB3) (8Linton D. Karlyshev A.V. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Gregson N.A. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1120-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Sundaram A.K. Pitts L. Muhammad K. Wu J. Betenbaugh M. Woodard R.W. Vann W.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NeuB3 shows 35.0% identity to the NeuB from Neisseria meningitidis and was found to be essential for the formation of flagella because an insertional mutation in the gene resulted in aflagellate C. jejuni (8Linton D. Karlyshev A.V. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Gregson N.A. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1120-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this study we report the first identification and characterization of the activity of NeuB3 as a pseudaminic acid synthase that catalyzes the condensation of PEP with 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc to form pseudaminic acid.There are two potential mechanisms proposed for pseudaminic acid synthase. The first and most likely mechanism is a C-O bond cleavage mechanism similar to that of sialic acid synthase (Fig. 2A). The second potential mechanism involves P-O bond cleavage whereby a direct attack of water onto the phosphate group of PEP generates phosphate and the enolate anion of pyruvate (Fig. 2B). The enolate then attacks the aldehyde of the open chain form of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc producing the open chain form of pseudaminic acid. Precedence for this mechanism comes from pyruvate kinase (22Seeholzer S.H. Jaworowski A. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and PEP carboxykinase (23Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8105-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) where catalysis occurs through formation of the enolate anion of pyruvate via nucleophilic attack at the phosphate group of PEP. In this article we use [2-18O]PEP to show that, like sialic acid synthase, pseudaminic acid synthase also employs a C-O bond cleavage mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General Methods—Purine nucleoside phosphorylase and phosphoenolpyruvate were purchased from Sigma. 18O-Enriched water (95%) was purchased from Icon Isotopes. 2-Amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside was purchased from Berry and Associates. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal.

Concentrations of stock substrate solutions were determined enzymatically using the reported assay conditions with high concentrations of NeuB3 (64 μg) and excess co-substrate. NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker AV300 or AV400 spectrometer. ESI-MS was performed on a Bruker Esquire LC mass spectrometer.Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of NeuB3—The neuB3 gene, Cj1317, was obtained from the genome strain C. jejuni 11168 by PCR amplification with Pwo polymerase according to manufacturer's conditions (Roche) (8Linton D.

The primers used were: 5′-CCCCCCCATATGCAAATAGGAAATTTTAAC-3′ (forward sequence) and 5′-CCCCCCGTCGACTCATCATTGGAAATCTCCTTGTTTAAAG-3′ (reverse sequence). The gene was then cloned into the expression plasmid pCWori+ as an NdeI-SalI fragment, and the construct was maintained in Escherichia coli AD202, which was used for enzyme production (25Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μgml–1 ampicillin. Overexpression of NeuB3 was induced through the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.60, with growth at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were harvested through centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) containing pepstatin A (1 mg/liter) and aprotonin (1 mg/liter), and lysed with two passes through a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 1.5 h, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and loaded directly onto a 5-ml Hi-trap™ Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). NeuB3 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0to1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Fractions containing active enzyme were desalted 2 times by concentration and reconstitution with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) using Amicon Ultra Centricons (Millipore), and then flash frozen with 10% glycerol. Protein samples were determined to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass was determined to be 38,670 using ESI-MS (38,647 predicted).NMR Incubation Studies and Tests for Activity— 6-Deoxy-AltdiNAc was synthesized according to literature procedures (26Flowers H.M.

A solution of Tris-DCl buffer prepared in D2O (700 μl, 10 mm, pD 7.4) containing 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (10 mm) and PEP (20 mm) was placed in an NMR tube. Initial 1H and proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were taken. The solution was removed from the tube and mixed with 50 mg of NeuB3 (buffer exchanged with the deuterated Tris-HCl buffer (pD 7.4)) and 1 mm MgCl2 to a total volume of 1 ml.

The extent of 18O incorporation at the C-2 position was determined to be 54% by mass spectrometry: ESI-MS (MeOH) m/z 169 (M – H+, 18O, 100), 167 (M – H+, 16O, 85). 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to determine that the position of the label was at the C-2 position: 31P NMR δ –2.999 (s, P-16O, PEP), –3.018 (s, P-18O, PEP).A solution of Tris-DCl buffer prepared in D2O (700 μl, 10 mm, pD 7.4) containing 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (10 mm) and 20 mm [2-18O]PEP was placed in an NMR tube, and Chelex-100 resin (∼20 mg previously washed with D2O) was added. An initial proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectrum was obtained with the following parameters: spectral frequency of 121.5 MHz, sweep width of 2437 Hz, acquisition time of 13.4 s, pulse delay of 2 s, and pulse width of 10 μs. The solution was decanted from the Chelex resin and mixed with 50 mg of NeuB3 (buffer exchanged with the deuterated Tris-HCl buffer (pD 7.4)) and 1 mm MgCl2. The reaction was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C and Chelex-100 resin (∼20 mg previously washed with D2O) was added. After a 1-h time period to allow complete complexation of the metals, another proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectrum was acquired with the same parameters: 31P NMR δ 0.0 (s, Pi-16O), –0.022 (s, Pi-18O), –3.010 (s, P-16O, PEP), –3.029 (s, P-18O, PEP).Isolation and Characterization of Pseudaminic Acid—Enzyme was removed from the reactions by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the resulting filtrate was loaded onto a 10-ml column of Dowex AG1-X8 resin (formate form) pre-equilibrated with water. A stepwise gradient of 0–1.0 m formic acid in water with 0.2 m increments (50 ml per increment) was used to elute the pseudaminic acid from the column. Pseudaminic acid eluted from the column in the 0.2 and 0.4 m fractions that were concentrated in vacuo and then lyophilized. Pseudaminic acid was characterized using 1H, 13C, two-dimensional COSY, HMQC, and one-dimensional TOCSY NMR spectroscopy (in 10 mm deuterated phosphate buffer pD 7.4), and negative ESI-MS mass spectrometry. 1H (D2O) δ 1.0 (d, 3 H, J8,9 6.5 Hz, H-9), 1.95 (dd, 1 H, J3ax,4 12.2 Hz, J3ax,3eq 13.3 Hz, H-3ax), 1.99 (dd, 1 H, J3eq3ax 13.3, J3eq,4 4.6 Hz, H-3eq), 1.86 (s, 3 H, CH3), 1.89 (s, 3 H, CH3), 3.91 (dd, 1 H, J5,6 1.7 Hz, J6,7 10.3 Hz, H-6), 4.01 (dq, 1 H, J7,8 3.7 Hz, J8,9 6.5 Hz, H-8), 4.03 (dd, 1 H, J6,7 10.3, J7,8 3.7, H-7), 4.05 (ddd, 1 H, J3eq,4 4.6, J3ax,4 12.2, J4,5 5.5, H-4), 4.13 (dd, 1 H, J4,5 5.5, J5,6 1.7, H-5). 13C NMR (D2O) δ 15.2 (C-9), 21.8 (CH3-NAc), 22.0 (CH3-NAc), 34.8 (C-3), 48.8 (C-5), 52.9 (C-7), 65.2 (C-4), 66.8 (C-8), 69.9 (C-6), 96.4 (C-2), 173.7, 174.6, 176.3 (C = O). -ve ESI-MS (H2O) m/z 333 (M – H+), m/z 315 (M – H2O).Enzyme Kinetics as Determined by a Continuous Coupled Assay—Enzyme kinetics were measured by a continuous coupled phosphate assay (30Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A cuvette containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (variable), PEP (variable), 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (200 μm), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (5 units buffer exchanged twice into 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0), and MnCl2 (10 mm) was thermally equilibrated for 5 min at 37 °C. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of NeuB3 (3.2 μg) for a total assay volume of 500 μl and the enzymatic rate was calculated from the observed increase of absorption at A360 (using ϵ = 11,000 m–1 cm–1). The Km value for 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc was measured in the presence of 1 mm PEP (saturating), and that for PEP was measured in the presence of 1 mm 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (saturating). Kinetic parameters were determined from initial velocities fit to Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the program Grafit (31Erithacus Software, Ltd.GraFit. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK2003Google Scholar).pH Versus Rate Profile Experiment—The pH versus rate profile was constructed using a mixture of 50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm MES buffer at pH 6–9. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase was buffer exchanged twice in the same buffer at the different pH values. Saturating 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (1 mm) and saturating PEP (1 mm) were used with the kinetic assay above. Initial rates were plotted against pH.Metal Dependence Experiment—The metal dependence experiment was carried out with saturating 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (1 mm) and saturating PEP (1 mm) at pH 7.0 using the kinetic assay above. Different divalent metal cations were independently added at a concentration of 10 mm and the initial velocities were determined. The rates were normalized to the fastest rate (Co2+). Controls included adding 10 mm EDTA or no additives (enzyme as isolated) to the kinetic assay.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverexpression and Purification of NeuB3-C. jejuni—The neuB3 gene, Cj1317, was obtained from the genome strain C. jejuni 11168 by PCR amplification and overexpressed in E. coli. NeuB3 was isolated using a single anion exchange chromatographic step and the resulting protein was found to be greater than 90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The molecular mass of NeuB3 was determined to be 38,670 ± 30 using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (38,647 predicted).FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE gel showing the expression and purification of recombinant pseudaminic acid synthase (NeuB3) using ion-exchange chromatography. Lane 1 contains molecular mass standards of 66 and 29 kDa, lane 2 shows crude cell extract, lane 3 shows the purified pseudaminic acid synthase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Test for Activity of NeuB3—One of the main hurdles in studying pseudaminic acid synthase is that the putative substrate 6-deoxy-Altdi-NAc is not commercially available. To obtain a sample it was necessary to chemically synthesize the compound in 12 steps from l-fucose using a protocol described in the literature (26Flowers H.M. Levy A. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; : 189-195Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Liav A.L. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test whether NeuB3 showed pseudaminic acid synthase activity, 1 eq of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc and 2 eq of PEP were incubated in deuterated buffer containing Mn2+ and NeuB3, and the reaction was monitored by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. Before the addition of NeuB3, the 31P NMR spectrum shows a single phosphorus peak corresponding to the phosphate group of PEP at –3.01 ppm (Fig. 4, upper panel). After the addition, a new peak appears at 0 ppm corresponding to inorganic phosphate released during catalysis (Fig. 4, lower panel). The identities of the phosphorus peaks were verified by spiking with PEP and phosphate standards (data not shown). Control incubations lacking either enzyme or 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc did not show the formation of orthophosphate under identical conditions, indicating that the reaction was not because of either background hydrolysis or a phosphatase impurity. In addition, ManNAc could not replace 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc as a substrate indicating that NeuB3 does not possess detectable sialic acid synthase activity.FIGURE 431P NMR spectra monitoring the conversion of PEP to phosphate by NeuB3. The upper panel shows the spectrum before the addition of NeuB3. The lower panel shows the spectrum taken after 5 min of incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course as observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the conversion of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc to pseudaminic acid. The initial 1H NMR spectra shows that 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc exists as a 3:1 ratio of the β to α anomer in solution (Fig. 5, upper panel). The anomeric ratio is apparent from integration of the two acetamido signals of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (β-anomer at 1.88 and 1.93 ppm, and α-anomer at 1.89 and 1.90 ppm) and also the anomeric protons (data not shown). After the addition of NeuB3, the complete conversion of the substrate into largely a single anomer of a new product is observed (acetamido peaks at 1.81 and 1.85 ppm). This would be expected for the pyranose form of a nonulosonic acid that would strongly favor the α-anomer in solution. Further support is seen in the appearance of the key characteristic peaks of pseudaminic acid because of the signals of the C-3 methylene protons (Fig. 5, lower panel). The H-3ax (axial) proton signal is a doublet of doublets that appears at 1.62 ppm and the H-3eq (equatorial) proton signal is a doublet of doublets that appears at 1.77 ppm (slightly obscured by the methyl N-acetyl proton signals) under these conditions. The fact that the H-3ax proton signal appears as a triplet is because of strong geminal coupling to the H-3eq proton (J3ax,3eq 13.3 Hz) and strong coupling to the H-4 proton (J3ax,4 12.2 Hz). The large J3ax,4 coupling can only arise if H-3ax and H-4 have a trans-diaxial relationship. This indicates that PEP attacks the si-face of the aldehyde of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc to generate an (S)-configuration at C-4.FIGURE 51H NMR spectra monitoring the conversion of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc into pseudaminic acid by NeuB3.

One can postulate reasonable biosynthetic routes to either enantiomer using very similar enzymatic pathways and therefore it was conceivable that either the d-or l-enantiomer of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc could be the correct substrate for NeuB3. The fact that the l-isomer of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc is the substrate of NeuB3 indicates that the stereochemical assignment of pseudaminic acid is correct as the previously assigned l-glycero-l-manno isomer (4Thibault P.

The large coupling constants of J3a,4 (12.2 Hz) and small coupling constants of J4,5 (5.5 Hz) and J5,6 (1.7 Hz) indicates that H-4 is axial, H-5 is equatorial, and H-6 is axial (TABLE ONE).

Exposure of HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells to reactive oxygen species, generated by glucose oxidase (GO), enhanced the levels of NEIL1 mRNA and polypeptide by 2–4-fold by 6 h after GO treatment. A similar oxidative stress-induced increase in human NEIL1 (hNEIL1) promoter-dependent luciferase expression in HCT116 cells indicates that reactive oxygen species activates NEIL1 transcription. The transcriptional start site of hNEIL1 was mapped, and the upstream promoter sequence was characterized via luciferase reporter assay. Two identical CRE/AP-1-binding sites were identified in the promoter that binds transcription factors c-Jun and CREB/ATF2. This binding was significantly enhanced in extracts of cells treated with GO. Furthermore, a simultaneous increase in the level of phosphorylated c-Jun suggests its involvement in up-regulating the NEIL1 promoter. Oxidative stress-induced activation of NEIL1 appears to be involved in the feedback regulation of cellular repair activity needed to handle an increase in the level of oxidative base damage.

Oxidative DNA damage, including a multitude of damaged bases, abasic (activator protein (AP)) sites, and DNA strand breaks, is believed to be responsible for sporadic mutations leading to cancer and other pathological as well as age-related syndromes (1Ames B.N.

Most of the oxidative damage in DNA is repaired via the base excision repair pathway, in which oxidized and altered bases are excised by DNA glycosylases in the first step of repair (5Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Kow Y.W. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Base excision repair is highly conserved among all organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to humans. In E. coli, three oxidatively damaged base-specific glycosylases, endonuclease III (Nth), formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), and endonuclease VIII (Nei), excise modified DNA bases with overlapping specificity. Based on structural similarity and reaction mechanism, these enzymes are classified in two families with Nth in one and Nei and Fpg in the other (6Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S.

NTH1 removes mostly oxidized pyrimidines, e.g. thymine glycol, whereas 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), functionally similar to Fpg but mechanistically analogous to Nth, is most active with 8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine-guanine substrates (9Ikeda S.

This novel substrate structure preference of NEILs raises the possibility of their specialized in vivo functions for repair of oxidized bases in transient bubbles formed during replication and/or transcription.Taken together, these results support the scenario that OGG1 and NTH1 are involved primarily in repair of oxidative damage formed in inactive sequences constituting the bulk of the genome. In contrast, NEIL1 and NEIL2 may be preferentially involved in repair of oxidized bases from the active sequences during replication or transcription, which should be more urgent than the repair of inactive sequences. In this report, we examined the possibility of modulation of NEIL1 activity, and we observed that human NEIL1 (hNEIL1) is activated by ROS. We then characterized the hNEIL1 promoter and identified a pair of CRE/AP-1 sequences involved in the oxidative stress response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—The human colorectal carcinoma line HCT116 (with wild type p53), a gift of B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University), was cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). At 70% confluence, the cells were treated with glucose oxidase (GO; Roche Applied Science) at 100 ng/ml for 1 h, followed by washing with and incubation in fresh medium. This treatment did not affect cell viability, as judged by the rate of cell growth.Measurement of Intracellular ROS Level—Changes in intracellular ROS level after GO treatment were determined as described previously (21Ribardo D.A. Kuhl K.R. Boldogh I. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Chopra A.K. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 5 μm 5-(and-6) carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA; Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. In control experiments, we determined that cellular uptake of H2DCF-DA reached a plateau at about 18 min when 0.6% of DCF, the oxidized form of H2DCF, was released in the medium (data not shown). As a control, we also treated the cells with DCF, and we observed a small increase in intracellular fluorescence (<5%) after glucose oxidase treatment (data not shown). The change in DCF fluorescence of treated versus mock-treated cells was determined by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FAC-Scan). The mean fluorescence for 12,000 cells, from three or more independent experiments, was analyzed, after correction for DCF extrusion in the medium, and expressed as ±S.E. (Fig. 1).Western Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on ice for 30 min in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science), and then microcentrifuged. Western analysis of the supernatant was carried out with antibodies to hNEIL1 (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX), CREB, ATF2, c-Jun, and phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), using enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences); the signals were quantitated by densitometric scanning.RT-PCR Analysis—RNA extraction was carried out with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2–5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a Titan one-step RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science), followed by a limiting cycle amplification protocol using the following primer combinations: hNEIL1 forward, 5′-CGG CGG CTG CGT GGA GAA GTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTC CCA GCG GCC GAA CCG GCG-3′, designed to amplify a 300-bp region; GAPDH forward, 5′-GTG AAG GTC GGA GTC AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-3′, designed to amplify a 294-bp region (total number of cycles: 24 for hNEIL1 and 20 for GAPDH). The products of the semiquantitative RT-PCR were resolved in a 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed.For quantitative, real time RT-PCR, one-step RT-PCR was performed with 100 ng of cellular RNA for both the target gene and an endogenous control in single-plex tubes using TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagent kit (P/N 4309169). The cycling parameters (for 40 cycles) in an ABI7000 thermal cycler were as follows: reverse transcription at 48 °C for 30 min, AmpliTaq activation 95 °C for 10 min, denaturation 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension 60 °C for 1 min. Duplicate CT values were calculated using Microsoft Excel and using a comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2–ΔΔCT) was calculated after normalization to the 18 S RNA as an endogenous reference, and relative to a calibrator (one of the experimental samples).Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Analysis (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from HCT116 cells were prepared as described earlier (22Nada S. Chang P.K. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7660-7667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For EMSA, 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotides and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) in a binding buffer containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by electrophoresis in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) at 200 V for 1 h. The gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. Competition of binding was performed in the presence of a 50- or 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide and incubating for 20 min at room temperature before adding the probe. Supershift assays were performed by preincubating the assay mixture with 4 μg of antibody against CREB/ATF2 or c-Jun for 1 h at 4°C before the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex probe.Genomic Cloning of the 5′-Upstream Region of hNEIL1—An NdeI/XhoI fragment of the hNEIL1 cDNA was used to screen a BAC DNA library (Resgen) under stringent conditions. Restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis of BAC clones identified 18-kb HindIII, 13-kb EcoRI/HindIII, and 12-kb BamHI/HindIII fragments that hybridized to the probe. The 13-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment was further subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. The sequences of the genomic clone were confirmed by matching with the published NEIL1 gene sequence (GenBank™ accession number AAH10876). Analysis of candidate cis-elements to identify relevant transcription factors was performed using the programs version 2.2. Parameters for MatInspector were set for 1.0 core similarity (a 4-nucleotide highly conserved sequence) and 0.85 matrix similarity, employing the vertebrate matrix group.Primer Extension Analysis—An antisense primer, P2 (5′-GGCTGAGGCAGGAGAATC-3′), complementary to the 5′-untranslated region of the hNEIL1 cDNA, near the beginning of exon 1, was 5′-32P-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to 50 μg of total RNA at 58 °C for 20 min. The primer extension was performed with the annealed RNA DNA duplex, using 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C for 1 h in the supplied extension buffer, and the products were resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. A control reaction was set up with a second antisense oligo P1, further downstream to the P2 sequence. Sequencing reactions, generated by Sanger's dideoxy termination method, using primer P2 annealed to the hNEIL1 plasmid, were run in parallel to determine the exact length of the primer extension products.Plasmids, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—A 2.1-kb fragment spanning the upstream sequence of hNEIL1, including part of the first exon, was subcloned from the 13-kb genomic clone at the XhoI/HindIII sites of the promoterless luciferase vector pGL2-basic (Promega), and the recombinant plasmid was named p(–2100) hNEIL1 luc. Starting with this plasmid, we generated several deletion constructs by PCR amplification, with sense primers representing different segments of the 5′ regions of hNEIL1; the 5′ deletion fragments were subsequently fused upstream of the luciferase gene in the expression vector. The sequences of sense primers to generate these reporter plasmid constructs are given in TABLE ONE. All of these were used in combination with a common antisense primer, 5′-CTT CCC GGG TTC AAG TGA TTC TCC TGC CTC-3′. Point mutations were generated in p(–1800/+40)NEIL1 luc with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) per the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligo sets used are as follows (mutated nucleotides are underlined): distal CRE/AP-1 site, 5′-GGC AGG CAG ATC ACC TGA GGT TGG GAG TTT GAG ACC AGC-3′ and 5′-GCT GGT CTC AAA CTC CCA ACC TCA GGT GAT CTG CCT GCC-3′; proximal CRE/AP-1 site, 5′-GGC GGG CAG ATT ACT TGA GG T TGG GAG TTC AAG ACC AGC-3′ and 5′-GCT GGT CTT GAA CTC CCA ACC TCA AGT AAT CTG CCC GCC-3′. The nucleotide sequences of both deletion and mutant constructs were verified by sequencing. The HCT116 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and their extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the data were normalized to co-transfected Renilla luciferase (control reporter) to correct for variation in transfection efficiency. Co-expression experiments were performed using expression vectors containing full-length cDNAs of the transcription factor c-Jun.TABLE ONEPrimer sequences for luciferase constructsPrimerPrimer sequencePlasmid1800-luc sense5′-GGT TAC CCA TGT TGT TGC ATG TGG CAG-3′p(-1800/+40) NEIL1 luc1200-luc sense5′-GAA CCA TAT GTT TTC TAA TGC AGA GG-3′p(-1200/+40) NEIL1 luc900-luc sense5′-CTA CTC AGG AGG CTG AGG CAA GAG-3′p(-900/+40) NEIL1 luc600-luc sense5′-GTG ATG CAG CAT CTA TCT CAA ACA-3′p(-600/+40) NEIL1 luc300-luc sense5′-CTA CTT GGG AGG CTG AGG CTG AGG-3′p(-300/+40) NEIL1 luc100-luc sense5′-CTC ACT TCT GTA ATC CCA GCA CTT-3′p(-100/+40) NEIL1 luc50-luc sense5′-GGT CAG GAG TTC AAGACC AGC CTG-3′p(-50/+40) NEIL1 luc Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—In all experiments, including densitometric scans of Western blots or RT-PCR analysis and luciferase assays, results were calculated as the means (±S.D.) of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance for comparisons of multiple groups. p values of 0.05 or less were deemed to be statistically significant. All statistical tests were done using SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific).RESULTSOxidative Stress Transiently Increases NEIL1 Protein and mRNA Levels in HCT116 Cells—To explore the effects of oxidative stress on NEIL1 expression, we treated HCT116 cells for 1 h with a subtoxic dose (100 ng/ml) of the ROS generator GO, and we then analyzed NEIL1 protein and mRNA levels at various times. GO treatment caused 2.4 ± 0.3-fold increase in the intracellular ROS level in these cells after 1 h (Fig. 1). Mock and GO-treated cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 20 h. Western analysis of whole cell and more significantly nuclear extracts showed an increase in the NEIL1 protein level within 3 h of GO treatment, reaching up to 2–4-fold over the control at 6–9 h, and before returning to the base line by 20 h (Fig. 2). The OGG1 polypeptide level remained unchanged over a similar time course of GO treatment (Fig. 2A). The GO treatment similarly increased the NEIL1 mRNA level in HCT116 cells (up to 4-fold at 6–9 h), as analyzed by both semi-quantitative (Fig. 3A) and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). The GO treatment was performed in parallel in MRC5, human primary fibroblasts. Real time RT-PCR analysis of RNA revealed a similar induction of the transcript level upon exposure to ROS (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 2Induction of hNEIL1 in oxidatively stressed HCT116 cells. A, after treating HCT116 cells with GO (100 ng/ml), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” total lysates of cells, harvested at various times, were analyzed for NEIL1 and OGG1 levels by Western blotting. β-Actin was used as the loading control (left panel); the ratios of band intensities of hNEIL1 or hOGG1 to β-actin are shown in the right panel. Results correspond to mean (± S.D.) from three separate experiments.

We cloned a 13-kb EcoRI/HindIII genomic fragment containing the complete transcription unit of the NEIL1 gene into pBluescript, together with a significant part of the 5′-flanking region. Comparison of the genomic sequences of hNEIL1 to its cDNA showed that the transcribed sequence spans ∼8kb and contains 10 exons. The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis; the longest product observed extended 40 bp from the primer, P2, indicating a G in the sense strand as the site most frequently used for transcription (Fig. 4). Primer P1 failed to show any primer extension product. The initiation codon of the NEIL1 polypeptide was located in the 2nd exon, exon 1 (1 kb) being the untranslated region. Transfac software analysis of a 2.1-kb fragment spanning upstream sequences, including part of the 1st exon, identified several putative cis-elements for transcription factors. It is interesting to note the presence of binding sites for several b-Zip family proteins, including c-Jun, CREB, and NF-E2/AP-1-related factors (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 4Mapping of NEIL1 transcriptional initiation site. A pair of oligodeoxynucleotides, complementary to 5′-untranslated region of the hNEIL1 cDNA, was annealed to 50 μg of total RNA from HCT116 cells and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase in separate reactions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, 1st lane, primer extension product with P1 oligo; 2nd lane, product with P2 oligo.

Deletion of the region between –1800 and –900 bp caused a 2–3-fold decrease of luciferase activity. Additional deletion of the downstream sequence to –600 or –500 bp did not further decrease promoter activity, whereas deletion of the region spanning –300 and –100 bp resulted in another 3-fold decrease in promoter activity, indicating that this region is the major contributor to NEIL1 expression. Furthermore, the minimal promoter activity could be detected in the plasmid containing the –50/+40 sequences.Oxidative Stress Transactivates the NEIL1 Gene Promoter—To identify the promoter region essential for transcriptional up-regulation of NEIL1 during oxidative stress, HCT116 cells were transfected with three different NEIL1 reporter constructs: p(–1200) NEIL1 luc (bearing both proximal and distal CRE/AP-1 elements); p(–900) NEIL1 luc (bearing only proximal CRE/AP-1); and p(–50) NEIL1 luc (lacking both CRE/AP-1 elements). The luciferase activity was measured in extracts of transfected cells after GO treatment (Fig. 6A). A >2-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed with the p(–1200) NEIL1 luc construct within 3 h after exposure to GO. This up-regulation reached its peak at 6 h (>3.5-fold) and returned to the basal level at 20 h. Similarly, an ∼3-fold induction was observed with p(–900) NEIL1 luc after exposure to GO. However, the promoter-reporter construct p(–50) NEIL luc, containing the minimal promoter sequence, showed no up-regulation in luciferase activity under these conditions. These results indicate that the cis-acting elements responsible for oxidative stress-induced NEIL1 promoter activity are located 60–1200 bp 5′ to the transcriptional start site.FIGURE 6Identification of CRE/AP-1-binding sites required for ROS-induced activation.

However, protein N-glycosylation in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, etiological agent of human African sleeping sickness, is not well understood. Here, we describe the creation of a bloodstream-form T. brucei mutant that is deficient in the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme glucosidase II. Characterization of the variant surface glycoprotein, the main glycoprotein synthesized by the parasite with two N-glycosylation sites, revealed unexpected changes in the N-glycosylation of this molecule. Structural characterization by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical and enzymatic treatments revealed that one of the two glycosylation sites was occupied by conventional oligomannose structures, whereas the other accumulated unusual structures in the form of Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–3(GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, and Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–3(Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc. The possibility that these structures might arise from Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 by unusually rapid α-mannosidase processing was ruled out using a mixture of α-mannosidase inhibitors. The results suggest that bloodstream-form T. brucei can transfer both Man9GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 to the variant surface glycoprotein in a site-specific manner and that, unlike organisms that transfer exclusively Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the T. brucei UDP-Glc: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase and glucosidase II enzymes can use Man5GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man5GlcNAc2, respectively, as their substrates. The ability to transfer Man5GlcNAc2 structures to N-glycosylation sites destined to become Man4–3GlcNAc2 or complex structures may have evolved as a mechanism to conserve dolichol-phosphate-mannose donors for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and points to fundamental differences in the specificities of host and parasite glycosyltransferases that initiate the synthesis of complex N-glycans.

BioEssays. 1996; 18: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). There are many VSG genes, and each encodes a GPI-anchored glycoprotein with one to three N-glycosylation sites (2Mehlert A.

In eukaryotes, the precursor for N-glycans is built up on the lipid carrier dolichol (Dol) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In most organisms, the final precursor is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, the glycan portion of which is transferred en bloc via the action of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), to Asn residues within Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons during protein translation and sequestration into the lumen of the ER. Processing of the precursor structure by glycosidase and glycosyltransferase enzymes within the ER and Golgi apparatus generates the final set of mature structures. In the first steps of processing, the outer α1–2-linked glucose is removed by glucosidase I and the two remaining α1–3 linked glucose residues are removed by glucosidase II. Glucosidase II is a heterodimer; the catalytic α-subunit is a member of the family 31 glycosyl hydrolases, and the β subunit generally contains a KDEL-type ER retention motif (8Trombetta E.S.

For example, Trypanosoma conhorini, Trypanosoma dionisii, Leptomonas samueli, Herpetomonas samuelpessoai, and Herpetomonas muscarum utilize triantennary Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol; Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia harmosa, and Leishmania enriettii utilize biantennary Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol; Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania adleri, and Blastocrithidia culicus utilize biantennary Man6GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (15Parodi A.J.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in the Americas, utilizes Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol during most of its life cycle but uses both Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol and Man7GlcNAc2-PP-Dol in its bloodstream trypomastigote stage (19Doyle P. de la Canal L. Engel J.C. Parodi A.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The insect-dwelling procyclic form of the African trypanosome T. brucei makes and transfers Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (20Acosta-Serrano A. O'Rear J. Quellhorst G. Lee S.H. Hwa K.Y. Krag S.S. Englund P.T. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although bloodstream-form T. brucei also makes Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (21Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. Ferguson M.A.J.

This observation together with the identification by Zamze et al. (4Zamze S.E. Ashford D.A. Wooten E.W. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20244-20261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of unusually small (Man3–4GlcNAc2) N-glycans on mature VSG221 and the accumulation of substantial amounts of Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol in bloodstream-form T. brucei (24Löw P. Dallner G. Mayor S. Cohen S. Chait B.T. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19250-19257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests two possible models of protein N-glycosylation in the ER of bloodstream-form T. brucei (23Bangs J.D. Doering T.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17697-17705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (a) the transfer of Man9GlcNAc2 to some N-glycosylation sites and the transfer of (Endo H-resistant) Man5GlcNAc2 to others and (b) the transfer of Man9GlcNAc2 to both sites and the unusually rapid (immediate) processing of some sites to Endo H-resistant structures in the ER. To help discriminate between these models and to gain further insights into protein N-glycosylation in this parasite, we constructed a bloodstream-form T. brucei glucosidase II null mutant and used α-mannosidase inhibitors and assessed their effects on VSG N-glycosylation patterns. Cultivation of Trypanosomes—Bloodstream-form T. brucei genetically modified to express T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein were cultivated in HMI-9 medium containing 2.5 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator as described in Wirtz et al. (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In some experiments the parasites were grown for 48 h in the presence of 6 mm 1-deoxynojirimycin (Sigma), the α-glucosidase inhibitor, or with a mixture of α-mannosidase inhibitors (186 μm kifunensin (Industrial Research Ltd., New Zealand), 100 μm swainsonine, and 0.8 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada)). Radiolabeling of Trypanosomes and Endoglycosidase Digestions— Cells were washed and resuspended at 2.5 × 107/ml in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium preincubated with or without 0.8 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem) for 15 min or with and without the aforementioned mixture of α-mannosidase inhibitors for 30 min and pulse-labeled with 75 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 min at 37 °C. Cells were cooled by the addition of 20 ml of ice-cold trypanosome dilution buffer (26Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm methionine and harvested by centrifugation 800 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots (5 μl) were combined with 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 0.005 units of Endo H (Roche Applied Science) or with 20 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 500 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Mock digestion controls were performed with buffer without enzyme. After 3 h at 37°C, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. The gel was soaked in En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at –70 °C with a Dupont Cronex intensifying screen. DNA Isolation and Manipulation—Plasmid DNA was purified from Escherichia coli (DH5α) using Qiagen Miniprep or Maxiprep kits, as appropriate. Gel extraction and reaction cleanup was performed using Qiaquick kits. Custom oligonucleotides were obtained from Thermo Hybaid or the Dundee University oligonucleotide facility. T. brucei genomic DNA was isolated from ∼2 × 108 bloodstream-form cells using DNAzol (Helena Biosciences) or from 5 × 109 procyclic cells using standard methods. Cloning and Sequencing of the TbGlcaseIIα ORF—A 2517-bp region, including the 2421-bp ORF identified from the T. brucei genome data base, was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase with 5′-tattgttgtttgcttgagtagg-3′ and 5′-atgagcaacaagatcagacc-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The cycling parameters used were 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 4 min followed by a final 10-min extension time at 72 °C. The products of three separate PCRs were ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and one representative clone from each was used for triple pass DNA sequencing. Generation of Gene Replacement Constructs—The 500-bp 5′- and 522-bp 3′-UTR sequences immediately adjacent to the start and stop codons of the TbGlcaseIIα ORF were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Taq with 5′-tcaagtacGCGGCCGCtacgttgacggagcgacg-3′ and 5′-tggacggtttaaacctaagcgaagcttcactgctagtttttcctactc-3′ and 5′-cgcttaggtttaaaccgtccaggatccgatggcgaggccggcgggttg-3′ and 5′-tcctcttaGCGGCCGCgacggcgtggaggaatgc-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The two PCR products were used together in a further PCR reaction to yield a product containing the 5′-UTR linked to the 3′-UTR by a short HindIII, PmeI, and BamHI cloning site (underlined) and NotI restriction sites at each end (capital letters). The product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) by topoisomerase-mediated ligation. Antibiotic resistance markers were cloned into the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites between the two UTRs to produce two constructs, one containing the puromycin acetyltransferase (PAC) drug resistance gene and one containing the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) hygromycin drug resistance gene. Transformation of Bloodstream-form T. brucei—Constructs for gene replacement and ectopic expression were purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit, digested with NotI to linearize, precipitated, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in sterile water. The linearized DNA was electroporated into T. brucei bloodstream cells (strain 427, variant 221) that were stably transformed to express T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein under G418 selection (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Cell culture and transformation was carried out as previously described (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 27Milne K.G. Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Southern Blotting—Aliquots of genomic DNA isolated from 100 ml of bloodstream-form T. brucei cultures (∼2 × 108 cells) were digested with various restriction enzymes. Fluorescein-labeled probes were generated using the CDP-star random prime labeling kit (Gene Images); 250 ng of template was used in a reaction volume of 50 μl and incubated for 90 min. Aliquots of 8 μl were used for each Southern blot experiment. Small Scale VSG Isolation—Soluble-form VSG was isolated from 100 ml of cultures containing ∼2 × 108 bloodstream-form T. brucei. The cultures were chilled in ice-water and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice in trypanosome dilution buffer (26Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) prewarmed to 37 °C and incubated for 5 min at the same temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 200-μl DE52 anion exchange column preequilibrated in lysis buffer. Fresh lysis buffer (800 μl without protease inhibitors) was applied in four stages, and the pooled column eluate was concentrated and diafiltered with water on a YM-10 spin concentrator (Microcon). The final sample of 50–100 μg sVSG221 was recovered in a volume of 100 μl of water. Electrospray-Mass Spectrometry (ES-MS) Analysis of Intact VSG— Samples of the small scale VSG preparations were diluted to ∼0.05 μg/μl in 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid or 50% methanol, 1% formic acid, loaded into nanotips (Micromass type F), and analyzed by positive ion ES-MS on a QTof2 instrument (Micromass) with tip and cone voltages of 1 kV and 30 V, respectively, or an ABI Q-StarXL instrument with tip and declustering potentials of 900 and 60 V, respectively. Data were collected, averaged, and processed using the maximum entropy algorithm using MassLynx software or using the Bayesian protein reconstruction algorithm using ABI Analyst software. ES-MS/MS Analysis of Pronase Glycopeptides—Samples (50 μl) of the remaining VSG were mixed with 5 μlof1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml freshly prepared Pronase (Sigma) dissolved in 10 mm calcium acetate. After 48 h at 37 °C, the digest was acidified with 100 μl of 1 m acetic acid, centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and passed through a small column of 50 μl of Chelex 100 (Na+) over 100 μl of Dowex AG50 (H+). The column was eluted 5 times with 150 μl of water, and the combined eluates, containing the glycopeptides, were dried by rotary evaporation. The samples were dissolved in 50 μlof30% propan-1-ol, 10% acetic acid or 50% methanol, 1% formic acid, and aliquots were loaded into nanotips (Micromass type F) for mass spectrometry. Pronase glycopeptide fractions were analyzed by positive ion ES-MS/MS in neutral loss scanning mode (neutral loss of m/z 81 for the loss of terminal hexose from doubly charged parent ions) using a Micromass Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tip and cone voltages were 1 kV and 40 V, and the collision energy was 15 V with argon as the collision gas at 3 × 10–3 torr. Glycopeptide ions identified in this experiment were analyzed on a QTof2 instrument (using the same source conditions) or on a Q-StarXL instrument, with tip and declustering potentials of 900 V and 60 V, in product ion scanning mode using collision energies of 30–60 V. Large Scale VSG and VSG N-Glycan Isolation—TbGlcaseIIα–/– null mutant parasites (2 × 1011) were harvested from the infected blood of 20 rats as previously described (27Milne K.G. Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The parasites were lysed by osmotic shock, and the sVSG was released into the supernatant, purified using DE-52 anion exchange chromatography according to the method of Cross (28Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The VSG was further purified by gel filtration on a 850 × 2.5-cm Sephacryl S200 column eluted with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 10 ml/h (29Mehlert A. Bond C.S. Ferguson M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protein peak fractions were pooled to yield 36 mg of sVSG after dialysis against water and lyophilization. A sample of sVSG221 (25 mg) was incubated in 200 μl of 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol (100 °C, 30 min), cooled, and diluted with 800 μl of 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.625% Triton X-100, 25 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The denatured glycoprotein was then treated with 50 units of PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C. The PNGase F digest was made 75% with respect to ice-cold ethanol and incubated at –20 °C overnight to precipitate the bulk of the protein. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dried and dissolved in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for gel filtration on a Sephacryl S200 column (13 × 1.5 cm) eluting at 10 ml/h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and 10-μl aliquots were spotted onto a silica gel-60 TLC plate (Merck) and stained for carbohydrate with orcinol reagent. The carbohydrate-positive fractions containing the released N-glycans were recovered close to the included volume, well separated from a major A280 absorption peak containing protein and detergent micelles. The glycan-containing fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and desalted by passage through 0.2-ml Chelex 100 (Na+) over 0.5 ml of Dowex AG50 (H+) over 0.5 ml of Dowex AG3 (OH–) over 0.2 ml of QAE-Sephadex A25 (OH–). The eluate and four column washings with 1.4 ml of water were pooled, dried by rotary evaporation, and dissolved in a 100 μl of water. N-Glycan Fractionation—The N-glycan pool released from sVSG221 was separated by Dionex high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a 4.6 × 250-mm Carbopack PA1 column eluting at 0.6 ml/min with 5 mm sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 150 mm sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH over 55 min. Sodium ions were removed from the eluate on-line with a Dionex ARRS unit. Aliquots (1%) of each 0.3-ml fraction were applied to a silica gel-60 TLC plate and stained with orcinol. Carbohydrate-positive fractions were identified eluting between 30.5 and 36.0 min. Aliquots of these fractions (3 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of acetonitrile containing 2% formic acid and analyzed by positive ion nanospray ES-MS to detect [M+2H]2+,[M+H+Na]2+, and [M+2Na]2+ ions of N-glycans. Fractions were pooled according to the ES-MS data. Fraction pools A-E contained predominantly the following structures: Hex8HexNAc2 (A), Hex6HexNAc2 (B), Hex6HexNAc3 (C), Hex7HexNAc3 (D), and Hex9HexNAc2 (E). Each fraction was analyzed by GC-MS monosaccharide composition analysis (30Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 349-383Google Scholar) to estimate yield. 1HNMR—One-dimensional 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of fractions B and C were obtained using the zgpr pulse program on a Bruker AM500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe. Samples were repeatedly exchanged into 2H2O, dissolved in 350 μl of 2H2O, and transferred to a Shigemi tube. Experiments were performed at 300 K, with a sweep width of 10 ppm; 256 scans were recorded after 8 dummy scans. Two-dimensional experiments were performed under the same conditions. COSY and ROESY experiments were performed with Watergate suppression, and TOCSY spectroscopy used a phase-sensitive mlev program. Permethylation and ES-MS/MS of N-Glycans—Samples recovered from NMR were exchanged back into H2O by passage through a short column (20 × 1 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 (Bio-Rad), equilibrated, and eluted with water. Samples were dried and permethylated by the sodium hydroxide method, as described in Ferguson (30Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 349-383Google Scholar). The permethylated glycans were dissolved in 100 μl of 80% acetonitrile, and aliquots (2 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of 80% acetonitrile, 1 mm sodium acetate before loading into nanotips (Micromass type F) for positive ion ES-MS and ES-MS/MS on a QTof2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Tip and cone voltages were 1 kV and 40 V, respectively, and the collision energy was 45–70 V. Methylation Linkage Analysis by GC-MS—The remainder of the permethylated glycan samples were subjected to acid hydrolysis, NaB2H4 reduction, and acetylation (to yield partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs)), and analyzed by GC-MS as described in Ferguson (30Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 349-383Google Scholar). The PMAAs were analyzed on an Agilent HP-5 column and on a Supelco SP2380 column (the latter to allow resolution of the non-reducing terminal-Man and non-reducing terminal-Glc PMAAs). Tritium Labeling and HPTLC Analysis of Glycans—Samples of pools B, C, and D (2 nmol each) were dried and reduced with 5 μl of 5.5 mm NaB3H4 in 16.6 mm NaOH (16 h, 22 °C). Excess reductant was added (5 μl of 0.5 m NaB3H4), and the incubation was continued for 3 h. The samples were acidified with 10 μl of 1 m acetic acid in a fume hood, passed through 0.2-ml Dowex AG50 (H+), and dried. Boric acid was removed by co-evaporation with 2 × 250 μl of 5% acetic acid in methanol and 2 × 250 μl of methanol. The labeled glycans were dissolved in water and applied to 3-cm-wide strips of Whatman No. 3MM paper for downward paper chromatography in butan-1-ol, ethanol, water (4:1: 0.8). Labeled glycans were recovered from the origin by elution with water and desalted by passage through a column of 100 μl each of Chelex 100 (Na+) over Dowex"
https://openalex.org/W2003241791,"DExD/H proteins, typically described as RNA helicases, participate in rearrangement of RNA-RNA and possibly RNA-protein complexes in the cell. Aside from the conserved DExD/H core, members of this protein family often contain N- and C-terminal extensions that are responsible for additional functions. The Bacillus subtilis DExD/H-box protein YxiN and its Escherichia coli ortholog DbpA contain an ∼80 amino acid C-terminal extension that has been proposed to specifically interact with a region of 23 S ribosomal RNA including hairpin 92. In this study, the DExD/H-box core and the C-terminal domain of YxiN were expressed and characterized as separate proteins. The isolated DExD/H-box core, YxCat, had weak, nonspecific RNA binding activity and showed RNA-stimulated ATPase activity with a Km(ATP) that resembled several non-specific DExD/H proteins. The isolated C-terminal domain, YxRBD, bound RNA with the high affinity and specificity seen with full-length YxiN. Thus, YxiN is a modular protein combining the activities of the YxCat and YxRBD domains. Footprinting of YxiN and YxRBD on a 172-nucleotide fragment of 23 S rRNA was used to identify the sites of interaction of the C-terminal and helicase domains with the RNA.

Members of the DExD/H helicase family participate in many cellular processes involving rearrangement of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (1Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 2Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). DExD/H proteins contain a conserved catalytic core consisting of two RecA-like domains that bind ATP and single-stranded RNA (3Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Similar to other RecA-like ATPases (4Ye J. Osborne A.R. Groll M. Rapoport T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release is coupled to a conformational change in the core. In DExD/H proteins, this results in translocation of the protein along single-stranded RNA and subsequent duplex destabilization and/or ribonucleoprotein disruption (5Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12236-12244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Fairman M.E. Maroney P.A. Wang W. Bowers H.A. Gollnick P. Nilsen T.W. Jankowsky E. Science. 2004; 304: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Outside of the catalytic core, DExD/H proteins often contain ancillary N- and C-terminal extensions that correlate with their specific cellular functions. In many cases, helicases are part of multiprotein complexes, and the putative role of the ancillary domains is to recruit the helicase to the complex by protein-protein interactions (7Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene. 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ancillary domains can directly bind to a specific RNA substrate, delivering the helicase to its site of action. Bacillus subtilis DExD/H protein YxiN and Escherichia coli DbpA define a group of bacterial orthologs with a conserved C-terminal domain of ∼80 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Both YxiN and DbpA specifically recognize the A-site region of 23 S rRNA, including hairpin 92, suggesting that the RNA specificity is conferred by the C-terminal domain (8Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11681-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Tsu C.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16989-16996Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3028-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In a domain swap experiment, the C-terminal domain of YxiN was appended to the catalytic core of SrmB, a non-sequence-specific RNA helicase from E. coli (12Kossen K. Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The resulting chimera possessed the RNA specificity of YxiN but had catalytic properties similar to those of the parental helicase, SrmB. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of YxiN is capable of imparting specificity in the context of another DExD/H box protein, suggesting that the sequence-specific RNA binding and helicase activities are separable and that this group of DExD/H proteins may be functionally modular. To prove this hypothesis, the helicase and C-terminal domains of YxiN were prepared here as separate polypeptides. This approach permits the intrinsic activities of the catalytic core and the C-terminal domain to be assayed independently and compared with the full-length protein. Plasmids for Expression of Recombinant YxiN Fragments—Coding sequences for YxiN protein fragments were PCR-amplified from the native B. subtilis sequence in an existing plasmid (11Kossen K.

Primers were designed such that the subcloned fragments deleted the first of the tandem inteins of the parent vector and placed the C-terminal residue of each encoded YxiN protein fragment flush with the N-terminal residue of the second intein. In this manner, no extraneous residues remained at the C terminus of the target after self-cleavage of the target-intein fusion. The plasmids used for these studies encoded the DExD/H core fragment, termed YxCat (residues 1-368) and the C-terminal domain fragment, termed YxRBD (residues 404-479, which starts at Met-404 of YxiN). Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length YxiN from a previous study was used (11Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). YxiN fragments were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) either by growing in LB to A600 of ∼0.6 and inducing with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside or by growing in a self-inducing medium (13Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9, at 20 °C (Buffer A) and lysed by sonication. Protein purification was carried out at 4 °C. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the clarified supernatant was brought to 0.1% (w/v) in polyethyleneimine by dropwise addition from a 10% (w/v) stock solution, pH 7.2, over a period of 10 min. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a chitin column and washed with several column volumes of Buffer A. Then, the column was loaded with 50 mm dithiothreitol in Buffer A, and flow was stopped overnight to allow on-column self-cleavage of the target-intein fusion. The next day, protein was eluted from the column in 2 column volumes of wash, concentrated to a volume of a few milliliters, and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) for fragment 1-368; Superdex-75 for fragment 404-479) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.9, at 20 °C (Buffer B). Protein from the peaks corresponding to the YxiN fragments were concentrated to >5 mg/ml and stored at -70 °C in Buffer B. RNA Substrates—RNAs HP+15M and HP+15 through HP+2 were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc.

Gel Mobility Shift Binding Assay—The binding assay was based on the previously described method (14Polach K.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A low concentration (0.4 nm) of 5′-32P-labeled RNA was mixed in 16-μl reactions with a series of protein concentrations in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm poly(A), 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Poly(A) was omitted from the YxCat binding experiments. Reactions were incubated for 10 min to reach equilibrium, and 10-μl aliquots were loaded onto 5% native acrylamide gels (29:1 ratio of acrylamide to bis-acrylamide) in 0.33× TBE (1× TBE is 90 mm Tris borate, 1mm EDTA, pH ∼8.3). Gels were run in 0.33× TBE at 200 V, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. The fraction of unbound material was quantitated as the ratio of counts in the free RNA band to the combined counts of the free RNA and the shifted species above. The fraction of bound material (1 - unbound fraction) was fit to a noncooperative binding curve to derive the dissociation constant. Reported ΔG and Kd values resulted from averages of three experiments. Typical standard deviations of ΔG values were below 0.7 kcal/mol (∼3-fold in Kd), and individual standard deviations are depicted as error bars in Fig. 3. Footprinting Assay—172-nt RNA substrate footprinting using RNases T1, T2, and kethoxal was carried out as described previously (10Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3028-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Where noted, 1 μm His-DbpA, 1 μm YxiN, 1 μm YxRBD, and 5 mm AMPPNP·Mg were used. ATPase Assay—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured using the previously described coupled spectroscopic assay (9Tsu C.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16989-16996Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at room temperature with the addition of 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The individual cuvette method was modified to a high-throughput plate format using the SpectraMax Plus 384 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). In a single experiment, duplicate 50-μl reactions were placed in flat-bottom polystyrene 384-well plates, and absorbance was monitored at 338 nm for 15 min. Individual well path lengths experimentally determined by the instrument (PathCheck) were used to normalize the absorbances to a path length of 1 cm. Data from at least two independent experimental measurements were used in fitting. Typical standard deviations of the reported ATP hydrolysis rates at or above half-maximal ATPase stimulation were below 10%, and individual standard deviations are depicted as error bars in Fig. 6. RNA titration experiments used 200 nm YxiN and 1 μm YxCat. In the Km(ATP) determination, 50 μm poly(A) and 200 nm YxiN and YxCat were used. The fully general kinetic equation was used when the concentration of enzyme was near the Kapp(RNA) (11Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Binding of RNA by YxiN, YxRBD, and YxCat—The RNA binding properties of B. subtilis YxiN are similar to those of its E. coli ortholog DbpA. Previous experiments demonstrated a specific interaction of YxiN with RNAs containing hairpin 92 of 23 S rRNA, such as HP+15 (Fig. 1B), by an RNA-stimulated ATPase assay, whereas mutation of two bases in the stem loop of the RNA (RNA HP+15M) eliminated the stimulation (12Kossen K. Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To directly examine the binding and specificity of YxiN, a gel-shift assay was used. Trace concentrations of 5′-32P-labeled RNA HP+15 were mixed with varying concentrations of YxiN and analyzed on a native gel. A distinct, slower migrating band was observed (Fig. 2A) consistent with complex formation between RNA HP+15 and YxiN. The smear below the complex is considered to represent specific complex that falls apart during the electrophoresis and is counted as the bound fraction in quantitation. The plot of fraction bound versus protein concentration fits a sigmoid binding curve with a Kd of 4.6 nm (Fig. 4). The curve has a Hill coefficient of ∼1, indicating noncooperative binding of HP+15 with YxiN. In a similar experiment using the nonspecific RNA HP+15M (Fig. 2B), no complex band was observed even at 5 μm YxiN, a 10-fold higher concentration than the highest used with RNA HP+15. Thus, base mutations in the loop of RNA HP+15 disrupt its interaction with YxiN, indicating that the binding is sequence-specific. DbpA has shown an analogously specific interaction with RNA HP+15 by stimulation of ATPase activity (15Tsu C.A. Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA. 2001; 7: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and a similar Kd in electrophoretic mobility shifts (9.2 nm) (14Polach K.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Binding titration of RNA HP+15 (triangles), RNA HP+3 (diamonds), and RNA HP+2 (circles) with YxiN (black) and YxRBD (gray). Curves indicate best fits to a noncooperative binding model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction between YxiN and its specific RNAs has been proposed to involve sequence specific binding of the C-terminal domain and sequence nonspecific binding of the catalytic core (12Kossen K. Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test this proposal directly, the two portions of the gene were cloned separately as fusions with an intein and a chitin-binding domain (pTWIN1, New England Biolabs). YxCat, the fragment of YxiN containing the catalytic core, extends from residues 1-368, including 35 amino acids after the last highly conserved motif ((H/Q)RXGRXGR) (Fig. 1A). This site was chosen because it aligns close to the end of the minimal DExD/H protein eIF4A. YxRBD, the C-terminal fragment of YxiN, encompasses a region of conserved sequence between residues 404-479. YxRBD is rich in basic amino acids and has a calculated pI of 10.0. Amino acids 369-403 of YxiN that lie between YxCat and YxRBD were not included because this region varies in length among DbpA orthologs (7-35 amino acids) and may represent a flexible linker. Expression of these fragments yielded large amounts of soluble proteins that were purified and cleaved on a chitin column and further purified by gel filtration. 15N, 1H-HSQC NMR spectra of 15N-labeled YxRBD revealed a dispersion of amide proton peaks that is consistent with a folded polypeptide. In addition, crystals of the fragment have been obtained, indicating that it constitutes a well folded domain (data not shown). The individually expressed fragments of YxiN both show RNA binding activity. The addition of the C-terminal fragment, YxRBD, to RNA HP+15 shows a shifted band corresponding to the RNA-protein complex (Fig. 2C). As would be expected for its smaller size, the mobility shift by this protein fragment is less than that of full-length YxiN. The affinity of YxRBD to RNA HP+15 (5.2 nm) is similar to that of YxiN (4.6 nm) (Fig. 4). Furthermore, interaction of YxRBD with RNA HP+15M is not observed, paralleling the sequence specificity of full-length YxiN (Fig. 2D). The catalytic core fragment, YxCat, interacts with RNA HP+15 to produce a faint complex band of intermediate mobility at micromolar protein concentrations (Fig. 2E). The binding is not saturated even at the highest concentrations of YxCat tested, indicating a very weak interaction (Kd > 4 μm). YxCat binds RNA HP+15M just as well as it does RNA HP+15 (Fig. 2F), demonstrating that the catalytic core fragment does not have RNA sequence specificity. Thus, YxRBD interacts with RNA tightly and sequence specifically, whereas YxCat binding to RNA is weak and is not sequence-specific. It was of interest to determine the minimal length of the 5′ single-stranded extension in RNA HP+15 that is needed to bind YxiN and YxRBD. To this end, a set of RNAs with single nucleotide truncations from the 5′ end of RNA HP+15 (Fig. 1B) were each used in gel-shift binding experiments with YxiN and YxRBD. The resulting free energies of binding are shown in Fig. 3. Surprisingly, neither YxiN nor YxRBD showed a sharp binding “boundary” where the affinity drops dramatically within one or two nucleotides. Instead, the energies of binding to both proteins decreased gradually with decreasing 5′ extension length. For RNAs with more than seven nucleotides of 5′ single-stranded sequence, binding affinity to YxRBD is the same as to YxiN. However, shorter RNAs show differences in their binding behavior to YxRBD and YxiN (Fig. 3). For the shortest RNAs, HP+2 and HP+3 (Fig. 1B), binding to full-length YxiN can still be observed, whereas neither RNA shows detectable binding to YxRBD (Fig. 4). The disparity in binding properties of the two proteins suggests that the catalytic domains of YxiN, which are absent in YxRBD, may contribute to the binding of shorter RNAs. However, the addition of more single-stranded residues to the short RNAs increases their binding affinity to both YxRBD and YxiN (Fig. 3). Because the longer RNAs bind more tightly than short RNAs to YxRBD (which lacks the catalytic domains), in this case the additional binding energy likely arises from nonspecific electrostatic interactions of the single-stranded region with the basic C-terminal domain. Thus, because nonspecific interactions of the RNA can occur both with the C-terminal and the catalytic domains, the resulting affinities of YxRBD and YxiN for longer RNAs become similar to each other. Footprinting of YxiN and YxRBD on RNA—DbpA and YxiN have been shown to interact with a larger region of 23 S rRNA than RNA HP+15. Although the hairpin of RNA HP+15 (hairpin 92 in 23 S rRNA) is a major affinity and specificity determinant, DbpA and YxiN show increased binding affinity and ATPase stimulation with larger RNAs that also contain helices 89, 90, and 93 in addition to 92 (14Polach K.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3693-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Tsu C.A. Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. RNA. 2001; 7: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DbpA has an extensive footprint on a 172-nt RNA that includes this region (Fig. 5), indicating the presence of additional contacts of DbpA with RNA elements other than hairpin 92 (10Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3028-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The YxRBD fragment is useful in assigning the domains of YxiN to specific interactions with such larger RNAs because it can identify the site of binding of the C-terminal domain devoid of the catalytic core. To this end, the footprint of YxRBD on the 172-mer was obtained using RNases T1, T2, and kethoxal and was compared with analogous footprints of YxiN in the presence of AMPPNP. In addition, the footprint of DbpA with AMPPNP on the same RNA was used as a control. The results of the footprinting experiments are shown on the secondary structure of the 172-mer in Fig. 5. All three proteins showed protections from kethoxal at G2553 in hairpin 92, and from RNase T2 at U2652/A2564 in the bulge between helices 92 and 90. Protection at G2553 was also confirmed by RNase T1 (data not shown). However, only the full-length DbpA and YxiN protected the G2502/G2505 residues between helices 89 and 90, and the G2588/G2603 residues in helix 93 from RNase T1 and kethoxal (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Footprinting in the bulge of helix 90 (G2574), reported previously for DbpA (10Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3028-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), could not be assigned unambiguously for either YxiN or YxRBD. Overall, full-length YxiN protected essentially the same set of residues as DbpA, whereas the C-terminal fragment only interacted with hairpin 92 and the single-stranded region connecting it to helix 90. This suggests that the helicase domains of the full-length protein were required for interaction with residues 5′ and 3′ of helix 90. ATPase Activity of YxiN and YxCat—The ATPase activity properties of YxiN and its fragments were compared using a coupled ATP hydrolysis assay (Fig. 6 and TABLE ONE). The background ATP hydrolysis rate of YxiN in the absence of RNA was determined to be 0.39 min-1 (data not shown). Upon addition of the specific RNA HP+15 and the nonspecific RNA HP+15M and poly(A), YxiN shows a stimulation of ATPase activity with the expected selectivity (Fig. 6A). RNA HP+15 elicits full activation of 55 min-1 at the lowest RNA concentration in this experiment (200 nm). Using a lower range of RNA concentrations, the apparent activation constant of RNA HP+15 (Kapp) was determined to be 31 nm (TABLE ONE). In contrast, stimulation by RNA HP+15M occurs with a much higher Kapp of 3500 nm and saturates at a lower maximal activity (25 min-1). Poly(A) also activates YxiN weakly, increasing activity linearly up to a concentration of 10 μm without reaching saturation (the concentration of poly(A) is expressed in 32-nt units). To gauge the effectiveness of such nonsaturating substrates, the apparent second order rate constant (kmax/Kapp(RNA)) was derived from the initial slope of ATPase activity versus RNA concentration (TABLE ONE). Under these conditions, YxiN exhibits a 250-fold specificity for RNA HP+15 over RNA HP+15M and a 1000-fold specificity over poly(A). Previous experiments with YxiN at the more stringent salt concentration of 150 mm showed a specificity of 170,000 for RNA HP+15 over RNA HP+15M (12Kossen K. Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).TABLE ONERNA-dependent ATPase activity constants of YxiN and YxCatProtein/RNAkmaxKappkmax/KappSpecificityaSpecificity is defined as the ratio of second order rate constants: kmax/Kapp(RNA)/kmax/Kapp(RNA HP + 15)min–1nmmin–1 nm–1YxiN RNA HP + 1555311.81 RNA HP + 15 m2535007.1 × 10–30.004 Poly(A)1.7 × 10–30.001YxCat RNA HP + 155.4 × 10–51 RNA HP + 15 m6.9 × 10–51.3 Poly(A)6.9 × 10–51.3a Specificity is defined as the ratio of second order rate constants: kmax/Kapp(RNA)/kmax/Kapp(RNA HP + 15) Open table in a new tab The isolated catalytic core maintains the capacity for RNA-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 6B). Similar to full-length YxiN, the RNA-independent ATP hydrolysis rate of YxCat was found to be 0.40 min-1 (data not shown). Upon addition to 1 μm YxCat, RNAs HP+15, HP+15M, and poly(A) stimulate the ATPase activity linearly with RNA concentration and show similar second order rate constants between 5.4 × 10-5 and 6.9 × 10-5 min-1 nm-1 (Fig. 6B and TABLE ONE). The lack of saturation up to 10 μm RNA concentrations may reflect the more acidic pI of YxCat (5.8 compared with 7.7 for YxiN), making it less likely to interact with RNA at the assay pH of 7.5. In fact, titrations with poly(A) remain linear up to 50 μm (in 32-nt units), eliciting rates up to 3.5 min-1 (data not shown). Because saturation of ATPase activity was not attained, the kmax of YxCat can only be estimated to be between 3.5 min-1 and the full-length YxiN value of 55 min-1. Assuming this range of kmax, the calculated apparent RNA binding affinities (Kapp) for RNAs in TABLE ONE are in the range of 65 to 1000 μm. Thus, YxCat has very weak apparent RNA binding affinity and no intrinsic specificity among the tested RNAs. Finally, because the C-terminal fragment does not contain any ATPase motifs, it does not hydrolyze ATP on its own, as expected (data not shown). Two experiments suggest that the ATPase activity of YxCat is functionally independent from the C-terminal fragment. First, the apparent affinity of YxCat for ATP was compared with that of YxiN. The ATPase activity of both proteins was assayed at varying concentrations of ATP·Mg with 50 μm poly(A) (in 32-nt units) (Fig. 6, C and D). The resulting Km values of 210 μm for YxiN and 350 μm for YxCat are similar to each other and close to the value of 230 μm measured with saturating amounts of the specific 23 S + 16 S rRNA substrates (11Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, YxCat does not require the C-terminal fragment for proper formation of the ATP site and for ATP binding. Second, when 1 μm YxRBD was added to the YxCat ATPase assay with either RNA HP+15 or HP+15M, no additional stimulation or preference for RNA HP+15 was observed (data not shown). This indicates that YxRBD is incapable of selectively presenting the specific RNA to YxCat in trans, suggesting a lack of interaction between the catalytic core and the C-terminal domain. The present study demonstrates that the C-terminal region of YxiN is a domain that can independently bind RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Expressed as a 76-amino acid fragment, YxRBD folds well and specifically binds RNAs containing hairpin 92 of 23 S rRNA with low nano-molar affinity (Fig. 2C and D). This domain is similar in size to the currently known RNA-binding domains of the RRM (RNA recognition motif), dsRBD (double-stranded RBD), and OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding)-fold families, as well as to the small, single-domain ribosomal proteins. Although assignment to the OB-fold family cannot be made based on sequence (16Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), alignments of YxiN, DbpA and other bacterial homologs (Fig. 1A) indicate that the C-terminal domain defines a distinct subfamily of RNA-binding domains. However, in a Pfam search, a few members of the subfamily show very weak similarity with the eukaryotic RRM family (expectation values, >0.05) in a 20-amino acid region starting at RNP-1 (17Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A closer examination of a possible alignment indicates that half of the six most conserved positions of the RRM (Leu-16, Val-38, and Ala-49, numbering by Birney et al. (18Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar)) have analogous positions in the DbpA C-terminal domain, whereas the other half does not (Leu-7, Phe-20, and Phe-40) (18Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise classification of this sequence specific RNA-binding domain awaits further studies. Aside from orthologs of DbpA, there is a highly similar, but distinct, C-terminal domain present in E. coli DeaD/CsdA, a DExD/H protein involved in the ribosomal biogenesis of the 50 S subunit (19Charollais J. Dreyfus M. Iost I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In CsdA and its orthologs, the domain is located significantly further away from the helicase core and is flanked on both sides by arginine- and glycine-rich sequences that are known to accompany other RNA-binding domains (20Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain in CsdA homologs differs from the YxiN/DbpA RBD in several conserved sequence positions (the two groups are defined together in Pfam entry PF03880). Interestingly, CsdA does not exhibit any detectable in vitro specificity for hairpin 92, and its ATPase activity is stimulated by several RNAs (21Bizebard T. Ferlenghi I. Iost I. Dreyfus M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7857-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 3K. Kossen and O. Uhlenbeck, unpublished results. These results suggest that CsdA either lacks RNA specificity or recognizes a relatively common RNA motif. Characterization of the YxCat fragment indicates that it possesses the essential catalytic properties shared by all DExD/H proteins. The Km for ATP is 350 μm for YxCat and 210 μm for YxiN, which are similar to the values of 330 μm reported for eIF4A (22Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), 260 μm for Prp16 (23Wang Y. Wagner J.D. Guthrie C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), 180 μm for SrmB (12Kossen K. Karginov F.V. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and 300 μm for Ded1p (24Iost I. Dreyfus M. Linder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The similarity in the ATP binding properties of YxCat with the intact protein, as well as with the other DExD/H proteins, suggests that the ATP pocket is properly formed within the isolated catalytic core. YxCat binds RNA very weakly, with a Kd greater than 4 μm and a Kapp(RNA) greater than 65 μm. Similarly, the minimal DExD/H-box protein eIF4A binds poly(A) with a Kapp(RNA) of 115 μm (in 20-mer units) (22Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, ancillary domains present in other DExD/H proteins may aid in the interaction with RNA, increasing the affinity. For example, the yeast DExD/H protein Ded1p binds RNA with a Kd of 20 nm (24Iost I. Dreyfus M. Linder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the hepatitis C virus, NS3, has a 2 μm Kapp(RNA) (25Paolini C. De Francesco R. Gallinari P. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, tight intrinsic RNA affinity of the helicase cores does not appear to be required generally, presumably because of their function in larger polypeptide chains or complexes. As in most DExD/H proteins, RNA binding to YxCat stimulates ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6B) with rates comparable with those of eIF4A (3 min-1). Furthermore, both RNA binding and stimulation of ATPase activity of YxCat are not sequence specific. Likewise, most of the DExD/H proteins studied in vitro lack sequence specificity, suggesting that this is a general property of DExD/H cores. Consistent with this notion, DExD/H helicases have been proposed to interact primarily with the oligonucleotide backbone (26Kawaoka J. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The individual domains of YxiN appear to function in a modular fashion. The C-terminal domain provides the bulk of the binding energy as well as sequence specificity, whereas the helicase core performs the catalytic functions. The two domains do not require each other for activity, and there appears to be no interaction between them, because the addition of YxRBD to YxCat in trans does not increase the ATPase activity or impart specificity. Thus, the C-terminal domain simply brings the catalytic core to its cellular target. Such a modular design strategy may be common for DExD/H proteins with ancillary domains. For example, modularity in the yeast splicing DExD/H protein Prp16 was established by testing domain deletion mutants of Prp16 for viability in vivo and interactions with the spliceosome in vitro (27Wang Y. Guthrie C. RNA. 1998; 4: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The N-terminal ancillary domain was found to interact with the spliceosome and act as a dominant negative inhibitor of splicing in vitro. Thus, the N-terminal domain functions to bring the protein to the spliceosome. However, in contrast with YxiN, the N-terminal domain of Prp16 in trans with the other domains of Prp16 can rescue a strain devoid of Prp16, indicating that the N-terminal domain interacts with the rest of the protein. The modular nature of YxiN sheds light on how it interacts with its larger, more biologically relevant 172-mer substrate, as well as potential modes of action on the cellular substrate of YxiN. The footprinting pattern of YxRBD indicates that this domain interacts sequence-specifically with hairpin 92 and the single-stranded sequence connecting it to helix 90, tethering the catalytic core to this location (Fig. 5). The absence of RNA specificity of YxCat indicates that the full-length enzyme has the ability to act on any suitable substrate in the vicinity of its molecular localization. Accordingly, within the 172-mer RNA, the catalytic core interacts with regions encompassing positions 2502 and 2505 5′ of helix 90, as well as 2588 and 2603 3′ of helix 90. The flexibility of the catalytic core relative to the tethering point of the C-terminal domain, reflected in the ability of DbpA to unwind duplexes in several locations around helix 92 (28Diges C.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5503-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggests that YxiN and DbpA may interact with the regions 5′ and 3′ of helix 90 in two distinct binding populations. The function of YxiN and DbpA may be to unwind an RNA duplex or rearrange a ribonucleoprotein structure at one or both of these locations during the ribosomal lifecycle. Recently, DbpA has been shown to unwind duplexes in a 3′-to-5′ direction, regardless of the orientation of the duplex relative to hairpin 92, and to require a 3′ single-stranded loading site, presumably for the binding of the catalytic core (29Diges C.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7903-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A similar requirement of a 3′ single-stranded RNA loading site may exist for its natural targets. In the context of the entire cellular substrate of YxiN, the 50 S ribosomal subunit or its assembly precursor, the catalytic domains of YxiN may act at the same site(s) as in the 172-mer or rearrange a different target or targets near hairpin 92. Rearrangement of several interactions near hairpin 92, an area crucial to ribosome function, may be required for proper RNA folding and establishment of correct interactions with ribosomal proteins."

In the present study, we examined the novel PKC isoform protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) and its role in vascular SMC apoptosis. In A10 SMCs, overexpression of PKCδ was sufficient to induce apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PKCδ diminished H2O2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, evidence is provided that the tumor suppressor p53 is an essential mediator of PKCδ-induced apoptosis in SMCs. Activation of PKCδ led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking p53 induction with small interference RNA or targeted gene deletion prevented PKCδ-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression rescued the ability of PKCδ to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs. We also establish that PKCδ regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Specifically, the transcriptional regulation required p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for serine 46, did not involve MAPK. Additionally, PKCδ, p38 MAPK, and p53 co-associate in cells under conditions favoring apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that SMC apoptosis proceeds through a pathway that involves PKCδ, the intermediary p38 MAPK, and the downstream target tumor suppressor p53.

Apoptosis is a multistage, genetically controlled process of selective cell deletion. Protein kinases regulate the early stages of apoptosis by phosphorylating key proteins (12Franklin R.A.

The critical role of PKCδ in vascular SMC apoptosis and pathogenesis of a neointimal lesion has been recently demonstrated using PKCδ “knock-out” mice. The PKCδ null mice developed exacerbated vein graft intimal lesions that contain fewer apoptotic vascular cells compared with the wild-type mice (21Leitges M. Mayr M. Braun U. Mayr U. Li C. Pfister G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Baier G. Hu Y. Xu Q. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aortic SMCs isolated from PKCδ null mice are resistant to apoptotic stimuli including H2O2. However, the mechanism by which PKCδ mediates SMC apoptosis remains to be defined. The tumor suppressor p53 is the master regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In particular, an important role of p53 in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases is suggested by decreased p53 levels in human restenotic (22Yonemitsu Y. Kaneda Y. Tanaka S. Nakashima Y. Komori K. Sugimachi K. Sueishi K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and atherosclerotic lesions (23George S.J. Angelini G.D. Capogrossi M.C. Baker A.H. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The importance of p53 is also confirmed in various animal models. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 to rat carotid arteries inhibited neointimal formation following balloon injury (24Scheinman M. Ascher E. Levi G.S. Hingorani A. Shirazian D. Seth P. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; 29: 360-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas target deletion of p53 led to larger intimal lesions in a mouse vein graft model (25Mayr U. Mayr M.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 has been shown to be activated by cellular stress, UV light radiation, growth factor withdrawal, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (26Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 27Wada T. Penninger J.M.

Upon activation, p38 phosphorylates various transcription factors but, of particular note, has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor p53 (30Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK is also implicated in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (12Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) However, its activity is likely cell type-specific, with most studies focusing predominantly on inflammatory cells (32Kumar S. Boehm J. Lee J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In this report we scrutinized the precise molecular mechanism of PKCδ-induced vascular SMC apoptosis and provide evidence that PKCδ activation leads to accumulation/modification of p53, which is essential for the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the role of p38 as an intermediate in PKCδ-induced p53 accumulation and apoptosis has also been demonstrated. In total, these studies provide an explicit link between PKCδ, p38 activation, and p53 modulation in the process of SMC apoptosis. These findings have implications for the development of improved approaches for the prevention and management of restenosis. General Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania), and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), rottlerin, SB20358, and H2O2, along with other chemicals not specified, were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to cleaved casapase-3 and phospho-p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, Massachusetts). Biotinylated p53 antibody and antibody to phosphorylated p53 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minnesota). SMC Culture—Rat aortic A10 SMCs, obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection, were grown as recommended. Mouse aortic SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta of p53-/- male mice (33Miyamoto A. Nakayama K. Imaki H. Hirose S. Jiang Y. Abe M. Tsukiyama T. Nagahama H. Ohno S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I.

Construction of Adenoviral Vectors and Infection—A recombinant adenoviral vector was constructed to express PKCδ. Briefly, a DNA fragment containing the desired sequence was generated by PCR using the human cDNA as a template. Following DNA sequencing, the PCR product was then cloned into an E1- and E3-deficient adenoviral vector (pEasy). Adenoviruses were propagated in HEK 293 cells and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. A recombinant adenovirus encoding for the wild-type p53 protein was a generous gift from Enrico Ascher (24Scheinman M. Ascher E. Levi G.S. Hingorani A. Shirazian D. Seth P. J. Vasc.

Apoptosis Assay—DNA fragmentation was determined using the Cell Death Detection ELISA system (Roche Applied Science), an assay based on a quantitative sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones. Activation of caspase 3 was quantified by Western blotting using an antibody specific for cleaved caspase-3. Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis as described previously (36Sakakibara K. Kubota K. Worku B. Ryer E.J. Miller J.P. Koff A. Kent K.C. Liu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25470-25477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with antibodies. Labeled proteins are visualized with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—The P1-p53 promoter luciferase reporter was a generous gift from David Reisman (37Durland-Busbice S. Reisman D. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 2165-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transient transfections and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (38Kubota K. Okazaki J. Louie O. Kent K.C. Liu B. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 109: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA was introduced into A10 SMCs by using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After transfection, cells were recovered in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h, followed by PMA (1 μm) for 12 h. In all experiments, 50 ng of the renilla luciferase construct (pRL-CMV) was co-transfected as an internal control. Antisense Oligo—An antisense oligonucleotide specific to rat PKCδ and its scrambled control were obtained from Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). 200 μm oligo was introduced to the media of cultured A10 SMCs, seeded 18 h earlier at equal density. The efficacy of oligo uptake by SMCs was >90%, determined by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligo provided by the manufacturer. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—As per our laboratory's protocol (36Sakakibara K. Kubota K. Worku B. Ryer E.J. Miller J.P. Koff A. Kent K.C. Liu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25470-25477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), total RNA was isolated using RNA Aqueous (Ambion, Austin, Texas) and reverse-transcribed using a reverse transcriptase kit and probes from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif). Quantification of mRNA was performed using the ABI Prism7700 (Applied Biosystems). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously by our laboratory (39Hollenbeck S.T. Itoh H. Louie O. Faries P.L. Liu B. Kent K.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, SMCs were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Total protein concentration was determined by a modification of the method of Lowry, and the protein amount of each sample was then equalized. Following primary antibody incubation and centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and one time with 50 mm Tris. The final pellet was re-suspended in 30 μl of sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Statistical Analysis—Values were expressed as a fold increase (means ± S.E.). Unpaired Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical differences. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times. PKCδ Is Necessary for Smooth Muscle Cell Apoptosis—We began our studies by testing whether inhibition of PKCδ affects the ability of SMCs to undergo apoptosis. A10 SMCs were treated with the apoptotic stimulus H2O2 at a concentration of 200 μm for 6 h in the presence and absence of the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin. Similar to what has been reported previously in mouse vascular SMCs, A10 cells, a rat aortic SMC line, responded to H2O2 with a large increase in DNA fragmentation. Pre-treatment of A10 cells with rottlerin (1 μm for 1 h) diminished the induction of DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, we inhibited PKCδ expression by treating cells with an antisense oligonucleotide. Compared with the control oligo, PKCδ antisense oligo produced a significant reduction in the level of endogenous PKCδ (Fig. 1B). More importantly, the PKCδ antisense oligo-treated cells became resistant to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data confirmed that PKCδ is a necessary component of the apoptotic pathway in vascular SMCs. Overexpression of PKCδ Induces Apoptosis and Accumulation of the Tumor Suppressor p53—We next evaluated whether overexpression of PKCδ would be sufficient to induce vascular SMC apoptosis. To this end, we employed an adenovirus encoding full-length wild-type PKCδ (AdPKCδ), which led to a marked increase in cellular levels of PKCδ (Fig. 2B). Additionally, AdPKCδ induced a small but significant elevation in the level of fragmented DNA and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2, A and B). To facilitate the activation of the ectopically expressed PKCδ, we treated A10 SMCs with 1–5 μm of PMA for 12 h. At these concentrations, PMA alone did not induce apoptosis as indicated by the lack of fragmented DNA as well as the absence of activated caspase-3. However, the PKC activator PMA, in combination with overexpression of PKCδ, resulted in an increase in DNA fragmentation by >3-fold (Fig. 2A) and cleaved caspase-3 by >300% (Fig. 2B). These data establish that overexpression of PKCδ is sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis. Because p53 has been implicated in SMC apoptosis, we investigated whether the overexpression of PKCδ and its dramatic increase in SMC apoptosis were associated with an induction of p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, overexpression of PKCδ in A10 SMCs significantly increased p53 levels. In parallel to the induction of apoptosis, the ability of AdPKCδ to induce p53 expression was further enhanced by PMA (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested whether the PKCδ-induced p53 accumulation leads to enhanced p53-dependent gene transcription by using a luciferase reporter gene containing a p53-specific enhancer element (40el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 41Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of a PKCδ expression vector significantly increased p53 reporter activity. More importantly, the addition of the PKC activator PMA facilitated the effect of PKCδ on the p53 reporter, which is consistent with the ability of PKCδ to induce p53 expression and SMC apoptosis (Fig. 2C). p53 Is Necessary for PKCδ-induced Apoptosis—To confirm the significance of p53 in PKCδ-induced apoptosis, we designed a specific p53 small interference RNA (siRNA) to block p53 translation. 72 h following the administration of this p53 siRNA (50 nm), levels of p53 in A10 SMCs were decreased by 44 ± 2.2% (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined whether the p53 siRNA affects apoptosis. 48 h following infection with AdPKCδ or AdNull, A10 cells were incubated with p53 siRNA (50 nm for 72 h) prior to PMA treatment (1 μm for 12 h). Cell apoptosis was then assessed using ELISA for DNA fragmentation and Western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3. Inhibition of p53 with the specific siRNA led to a significant decrease in both PKCδ-induced cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 3A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that p53 is necessary for PKCδ-induced SMC apoptosis. To confirm these findings using siRNA, we isolated SMCs from the thoracic aorta of p53 null mice and tested their ability to undergo apoptosis following overexpression of PKCδ and activation with PMA. Interestingly, AdPKCδ failed to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs (Fig. 3C). Next, we attempted to rescue apoptosis by restoring p53 expression using an adenovirus encoding wild type p53 (35Scheinman M. Ascher E. Kallakuri S. Hingorani A. Gade P. Sherman M. Seth P. Jacob T. Surgery. 1999; 126: 863-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p53 alone did not induce apoptosis, which is consistent with reports in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (42Kokontis J.M. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Liao S. Hay N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the expression of p53 restored completely the ability of PKCδ to induce apoptosis (Fig. 3C). These results provide further confirmation of the requirement of p53 for PKCδ-induced apoptosis of vascular SMCs. PKCδ Increases p53 Transcription—We next explored the mechanism by which PKCδ regulates p53. We began by examining the effect of PKCδ overexpression on the level of p53 mRNA. A10 SMCs were infected with AdNull or AdPKCδ and then treated with the PKC activator PMA (1 μm for 6h). Total RNA was isolated from control or PKCδ/PMA-treated cells, and p53 was quantified using TaqMan real time reverse transcription PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpressed PKCδ elicited a significant increase in the level of p53 mRNA. To determine whether the increase in p53 mRNA is secondary to increased promoter activity, we employed a luciferase construct containing the proximal portion of the human p53 promoter (37Durland-Busbice S. Reisman D. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 2165-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We cotransfected A10 cells with a PKCδ expression or control vector and the luciferase reporter. This experiment demonstrated an increase in p53 promoter activity in response to PKCδ overexpression (Fig. 4B), indicating that PKCδ regulates p53 transcription by up-regulating promoter activity in vascular SMCs. Overexpression of PKCδ Results in the Phosphorylation of p53—Because phosphorylation is an important element of p53 regulation, we next investigated the possibility that PKCδ may affect p53 through phosphorylation. To assess PKCδ-induced p53 phosphorylation, we utilized a specific antibody to p53 phosphorylated on serine residue 46, shown by others to provide p53 with greater affinity to promoters of apoptosis-related genes (43Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). PKCδ substantially increased the level of phospho-p53 (at serine 46), which was barely detectable in cells infected with the empty viral vector (Fig. 5A). To further confirm the role of PKCδ-induced p53 phosphorylation in apoptosis, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of p53 in A10 cells treated with H2O2, a stimulus for both apoptosis and p53 phosphorylation (44Niwa K. Inanami O. Kuwabara M. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, Western blot analysis of A10 cell lysates demonstrated a significant increase in p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 following treatment with H2O2 (200 μm for 4 h). Importantly, pre-incubation with the PKCδ chemical inhibitor rottlerin (1 μm for 1 h) dramatically diminished the ability of H2O2 to induce p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that PKCδ is responsible, directly or indirectly, for p53 phosphorylation. Lastly, we searched for the mechanism that enables the interaction between PKCδ and p53 by examining the potential physical association between the two proteins. Lysates from A10 SMCs infected with AdPKCδ were immunoprecipitated for p53 followed by Western blotting for PKCδ. As a negative control, the same cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG. We found a prominent p53 band in the PKCδ immunoprecipitate. In the converse experiment, PKCδ was detected in the p53 immunocomplex (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that PKCδ is physically associated with p53 in conditions favoring apoptosis. p38 MAPK Is Necessary for PKCδ-induced Up-regulation of p53—Next, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the p53 induction by evaluating the stress-activated kinase p38 in response to PKCδ overexpression. Overexpression of PKCδ in A10 SMCs activated p38 as demonstrated by the marked increase in p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). To investigate a possible role of p38 in PKCδ-induced p53 expression, we inhibited p38 using the p38 chemical inhibitor SB20358 (20 μm for 1 h) in PKCδ-overexpressing cells. We found that p38 inhibition resulted in a large decrease in the ability of PKCδ to up-regulate p53 protein levels (Fig. 6B). Next, we tested the effect of SB20358 on p53 promoter activity. As shown above, p53 promoter activity was increased in response to PKCδ overexpression. However, inhibition of p38 by SB20358 diminished the ability of PKCδ to up-regulate p53 transcription (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that p38 is the intermediate responsible for the induction of p53 transcription in PKCδ-overexpressing SMCs. p38 MAPK Is Not Necessary for PKCδ-induced p53 Phosphorylation—Because investigations in non-vascular cell types have demonstrated that p38 MAPK is a potential p53 serine 46 kinase and that p53-mediated apoptosis is dependent on this event, we explored whether these findings apply to SMCs. Chemical inhibition of p38 failed to block PKCδ-induced p53 phosphorylation but did decrease total p53 protein levels as demonstrated above (Fig. 7A). Despite the lack of influence of p38 MAPK on serine 46 phosphorylation, we found that both proteins were co-associated with PKCδ by a co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 7B). p38 MAPK Is Necessary for PKCδ-induced SMC Apoptosis—After establishing a potential direct interaction between PKCδ and p38 and the necessity of p38 for PKCδ-induced up-regulation of p53, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK in SMC apoptosis using the p38 inhibitor SB20358. Interestingly, a treatment with this inhibitor (20 μm for 1 h) prior to PMA activation(1 μm for 12 h) decreased apoptosis by >50% as quantified by both cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 8A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 8B). Thus, p38 MAPK contributes in part to PKCδ-induced SMC apoptosis. PKCδ, a member of the novel PKC subfamily, can be pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic depending on cell types and stimuli. In agreement with a previous report (21Leitges M. Mayr M. Braun U. Mayr U. Li C. Pfister G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Baier G. Hu Y. Xu Q. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), our results support the notion that PKCδ is proapoptotic in vascular SMCs. Because molecular activation of PKCδ alone was sufficient to result in caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, we speculate that activation of PKCδ is an early event leading to the onset of programmed cell death in SMCs. The molecular mechanisms linking PKCδ to the induction of apoptosis have been explored to some extent in non-smooth muscle cells. Several studies suggest that the presence of a positive regulatory loop between PKCδ and caspase-3; however, exactly how PKCδ might stimulate caspase-3 remains unclear (45Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar, 46Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Another important target of PKCδ is the mitochondria. It was demonstrated in HeLa cells (47Basu A. Woolard M.D. Johnson C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and keratinocytes (48Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that overexpression and activation of PKCδ leads to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, which subsequently leads to activation of caspases and apoptosis. Additionally, several nuclear proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (49Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), p73β (50Ren J. Datta R. Shioya H. Li Y. Oki E. Biedermann V. Bharti A. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33758-33765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and lamin B (51Cross T. Griffiths G. Deacon E. Sallis R. Gough M. Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have been identified as PKCδ targets/substrates. Activated PKCδ associates with and phosphorylates these proteins; such interactions, at least in part, contribute to apoptosis. In the current study, we present evidence that the tumor suppressor p53 is a necessary mediator of PKCδ-induced apoptosis in vascular SMCs. We have shown that activation of PKCδ led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with SMC apoptosis. Moreover, blocking p53 induction with siRNA prevented apoptosis. Finally, targeted gene deletion of p53 prevented PKCδ-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression through adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer rescued the ability of PKCδ to induce apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the direct involvement of p53 in the regulation of SMC apoptosis by PKCδ. Experimental evidence is now provided that PKCδ regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, apparently mediated by separate signaling mechanisms. Specifically, the transcriptional regulation requires p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for Ser-46, does not require MAPK. The importance of post-translational regulation of p53 by PKCδ is demonstrated by our observation that ectopic expression of p53 alone was insufficient to induce apoptosis. Only when co-expressed with PKCδ was p53 able to restore apoptosis of p53 null cells, presumably through a PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation. It was surprising that the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB20358, significantly inhibited PKCδ-induced accumulation of p53 but did not affect p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46, because direct interaction between p53 and p38 MAPK (52She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) has been suggested previously. Indeed, we showed that all three proteins, p53, p38 and PKCδ, co-associated in the immunoprecipitation complex isolated from SMC lysates. Our attempts to evaluate other serine residues within the p53 molecule are currently not possible due to a lack of specific phospho-antibodies. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether PKCδ and p38 stimulate p53 phosphorylation at additional residues. With respect to Ser-46, our data suggest that it is p38-independent. The potential role of PKCδ in the regulation of p53 accumulation has been suggested previously. Using the selective PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, Niwa et al. (44Niwa K. Inanami O. Kuwabara M. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inhibition of PKCδ decreases H2O2-induced p53 accumulation in bovine endothelial cells. In NIH3T3 cells, Lee et al. (53Lee Y.-J. Soh J.-W. Dean N.M. Cho C.-K. Kim T.-H. Lee S.-J. Lee Y.-S. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar) observed an increase in the p53 level by overexpressing PKCδ, whereas Abbas et al. (54Abbas T. White D. Hui L. Yoshida K. Foster D.A. Bargonetti J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9970-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated a suppression of p53 basal expression by inhibiting PKCδ in ML-1 cells (acute myeloid leukemia cells). We have now demonstrated that in vascular SMCs the overexpression of PKCδ increased the accumulation of both the p53 protein and mRNA. In contrast, Johnson et al. (55Johnson C.L. Lu D. Huang J. Basu A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar) found that the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin increases p53 levels in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells, whereas the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate attenuates p53 levels in the same cell line. Therefore, it is likely that PKCδ, paralleling its dual functions in apoptosis, plays multiple roles in regulating p53 expression, which is dependent upon the cell type and stimuli employed. Our findings that PMA alone did not induce apoptosis in control or AdNull-infected SMCs is seemingly surprising, because these cells express endogenous PKCδ, and PMA activates PKCδ. The lack of cell death associated with PMA treatment may be related to the effect of PMA on other PKC isotypes. We have shown previously that SMCs express at least eight isotypes of PKC, among which six can be activated by PMA (56Itoh H. Yamamura S. Ware J.A. Zhuang S. Mii S. Liu B. Kent K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H359-H370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms, such as PKCδ, are pro-apoptotic, whereas others, such as PKCα, have been demonstrated to be anti-apoptotic in non-SMCs (57Leirdal M. Sioud M. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 58Jorgensen K. Skrede M. Cruciani V. Mikalsen S.-O. Slipicevic A. Florenes V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our data show that overexpressing PKCδ shifts the PMA response in favor of apoptosis. However, the outcome of simultaneously activating multiple PKC isotypes, as may occur in control SMCs treated with PMA, appears to result in no net effect on cell death. The present study highlights another interesting finding that PKCδ stimulates p53 gene expression through p38 MAPK. We showed that inhibition of p38 completely eliminated PKCδ-stimulated accumulation of p53 protein and mRNA. Moreover, analyses using a p53 promoter reporter demonstrated that PKCδ up-regulated p53 promoter activity, also in a p38-dependent manner. Several transcription factors have been identified to bind and regulate the murine p53 promoter, including NFκB (60Reisman D. Balint E. Loging W.T. Rotter V. Almon E. Genomics. 1996; 38: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Kim et al. (61Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed in articular chondrocytes that NO-induced activation of p38 up-regulates p53 expression through NFκB. Moreover, the NFκB pathway has been shown to be activated by PKCδ in several cell types (62Satoh A. Gukovskaya A.S. Nieto J.M. Cheng J.H. Gukovsky I. Reeve Jr., J.R. Shimosegawa T. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Future studies are mandatory to directly test the role of NFκBinPKCδ-induced p38-dependent transcriptional regulation of p53. In summary, our results demonstrate that PKCδ plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathway leading to vascular SMC apoptosis. The p38-dependent-accumulation and independent-phosphorylation of p53 by PKCδ contributes, at least in part, to SMC apoptosis. Given the critical role of apoptosis in intimal hyperplasia, it is possible that enhancement of PKCδ activity at different stages after vascular intervention may provide a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of restenosis.

CS and DS typically have backbones consisting of repeating disaccharide units of -GlcUA-GalNAc- and -IdoUA-GalNAc-, respectively, where IdoUA represents l-iduronic acid. Notably, hybrid chains, composed of both units in varying proportions, also exist (8Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These units are modified during chain elongation by specific sulfotransferases at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc in various combinations, thereby producing characteristic sulfation patterns and enormous structural diversity. These structural characteristics are strictly regulated, as revealed by the compositional analysis of CS/DS chains from various organs and by immunohistochemical staining using antibodies recognizing different CS/DS epitopes. chondroitin sulfate dermatan sulfate heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan proteoglycan l-iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate 4-O-sulfate 6-O-sulfate 4-deoxy-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid embryonic pig brain-derived CS/DS chains pleiotrophin fibroblast growth factor 2-aminobenzamide matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry chondroitinase high performance liquid chromatography GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4S) IdoUAα1-3GalNAc(4S) GlcUA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(4S) IdoUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(4S) GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(6S) IdoUAα1-3GalNAc(6S) GlcUA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(6S) IdoUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(6S) GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) IdoUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(6S) ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S) ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(6S) ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(4S) ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) flow-through subfraction of F5 bound subfraction of F5.

CS/DS chains are generally considered to play inhibitory roles in neurite extension and axonal growth, a contention supported by studies in vivo showing that removal of CS chains by chondroitinase ABC treatments permits axonal regeneration after nigrostriatal tract axotomy and spinal cord injury (11Moon L.D.F.

On the other hand, DSD-1-PG, the mouse homologue of rat phosphacan, which carries a functional domain (the so-called DSD-1 epitope) in the CS/DS side chains, promoted the outgrowth of neurites toward embryonic rat hippocampal neurons in culture (14Faissner A.

In that study, we used a monoclonal antibody, 2A12, which was raised against DS from ascidian. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the inhibitory and promoting activity of CS/DS chains is probably defined by specific carbohydrate sequences with characteristic sulfation patterns in a particular microenvironment. Structural studies have demonstrated that the disaccharide composition and the GlcUA/IdoUA ratio of the brain CS/DS chains change during development (21Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J.

These findings suggest that subpopulations of CS/DS chains play distinct roles during development. Most interestingly, CS/DS hybrid chains (E-CS/DS) isolated from embryonic pig brain were found to promote the outgrowth of neurites toward embryonic mouse hippocampal neurons in culture (22Bao X.

These chains show neuritogenic activity by interacting with endogenously expressed PTN and presenting it to the neuronal cell surface, thereby facilitating the neuritogenic function of this growth factor. Preliminary results (25Bao X.F. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), regarding the structure-function relationship, have suggested important roles for oversulfated disaccharides such as the D/iD unit (HexUA(2S)-IdoUA(6S)), the E/iE unit (HexUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)) and IdoUA-containing structures in the interaction of E-CS/DS with PTN, where HexUA, 2S, 4S and 6S represent hexuronic acid, and 2-O-, 4-O-, and 6-O-sulfate, respectively. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a series of PTN-bound and -unbound oligosaccharides from E-CS/DS with novel structures. The results demonstrated that PTN binds with distinct affinity to multiple sequences in E-CS/DS chains, and that both the size and composition of sugar chains are crucial for the interaction. In addition, we show the first direct evidence that CS/DS chains of the mammalian brain are characterized by a high degree of microheterogeneity and highly sulfated domains containing a cluster of oversulfated disaccharides. Materials—The E-CS/DS chains were purified from a phosphate-buffered saline homogenate of embryonic pig brains as described previously (22Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K.

Hyaluronidase SD from Streptococcus dysgalactiae, chondroitinases ABC (conventional and protease-free preparations), AC-I, AC-II, and B, and heparitinase were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant human PTN for interaction assays was obtained from RELIA Tech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). ΔHexuronate-2-O-sulfatase (abbreviated as Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase) was a gift from K. Yoshida, Seikagaku Corp. A PTN-bound affinity column was prepared by coupling 0.5 mg of recombinant human PTN, which was produced in yeast, to a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (1 ml) as reported previously (25Bao X.F. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prepacked PD-10 columns and a Superdex™ Peptide HR column (10 × 300 mm) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. An amine-bound silica PA-03 column (4.6 × 250 mm) was purchased from YMC Co. (Kyoto, Japan). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available. Inhibition Assays Using a BIAcore System—The inhibitory activity of sugar chains against the interaction of PTN with immobilized E-CS/DS chains was examined using a BIAcore system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Biotinylated E-CS/DS chains were immobilized onto the streptavidin-derivatized surface of a sensor chip as described (22Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of treatments with GAG-degrading enzymes on the inhibitory activity of E-CS/DS, equal amounts of E-CS/DS (1.35 μg) were individually incubated with chondroitinase ABC (5 international milliunits), AC-I (2 international milliunits), or B (2 international milliunits), hyaluronidase SD (2.5 international milliunits), or heparitinase (1 international milliunit), in an appropriate buffer at 37 °C for 1 h, and the resulting digest was then mixed with 200 ng of PTN in a volume of 130 μl and co-injected onto the surface of the sensor chip. The same amount of PTN and the intact E-CS/DS was run as a control. Response curves were recorded, and the maximal response of each reaction was used for calculation. Inhibitory activity was expressed as a percentage relative to the response obtained from an injection of PTN (200 ng) without sugar chains. In the case where oligosaccharides, generated from E-CS/DS, were used as inhibitors, certain amounts of oligosaccharides (8-80 pmol) were mixed with 50 ng of PTN and co-injected into the BIAcore system. The same amount of PTN only was run as a control. The inhibitory efficiency was calculated as a percentage relative to the response obtained from the control. Fragmentation of E-CS/DS—An exhaustive digestion with chondroitinase B was used to selectively dissect the E-CS/DS chains. The digestion of E-CS/DS (100 μg) was initiated with 50 international milliunits of chondroitinase B in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (26Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in a total volume of 30 μl at 30 °C and run for 4 h. Thereafter the same amount of the enzyme was added, and the incubation continued for 12 h. After boiling at 100 °C for 1 min to stop the reaction, the digest was lyophilized and derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (2AB), and then the excess 2AB was removed by paper chromatography (27Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The 2AB derivatives were subjected to gel filtration on a column (10 × 300 mm) of Superdex Peptide using 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as an eluant at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min (22Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Each resolved fraction as indicated in Fig. 2A was collected, rechromatographed under the same conditions, and desalted by repeated lyophilization. Size determination of the compounds in each fraction was achieved by comparison of the elution positions with those of size-defined oligosaccharide standards derived from CS-C or CS-D and by a mass spectrometric (MS) analysis as described below. Fractionation of E-CS/DS Oligosaccharides on a PTN Affinity Column—The PTN affinity column (1 ml) contained 0.35 mg of the protein. Before sample application, the column was washed with 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), containing 2.0 m NaCl, and then equilibrated with 5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl-containing Buffer A as above. 2AB-derivatized oligosaccharide fractions were each dissolved in 250 μl of 0.15 m NaCl-containing Buffer A and applied to the PTN column. To maximize the absorbance, loading was repeated six times by recycling each unbound fraction. Oligosaccharides (typically 50 pmol) were subjected to the affinity chromatography, and the column was washed stepwise with 3 ml of Buffer A containing 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, or 2.0 m NaCl for analytical runs. For preparative purposes, up to 2500 pmol of oligosaccharides were applied to the affinity column, which was then washed with Buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.7 m NaCl successively. The 0.15 m NaCl-eluted fraction was again subjected to affinity fractionation under the same conditions as described above. The 0.15 m NaCl-eluted subfraction obtained from the second fractionation was considered the unbound subfraction, whereas the combined 0.7 m NaCl-eluted subfraction was considered the bound subfraction of the parent fraction. For desalting and quantification, subfractions were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex Peptide column as described above. Calculation of the relative abundance among subfractions of a certain fraction was achieved by comparing the overall fluorescence intensity of the oligosaccharide peak(s) detected in each subfraction. Anion-exchange Chromatography—Separation of the PTN-unbound (400 pmol) and -bound (230 pmol) oligosaccharides in the chondroitinase B-resistant octasaccharide fraction, and analysis of the enzymatic digests with bacterial chondroitinases were carried out by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an amine-bound silica PA-03 column. The identification and quantification of the unsaturated di- and tetrasaccharides generated by chondroitinases were achieved by making comparisons with the authentic unsaturated di- and tetrasaccharides from CS and DS chains: ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc (ΔDi-0S or ΔO unit), ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc-(6S) (ΔDi-6S or ΔC unit), ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S) (ΔDi-4S or ΔA unit), ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(6S) (ΔDi-diSD or ΔD unit), ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(4S) (ΔDi-diSB or ΔB unit), ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,6S) (ΔDi-diSE or ΔE unit), ΔHexUA(2S)α1-3GalNAc-(4S,6S) (ΔDi-TriS or ΔT unit) (28Sugahara K.

Delayed Extraction Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry—Dried oligosaccharides (2-4 pmol of individual oligosaccharides, and 10-20 pmol of mixed oligosaccharide fractions) were first mixed with 1-2 μl of (Arg-Gly)15 (5-20 pmol) and then 1 μl of gentisic acid (1 mg/ml) (31Rhomberg A.J.

Each mixture was spotted on a plate for MS analysis using a mixture of (Arg-Gly)15 and gentisic acid as a control. The analysis was run in a positive mode using the HCD1001 method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MS spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE-RP-Pro (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using the linear mode. Enzymatic Treatments—For the analysis of disaccharide composition, oligosaccharides (20-100 pmol as disaccharides) were incubated with 5 international milliunits of chondroitinase ABC for 2 h and then chondroitinase AC-II (1 international milliunit) for another h. The resultant digests were derivatized with 2AB, and the excess 2AB was removed by extraction with CHCl3 (33Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12921-12930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To identify di- and tetrasaccharide structures at the reducing ends of the separated octasaccharides, aliquots (0.5-2 pmol) of each 2AB-labeled oligosaccharide subfraction were incubated with chondroitinase AC-II (1 international milliunit) or ABC (a conventional preparation, 1 international milliunit), respectively. To characterize the disaccharides at the non-reducing ends of the isolated oligosaccharides, the PTN-unbound and -bound subfractions (1-3 pmol) were subjected to digestions with a protease-free preparation of chondroitinase ABC (1 international milliunit) for 15 min or with chondroitinase AC-II (1 international milliunit) for 60 min, respectively, followed by a derivatization with 2AB. In one case, the disaccharide at the reducing end was examined by incubation of the oligosaccharide subfraction (∼2 pmol) with Δhexuronate-2-sulfatase (4 μIU) as described (15Nadanaka S. Clement A.

All the enzymatic reactions were carried out at 37 °C if not specified, and heating at 100 °C for 1 min was used to terminate the reactions. Each digest was subjected to analyses by anion-exchange HPLC and/or gel filtration as described above. Chondroitinase B-resistant Structures Contain the Major PTN-binding Epitopes of E-CS/DS—The E-CS/DS chains had a disaccharide composition of ΔO, ΔC, ΔA, ΔD, ΔB, and ΔE at a molar percentage of 14.4:32.9:60.1:1.7:<0.1:0.9, as evaluated by chondroitinase ABC digestion, and contained ∼9% IdoUA-containing disaccharides, which were cleavable by chondroitinase B and largely scattered along the chains (22Bao X.

Here, to characterize the epitopes in E-CS/DS for binding to PTN, we first assayed the effects of various treatments with chondroitinases or hyaluronidase on the inhibitory activity of E-CS/DS against the interaction between PTN and immobilized E-CS/DS in the BIAcore system. As shown in Fig. 1, E-CS/DS at a concentration of 10 μg/ml inhibited 75% of the interaction. However, treatment with chondroitinase ABC or AC-I abolished the inhibitory activity of E-CS/DS almost completely, indicating that both treatments destroyed most of the PTN-binding epitopes in the parent polymer. In contrast, neither hyaluronidase SD nor heparitinase treatment affected the inhibitory activity of E-CS/DS. The results of the hyaluronidase digestion suggested that long and consecutive sequences of non-sulfated disaccharides are not the structural elements in E-CS/DS critical for the binding to PTN. The results of the heparitinase digestion confirmed that the E-CS/DS preparation used in this study was free of contamination by HS. To our surprise, a chondroitinase B digest of E-CS/DS exhibited 65% of the inhibitory activity of the intact E-CS/DS, indicating that the chondroitinase B-resistant structures of E-CS/DS contained the majority of the PTN-binding epitopes. Gel filtration analysis of the digests of E-CS/DS obtained with chondroitinase B or hyaluronidase SD after labeling with 2AB revealed that chondroitinase B digestion generated a series of oligosaccharides ranging from di- to >20-mer oligosaccharides (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the hyaluronidase SD digest contained disaccharides and non-separable large oligosaccharides (>12-mer) in addition to small amounts of tetra- and hexasaccharides (data not shown). Isolation of Minimal Oligosaccharides for PTN Binding from a Chondroitinase B Digest of E-CS/DS—The parent E-CS/DS chains were dissected using chondroitinase B for the isolation of PTN-binding structures, taking advantage of the specificity of the enzyme, which not only retained the major PTN-binding structures in the digest but also provided structural information on the type of uronic acid (IdoUA) at the cleavage site. E-CS/DS was exhaustively digested with chondroitinase B, derivatized with 2AB, and fractionated by gel filtration. The effluent fractions (F1 to F8) were collected as indicated in"

Here, we explore the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Kir1.1a serine 44 controls plasmalemma expression. Studies in Xenopus oocytes, expressing wild-type, phosphorylation mimic (S44D), or phosphorylation null (S44A) Kir1.1a, revealed that phosphorylation of serine 44 is required to stimulate traffic of newly synthesized channels to the plasma membrane through a brefeldin A-sensitive pathway. ROMK channels were found to acquire mature glycosylation in a serine 44 phosphorylation-dependent manner, consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent trafficking step within the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi. Serine 44 neighbors a string of three “RXR” motifs, reminiscent of basic trafficking signals involved in directing early transport steps within the secretory pathway. Replacement of the arginine residues with alanine (R35A, R37A, R39A, R41A, or all Arg to Ala) did not restore cell surface expression of the phospho-null S44A channel, making it unlikely that phosphorylation abrogates a nearby RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signal. Instead, analysis of the compound S44D phospho-mimic mutants revealed that the neighboring arginine residues are also necessary for cell surface expression, identifying a structure that determines export in the biosynthetic pathway. Suppressor mutations in a putative dibasic ER retention signal, located within the cytoplasmic C terminus (K370A, R371A), restored cell surface expression of the phosphonull S44A channel to levels exhibited by the phospho-mimic S44D channel. Taken together, these studies indicate that phosphorylation of Ser44 drives an export step within the secretory pathway to override an independent endoplasmic reticulum localization signal.

The ROMK (aka Kir 1.1 or KCNJ1) subfamily of inward rectifying potassium channels (1Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) is essential for proper renal potassium excretion and the maintenance of potassium homeostasis. These channels are believed to be a major route for potassium transport into the distal tubule lumen (2Lu M. Wang T. Yan Q. Yang X. Dong K. Knepper M.A. Wang W. Giebisch G. Shull G.E. Hebert S.C. J.

Indeed, aldosterone, vasopressin, and other factors precisely regulate ROMK activity in the renal cortical collecting duct, controlling potassium excretion in accord with the demands of potassium balance. Because ROMK channels normally exhibit a very high open probability (6Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), physiologic alterations in channel activity are likely to be achieved by regulated changes in the number of active channels at the plasmalemma. A growing body of data has pointed to the involvement of phosphorylation-dependent trafficking mechanisms in the physiologic control of ROMK cell surface density. For example, Src kinases stimulate ROMK endocytosis and down-regulate channel density in states of potassium deprivation (7Moral Z. Dong K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R. Huang X.Y.

In principle, phosphorylation could drive delivery of channels to the cell surface, impair channel internalization or work through a combination of these processes. Observations of ours (14Yoo D.

Intriguingly, serine 44 juxtaposes putative RXR-type ER localization (20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Here, we test the hypothesis that cell surface expression of ROMK channel is regulated by phosphorylation-dependent export in the secretory pathway through a mechanism involving the phosphoserine 44 and the neighboring arginine motifs. Molecular Biology—All studies were performed with modified rat ROMK1 (aka Kir 1.1a) (1Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), containing an external hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag as described before (14Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based strategy with PfuTubo DNA polymerase (QuikChange, Stratagene). The sequence of all modified cDNAs was confirmed by dye termination DNA sequencing (University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core). All constructs used for studies in Xenopus oocytes were subcloned between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene in the modified pSD64 vector to increase expression efficiency (22Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). This vector also contains a polyadenylate sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (dA23dC30). cRNA Synthesis—Complementary RNA was transcribed in vitro in the presence of capping analogue G(5′)ppp(5′) from linearized plasmids containing the cDNA of interest using SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage Machine, Ambion Inc.). cRNA was purified by spin column chromatography (MEGAclear, Ambion Inc.). Yield was quantified spectrophotometrically and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocyte Isolation and Injection—Oocytes from female Xenopus Laevis (Xenopus Express, Homosassa, FL) were isolated and maintained using the standard procedures as described previously (23Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frogs were anesthetized with 0.15% 3-aminobenzoate, and a partial oophorectomy was performed through an abdominal incision. Oocyte aggregates were manually dissected from the ovarian lobes and then incubated in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing collagenase (type 3, Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature to remove the follicular layer. After extensive washing with collagenase-free OR-2, oocytes were stored at 19 °C in OR-3 medium (50% Leibovitz's medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing penicillin/streptomycin). 12–24 h later, healthy looking, Dumont stage V-VI oocytes were pneumatically injected with 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 0.75 ng of cRNA (unless noted otherwise) and then stored in OR-3 medium at 19 °C. Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes were monitored using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described previously (6Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were bathed in a 45 mm K+ solution (45 mm KCl, 45 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2.1mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or a 90 mm KCl solution (90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Voltage-sensing and current-injecting microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5–1.5 MΩ when backfilled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of 0 mV, and currents were recorded during 500-millisecond voltage steps, ranging from –100 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. For assessment of cation selectivity (PK/PNa) reversal potentials were measured as before (23Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar) in 5 mm K and 5 mm Na (85 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Data were collected using an ITC16 analog-to-digital, digital-to-analogue converter (Instrutech Corp.), filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized on line at 2 kHz using Pulse software (HEKA Electronik) for later analysis. ROMK currents are taken as the Barium-sensitive inward current (2 mm barium acetate) as we have done before (6Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Values reported in the text are the barium-sensitive inward currents at –100 mV. Surface Expression—Plasmalemma expression of the external HA-tagged ROMK1 channel was measured in single oocytes following procedures outlined by Zerangue et al. (20Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) with slight modifications as before (14Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In these studies, oocytes were washed two times in cold OR-2 medium, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in OR-2 for 15 min at 4 °C, and washed three times in OR-2. To block spurious antibody binding, oocytes were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C in OR-2 containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Exposed HA epitopes on the surface of intact oocytes were labeled with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science 3F10, 1% BSA, 4 °C overnight), and then oocytes were washed with OR-2 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rat (1 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories, 1% BSA, 3 h). Cells were washed for 1 h with OR-2 containing 1% BSA and then again for 10 min in OR-2 medium without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Luminescence from single oocytes was measured for 10 s in a Sirius luminometer and reported as the average relative light units per second. Average values represent 15–20 oocytes/construct/frog repeated in at least triplicate (three frogs). Membrane Protein—Oocytes were processed following the protocol described by Kamsteeg and Deen (24Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to isolate proteins from total membrane. In brief, oocytes were washed twice in homogenization buffer (80 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and then broken by trituration with a 25-gauge syringe. To pellet yolk proteins and nuclei, homogenates were spun twice at low speed (100 × g) for 10 min. Supernatants were then spun at high speed (16,100 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the total membrane fraction. Pellets were washed once in the homogenization buffer and spun at top speed again for 15 min and then placed in solubilization buffer (4% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, containing the protease inhibitors) and rocked for 2 h at 37°C. Particulate material was pelleted (16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the solubilized proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis of total membrane ROMK protein, as described below, was performed to ensure all constructs were translated at relatively equal levels. To study glycosylation, the solubilized membrane protein (20 μg) was treated with PNGase F or endoglycoside H (Endo H) (25 units/μg of protein) for 37 °C according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Cell Surface Immunoprecipitation—Surface delivery of S44A and S44D channels were studied in a qualitative cell surface immunoprecipitation assay. Samples containing the two different mutant channels were processed simultaneously as described below. After recovery from cRNA injection (19 °C for 12 h), intact oocytes were placed at room temperature and incubated with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science rat monoclonal anti-HA; 1:100 in OR-2 media supplemented with 1% BSA) to capture the arrival of channels at the cell surface at specific chase times (2, 4, and 6 h). The different channel mutants were compared using an equal numbers of oocytes (50 oocytes/frog per time point), and the studies were repeated in triplicate (3 frogs). At each time point, oocytes were placed at 4 °C in OR-2 medium containing brefeldin A (BFA) (10 μm) to stop membrane traffic and then further incubated with the antibody (4 h, 4 °C) to optimize labeling of cell surface expressed ROMK channels. Oocytes were washed of unbound antibody with the OR-2 + 1% BSA solution and lysed as above. Surface HA antibody-bound channels were then immunoprecipitated from membrane preparation using Protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C, rotating. Beads were washed three times with homogenization buffer + 0.1% Triton. Protein was eluted with SDS sample Buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis with anti-rabbit ROMK antibodies. Western blot analysis was then performed to identify surface immunoprecipitated ROMK (1°Ab, anti-ROMK LC35 (25Ecelbarger C.A. Kim G.H. Knepper M.A. Liu J. Tate M. Welling P.A. Wade J.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1:100; 2°Ab, donkey anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase, 1:5000). Western Blot Analysis—Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM) for 1 h at room temperature. Rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science) was diluted in 5% NFDM to 0.1 μg/ml, incubated overnight, washed for 10 min in TBS-T, incubated with goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, 5% NFDM), and then washed extensively for 20 min in TBS-T. Bound antibodies were then revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and fluorography (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using GB-Stat™ for Macintosh statistics package (Dynamic Microsystems, Inc). Analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference method post hoc test was performed to test for significance. Values of at least p < 0.05 were considered significant. Single exponential curve fits were performed using a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares optimization in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All data are given as mean ± S.D. All biochemical studies were repeated in at least triplicate. To determine whether phosphorylation of serine 44 drives trafficking of ROMK1 channels in the secretory pathway, we first monitored the arrival of newly synthesized ROMK1 channels at the plasmalemma in post-cRNA injection-chase experiments. In these studies, Xenopus oocytes were injected with either wild-type (WT), phosphorylation mimic (S44D), or phosphorylation null (S44A) ROMK cRNA, incubated at 19 °C for 12 h, and then “chased” at 22 °C in the absence and presence of brefeldin A (10 μm) with measurements of ROMK activity (Fig. 1A) and channel surface abundance (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1A, whole cell K+ currents, carried through the WT and the S44D channels but not the S44A channels, appear within the first 2 h of the chase period and then increase further at a quasi-linear rate. The response of WT and S44D was completely inhibited by BFA. Since BFA blocks the transport of newly synthesized membrane proteins at the ER/Golgi without effects on post-endocytotic routing in Xenopus oocytes (26Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the response is consistent with the egress of channels through the biosynthetic pathway. The rate of BFA-sensitive traffic to the plasmalemma (Fig. 1B), as inferred from time-dependent increase in the macroscopic potassium conductance, was identical for the wild-type and the phosphorylation mimic (S44D) channel. This latter result agrees with the observations that high levels of cAMP and PKA in the oocyte expression system (27Jessus C. Rime H. Ozon R. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) drive constitutive phosphorylation of Ser44 (14Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-F422PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the S44A phosphorylation null mutation dramatically inhibited trafficking to the plasmalemma. Since S44A ROMK channels (detected at the cell surface in limited abundance) display the same single channel conductance and open probability as the wild-type channel (28MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-F422PubMed Google Scholar), the absence of significant whole cell channel activity indicates that Ser44 phosphorylation null channels are inefficiently routed through the biosynthetic trafficking pathway. Indeed, direct measurements of ROMK cell surface expression at steady state by antibody binding and analytical luminometry corroborate the measurements of ROMK activity (Fig. 1C). To further substantiate the functional studies, we assessed the arrival of externally HA epitope-tagged ROMK channels to the plasmalemma using a dynamic surface labeling and qualitative detection assay (Fig. 2). In these studies, oocytes were incubated in the continued presence of HA antibody during the chase period so that channels that visit the plasmalemma, however transiently, should become bound to antibody. Channels labeled with extracellular antibody were recovered by immunoprecipitation, detected in Western blot analysis, and compared with the total immunodetectable channel in the cell. As shown in Fig. 2, ROMK channels bearing the phosphorylation mimic (S44D) mutation could be readily labeled with HA antibody at the cell surface during the early chase period. In contrast, phosphorylation null (S44A) channels could not be detected at the cell surface. Of note, the total immunodetectable pool of S44A channel consistently migrated as a smaller doublet (∼45–48 kb) than the surface expressed S44D channel (∼60 kb), presumably reflecting immature processing (see “Glycosidase Analysis”). Collectively, these studies indicate that phosphorylation of serine 44 is required for forward trafficking of channels in the secretory pathway. Mature Glycosylation Is Dependent on Ser44 Phosphorylation— ROMK1 channels acquire N-linked glycosylation at a single extracellular asparagine residue, N117 (29Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), into an Endo H-sensitive core and then are believed to be further processed to an Endo H-resistant form, indicative of maturation beyond the cis-Golgi. We took advantage of this process and examined glycosylation of the Ser44 mutant ROMK channels to probe for phosphorylation-dependent trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi (Fig. 3). The WT, S44A, and S44D ROMK proteins migrate on SDS-PAGE gels as a ∼47- and 48.5-kDa doublet. The WT and phospho-mimic, S44D, channel also ran as a higher molecular species, ∼61 kDa (a broader 61–85-kDa band in longer exposures), that was not seen with the phospho-null S44A channel. PNGase F, an amidase that cleaves all N-glycan chains from asparagine residues, collapsed the 48.5-kDa and the 61-kDa ROMK proteins into a single ∼47-kDa band. Because 47 kDa is the same size as glycosylation-deficient ROMK1 channels (N117Q) and the predicted molecular mass of unmodified ROMK1, the 48.5- and the 61-kDa proteins represent N-linked glycosolated forms of ROMK1. Endo H, an enzyme that preferentially hydrolyzes high mannose N-glycans on immature membrane proteins, selectively digested the ∼48.5-kDa form of ROMK. By contrast, the ∼61-kDa form was resistant to Endo H treatment, indicative of mature glycosylation. Taken together, these studies indicate that ROMK channels acquire mature glycosylation in a manner that is dependent on the conformation of serine 44, consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent trafficking step at the ER/Golgi. Stability of ROMK at the Plasma Membrane Is Not Dependent on Ser44 Phosphorylation—In principle, phosphorylation of serine 44 could also influence the stability of ROMK channels at the plasma membrane. To determine whether this is the case, we assessed the lifetime of wild-type and Ser44 phosphorylation mutant channels on the plasmalemma. In these studies, we allowed sufficient time after injection (2–3 days) for ROMK to be maximally expressed at the cell surface and then monitored the decay in channel activity (WT, S44D, S44A) under two-microelectrode voltage clamp after the arrival of new channels was blocked with BFA (10 μm). Studies of the S44A mutant channel required injecting ten times more cRNA than used with the wild-type and S44D channels to detect measurable activity. Under these conditions, initial whole cell K+ current density of the oocytes expressing S44A was well above background and comparable with the other channels (10.83 ± 2 μAat –100 mV in 90 mm K+). As shown in Fig. 4A, neither of the Ser44 mutant channels displayed significantly different decay rates than the wild-type channel. Indeed, all were well described by a single exponential time course with half-lives that were statistically indistinguishable (3.2 ± 0.5 h, WT; 4.0 ± 0.7 h, S44D; 3.6 ± 0.5 h, S44A, n = 3 frogs) and similar to previous reports of the wild-type channel (30Zeng W.Z. Babich V. Ortega B. Quigley R. White S.J. Welling P.A. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F630-F669Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Measurements of immunodetectable channel at the cell surface in the presence and absence of brefeldin A confirmed that decay in channel activity was due to channel internalization. With the results above, these studies indicate that phosphorylation of Ser44 controls surface expression of ROMK through a biosynthetic trafficking mechanism and not through alteration of channel stability at the plasma membrane. Sequence Requirements for Phosphorylation-dependent Trafficking— The phosphoserine 44 residue juxtaposes a string of three “RXR” motifs (Fig. 5). Similar basic residue structures have been implicated in the control of membrane protein traffic at early steps in the secretory pathway, acting as signals that drive ER localization (20Zerangue N.

Evidence for a physiological mechanism that upon depolarization of myotubes tightly couples three calcium channels, DHPR, RyR1, and a Ca2+ entry channel with SOCC-like properties, has recently been presented (Cherednichenko, G., Hurne, A.

This form of conformational coupling, termed excitation-coupled calcium entry (ECCE) is triggered by the α1s-DHPR voltage sensor and is highly dependent on RyR1 conformation. In this report, we substitute RyR1 cysteines 4958 or 4961 within the TXCFICG motif, common to all ER/SR Ca2+ channels, with serine. When expressed in skeletal myotubes, C4958S- and C4961S-RyR1 properly target and restore L-type current via the DHPR. However, these mutants do not respond to RyR activators and do not support skeletal type EC coupling. Nonetheless, depolarization of cells expressing C4958S- or C4961S-RyR1 triggers calcium entry via ECCE that resembles that for wild-type RyR1, except for substantially slowed inactivation and deactivation kinetics. ECCE in these cells is completely independent of store depletion, displays a cation selectivity of Ca2+>Sr2+∼Ba2+, and is fully inhibited by SKF-96365 or 2-APB. Mutation of other non-CXXC motif cysteines within the RyR1 transmembrane assembly (C3635S, C4876S, and C4882S) did not replicate the phenotype observed with C4958S- and C4961S-RyR1. This study demonstrates the essential role of Cys4958 and Cys4961 within an invariant CXXC motif for stabilizing conformations of RyR1 that influence both its function as a release channel and its interaction with ECCE channels.

Several theories have been proposed to account for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), including the involvement of a diffusible second messenger (11Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and rapid vesicular translocation (12Bakowski D. Burgoyne R.D. Parekh A.B. J.

Ca2+ entry pathways evoked by physiological stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or elements of the DAG limb of the phosphoinositide pathway such as arachidonate also appear to directly modulate Ca2+ entry by a mechanism that is independent of store depletion (14Putney J.W.

Evidence for the conformational coupling hypothesis, whereby activation of Ca2+ entry is tightly coupled to changes in the conformation of RyRs and IP3Rs, has also been provided in both non-excitable and excitable cells (5Kiselyov K.I.

In skeletal muscle, a specialized form of conformational coupling occurs between DHPR and RyR1. Skeletal excitation-contraction (EC) coupling (an orthograde signal from DHPR to RyR1) results in release of Ca from the SR without a requirement for entry of extracellular Ca2+. Additionally, a retrograde signal from RyR1 to the DHPR regulates the magnitude of the inward Ca current carried by the DHPR (3Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 21Fleig A. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Avila G.

Block of RyR1 with micromolar ryanodine causes a substantial (2-nm) shift in the relative positions of the four DHPRs within each tetrad, indicating that ryanodine induces large conformational changes in the RyR1 cytoplasmic domain and that the α1S-DHPR-RyR1 complex acts as a physically coupled unit (25Paolini C. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12748-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within the DHPR, a 45-amino acid stretch of the α1S II-III loop (corresponding to Leu720-Leu764) and the C-terminal of β1a are both important for bi-directional signaling (26Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

In addition to bi-directional signaling engaged during EC coupling, there are Ca2+ entry mechanisms involving yet unidentified SOCC in muscle cells (see Ref. 30Ma J. Pan Z. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, for review). The activation of SOCC in myotubes has been linked to two distinct mechanisms. One form of Ca2+ entry, unmasked in the presence of the SERCA pump blockers thapsigargin (TG) (31Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar) or cyclopiazonic acid (32Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is activated subsequent to chronic store depletion and appears be closely related to SOCE commonly described in non-excitable cells. A second mechanism, termed excitation-coupled Ca2+ entry (ECCE) was recently described in skeletal myotubes (33Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unlike SOCE, the expression of both α1S-DHPR and RyR1 are essential for engaging ECCE. ECCE is triggered by membrane depolarization, whereas SOCE is inhibited by membrane depolarization (17Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). α1S-DHPR serves as the voltage sensor for triggering the activation of ECCE, and the conformational state of RyR1 dramatically influences the behavior of ECCE in response to membrane depolarization. For example, the fully blocked RyR1 conformation assumed in the presence of micromolar ryanodine significantly slows the inactivation of the ECCE during a maintained depolarization (33Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Initial experiments with ryanodine-treated myotubes indicate that ECCE, unlike SOCE, does not appear to depend on appreciable depletion of SR stores to be fully engaged. Elements of structure within RyR1 important for regulating either ECCE or SOCE are not known. Cysteine residues are integral for inducing and maintaining the three-dimensional conformation in proteins by forming critical inter- and intramolecular disulfide bond linkages. The RyR is known to contain several classes of cysteine residues with different chemical reactivities. Much attention has been focused on the role of extremely reactive cysteine residues as key structural components contributing to redox modulation and nitrosylation of the channel complex (see Refs. 34Pessah I.N. Kim K.H. Feng W. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: a72-a79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 35Hamilton S.L. Reid M.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently seven hyper-reactive cysteines of RyR1, including the nitrosylation site Cys3635, were identified using chemical labeling and mass spectroscopic techniques (36Voss A.A. Lango J. Ernst-Russell M. Morin D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34514-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Located in the cytoplasmic tail of all RyR and IP3R isoforms is a highly conserved TXCFICG motif with two invariant cysteine residues (Cys4958 and Cys4961 in RyR1). Although this motif conforms to the CXXC consensus known to confer redox sensitivity to thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases (37Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11214-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the contribution of Cys4958 and Cys4961 to RyR1 conformation and function are unknown. In the present study, we report that two mutated RyR1s (C4958S or C4961S) target properly to junctions after expression in 1B5 or primary myotubes, as indicated by the restoration of retrograde signaling to the α1S-DHPR. However, cells expressing these proteins lack EC coupling because the mutant release channels fail to activate, even in response to direct agonists. Nonetheless, C4958S- and C4961S-RyR1 maintain their ability to engage ECCE, which demonstrates that ECCE occurs in the absence of SR store depletion that would result from SR Ca2+ release. Interestingly, the inactivation of ECCE with C4958S- or C4961S-RyR1 is substantially slower than with wild-type RyR1. These data further differentiate ECCE from classic SOCE and show that cysteines 4958 and 4961 near the C terminus function both to maintain conformations necessary for RyR1 channel function and to influence conformational activation of ECCE. cDNA Cloning—Cys4958 and Cys4961 were mutated to serine using primer extension-driven site-directed mutagenesis in a ClaI(14,203)-XbaI (vector) fragment of RyR1 using a QuikChange® (Stratagene, CA) kit, and sequenced in both directions to confirm the mutation and the absence of any other random mutations. The primers used to create either mutation (note: mutated sequence is indicated in lowercase) are: forward 5′-GAGACCAAAa/tGCTTCATCa/tGCGGGATTG-3′, reverse 5′-CTCTGGTTTt/aCGAAGTAGt/aCGCCCTAAC-3′ with the first substitution yielding C4958S and the second yielding C4961S. The mutated fragments were then ligated back into the full-length RyR1 constructs in pHSVprPUC HSV amplicon vector (38Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. Di-Francesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or into both the pCDNA3 and the pCI-neo mammalian expression vectors (39Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A similar method was used to create the C3635S, C4876S, and C4882S mutations. Culture of 1B5 and Primary Mouse Skeletal Myotubes—IB5 myogenic cells (40Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 10% CO2, 5% O2. For Fura-2 ratio fluorescence imaging measurements, cells were grown on collagen (calf skin; Calbiochem) coated 72-well polystyrene plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) or 96-well μ-clear plates (Greiner, Frederick, MD). Once dividing cells were ∼50% confluent, they were stimulated to differentiate into myotubes over a period of 6-8 days in growth factor-deprived medium consisting of DMEM containing 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum (HIHS), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 10% CO2, 10% O2. Preparation of primary cultures of skeletal myotubes from wild-type and dyspedic (lacking RyR1) mice has been described previously (41Rando T.A. Blau H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Wild-type and dyspedic primary myoblasts were grown on 100-mm tissue culture-treated Corning dishes and cultured in Ham's F-10 nutrient medium containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (rhFGF; Promega, Madison, WI), 100 units/ml penicillin-G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 10% CO2, 5% O2. For Fura-2 imaging cells were plated onto 96-well μ-clear plates (Greiner) coated with MATRIGEL (BD Biosciences) or collagen. Upon reaching ∼80% confluence, the cells were differentiated into myotubes over a period of 3-5 days using DMEM containing 2% (v/v) HIHS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 10% CO2, 10% O2. Transduction of Skeletal Myotubes with cDNAs—For Ca2+-imaging studies, differentiated 1B5 and primary dyspedic myotubes were transduced with helper virus-free herpes simplex virus-1 amplicon virions (1 × 105 to 3 × 105 infectious units/ml) (38Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. Di-Francesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the cDNA encoding for either wild-type RyR1, C4958S- or C4961S-RyR1 in antibiotic-free DMEM containing 2% HIHS for 1 h at 37°C, 10% CO2, 10% O2. After 1 h, the virus-containing medium was replaced with differentiation medium, and the cells were used for imaging experiments 24-48 h post-transduction. For measurement of whole cell currents, a single nucleus of each myotube (6-7 days after initial plating) was microinjected with 0.3 μg/μl of either C4958S-, or C4961S-RyR1 pCDNA3 or RyR1-pCI-neo and 0.2 μg/μl of an expression plasmid (42Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) for the surface antigen CD8. Approximately 48 h later, the medium was removed from injected myotubes and replaced with external recording solution (see below) containing beads coated with CD8 antibody (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway), which allowed identification of cells that were expressing CD8, and thus candidates to express the RyR construct of interest. Alternatively, the RyR cDNA was injected together with 0.04 μg/μl cDNA for green fluorescent protein (43Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the CD8- or GFP-positive myotubes were used for experiments. Whole Cell Measurements of Ca2+ Currents and Transients—The whole cell technique was used for the simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ currents and transients (44O'Brien J.J. Feng W. Allen P.D. Chen S.R. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2428-2435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 1.6-2.0 mΩ when filled with internal solution, which contained (in mm) 145 cesium glutamate, 8 MgATP (1 mm free Mg2+), 2 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 0.5 K5Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as the Ca2+ indicator. After a seal was obtained between the patch pipette and a myotube, bath perfusion was used to remove any indicator that had leaked from the pipette. A period of >5 min was allowed after breaking into whole cell mode so that Fluo-3 could diffuse throughout the myotube. Ca2+ currents were measured with a Warner PC501 patch amplifier (Hamden, CT) and transients with a photomultiplier apparatus (Biomedical Instrumentation Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Cells were held at -80 mV and control (linear capacitive and leak) currents were measured by steps to -110 mV. Cell capacitance was determined by integration of the control current and used to normalize Ca2+ currents (pA/pF). Additionally, the average of 10 control currents was digitally scaled and subtracted from test currents to correct for linear components of leakage and capacitative current. The voltage protocol for test currents consisted of a 1-s prepulse to -30 or -20 mV to inactivate T-type current, followed by a 50-ms repolarization to -50 mV, followed by a 200-ms step to the test potential, a 125-ms step to -50 mV, and finally a return to the holding potential. The external solution used for measuring Ca2+ currents contained (in mm) 145 TEAC1, 10 HEPES, 10 CaCl2, and 0.003 TTX. To measure responses to application of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), intact cells were loaded with Fluo3-AM as described previously (44O'Brien J.J. Feng W. Allen P.D. Chen S.R. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2428-2435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data were recorded by applying 1-s fluorescence excitation pulses at 0.1 Hz and averaging the fluorescent emission during a 200-800-ms interval centered within each excitation pulse. Baseline fluorescence (F) was determined prior to the application of CPA and used to calculate the normalized change in fluorescence, ΔF/F. Response latency was determined as the time from application of CPA until the first data point exceeding the baseline by greater than two standard deviations. The effects of CPA, which was applied in rodent Ringer containing (mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), were tested on only a single myotube per culture dish. Ca2+ and Mn2+ Imaging—Differentiated 1B5 or primary myotubes were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2-AM (5 μm) at 37 °C for 20 min in imaging buffer (in mm) 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 6 dextrose, and 25 HEPES, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.05% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed with imaging buffer supplemented with 250 μm sulfinpyrazone and transferred to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Fura-2 was excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm, using a Delta Ram excitation source and fluorescence images magnified with × 10 or ×40 objectives were detected at 510 nm with an IC-300 ICCD camera (Photon Technology International; PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ). Images were captured, digitized, and stored on computer using ImageMaster software (PTI). Ratiometric (340/380) data were collected from regions of 5 to 15 individual cells. Agonists were dissolved in imaging buffer and perfused into wells containing the myotubes. When high KCl concentrations were used (>40 mm), the concentration of Na+ was lowered accordingly to preserve osmolarity. In some experiments the chloride product was kept constant by substitution of potassium methane sulfonate, and was not found to influence the myotube parameters measured in the present study. In some experiments, the manganese quench method was employed (45Clementi E. Scheer H. Zacchetti D. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2164-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol.

Mn2+ enters the cell through plasma membrane channels but cannot be removed via the ATPase pumps. After loading the cells with Fura-2-AM the extracellular solution was replaced with Ca2+-free imaging buffer containing a final concentration of 0.5 mm Mn2+. Fura-2 was excited at 360 nm and emission measured at 510 nm with a ×10 or ×40 objective. After recording a baseline decrease in fluorescence intensity (due to Mn2+ quenching the dye), cells were then depolarized with KCl and the new rate of quench observed. For electrical field stimulation, two platinum electrodes were fixed to opposite sides of the well and connected to an AMPI Master 8 stimulator. Myotubes were loaded with Fura-2 and stimulated with 25-ms, 6-V pulses over a range of frequencies (5-20 Hz). In these experiments, data were acquired at 50-ms intervals by photometry. Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Preparation—Differentiated myotubes transduced with virions containing the cDNA encoding for C4958S and wild-type RyR1 were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off 100-mm plates using 3 ml of cold harvest buffer (in mm: 137 NaCl, 3 KCl, 8 Na2HPO4, 1.5 KH2PO4, 0.5 Na4EDTA at pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 5 μm leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) and homogenized on ice using a PowerGen 700D homogenizer (Fisher Scientific) for 3 × 5 s at 14,000 rpm. An equal volume of ice-cold 20% sucrose buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added and the homogenization process repeated. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 33,000 rpm for 1 h, at 4°C in a Ti80 rotor and the crude pellet resuspended in 10% sucrose-HEPES buffer solution, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were denatured in 1:1 in a solution containing 10% mercaptoethanol and 10% sucrose-HEPES buffer for 30 min at 60 °C before being loaded onto a 3-10% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V for 45 min. The size-separated proteins were then transferred slowly onto polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using an electroblotter (Mini Transblot; Bio-Rad) for 16 h at 200 V followed by a rapid transfer for 1 h at 100 V. The transferred proteins were then incubated in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at ambient temperature for 30 min. The blot was then probed with 34C primary antibody (1:200 dilution; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA; Refs. 23Avila G. O'Connell K.M. Groom L.A. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol.

After 1 h the blot was rinsed in TTBS buffer three times and then incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:20,000 dilution) for 1 h at 25 °C. After a final rinse step with TTBS, enhanced chemiluminescence techniques (PerkinElmer Life Science Products) were used to visualize the immunoblots. C4958S-RyR1 Enhances L-type Ca2+ Current, but Lacks EC Coupling—Western analysis of homogenates from myotubes expressing C4958S- or wild-type RyR1 revealed the presence of one predominant immunoreactive band whose size was indistinguishable from that of junctional SR from adult rabbit (Fig. 1a). Similar results were obtained with preparations of C4961S-RyR1 (not shown). Additional immunocytochemical labeling experiments not shown here indicated that C4958S- or wild-type RyR1 were distributed within expressing myotubes in punctate rows, consistent with localization to Ca2+ release units at surface membrane/SR junctions (48Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The processing and targeting of C4958S-RyR1 were functionally tested by whole cell voltage clamp after expression in primary dyspedic myotubes. In agreement with previous results (3Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), the expression of wild-type RyR1 greatly enhanced peak L-type Ca2+ current density compared with dyspedic myotubes (−14.1 ± 1.5 versus −1.4 ± 0.3 pA/pF; Fig. 1, b and c). The wild-type RyR1 also restored skeletal-type EC coupling in that (i) the depolarization-induced calcium tra"
https://openalex.org/W2015188456,"RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene on 3p21.3 frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To identify RASSF1A target genes in NPC, we have investigated the expression profile of the stable RASSF1A transfectants and controls by high-density oligonucleotide array. A total of 57 genes showed differential expression in the RASSF1A-expressing cells. These RASSF1A target genes were involved in multiple cellular regulatory processes such as transcription, signal transduction, cell adhesion and RNA processing. The RASSF1A-modulated expression of eight selected genes with the highest fold changes (ATF5, TCRB, RGS1, activin βE, HNRPH1, HNRPD, Id2 and CKS2) by RASSF1A was confirmed in both stable and transient transfectants. Compared with the RASSF1A transfectants, an inverse expression pattern of activin βE, Id2 and ATF5 was shown in the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells treated with siRNA against RASSF1A. The findings imply that the expression of activin βE, Id2 and ATF5 was tightly regulated by RASSF1A and may associate with its tumor suppressor function. Strikingly, overexpression of Id2 is common in NPC and RASSF1A-induced repression of Id2 was mediated by the overexpression of activin βE.

Here, we directly test this association by using a Cre-LoxP strategy to inactivate the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc) gene in the murine renal epithelium. Mice homozygous for a conditional Apc allele were intercrossed with mice transgenic for Cre recombinase under control of the Cyp1A promoter, which delivers constitutive recombination within a proportion of cells in the renal epithelium. Inactivation of Apc leads to the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin and the rapid development of multiple dysplastic foci. Renal carcinoma was observed with an earliest onset of 4 months. This predisposition was accelerated by p53 deficiency, reducing the earliest onset to 2 months. Compared to other murine models of kidney neoplasia, this represents particularly rapid onset of disease, and so implicates an important role for Apc in suppressing renal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1989959258,"Caspases are essential proteases in programmed cell death and inflammation. Studies in murine and human cells have led to the characterization of 14 members of this enzyme family. Here we report the identification of caspase-15, a novel caspase that is expressed in various mammalian species including pig, dog, and cattle. The caspase-15 protein contains a catalytic domain with all amino acid residues critical for caspase activity and a prodomain that is predicted to fold into a pyrin domain structure, which is a unique feature among mammalian caspases. Recombinant porcine caspase-15 underwent autocatalytic processing into its subunits and cleaved both tetrapeptide caspase substrates and the apoptosis regulator protein Bid in vitro. Overexpression of caspase-15 in mammalian cells induced proenzyme maturation, cleavage of Bid, activation of caspase-3, and eventually cell death. Both the proteolytic and the pro-apoptotic activity of caspase-15 were abolished by mutation of the active site cysteine. Since a homolog of caspase-15 is absent in the human and the mouse genome, our results reveal an unexpected variability in the molecular apoptotic machinery of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2023127046,"The role of SecA in selecting bacterial proteins for export was examined using a heterologous system that lacks endogenous SecA and other bacterial proteins. This approach allowed us to assess the interaction of SecA with ribosome-bound photoreactive nascent chains in the absence of trigger factor, SecB, Ffh (the bacterial protein component of the signal recognition particle), and the SecYEG translocon in the bacterial plasma membrane. In the absence of membranes, SecA photocross-linked efficiently to nascent translocation substrate OmpA in ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) complexes in an interaction that was independent of both ATP and SecB. However, no photocross-linking to a nascent membrane protein that is normally targeted by a signal recognition particle was observed. Modification of the signal sequence revealed that its affinity for SecA and Ffh varied inversely. Gel filtration showed that SecA binds tightly to both translating and non-translating ribosomes. When purified SecA·RNC complexes containing nascent OmpA were exposed to inner membrane vesicles lacking functional SecA, the nascent chains were successfully targeted to SecYEG translocons. However, purified RNCs lacking SecA were unable to target to the same membranes. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that cytosolic SecA participates in the selection of proteins for export by co-translationally binding to the signal sequences of non-membrane proteins and directing those nascent chains to the translocon."

We purified Thermus thermophilus CPD photolyase with its second chromophore. UV-visible absorption spectra, reverse-phase HPLC, and NMR analyses of the chromophores revealed that the second chromophore of the enzyme is flavin mononucleotide (FMN). To clarify the role of FMN in the CPD repair reaction, the enzyme without FMN (Enz-FMN(-) and that with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)) were both successfully obtained. The CPD repair activity of Enz-FMN(+) was higher than that of Enz-FMN(-), and the CPD repair activity ratio of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) was dependent on the wavelength of light. These results suggest that FMN increases the light absorption efficiency of the enzyme. NMR analyses of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) revealed that the binding mode of FMN is similar to that of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin in Anacystis nidulans CPD photolyase, and thus a direct electron transfer between FMN and CPD is not likely to occur.

In particular, the CPD photolyases from Escherichia coli and Anacystis nidulans have been studied intensively. CPD photolyases contain flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a chromophore (5Eker A.P.M.

Our previous NMR analysis revealed that the CPD is bound to a FAD-containing cavity in the helical domain (17Ueda T. Kato K. Ogawa Y. Torizawa T. Kuramitsu S. Iwai S. Terasawa H. Shimada I. J. Biol.

The crystal structures of the CPD photolyases from E. coli and A. nidulans contain MTHF and 8-HDF, respectively, in the α/β domain (12Mees A. Klar T. Gnau P. Hennecke U. Eker A.P. Carell T.

In contrast, the crystal structure of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase lacks a second chromophore, although it contains a pocket that is similar to the 8-HDF-binding site of A. nidulans CPD photolyase (14Komori H. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the second chromophore of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase may have been dissociated from the enzyme during its purification. In the present study, we developed a method for the purification of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase that retained its second chromophore and identified flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as the second chromophore of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase. The enzyme without FMN (Enz-FMN(-) and that with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)) were both successfully obtained. Based on our characterization of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-), we conclude that FMN functions as a highly efficient light harvester that gathers light and transfers the energy to FAD. Purification of T. thermophilus CPD Photolyase—E. coli strains expressing CPD photolyase from T. thermophilus HB27 were cultured as described previously (19Kato R. Hasegawa K. Hidaka Y. Kuramitsu S. Hoshino T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uniformly 15N-labeled enzyme was obtained by culturing the cells in M9 medium containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl. Selective 15N labeling of tryptophan residues was performed as described previously (20Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 177: 44-73Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in buffer A (50 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl), pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and were lysed by sonication. Polyethyeneimine-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.35% (w/v), and the suspension was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was fractionated by P11 chromatography (What-man). The column was washed with buffer A, and the flow-through and the wash were subjected to UV-irradiated DNA-cellulose chromatography (21Eker A.P. Fichtinger A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 378: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The column was washed with buffer A, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). The eluate was concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to buffer A with Centriprep YM-30 (Millipore). The solution was fractionated by DEAE Sephadex A-25 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with buffer A. The flow-through and the wash were collected, and after the buffer was exchanged to storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, and 60% (v/v) glycerol), they were stored at -80 °C. Control of Oxidation States—To obtain T. thermophilus CPD photolyase in the reduced form (FADH-), sodium dithionite and dithiothreitol were added to the purified enzyme at final concentrations of 20 and 10 mm, respectively. The enzyme in the radical semiquinone form (FADH.) was obtained by removing the dithionite from the reduced enzyme with Centriprep YM-30. To obtain the enzyme in the oxidized form (FADox), the buffer of the purified enzyme was exchanged to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and the enzyme was incubated at 4 °C until the absorbance around 600 nm was completely eliminated (about 2 days). Ferricyanide was then removed with Centriprep YM-30. UV-visible Absorption Spectra—UV-visible absorption spectra of the native-state enzymes were measured using the enzymes at 5-20 μm dissolved in buffer A. The spectra of the standard FAD and the mixture of denatured apoprotein and the chromophores were measured in buffer A with 1% SDS. A 500-μl aliquot of the solution was placed into a cuvette, and the absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-visible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV 2400PC). Reverse-phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC)—FAD, FMN, a mixture of the denatured apoprotein and the chromophores, and the reaction mixtures of the photoreactivation assay were separated by Pegasil ODS 7 μm (8.0 × 300 mm) (Senshu Scientific) HPLC, with a 40-min 8.0-14.0% gradient of CH3CN in 0.1 m triethylamine acetate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Photoreactivation Activity—A CPD-containing single-stranded heptamer, d(TAT[CPD]TATG), was prepared as described previously (22Kobayashi H. Morioka H. Torizawa T. Kato K. Shimada I. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Three nanomoles of the enzyme in the E-FADH. form and 0.75 nmol of the substrate, d(TAT[CPD]TATG, were added to 1.5 ml of buffer A in the dark, and the reaction mixture was irradiated with monochromatic light by a fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu RF 5300PC) equipped with a UV-350 filter (Shimadzu) under aerobic condition at 25 °C. The bandwidth and the irradiation time were set to 1.5-5 nm and 2-40 min, respectively. The light intensity was measured with an optical power meter (Newport C-840). The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and was subsequently extracted six times with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The upper layer was lyophilized and fractionated by RP-HPLC as described above. Photolytic cross-section values (ϵ[phis]) were calculated as described previously (23Rupert C.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1962; 45: 725-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Photolyases with a Stoichiometric Amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)) and without FMN (Enz-FMN(-)—To obtain the enzyme with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)), equimolar amounts of FMN were added to the purified enzyme. After incubation for 1 h, the excess FMN was removed with Centriprep YM-30. To obtain the enzyme without FMN (Enz-FMN(-), the enzyme was subjected to Blue Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with buffer B, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 m NaCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol). The eluate was concentrated, and its buffer was exchanged to buffer A. Quantification of T. thermophilus CPD Photolyase—The purified enzymes, Enz-FMN(- and Enz-FMN(+), were quantified by their absorbance in the FADH. form at 280 nm (A280). Their molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (ϵ280), required for the quantification, were determined in the following manner. First, the A280 values of the enzymes in the FADH. form were measured. Second, to determine their amounts, they were denatured with 1% (w/v) SDS, and their cofactors were removed by Centriprep YM-30. The A280 values of the denatured apoproteins were measured, and the amount of each denatured apoprotein was calculated with its ϵ280 (1.05 × 105), which was determined from the number of tryptophan and tyrosine residues within the enzyme. Finally, the ϵ280 value of each enzyme in the FADH. form was determined from its amount and the A280 value. The determined ϵ280 values are as follows: the purified enzyme, 1.38 × 105; Enz-FMN(-, 1.24 × 105 ; Enz-FMN(+), 1.53 × 105. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—These measurements were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). The CPD-containing 28-mer, d(GAAAGTAGAACAAT[CPD]TAAGCAAATGGTAA), was synthesized from d(GAAAGTAGAA), d(CAAT-[CPD]TAAG), and (CAAATGGTAA), and 32-mer, d(TTTTACCATTTGCTTAATTGTTCTACTTTCTC), was obtained, as reported previously (25Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-biotinylated 32-mer was purchased from Espec Oligo Service. The 5′-biotinylated 32-mer was immobilized onto the sensor chip SA (Biacore AB), resulting in a signal of 250 resonance units, and subsequent injection of the CPD-containing 28-mer into the flow cell resulted in an additional signal of 250 resonance units. The binding assay was performed in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 3.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 m1 m NaCl, and 0.001% Triton X-100) at a flow rate of 50 μlmin- using serial dilutions of the enzymes in the 31 nm-1 μm range. The dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained from the global fitting analysis with 1:1 binding with a mass transfer model using BIAevaluation software, version 3.0 (Biacore AB). NMR Measurement—All NMR experiments were at 37 °C performed on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer. For the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) measurements, 0.1-0.3 mm concentrations of the enzymes were dissolved in 450 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 10mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm sodium dithionite, and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol in 90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O. For the 31P-NMR measurements of the enzyme, 0.1-0.3 mm concentrations of the enzymes were dissolved in 450 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol with 90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O. For the 31P-NMR measurements, the flavins were dissolved in 2H2O, and the pH of the solutions was adjusted to 9.0. 1H-15N HSQC and 31P-NMR experiments were performed as described (26Torizawa T. Kato K. Kimura Y. Asada T. Kobayashi H. Komatsu Y. Morioka H. Nikaido O. Ohtsuka E. Shimada I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Development of a Purification Protocol Designed to Retain the Second Chromophore—T. thermophilus CPD photolyase was reportedly purified by heat treatment and Blue Sepharose chromatography (19Kato R. Hasegawa K. Hidaka Y. Kuramitsu S. Hoshino T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We designate this purification method as method A. The ligand of Blue Sepharose chromatography, Cibacron Blue F3GA, is known to bind to the cofactor-binding site of flavoproteins (27Subramanian S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 169-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, buffers with a high salt concentration (>1 m) are required to elute the enzyme from Blue Sepharose. Therefore, the second chromophore may dissociate from the enzyme during the purification by method A. To obtain the enzyme with its second chromophore, we developed a purification method for T. thermophilus CPD photolyase that did not include Blue Sepharose chromatography. After several trials, we found that T. thermophilus CPD photolyase neither precipitated by polyethyleneimine treatment nor bound to phosphocellulose in a buffer with 100 mm NaCl (as described under “Materials and Methods”), in contrast to the majority of DNA-binding proteins (28Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Ward J.M. Wallace L.J. Cowan D. Shadbolt P. Levison P.R. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1991; 249: 195-200Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, T. thermophilus CPD photolyase was purified to apparent homogeneity, as judged from SDS-PAGE, by the removal of the DNA-binding proteins with polyethyleneimine and P11 chromatography followed by purification with DNA-cellulose chromatography (Fig. 1). DNA contamination was observed in the DNA-cellulose chromatogaphy eluate, and thus the contaminating DNA was removed by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Oxidation States of the Chromophore FAD—The FAD in purified photolyases is found in three oxidation forms: the two-electron reduced form (FADH-), the radical semiquinone form (FADH.), and the oxidized form (FADox) (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). FADH- is labile under aerobic condition and has little visible light absorbance, whereas FADH. and FADox are stable and have specific absorption maximums around 450 and 600 nm, respectively (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme purified by method B (Fig. 2, trace 1) under aerobic condition contains the absorption maximums around 450 and 600 nm. This result suggested that the purified enzyme is a mixture of the enzymes with FADox and FADH.. The heterogeneity of the oxidation states may cause uncertainty in the photoreactivation assay and the NMR analysis, and thus we developed methods to prepare the enzyme in each oxidation state. To obtain the enzyme with FADox, we added potassium ferricyanide to the purified enzyme and incubated it for 2 days. As a result, the absorbance around 450 nm, which is specific for the enzyme with FADox, was increased, and the absorbance around 600 nm, which is specific for the enzyme with FADH., disappeared (Fig. 2, trace 2). To obtain the enzyme with FADH-, we added sodium dithionite to the purified enzyme. Consequently, the absorbances around 450 and 600 nm disappeared (Fig. 2, trace 3). The disappearance of the absorbance around 600 nm intraces 2 and 3 indicates that the enzyme with FADH. represents less than 10% in the enzymes with FADox and FADH-. To obtain the enzyme with FADH., we removed dithionite from the enzyme with FADH-. As a consequence, the absorbance around 600 nm was regenerated (Fig. 2, trace 4), suggesting that the enzyme was in the FADH. form. NMR spectra of the enzyme with FADH., in which the resonances from the atoms nearby FADH. had disappeared because of the FAD-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (17Ueda T. Kato K. Ogawa Y. Torizawa T. Kuramitsu S. Iwai S. Terasawa H. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52574-52579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), also suggested that >90% of the enzyme was in the FADH. form. However, the absorbance around 450 nm was also partially regenerated. These results indicate that the enzyme purified by method B contains both an FAD and another chromophore with an absorbance around 450 nm. Identification of Chromophores—We analyzed the chromophores of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase purified by method B. First, the enzyme was denatured with 1% SDS, and a mixture of the denatured apoprotein and the chromophores was obtained. As shown in Fig. 3A, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the mixture was analogous to that of the reference FAD, indicating that the enzyme contains flavin derivatives as chromophores and does not contain MTHF, which is the second chromophore of E. coli photolyase, because MTHF has an absorbance maximum at 390 nm (30Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7715-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, to determine the stoichiometry of the apoprotein and the chromophores, the denatured apoprotein and the chromophores of the mixture were separated by dialysis and quantified by their absorbance and molar extinction coefficients. As a result, the molar ratio of the apoprotein and the cofactors was 1:1.5, suggesting that a flavin derivative is noncovalently bound to T. thermophilus CPD photolyase as a second chromophore. Third, the cofactors of the mixture were separated by RP-HPLC to identify the second chromophore (Fig. 3B). Consequently, two major fractions, fractions 1 and 2 in Fig. 3B, were observed. The fractions were further analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The observed molecular weights of fractions 1 and 2 were 788 and 458, respectively. Based upon the results and the chemical structures of the flavin derivatives (31Hausinger R.P. Honek J F. Walsh C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we speculated that fractions 1 and 2 were FAD and FMN, respectively, and that the latter was the second chromophore. Therefore, we compared the RP-HPLC profiles, the 1H NMR spectra, and the 31P NMR spectra of fraction 2 and those of the reference FMN (Fig. 3, B-G). As a result, the retention time of fraction 2 was equivalent to the reference FMN (Fig. 3, B and C), and 1H and 31P NMR spectra of fraction 2 were essentially the same as that of the reference FMN (Fig. 3, D-G). To elucidate the characteristics of the enzyme-bound FMN, we measured the 31P-NMR spectrum of the enzyme in the native state (Fig. 4A). Two resonances were observed, with chemical shifts similar to the FAD and FMN references. The line widths of the resonances were significantly larger than those of the FAD and FMN references, suggesting that the resonances are from FAD and FMN bound to the enzyme. The peak volume of the resonance from FMN was about half of that from FAD (Fig. 4A). This result shows that only about half of the enzyme purified by method B contains FMN. Preparation of the Enzyme without FMN (Enz-FMN(-) and that with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+))—To investigate of the function of FMN in the CPD repair reaction, we developed preparation methods for the enzyme with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)) and that without FMN (Enz-FMN(-). To prepare Enz-FMN(+), we added FMN to the purified enzyme and removed the excess FMN by dialysis. In the 31P NMR spectrum of the obtained enzyme, the peak volume ratio of the resonances from FAD and FMN was 1:1 (Fig. 4B). To prepare Enz-FMN(-), the purified enzyme was subjected to Blue Sepharose chromatography. Consequently, the resonance from FMN disappeared in 31P-NMR spectrum of the enzyme (Fig. 4C). Effect of FMN on the Affinity for CPD-containing DNA and the Photoreactivation Activity—To clarify the role of FMN in CPD repair, we compared the DNA affinity and the CPD repair activity of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-). In the assays, the enzymes were uniformly in the FADH. form, produced by the method developed in the present study. The affinity of the enzymes to CPD-containing double-stranded 28-mer DNA was determined by the surface plasmon resonance method. As a result, the dissociation constants of Enz-FMN(+) (9.2 × 10-9m-1) and Enz-FMN(-) (1.5 × 10-8m-1) were essentially identical, indicating that FMN does not affect the affinity of the enzyme for CPD-containing DNA. The repair activity of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) was determined by irradiating a complex of the enzyme and the single-stranded DNA with monochromatic light; we then analyzed the reaction mixture by RP-HPLC. We used the CPD-containing single-stranded DNA heptamer for the repair assay because photolyases repair both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA with equivalent efficiency (32Kim S.T. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8623-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and CPD-containing DNA and repaired DNA are difficult to separate by RP-HPLC in a long-chain or double-stranded form. Fig. 5A shows the light dose dependencies of the repair of CPD-containing DNA observed for Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-). Both Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) repaired CPD-containing DNA, whereas Enz-FMN(+) repaired the CPD with less light than Enz-FMN(-). To determine whether FMN increases the light absorption efficiency or enhances the dark reactions, we examined the CPD repair activity of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) with various wavelengths of the repairing light. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, although the activity of Enz-FMN(+) was about four times higher than that of Enz-FMN(-) with 450 nm light, the ratio was only about two times higher with 370 nm light. These results suggest that FMN increases the light absorption efficiency of the enzyme. NMR Analysis of the FMN Binding Mode—To clarify the role of FMN in CPD repair, we used NMR to study the FMN binding mode of the enzyme. We prepared Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) labeled with [α,ϵ-15N]tryptophan, and the 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured (Fig. 6A). The enzymes were uniformly in the FADH- form, to avoid the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement effect induced by FAD in the radical semiquinone form. Compared with the Enz-FMN(-) spectrum, the resonances from Trp-7 and Trp-49, which are in a pocket similar to the 8-HDF-binding site of A. nidulans CPD photolyase (Fig. 6B), had different chemical shifts in the Enz-FMN(+) spectrum, whereas the other resonances were not affected. In the present study, we developed a purification method for T. thermophilus CPD photolyase, which retains its second chromophore, and found that the purified enzyme contains both FAD and FMN as chromophores (Figs. 1 and 3). In previously reported studies in which the enzyme was purified by Blue Sepharose chromatography, the second chromophore of the enzyme was not observed (14Komori H. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Kato R. Hasegawa K. Hidaka Y. Kuramitsu S. Hoshino T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study revealed that the FMN is dissociated from the enzyme by Blue Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 4C), and thus it is likely that the FMN was dissociated from the enzyme during purification in the previously reported studies. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Enz-FMN(-) purified by method A (Fig. 7A) is different from the spectrum of the enzyme purified by method B (Fig. 7B). The former spectrum has additional peaks with chemical shifts around 8 ppm in the 1H dimension, as compared with the spectrum of the enzyme purified by method B, although both of the enzymes were purified to the same apparent homogeneity, as judged from SDS-PAGE, and lack a second chromophore. To remove the enzyme that lacks affinity to DNA, the enzyme purified by method A was further purified by chromatography on DNA-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex matrices. As a result, the NMR spectrum of the enzyme thus obtained was similar to that of the enzyme purified by method B (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that some of the enzyme purified by method A is denatured and unable to bind to DNA. Enz-FMN(+) was obtained successfully by the addition of FMN (Fig. 4B), suggesting that all of the purified enzyme retained the FMN binding activity. However, about half of the enzyme purified by method B lacked FMN. The FMN may partially dissociate from the enzyme during purification, or the FMN biosynthesis in E. coli may be insufficient because the enzyme was overexpressed in a heterologous system. Photolyases overexpressed in heterologous systems often contain less than stoichiometric amount of chromophores (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli in the present study, and thus we cannot completely rule out the possibility that T. thermophilus CPD photolyase does not contain FMN in vivo. However, the NADH- menaquinone oxidoreductases purified from T. thermophilus itself contain both FAD and FMN (33Yagi T. Hon-nami K. Ohnishi T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that T. thermophilus supplies FMN for the enzyme in vivo. We also cannot rule out the possibility that T. thermophilus CPD photolyase may contain a different second chromophore in vivo. However, it is unlikely that T. thermophilus CPD photolyase contains MTHF or 8-HDF, which were previously reported as second chromophores, because T. thermophilus CPD photolyase does not bind to MTHF (19Kato R. Hasegawa K. Hidaka Y. Kuramitsu S. Hoshino T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus lacks the cofG gene, which is essential for 8-HDF biosynthesis (34Graham D.E. Xu H.M. White R.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 180: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To clarify whether T. thermophilus CPD photolyase also contains FMN in vivo, the enzyme should be purified from T. thermophilus itself, or an action spectrum of the in vivo photoreactivation activity of T. thermophilus should be measured. The chemical shifts of the NMR resonances from the amide groups of Trp-7 and Trp-49 significantly changed upon FMN binding (Fig. 6). In the crystal structure of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase, these residues are in the proximity of a pocket similar to the 8-HDF-binding site of A. nidulans CPD photolyase. Chemical shifts are perturbed by the conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding, in addition to the direct ligand binding effects (35Takeda M. Terasawa H. Sakakura M. Yamaguchi Y. Kajiwara M. Kawashima H. Miyasaka M. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43550-43555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The conformations of the crystal structures of A. nidulans CPD photolyase in the 8-HDF bound form and in the free form are quite similar, and the conformational change upon 8-HDF binding is limited to the 8-HDF-binding site (13Kort R. Komori H. Adachi S. Miki K. Eker A.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the FMN is bound in the pocket in a similar manner as 8-HDF. One phosphate molecule resides in the pocket in the crystal structure, and thus the phosphate of FMN may be bound in the same manner. The enzyme with a stoichiometric amount of FMN (Enz-FMN(+)) has higher DNA repair activity than the enzyme without FMN (Enz-FMN(-), suggesting that FMN increases the CPD repair activity of the enzyme. The CPD repair activity ratio of Enz-FMN(+) and Enz-FMN(-) was dependent on the wavelength of the repairing light. In general photoreactions, the light absorption efficiencies depend on the wavelength, whereas the efficiencies of dark reactions are independent of the wavelength (30Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7715-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that FMN increases the light absorption efficiency of the enzyme. The FMN-binding site determined by NMR analysis is >20 Å away from the CPD-binding cavity (Fig. 6B), and thus direct electron transfer between FMN and CPD is not likely to occur. These results indicate that FMN acts as a highly efficient light harvester that absorbs light and transfers the energy to FAD as well as MTHF and 8-HDF do. The second chromophores of CPD photolyases (i.e. MTHF, 8-HDF, and FMN) have a role in absorbing solar light efficiently to achieve high enzyme activity in nature. In comparison with the absorption spectra of the second chromophores of CPD photolyases and the solar radiation spectrum of the sunlight at the earth surface, the spectra of FMN and 8-HDF overlap better than that of MTHF (5Eker A.P.M. Kooiman P. Hessels J.K.C. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8009-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 8-HDF is produced in only a few species, including methanogenic bacteria and cyanobacteria (36Walsh C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1986; 19: 216-221Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas FMN is widely distributed in many species. In CPD photolyases, the energy transfer from the second chromophores to FAD occurs via the dipole-dipole interaction of the chromophores, and the efficiencies and rate constants depend on several factors including the orientation and the distance between the chromophores (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Enz-FMN(+) and laser flash photolysis studies will allow us to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the energy transfer between FAD and FMN. We are grateful to Dr. S. Iwai for preparation of the CPD-containing DNA. We also thank Drs. T. Torizawa, M. Sakakura, and M. Osawa for stimulating advice."
https://openalex.org/W2132966709,"Tyrosine kinases of the Src family have been implicated in key biological processes. Here, we provide evidence that p56Lck, a lymphoid-specific Src kinase, is involved in the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Lck-deficient T cells were completely resistant to anticancer drugs. In contrast, apoptosis sensitivity to death receptors was not altered, indicating a specific interference of Lck with the mitochondrial pathway. Re-expression of Lck restored sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis and triggered mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Further analysis identified that the sensitization by Lck was independent of classical mediators of T-cell signaling, but essentially involved the Bcl-2 protein Bak. Expression of Bak was completely absent in Lck-deficient cells, while re-expression of Lck transcriptionally triggered Bak expression and conferred sensitivity to apoptosis, associated with a proapoptotic conformational change of Bak. Furthermore, in vitro the truncated fragment of Bid specifically activated Bak and cytochrome c release only from mitochondria of Lck-expressing cells. These results do not only demonstrate a sentinel role of Lck in drug resistance but also delineate a hitherto unknown pathway of Src kinases in regulation of Bcl-2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2045342622,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on iNOS activity. In a human intestinal epithelial cell line stimulated with cytokines, tyrosine phosphorylation of human iNOS protein was observed after 30 min exposure to pervanadate (PV), an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases. 4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a specific inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinases, abolished the PV-induced iNOS tyrosine phosphorylation. Cotransfection of Src with iNOS cDNA in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells resulted in a threefold (P<0.001) increase of iNOS protein levels and tyrosine phosphorylation of iNOS. In the presence of Src, 76% of wild-type (wt) iNOS was redistributed to detergent-insoluble domains and iNOS activity was decreased by 28% (P<0.05) despite increased iNOS protein levels. Analysis of iNOS tyrosine mutants revealed decreased Src-induced effects in Y151F iNOS mutant. Using a GST-fusion protein containing a domain encompassing Y151, we show that Y151 is a direct substrate for active Src in vitro. These findings indicate a role for iNOS tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of iNOS activity and the implication of Src tyrosine kinases in this pathway."

The tRNA 3′-processing endonuclease tRNase Z was only recently isolated, and its functional domains have not been identified so far. We performed an extensive mutational study to identify amino acids and regions involved in dimerization, tRNA binding, and catalytic activity. 29 deletion and point variants of the tRNase Z enzyme were generated. According to the results obtained, variants can be sorted into five different classes. The first class still had wild type activity in all three respects. Members of the second and third class still formed dimers and bound tRNAs but had reduced catalytic activity (class two) or no catalytic activity (class three). The fourth class still formed dimers but did not bind the tRNA and did not process precursors. Since this class still formed dimers, it seems that the amino acids mutated in these variants are important for RNA binding. The fifth class did not have any activity anymore. Several conserved amino acids could be mutated without or with little loss of activity. tRNA 3′ processing is one of the essential steps during tRNA maturation.

Several conserved amino acids could be mutated without or with little loss of activity. tRNA molecules are essential for protein synthesis, providing the amino acids during translation. They are not directly transcribed as functional molecules but as precursor RNAs, which require several processing steps to generate the functional tRNA molecule. Two of these processing steps are the removal of the additional 5′ and 3′ sequences of the tRNA. Although the removal of the additional 5′ sequence (the 5′ leader) is well understood (1Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), maturation of the tRNA 3′ end is not as well studied, although a correctly generated tRNA 3′ end is essential for the addition of the CCA triplet and thus for aminoacylation (2Mörl M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in Escherichia coli, tRNA 3′ maturation is a multistep process involving endo- as well as exonucleases, the final steps being performed by an exonuclease (3Deutscher M.P.

In contrast, Bacillus subtilis employs an endonuclease, called tRNase 6The abbreviation used is: tRNasetRNA 3′ endonuclease. 6The abbreviation used is: tRNasetRNA 3′ endonuclease.

Data base analyses showed that TRZ1 homologues are present in organisms from all three kingdoms, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya (Fig. 1). The tRNase Z family of proteins (also called Elac1/Elac2) can be divided into two subgroups: the short tRNase Z proteins (being 250–350 amino acids long), tRNase ZS enzymes, and the long tRNase Z proteins (with 700–950 amino acids), the tRNase ZL enzymes. Although the tRNase ZS proteins are present in all kingdoms, the tRNase ZL enzymes can only be found in eukarya. Both subgroups are part of the same protein family since the C-terminal part of the tRNase ZL proteins has high sequence similarity to the tRNase ZS enzymes. TRZ1 belongs to the family of metal-dependent β-lactamases (9Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M.

Other subgroups include the 3′ mRNA cleavage and adenylation specificity factors (13Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP to the corresponding nucleoside 5′ monophosphate.

The recently published crystal structure of the tRNase Z enzymes from B. subtilis (20de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Thermotoga maritima (21Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar) confirms that the tRNase Z enzymes belong to the family of metal-dependent β-lactamases since they contain the metallo-β-lactamase fold. Structural data also show that the enzyme is a homodimer with the monomers arranged head to head. The two monomers jointly form the active site cleft, which can readily accommodate single-stranded RNA. The exosite (an element outside the active site that participates in substrate binding) protrudes from the main protein body pointing toward the solvent. We are currently analyzing the functional modules of the eukaryotic tRNase Z enzyme, TRZ1, from A. thaliana. It is a short tRNase Z enzyme of 280 amino acids containing two potential leucine zippers and a histidine motif that is part of a metallo-β-lactamase motif containing 3 highly conserved histidine residues. To identify amino acids involved in dimerization, tRNA binding, and catalysis, 24 point mutations were made. In addition, several deletion variants were generated that have one of the potential motifs removed or carry a deletion from the C terminus. Our results show that several conserved amino acids can be mutated without or with little loss of tRNA processing activity. We identify 4 conserved amino acids to be required for dimerization and 1 amino acid and three regions important for tRNA binding. In addition, 6 amino acids were shown to be required for catalytic activity. Mutagenesis Strategy—The TRZ1 cDNA was excised from pET32a-nuz (5Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (using NcoI and XhoI) and cloned into pBlue KSII (digested with NcoI and XhoI) yielding pBlue-nuz. Inverse PCR was employed using pBlue-nuz as template to generate the TRZ1 variants. For deletion variants, the primers (primer sequences are available upon request) spared the region to be deleted. For point variants, one of the primers carried the mutation. PCR products were ligated to yield the pBlue-mutant clones. Depending on the nature of the amino acids to be mutated, the resulting amino acids were one of the hydrophobic amino acids, glycine, alanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, and serine. The pBlue-mutant clones were digested with NcoI and XhoI to release the cDNA and the mutated cDNA was subcloned into pET32a and pET29a (Novagen), respectively (both digested with NcoI and XhoI), yielding the pET32a-mutant clones and pET29a-mutant clones, respectively. A list of the variants obtained is shown in TABLE ONE. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutations.TABLE ONEtRNase Z variants An overview over the mutations made is shown.

Class 1 has wild type activity (80–100 % compared to wild type); class two has reduced catalytic activity (20–80 %); class three forms dimers, binds tRNA but has no processing activity (below 20 %); class four forms dimers but does not bind tRNA and has no catalytic activity; and class five does not form dimers, does not bind tRNA and has no activity. wt, wild type protein TRZ1.MutationxlinkEMSAivpClass–++100–Deletion 51–60o––4Deletion 149–164o––4Deletion 200–212o––4Deletion 270–280Multimers––5C25G++332C40G++991F51L (c)++951H54L (c)+o–3H56L (c)oo–3D58A (c)++–3H59L (c)Multimers––5G62V (c)++262P64A (c)++981P83L (c)Multimers––5H133L (c)+o–3Y140L (c)o+302P178A (c)++742G184V (c)o––4D185G (c)++73T186I (c)Multimers––5K203I (c)Multimers––5L205I (c)o+562E208A (c)++552T210I (c)o+851H226L (c)++–3H248L (c)Multimers––5R252G (c)++262Deletion of Arg-252++–3Y253S (c)++232 Open table in a new tab Overexpression of Recombinant Proteins—Expression of TRZ1 and TRZ1 variants was done as described previously (5Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with the following modification: the strain BL21(DE3)pLys was used for expression (Supplemental Fig. 1). Class 3 variants were separated from GroEL (22Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), which copurifies during S tag purification, using a MiniQ column, to confirm that loss of processing activity was not due to the presence of GroEL. The column was equilibrated using buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), a step gradient was applied using buffer B (buffer A with 1 m KCl), and tRNase Z was eluted with 120 mm KCl. The tRNase Z fraction was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A. All recombinant proteins (wild type and variants) were expressed at the same (low) amounts (100–120 μg of protein/l E. coli culture). Cross-linking Assay—For cross-linking assays with glutaraldehyde, 1 μg of protein was incubated with glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.05%) in double distilled water in 10 μl for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of 1 μl of 1 m lysine, the sample was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences). TRZ1 monomers and homodimers were detected using a primary rabbit antibody against TRZ1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—tRNA from wheat (tRNA isolated from wheat, Type V, Sigma) was 3′-end-labeled with [32P]pCp. 1 fmol of labeled tRNA was heated for 5 min at 80 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol) and allowed to cool down to room temperature. Recombinant TRZ1 (100 ng), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol were added (to a final concentration of 0.5 and 1 mm, respectively), and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Finally, 2 μl of 100% glycerol was added, and the reaction was loaded onto 8% native PAGE, which was run 60 min at 4 °C with 10 Vcm-1 in TG buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 58 mm glycine). Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Substrate Preparation—Precursor tRNATyr from Oenothera berteriana was transcribed from template pTyrII as described (23Kunzmann A. Brennicke A. Marchfelder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Vitro Processing Assays—All processing assays were carried out with 100 ng of recombinant protein in a reaction volume of 100 μl in nuz-IVP buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 30 min. To investigate the effect of imidazole upon the reaction, imidazole (1 and 10 mm final concentration) was added to the reaction mixture. Processing reactions were terminated by phenol and chloroform extractions. Nucleic acids were precipitated, and reaction products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Metal Dependence of the in Vitro Processing Reaction—To analyze which metal ions are required for the processing reaction, reactions were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 1 and 10 mm 1,10-phenantroline or for 1 h at 4°C with 10 mm EDTA. Chelators and chelatormetal complexes were subsequently removed by dialysis. In vitro processing reactions were carried out in metal-IVP buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and different metal ions (0.2 mm Mn2+, Fe2+, or Zn2+ according to Ref. 18Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; 2 mm Mg2+ according to Ref. 24Mayer M. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2096-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were added to analyze their effect on processing. No difference was observed whether the protein was preincubated with metal ions for 3 h at 24 °Cor whether the reaction was started (by the addition of the tRNA precursor) immediately after the addition of the metal ions. All buffers were treated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) to remove metal ions. Determination of Cleavage Efficiency—To determine the cleavage efficiencies, in vitro processing products of internally labeled precursors were separated by PAGE gels, which were subsequently dried. Gels were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 instrument (FujiFilm), and processing products were quantified using the software MacBAS (FujiFilm). All experiments were carried out in triplicates, and the resulting data were averaged. The cleavage efficiency of the wild type precursors was set to 100%. Gel filtration analyses suggested that TRZ1 might be active as homodimer. Thus we performed cross-linking assays with the recombinant TRZ1 and all variants to identify potential multimers. To investigate how tightly TRZ1 binds to the substrate and/or to the product, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with TRZ1 and all variants. As shown previously, the recombinant tRNase Z TRZ1 from A. thaliana cleaves tRNA precursors efficiently in vitro (5Schiffer S. Rösch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus as a test for catalytic activity, all variants were incubated with precursor tRNAs. Characteristics of the Wild Type Protein TRZ1—Cross-linking experiments with TRZ1 showed that the enzyme is indeed a homodimer (Fig. 2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses revealed that TRZ1 binds tightly to tRNA molecules but only weakly to the synthetic precursor tRNA (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The fact that TRZ1 did not bind well to the precursor tRNA under the conditions employed could be due to the fact that the precursor RNA used was made in vitro, and thus tRNA nucleotides were not modified and the precursor molecules might not fold correctly. Thus the following RNA binding studies were made with wheat tRNA. Incubation with precursor tRNATyr confirmed the catalytic activity of TRZ1 (Fig. 4).FIGURE 3tRNase Z binds to tRNAs. TRZ1 and variants were incubated with wheat tRNA to analyze whether the proteins bind to tRNA. The reaction was loaded onto a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently analyzed by autoradiography. The autoradiograph clearly shows that all four proteins bind to the tRNA (although H54L with lower efficiency). Lane wt, wild type protein TRZ1 incubated with tRNA; lanes C25G, C40G, and H54L, incubation of variants with tRNA; lane c, control without the addition of proteins.

TRZ1 (100% activity, see also TABLE ONE) and C40G (99% when compared with TRZ1) cleave the precursor tRNA efficiently, C25G shows only weak activity (33% when compared with TRZ1), and H54L does not cleave the precursor. DNA size markers are shown in nucleotides at the left. Precursor and products are shown schematically at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rationale for Mutant Selection—To identify important regions and amino acids of TRZ1 for dimerization, RNA binding, and catalysis, we initiated an extensive mutational study of TRZ1. Alignment of tRNase Z protein sequences from different organisms revealed conserved regions and amino acids that we chose for mutations (Fig. 1, TABLE ONE). Motif search software predicted three regions to be a histidine motif and two potential leucine zippers, respectively. Therefore we made three internal deletions: one, del51–60, which spans the histidine motif, and the other two, del149–164 and del200–212, which span the two potential leucine zippers (starting and ending with the 1st and 3rd leucine). In addition, we made a deletion from the C terminus (del270–280) to define a shorter tRNase Z enzyme. Point variants were generated of amino acids conserved between tRNase Z proteins (Fig. 1). Of particular interest were the amino acids from the histidine motif, which are conserved between the metal-dependent β-lactamases (His-54, His-56, Asp-58, and His-59) and the two histidines (His-133 and His-226) that might be involved in metal binding (11Aravind L. In Silico Biol. 1999; 1: 69-91PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to mutation of conserved amino acids, we also mutated 3 amino acids that are specific for TRZ1. Cys-25 and Cys-40 can only be found in the TRZ1 sequence and could be involved in dimer formation. Lys-203 was also unique for the TRZ1 sequence and was at a position where all other tRNase Z proteins have a conserved aspartic acid. All TRZ1 variants were expressed at the same levels as wild type TRZ1 in soluble form and purified with S protein-agarose. The E. coli protein GroEL (22Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) copurified with all recombinant proteins, but the wild type protein is not influenced by the presence of GroEL in any of the three activities tested (dimerization, tRNA binding, and processing). Thus only class 3 variants were separated from GroEL using anion exchange chromatography yielding pure proteins to confirm that the loss of processing activity in these variants was not due to the presence of GroEL. Indeed, activity tests with variants with and without GroEL gave the same results. Only in a few cases (Pro-83, Thr-186, del270–280) was it not possible to separate GroEL from the TRZ variants. Interestingly, these proteins were also not able to form dimers. GroEL does not interfere with dimerization since the other proteins dimerize also in the presence of GroEL. All variants were analyzed in respect to their ability to form dimers, to bind to tRNA, and to catalyze tRNA processing. During this study, structures of two bacterial tRNase Z enzymes have been solved. To discuss the results of this mutational study in a structural context, all mutations were mapped onto the B. subtilis structure based on the tRNase Z alignment (Fig. 5). Metal Ions Are Required for tRNA Processing Activity—It was shown previously that metal ions are required for tRNA processing activity of TRZ1 since preincubation with EDTA resulted in loss of activity (24Mayer M. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2096-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the metal required seems to be already bound by the enzyme since the addition of metal ions to the recombinant enzyme after expression in E. coli is not necessary. To elucidate which metal is required for activity, we preincubated the reaction with chelators 1,10-phenantroline and EDTA (Fig. 6). Preincubation with 10 mm 1,10-phenantroline and EDTA inhibited the reaction. Of several metal ions tested, only the addition of Mn2+ and Mg2+ rescued the activity, showing that these metal ions are required for the activity. Removal of Several Internal Amino Acids Leads to Inactivation of the Protein—Deletions of the histidine motif (del51–60) and the potential leucine zipper motifs (del149–164 and del200–212) (TABLE ONE and Supplemental Figs. 2–4) resulted in almost complete inactivation of the processing activity. Cross-linking experiments showed that these deletion variants barely form dimers anymore (TABLE ONE and Supplemental Fig. 2), that they were not able to bind to tRNAs anymore, and that they could not process precursor tRNAs. The C Terminus Is Essential for tRNA Binding and Processing Activity—Removal of 11 amino acids at the C terminus resulted in variant del270–280, which does not form dimers but does form multimers. In addition, this variant does not bind to tRNAs and does not have catalytic activity (TABLE ONE, Supplemental Figs. 2–4). Therefore the 11 amino acids from the C terminus are essential for tRNase Z activity. Amino Acids That Are Not Essential for Activity (Class One)—Variants C40G (Figs. 2, 3, 4), F51L, P64A, and T210I (Supplemental Figs. 2–4) showed the same activity or nearly the same activity (80–100%) as the wild type protein, suggesting that amino acids Cys-40, Phe-51, Pro-64, and Thr-210 are not essential for dimerization, tRNA binding, and catalysis. Amino acid Cys-40 was not conserved throughout the tRNase Z proteins and present only in TRZ1 from Arabidopsis; therefore it was not too surprising that mutation of that amino acid does not interfere with activity. However, Phe-51, Pro-64, and Thr-210 are conserved in at least four of the five protein sequences aligned in Fig. 1; thus it is interesting that these amino acids do not seem to be essential for processing activity. Variants That Have Only Reduced Catalytic Activity (20–80%) (Class Two)—Variants C25G (Figs. 2, 3, 4), G62V, Y140L, P178A, L205I, E208A, R252G, and Y253S (Supplemental Figs. 2–4) are still able to form dimers and still bind to tRNAs. However, they cleave tRNA precursors with reduced activity (20-80% wild type activity, TABLE ONE). Since these variants all still formed dimers and bind to tRNAs, the mutation seemed to affect only the catalytic activity. Variants That Do Not Have Catalytic Activity (Class Three)—Variants H54L (Figs. 2, 3, 4), H56L, D58A, H133L, D185G, H226L, and delR252 (Supplemental Figs. 2–4) still form dimers and bind to tRNA but are not able to process precursor tRNAs. This suggests a direct involvement of amino acids His-54, His-56, Asp-58, His-133, Asp-185, and His-226 in catalysis. The mutation of amino acid R252G only reduced the catalytic activity (down to 26%, see above); deletion of this amino acid, however, resulted in total loss of activity. In the case of ribozyme-mutants, which were not catalytically active anymore, the addition of imidazole rescued the catalytic activity (25Perrotta A.T. Shih I. Been M.D. Science. 1999; 286: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To test whether the addition of imidazole to the histidine mutants can rescue the catalytic activity, we added 1 and 10 mm imidazole to the processing reaction with mutants H54L, H56L, H133L, and H226L. The addition of imidazole did, however, not rescue the catalytic activity of these mutants (data not shown). Variants That Do Not Bind or Bind Only Weakly to tRNAs (Class Four)—Several variants (del51–60, del149–164, del200–212, and G184V) were still able to form dimers but did not bind to tRNAs anymore. They also did not process precursor tRNAs (Supplemental Figs. 2–4), suggesting that the mutated amino acid Gly-184 and that the deleted regions are important for RNA binding. Variants That Do Not Form Dimers (Class Five)—Variants H59L, P83L, T186I, K203I, H248L, and del270–280 did not form dimers anymore but seemed to aggregate since glutaraldehyde cross-linking results in bigger complexes, probably representing multimers. This suggested that the change of these amino acids somehow disturbs the whole protein structure, which leads to complete loss of activity. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that these variants cannot be separated from the E. coli chaperonin GroEL. Neither anion exchange chromatography nor gel filtration analysis (even with the addition of ATP and Mg2+) succeeded in separating these TRZ1 variants from GroEL. Although tRNA 3′ end processing is vital for tRNA maturation and subsequent aminoacylation, little is known at present about the functional domains of the tRNA 3′-processing enzyme tRNase Z. We performed an extensive mutational study of the tRNase Z from A. thaliana to identify amino acids and regions important for dimerization, tRNA binding, and catalysis. During this study, the structures of the bacterial tRNase Z enzymes from B. subtilis and T. maritima were solved (20de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). Our results obtained from the mutational study of the eukaryotic short tRNase Z enzyme presented here were thus compared with the bacterial structure. Characteristics of the tRNase Z Enzyme From A. thaliana—The TRZ1 protein is a homodimer, as are the homologous proteins from E. coli (18Vogel A."

Conventional kinesin is a plus-end-directed microtubule motor driving fast axonal transport of vesicles. Kinesin superfamily genes are represented in every eukaryotic genome examined, ranging in number from 6 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 45 in the human genome (1Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Members of this family are implicated in the transport of vesicles and organelles (3Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), as well as a variety of other microtubule-dependent processes, such as meiotic and mitotic chromosome movement (4Endow S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the maintenance and function of cilia and flagella (5Scholey J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 423-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and the regulation of microtubule dynamics, as in the case of mitotic centromere-associated kinesins (6Hunter A.W. Wordeman L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4379-4389PubMed Google Scholar). Kinesin is a dimer of mutually entwined α-helices forming a coiled-coil structure, flanked on both ends with N- and C-terminal globular domains (7Yang J.T. Laymon R.A. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The N terminus forms a globular motor domain of conserved sequence and structure, responsible for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis. Structures of the motor domain of rat conventional kinesin in both dimeric and monomeric forms containing ADP have been solved (8Sack S. Muller J. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Mandelkow E.M. Brady S.T.

Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but subtle structural differences between the two heads suggest different conformational states that may be related to motility. Conventional kinesin is a processive motor; for example, Drosophila kinesin dimer hydrolyzes ∼100 molecules of ATP before dissociating from the microtubule (10Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16508-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A.

Processivity is maintained by an alternating site ATPase pathway, in which one head of kinesin remains tightly associated with a microtubule while the other rapidly diffuses to the next binding site (13Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A.

Kinesins appear to achieve motility via a hand over hand mechanism, in which the two microtubule-binding heads of the protein alternate in relative position, advancing the molecule by 8 nm, the distance spanned by one αβ-tubulin dimer, with each step (16Schief W.R.

This model is supported by structural studies of fixed kinesin·microtubule complexes, x-ray crystallography of monomeric and dimeric kinesin, spectroscopic analysis of kinesin dynamics using fluorescent and spin-label probes, physical measurements of kinesin force-generation using laser-trapping, and kinetic analysis of kinesin ATPase activity (14Gilbert S.P.

Despite extensive analysis by a variety of techniques, there remains some uncertainty concerning the enzymatic pathway by which processive motility is achieved, and the nature and order of the conformational changes. Taking advantage of rapid, transient-state kinetic analysis of Drosophila conventional kinesin a detailed model of kinesin ATPase emerged, based upon measurements of the rate and order of each step in the pathway (10Hackney D.D.

Data on each of the kinesin·microtubule ATPases provide evidence for the central role of a “captive head” state in the ATPase cycle where a nucleotide-free head is attached strongly to the microtubule while the other head retains ADP and interacts only weakly with the microtubule. Evidence for the alternating site ATPase pathway relies upon the observed effect of ATP binding to the open site stimulating the release of ADP from the second site. It can be argued that all of the data in support of an alternating site ATPase stem from experiments that are dependent upon the captive head state. In contrast, based upon purely structural and equilibrium data, Rice et al. (31Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) proposed a truncated model in which the captive head state is bypassed during processive movement. One drawback of our kinetic studies using Drosophila kinesin is the absence of an x-ray crystal structure for this molecule. Given the potential utility of a crystal structure for structure-function relationship analysis, in which interactions between residues appearing in the crystal structure might be targeted for mutagenesis, it is unfortunate that one of the best-understood and most thoroughly characterized conventional kinesins has proved refractory to crystallization. Because Rattus norvegicus kinesin is the only source that has yielded the structure of the dimeric form of kinesin, we have turned our attention to rat kinesin for more detailed structure/function studies. In the present study, we examined the transient state kinetics of the ATPase hydrolysis cycle of a 406-residue N-terminal fragment of rat conventional kinesin. The results of this study establish the ATPase pathway for another kinesin whose structure is known and provide a standard against which the kinetics of rat kinesin mutants can be compared in the accompanying paper (32Auerbach S. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37061-37068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Materials—Escherichia coli BLR(DE3) was obtained from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). E. coli XL1-Blue was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). QIAprep Plasmid DNA extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits were purchased from Stratagene. Bio-Rex 70 resin (75- to 150-μm wet bead size) and Bio-Gel P-4 Gel (45- to 90-μm particle size) were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). DEAE-, Q-, and S-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography resins were from Amersham Biosciences. Taxol (paclitaxel) was purchased from Sigma Co. Radiolabeled ATP ([α-32P]ATP, >3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and N-methylisatoic anhydride and N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC) 2The abbreviations used are: MDCC, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxamide; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyethyleneimine-cellulose F TLC and silica gel 60 F254 plates (EM Science) were purchased from VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA). Other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Media and Buffers—The following media and buffers were used for the experiments described: Buffer A (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 μm ATP); Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 μm ATP); ATPase Buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol); and PM buffer (100 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.6, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA). The pH of each buffer was adjusted at the temperature at which it was to be used. Data Analysis—Thin-layer chromatography of radiolabeled nucleotide measured formation of ATPase hydrolysis product, which was quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Linear and nonlinear regressions to kinetic data were performed using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and GraFit (Erithacus Software, Horley, Surrey, UK). Graphs were prepared using GraFit. Simulations of kinetic data were performed using the kinetic simulation software KinTekSim (33Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 34Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) from KinTek Corp. (Austin, TX, www.kintek-corp.com). Construction of pKHC407A—The plasmid used in the expression and purification of an N-terminal fragment of rat conventional kinesin heavy chain was derived from pKHC406 (35Morfini G. Szebenyi G. Richards B. Brady S.T. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 23: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a gift from Scott Brady (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX). The C-terminal polyhistidine tag encoded in the plasmid was removed by substitution of the first non-kinesin codon in the open reading frame of the plasmid with a nonsense codon, using site-directed mutagenesis (36Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). Kinesin mutants were likewise generated using PCR-mediated codon substitution. Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). For removal of the polyhistidine tag, the complementary primers 5′-CACCTGTGGTTGACTAGCTTGCGGCCGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCGGCCGCAAGCTAGTCAACCACAGGTG-3 were used. The resulting plasmid, pKHC407A, expresses an N-terminal fragment of rat conventional kinesin terminating at asp407. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), was used with a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for polymerase chain reaction (37Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13472) Google Scholar). Temperature cycles were as recommended by the kit manufacturer: 95 °C (30 s), 55 °C (1 min), and 68 °C (6 min) for 16 cycles. Expression of Kinesin—The pKHC406 plasmid and its derivatives are based on the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible pET expression vector (38Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 39Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Colonies of transformed E. coli BLR(DE3) were grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB broth plus 1% dextrose, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. Induced cells were centrifuged and pellets were frozen at -80 °C. Purification of Kinesin—Kinesin preparations were kept on ice or at 4 °C. Cells from 4-liter-induced culture were resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A plus 95 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25 μg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was disrupted using a Branson Sonifier Model 450 for 4 bursts on ice, power setting 4, 20 s/burst. The lysate was then cleared by centrifuging (Beckman JA-25.50 rotor, 23,000 × g, 30 min), and loaded onto a 34-ml BioRex70 column (2 cm2 × 17 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A plus 95 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of the equilibrium buffer. Elution of protein was performed using a 4-column volume gradient spanning 95-485 mm NaCl, and 4-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and kinesin appeared as an abundant ∼45.5-kDa protein. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against 1 liter of Buffer B plus 95 mm NaCl. The dialyzed kinesin was loaded onto a 10-ml Q-Sepharose column (2 cm2 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. After a 3-column volume wash, kinesin was eluted with a 6-column volume gradient from 95 to 475 mm NaCl, and fractions were collected. Those fractions in which a ∼45.5-kDa protein was predominant were selected and pooled. Pooled fractions were dialyzed twice for 2 h apiece against 1 liter of Buffer A plus 40 mm NaCl. After dialysis, the preparation was loaded onto a 3-ml Q-Sepharose column (0.8 cm2× 3.75 cm), pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was done with a 3-column volume gradient from 40 to 240 mm NaCl. Those fractions containing the 45.5-kDa protein were dialyzed twice for 2 h apiece against ATPase buffer plus 0.1 μm ATP. Aliquots of purified protein were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Before use, thawed kinesin aliquots were centrifuged (Heraeus Biofuge, 15,000 × g, 10 min) to remove debris. Active kinesin concentration was determined by measuring the time-dependent dissociation of kinesin-bound ADP as described (41Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mammalian Brain Tubulin and Microtubule Preparation—Tubulin was extracted from bovine brain tissue by exploiting the temperature-dependent and reversible polymerization of the protein into microtubules (42Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 43Sloboda R.D. Dentler W.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and microtubule-associated proteins were then removed by DEAE-chromatography (44Borisy G.G. Olmsted J.B. Marcum J.M. Allen C. Fed. Proc. 1974; 33: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar, 45Omoto C.K. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Microtubules were stored at -80 °C as centrifuged pellets. On the day of each experiment, pellets were thawed and resuspended in PEM buffer plus 1 mm GTP to a concentration of 10-15 mg/ml and depolymerized on ice for 20 min. Taxol was added stepwise to concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 20 μm, with 10-min incubations at 34 °C subsequent to each addition. The solution was then diluted 10-fold with PEM buffer plus 10 μm Taxol to stabilize the microtubules, and further incubated at 34 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation (Beckman JA-25.50 rotor, 39,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the microtubule pellet was resuspended in ATPase buffer plus 20 μm Taxol. Microtubule concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar), and reported molar concentrations of microtubules refer to the concentrations of αβ-tubulin dimer (molecular mass of 110 kDa). Nucleotide Analogs—N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant) derivatives of ATP and ADP were synthesized as described previously (47Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 48Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric properties of the products were evaluated and conformed to published values. 2′(3′)·mantADP and 2′(3′)-mantATP are reported to have an A255/A356 ratio of ∼4.0, reflecting the optical densities of the N-methylanthraniloyl and adenine moieties (47Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Previous work showed the 2′-mant-3′-dATP and 3′-mant-2′-dATP gave results similar to the mixture of isomers (2′-mant-ATP and 3′-mant-ATP) (14Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); therefore, we only used the mixture in these studies. Phosphate Sensor—Phosphate release experiments measured the rate at which inorganic phosphate is released from kinesin, and relied on an engineered E. coli phosphate-binding protein (PBP-A179C) covalently coupled to a fluorescent dye MDCC (49Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 50Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The expression system for the protein component, consisting of the E. coli strain ANCC75 containing a pBR322-derived plasmid into which the modified phoS gene directing the production of PBP-A197C has been cloned, was obtained from M. Webb (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). PBP-A179C was expressed and purified as described (49Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Conjugation of the protein with MDCC, and subsequent purification of the phosphate sensor, was performed according to the method described by Brune et al. (49Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), with subsequent modifications (50Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The concentration of MDCC-PBP-A197C was determined spectrophotometrically, assuming an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 68,575 m-1 cm-1. MDCC-PBP-A197C was divided into small aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Steady-state ATPase Assays—The hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP by kinesin·microtubule complex was monitored at 35 °C by mixing labeled nucleotide with the enzyme, quenching the reaction after a predetermined time, separating the products on a TLC plate, and measuring the hydrolysis of the labeled nucleotide by standard radiation monitoring techniques as previously described (41Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Velocity data for a range of substrate concentrations were then plotted and fit by nonlinear regression to a hyperbolic model, kobs = kcat[ATP]/(Km-ATP + [ATP]) + C, to determine values of kcat and Km-ATP. Sedimentation Equilibrium Study—A Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge was used; it was fitted with an AnTi60 rotor and absorbance optics. Using three 6-channel charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces, nine kinesin concentrations could be evaluated simultaneously. Rotor speed was 13,000 rpm and run temperature was 24 °C. Equilibrium data were collected at 230 nm at a spacing of 0.003 cm with five averages in a step scan mode. Data sets were collected at 2-h intervals between 16 and 22 h after run initiation, and equilibrium was verified by comparing successive scans. Optical data were edited in Excel to extract data from individual channels and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fitting to a self-association scheme using NONLIN (51Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), obtained from the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. An estimate of 0.7350 cm·g-1 for the partial specific volume of the kinesin monomer was made based on amino acid sequence contribution, taking into account a contribution of -0.0030 cm·g-1 made by the bound ADP. Solvent density was determined volumetrically to be 1.0056 g·cm-1. The extinction coefficient ϵ at 230 nm, the wavelength monitored during the analytical ultracentrifugation experiment, of KHC407A, was determined at 31,260 m-1 cm-1, and this value was used to convert the apparent association constants determined by NONLIN from optical density units to those of molarity according to the relationship K2(m-1) = K2(abs-1) × (1.2ϵ/2), where 1.2 is the optical path length in centimeters of the rotor centerpiece. NONLIN was used to fit equilibrium optical profiles of the sample channels to a simple monomer-dimer association reaction, with no assumed nonideality. Rapid Quench Experiments—Transient-state kinetic analysis of kinesin ATPase in ATPase buffer was performed at 35 °C using a KinTek RQF-3 chemical quench flow instrument (KinTek Corp.). Reactions were quenched with 2 n HCl, and neutralized with 2 m Tris-3 m NaOH as described (24Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 1.5 μl of each quenched sample was examined by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography, developed with 0.6 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4. Stopped-flow Experiments—A KinTek Stopped-Flow apparatus (Model SF-2001, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) was used for stopped-flow experiments. Experiments were performed as previously described (14Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 52Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at 35 °C in ATPase buffer. Indicated reagent concentrations represent concentrations achieved after mixing. Phosphate release kinetics were measured in the stopped-flow instrument, using the fluorescent phosphate reporter MDCC-PBP-A197C (11Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 49Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 4 μm and including the “phosphate mop,” consisting of 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine and 0.01 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Excitation was at 425 nm, and fluorescence was measured using a 450 nm cutoff long-wave filter. Post mixing concentrations were 50 nm kinesin, 75 nm microtubules, and 500 μm ATP. Phosphate concentration was computed from the fluorescence based upon a standard curve. The time dependence of phosphate production was fitted to the burst equation [Pi] = A·exp(-kobst) + k2t + C, with kobs representing the rate of phosphate release under the conditions tested. The rate constants governing the binding of nucleotide to kinesin were estimated using mantADP and mantATP (15Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data were fit to a single exponential function, F = A·exp(-kobst) + C, where kobs is the rate constant governing nucleotide binding and k2 accounts for a slow, linear phase. Values of kobs were plotted against nucleotide concentration and fit to a hyperbolic model: kobs = kmax[mAD(T)P]/(Kd + [mAD(T)P]) + koff. In experiments measuring rates of dissociation of mantADP, excitation of the fluorophore was direct, at 360 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence accompanied dissociation of mantADP from the active-site as described previously (14Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Fluorescence traces were either fit to a double-exponential model of the form F = A1·exp(-k1t) + A2·exp(-k2t) + C, or else fit by simulated kinetic data. ATPase Pathway—The results presented in this report define the alternating site ATPase pathway shown in Fig. 1, which will be referenced to clarify the relationship between the data and this minimal model. Active-site Titration—Isolated kinesin contains Mg-ADP tightly bound to the enzyme active-site (41Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 53Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine the concentration of kinesin active-sites in each preparation, the protein was incubated with [α-32P]ADP, and then the concentration of the bound radiolabeled nucleotide was measured by quantifying the amount that was inaccessible to a regenerating system that converted all free ADP to ATP (41Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When phosphocreatine kinase, phosphocreatine, and cold ATP were added to a kinesin·[α-32P]ADP complex, all free [α-32P]ADP was rapidly converted to [α-32P]ATP while the remaining [α-32P]ADP was slowly lost from the kinesin active-site, observable by its slow conversion to [α-32P]ATP. The rate of disappearance of [α-32P]ADP equals the rate of dissociation of ADP from kinesin, and the amplitude extrapolated to t = 0 provides an estimate of the concentration of bound [α-32P]ADP at the start of the reaction. In Fig. 2, the results of an active-site determination experiment are shown."

To help elucidate the mechanisms involved in the block in proliferation in hormone-receptor positive cells, we have utilized a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ)-null mouse model. Loss of this transcription factor results in increased steroid and prolactin receptor expression concomitant with a 10-fold decrease in proliferation in response to pregnancy hormones. To determine the basis for this decrease, several markers of cell cycle progression were analyzed in wild type and C/EBPβ-null mammary epithelial cells (MECs). These studies indicated that cell cycle progression in C/EBPβ-null MECs is blocked at the G1/S transition. C/EBPβ-null mammary glands display substantially increased levels of the activated form of transforming growth factor β, a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation, as well as increased downstream Smad2 expression and signaling. While cyclin D1 levels were equivalent, cyclin E expression was markedly reduced in C/EBPβ-null as compared with wildtype MECs. In addition, increased p27 stability and retention in the nucleus and decreased levels of the cdc25a phosphatase contributed to a significant loss of cdk2 kinase activity.

Many cell cycle components have been shown to play a role in mammary gland development and have functional consequences when deleted in mice. A number of mice with germ line deletion of key cell cycle regulators do not undergo lobuloalveolar development in response to pregnancy, including those lacking cyclin D1, progesterone receptor, Id2, TGF-β1, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ) (7Ewan K.B.

Ductal elongation appears normal, and ducts fill the fat pad, but hormone-induced proliferation is impaired (3Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol.

Coincident with a 10-fold decrease in 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, a marker of S-phase, is a nearly 3-fold increase in the percent of ERα/PR/PrlR-positive mammary epithelial cells in C/EBPβ-null mice (3Seagroves T.N.

Despite decreased proliferation and altered steroid receptor and PrlR patterning, these two cell populations remained distinct.A key question in the mammary gland and breast cancer fields is what keeps steroid receptor-positive cells from dividing, and why is this proliferative block lost during breast cancer progression. The opposite effect is observed in C/EBPβ-null mammary glands, where increased numbers of ERα/PR-positive cells are accompanied by decreased proliferation. The precise role of C/EBPβ is not clear because of its many protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications (reviewed in Refs. 17Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Lamb J. Ramaswamy S. Ford H.L. Contreras B. Martinez R.V. Kittrell F.S. Zahnow C.A. Patterson N. Golub T.R. Ewen M.E. Cell. 2003; 114: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To better understand how loss of C/EBPβ affects hormone-induced mammary gland proliferation, we used wild type (WT) and C/EBPβ-null mammary tissue to analyze the expression and activity of G1/S cell cycle molecules after acute (2 days with estrogen and progesterone (E + P)) hormone treatment. These types of studies cannot be duplicated in cell culture, since almost all mammary cell lines lose expression of steroid receptors and cell-cell interactions in tissues and paracrine effects of growth factors cannot be accurately recapitulated in culture. We found that loss of C/EBPβ and the altered steroid receptor patterning results in up-regulation of active TGF-β1, decreased cyclin E expression, increased p27, decreased cdc25A expression, and loss of cdk2 kinase activity, all of which contribute to an insurmountable block in cell cycle progression in response to hormone stimulation. Thus, the C/EBPβ-null mouse model has provided valuable new insights into the mechanisms that prevent steroid receptor-positive cells from proliferating in response to pregnancy hormones and may help us understand how these mechanisms are abrogated in breast cancer progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Tissue Isolation—Mice with targeted germ line deletion of C/EBPβ have been previously described (19Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Cosantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Animal care and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine and were in accordance with the procedures detailed in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication 85-23). Twelve-week-old, ovary-intact, nulliparous mice were treated for 48 h with a single interscapular subcutaneous injection of 17β-estradiol benzoate (1 μg) and progesterone (1 mg) in 100 μl of sesame oil (all from Sigma). Two hours before sacrifice, animals were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (0.03 mg/g of body weight; Sigma). Mammary glands were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. After embedding in paraffin, tissues were sectioned (5-7 μm) onto Probe-On Plus charged slides (Fisher Scientific). Alternatively, mammary gland tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C before cryostat sectioning.Immunostaining—Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, then rehydrated through a graded ethanol series (100, 95, 80, and 70%). Immunohistochemical staining for cyclin D1 and p27 was performed without antigen retrieval and used 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton X-100 as blocking buffer. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using the remaining antibodies were performed after microwave antigen retrieval (20 min) in 10 mm sodium citrate. A 5% solution of bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Tween 20 was used as blocking buffer. Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at room temperature: cyclin D1 (Ab-4), p27 (Ab-2; Lab Vision NeoMarkers), biotinylated-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences), Ki67 (M19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-histone H3 (Ser10), phospho-histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA), phospho-p27 (Thr187), E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), phospho-Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) (Cell Signaling Technology), smooth muscle α-actin (A14; Sigma), keratin 5 (Covance, Richmond, CA). Immunoperoxidase staining was detected using the Vectastain Elite ABC and the diaminobenzidine substrate kits according to manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Nuclei were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. Immunofluorescence staining was detected using the appropriate Texas Red- or Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence for the activated form of TGF-β1 (chicken polyclonal; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was performed on frozen sections as described previously (7Ewan K.B. Shyamala G. Ravani S.A. Tang Y. Akhurst R. Wakefield L. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2081-2093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Image Capturing, Counting, and Statistical Analyses—An Olympus BX40 light microscope connected to a MagnaFire digital camera was used to capture images from immunohistochemical staining. At least 8-12 individual 40× fields per sample were captured for counting. The number of positively stained MEC nuclei was expressed as a percentage of the total number of luminal epithelial cells. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test (two-sample assuming unequal variance). Fluorescent images of phospho-p27 immunostaining were digitally captured using an Olympus BX50 Microscope connected to a Hamamatsu C5810 CCD device. Cells with nuclear fluorescent intensity above a certain threshold in Adobe Photoshop were counted as positive and expressed as a percentage of total MEC nuclei. Fluorescent images of polarity markers were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. A single Z section was digitally processed using Adobe Photoshop. Active TGF-β staining was processed as described previously (7Ewan K.B. Shyamala G. Ravani S.A. Tang Y. Akhurst R. Wakefield L. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2081-2093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To quantify the mean TGFβ intensity per cell, a small, circular mask was placed on the basal side of epithelial nuclei in the DAPI channel using SigmaScan Pro5 (Systat Software, Inc). The masks were then transposed onto the corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. A mean intensity under each mask was derived in each field. These values were normalized against background to calculate a mean intensity per cell for each treatment group. A two-tailed t test was used to determine significance.Tissue Extracts—Mammary glands were collected and pooled from mice treated for 2 days with E + P and used to enrich for MECs as described by Pullen and Streuli (20Pullan S. Streuli C.H. Harris A. Epithelial Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996: 97-121Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissues were minced and digested at 37 °C for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing collagenase (2 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) and hyaluronidase (100 units/ml; Sigma), followed by washes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from enriched MECs after lysis with RIPA buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from enriched MECs using the NE-PER kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The purity of these extracts was determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown) using antibodies against IRS-1 (cytoplasmic) and phospho-Smad2 Ser465/467 (nuclear). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay from Pierce.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using whole cell RIPA extracts from enriched MECs. Forty μg of extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of primary antibody and protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated immune complexes, whole MEC extracts, and nuclear and cytoplasmic MEC extracts were run on 12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tri-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000, including p27 (Ab-2; NeoMarkers), cyclin E (Upstate Biotechnology), p21 (SX118; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), cyclin D1 (C-20), cdk2 (M2 and D12), cdc25A (F-6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Smad 2, phospho-Smad 2 (Ser465/467), and p42/44 ERK (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted 1:10,000, and blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washes with TBST, chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal reagents from Pierce. cdk2 immunoprecipitation kinase assays were conducted as previously described using histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) as the substrate (21Contreras A. Hale T.K. Stenoien D.L. Rosen J.M. Mancini M.A. Herrera R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8626-8636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Western blot densitometry and kinase activity were determined using NIH Image v1.63 software. Each experimental sample was then normalized to the levels of loading control.RESULTSCell Cycle Progression Is Blocked in C/EBPβ-null Mammary Epithelial Cells—To mimic the burst of proliferation observed during early pregnancy, mice were treated acutely with E + P for 2 days, resulting in ∼15% of MECs entering S-phase in wild type mice (3Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated a 10-fold decrease in proliferation, as measured by BrdUrd incorporation, in mammary glands from C/EBPβ-null mice after 2 days of E + P treatment (3Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These results suggested a block in the G1/S phase transition. To better define the stage at which cell cycle progression was blocked, additional proliferation markers were analyzed. The expression of Ki67, phospho-histone H1 and phosphohistone H3 were examined by immunohistochemistry and compared with the 2-h BrdUrd pulse using mammary tissues from WT and C/EBPβ-null mice treated for 2 days with E + P (Fig. 1A). Using immunohistochemical staining, the percent of BrdUrd-positive cells showed a 10-fold decrease in C/EBPβ-null MECs, similar to previous results obtained by indirect immunofluorescence (3Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The nuclear Ki67 antigen is expressed in proliferating cells during all phases of the active cell cycle but absent in resting (G0) cells (22Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). In response to E + P, ∼27% of MECs from WT glands were positive for Ki67, compared with fewer than 6% of MECs from C/EBPβ-null glands (Fig. 1B). The linker histone H1 is phosphorylated during both the G1-S and G2-M transitions (23Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hormone treatment resulted in 24% of WT MECs expressing phospho-H1 versus 2% of C/EBPβ-null MECs positive for this marker (Fig. 1B). Histone H3, when phosphorylated on serine 10, is used as a marker of mitosis and chromatin condensation (24Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Similar to the other markers, a significant decrease in phospho-H3 staining was observed in C/EBPβ-null MECs as compared with WT (Fig. 1B). Since both S phase and mitotic markers were equivalently affected in C/EBPβ-null mammary cells, these results suggested that the null cells are either unable to enter the cell cycle from G0 or never progressed past the G1-S transition in response to hormone treatment.Increased Activation of TGF-β Correlates with Block in Proliferation but Does Not Alter Polarity—TGF-β1 was recently shown to co-localize with steroid hormone receptors (6Ewan K.B.

Pathol. 2005; 167: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 4Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Ewan K.B. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that there might be increased TGF-β expression in the C/EBPβ-null mammary gland correlating with the 2-3-fold increase the number of cells expressing ERα and PR (3Seagroves T.N. Lydon J.P. Hovey R.C. Vonderhaar B.K. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Grimm S.L. Rosen J.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which might correlate with the decrease in proliferation. Frozen mammary gland sections from mice treated for 2 days with E + P were stained with an antibody specific for the active form of TGF-β1, as opposed to the latent form of TGF-β1 associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Immunostaining revealed up-regulation of active TGF-β1 in C/EBPβ-null mammary epithelial cells, as evidenced by the higher intensity of the fluorescent signal (Fig. 2A). In addition to more active TGF-β1-positive cells, there was increased expression per cell in the C/EBPβ-null MECs as compared with WT (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Alterations in TGF-β signaling, but no difference in epithelial cell polarity, between WT and C/EBPβ-null mammary glands. A, immunofluorescent staining for the active form of TGF-β1 (green) was performed on frozen mammary gland sections from WT and C/EBPβ-null mice treated for 2 days with E + P. Images were captured by confocal microscopy, with DAPI-stained nuclei shown in blue. Representative images are shown from three animals per genotype. Quantitation of mean fluorescent intensity per cell is presented on the scatter plot, with the points representing individual animals, and the blue bar representing the mean of all samples. Error bars show the S.E., and a statistically significant difference was observed between WT and C/EBPβ-null mean values (p < 0.0001; indicated by the blue asterisk). B, 15 μg of MEC WCE from WT or C/EBPβ-null mammary glands (2 days with E + P) were loaded per lane and blotted using a phospho-Smad2 antibody. The blots were reprobed first with a Smad2 antibody and then with an ERK antibody as a loading control. Quantitation of relative densitometric intensity for Smad2 and phospho-Smad2, normalized to the loading control, is shown in the bar graph with error bars showing the S.E. C, immunofluroescence staining for phospho-ERM (green) and smooth muscle α-actin (red) was performed on paraffin-embedded mammary gland sections from WT and C/EBPβ-null mice (2 days with E + P), and images were captured by confocal microscopy. DAPI-stained nuclei are shown in blue. Ductal lumens (Lu) are indicated. Bar, 10 μm. D, immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin (red) and keratin 5 (green) was performed on paraffin-embedded mammary gland sections from WT and C/EBPβ-null mice (2 days with E + P), and images were captured by confocal microscopy. DAPI-stained nuclei are shown in blue. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A functional read-out for TGF-β activity is the phosphorylation state of the signaling molecule Smad2. Phosphorylation at Ser465 and Ser467 by TGF-β type I receptor allows Smad2 to dimerize, interact with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and affect the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes involved in entry into S phase (25Liu F. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1280-s1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed increased total levels of Smad2 in C/EBPβ-null as compared with WT MEC extracts (Fig. 2B), as well as higher levels of Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), which correlates with the increased active TGF-β staining (Fig. 2A). The increase in Smad2 levels may be a result of the increase in the number of ERα-positive cells in C/EBPβ-null mammary glands (15Grimm S.L. Rosen J.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas the higher level of Smad2 phosphorylation may reflect the increase in active TGF-β1 expression.Chronic TGF-β exposure often results in loss of epithelial cell polarity (5Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), which may account for the failure to respond to hormone-induced signals. Immunofluorescent staining for various polarity markers was performed and analyzed by confocal microscopy to see if a change in polarity had occurred in C/EBPβ-null mammary tissue. A polarity marker specific for the apical surface of epithelial cells is the phosphorylated form of ERM, a family of F-actin-binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 26Polesello C. Payre F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 294-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for phospho-ERM (green) showed a discontinuous pattern that lined the lumen of ducts from WT mice, whereas a more uniform expression pattern was observed in C/EBPβ-null ducts (Fig. 2C). This distinction is most noticeable in the higher magnification images. Despite the difference in expression pattern, the protein was localized correctly in both genotypes. Co-immunostaining for smooth muscle α-actin (red) was also performed with phospho-ERM to outline the myoepithelial cell layer surrounding the ducts (Fig. 2C). A calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, is a transmembrane component of the adherens junction and is essential for function and polarity of epithelial cells (27Daniel C.W. Strickland P. Friedmann Y. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In response to increased TGF-β signaling, expression of E-cadherin is often down-regulated to allow cell migration (reviewed in Ref. 28Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5408) Google Scholar). E-cadherin expression (red) can be seen at the lateral edges of the luminal epithelial cells in both WT and C/EBPβ-null ducts (Fig. 2D). The staining appeared to be more intense in the null sections but once again was appropriately localized in both genotypes. Co-immunostaining for keratin 5 (green) was performed with E-cadherin to identify the myoepithelial cells surrounding each duct (Fig. 2D). Thus, it appears that increased activation of TGF-β1 correlates with"

Arg is also found at this position in non-yeast nonmuscle actins. The substitution caused retarded growth on glucose and an inability to use glycerol as a sole carbon source. The mitochondria were clumped and had lost their DNA, the vacuole appeared hypervesiculated, and the actin cytoskeleton became somewhat depolarized. Introduction of the second muscle actin-specific substitution, S365A, rescued these defects. Suppression was also achieved by introducing the four acidic N-terminal residues of muscle actin in place of the two found in yeast actin. The H372R substitution results in an increase in polymerization-dependent fluorescence of Cys-374 pyrene-labeled actin. H372R actin polymerizes slightly faster than wild-type (WT) actin. Yeast actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) accelerates the polymerization of H372R actin to a much greater extent than WT actin. The two suppressors did not affect the rate of H372R actin polymerization in the absence of an Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, the S365A substitution dampened the rate of Arp2/3 complex-stimulated H372R actin polymerization, and the addition of the four acidic N-terminal residues caused this rate to decrease below that observed with WT actin in the presence of Arp2/3. Structural analysis of the mutations suggests the presence of stringent steric and ionic requirements for the bottom of actin subdomain 1 and also suggests that there is allosteric communication through subdomain 1 within the actin monomer between the N and C termini.

The actin C-terminal region, consisting of residues 364-375, is located in subdomain 1 on the opposite side of the protein from that of the N terminus and is believed to play an important role in the interaction of actin with different actin-binding proteins such as profilin (1Eads J.C.

The crystal structure of the filament shows that a direct interaction of the N and C termini is virtually impossible because of the intervening mass of the core of subdomain 1 (Fig. 1). The sequence of the C-terminal peptide is highly conserved throughout the actin family. The sequences for mammalian and avian muscle actins are identical and there are only two differences between yeast and higher eukaryotic actins, a substitution of His in yeast at residue 372 for Arg and a substitution of Ser at residue 365 for Arg just outside of the helix in this peptide. In the first case the His and the Arg carry at least a partial positive charge. Removal of the C-terminal three residues in yeast actin causes cell inviability, whereas removal of either or both of the first two residues, beginning with the C terminus, shows milder phenotypes including temperature sensitivity and increased cell size (5Johannes F.J. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The actin C-terminal dipeptide or tripeptide can be removed proteolytically with trypsin (6O'Donoghue S.I. Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the resulting actin will still polymerize in vitro. However, cleavage results in small increases in the critical concentration of the protein needed for polymerization, a decreased ability to activate myosin ATPase activity, and a large effect on the morphology of actin filaments. Filaments were more highly curved and irregular and exhibited decreased viscosity. Results were also observed on the protease susceptibility of regions of the actin near the nucleotide binding site and in alterations between the C-terminal peptide and the DNase I binding loop at the top of subdomain 2 (7Crosbie R.H. Miller C. Cheung P. Goodnight T. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1957-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data suggest the necessity of an intact C-terminal peptide for the attainment of stable filament formation. Alteration and modification of Cys-374 alone affect actin function. A C374S mutation in avian nonmuscle β-actin causes adverse changes in critical concentration, the ability to translocate in an in vitro motility assay, and the ability to interact with profilin (8Aspenstrom P. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Modification of Cys-374 with fluorescent reagents such as pyrene maleimide affects both the myosin S1 ATPase activity and sliding velocity using in vitro motility assays, although the specificity of the effect depends on the particular fluorescent probe utilized (7Crosbie R.H. Miller C. Cheung P. Goodnight T. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1957-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In x-ray crystal structures of G-actin, the C terminus points toward the interior of the protein in subdomain 1 (1Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K.

However, several pieces of evidence suggest that in the filament this peptide must be extremely flexible. Polymerization causes a substantial increase in fluorescence of such ligands attached to Cys-374, suggesting that it becomes buried within the filament interior. Additionally, Kim et al. (12Kim E. Wriggers W. Phillips M. Kokabi K. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cys-374 could be intermolecularly cross-linked to Cys residues introduced by mutation at residue 265 in a monomer located across the interstrand space in F-actin and at residue 41 in the DNase I loop of an adjacent monomer in the same helical strand. Such reactivity requires that the C-terminal helix move at least 10 Å without disrupting the filament. This result further suggests that this part of the protein plays a significant role in determining actin filament conformation. Despite the fact that yeast and muscle actins are 87% identical in amino acid sequence (13Rubenstein P.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), yeast cannot survive with mammalian muscle actin as the sole actin in the cell. Yeast is viable, however, with β-nonmuscle actin as the sole actin, although in this case the cells are extremely sick (14Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reason for the incompatibility between mammalian actins and yeast cell viability is not understood, and we reasoned that it might result from the inability of various yeast actin-binding proteins to interact appropriately with the higher eukaryotic actin. Alternatively, the incompatibility might derive from inherent differences between yeast and higher eukaryotic actins in filament morphology and filament dynamics (15Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Two structures associated with the actin cytoskeleton that might be affected by these differences are mitochondria and vacuoles. F-actin and the actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) 3The abbreviations used are:Arp2/3actin-related proteins 2 and 3CS1citrate synthase 1DAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole4Acfour acidic N-terminal amino acid residues of muscle actinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild-type complex localize to the sites of vacuole fusion, and actin remodeling has been implicated in vacuole docking prior to fusion as well as in the late stages of vacuole fusion and in the recruitment of 3-phosphoinostides to sites of vacuole fusion (16Eitzen G.

Actin plays a role in mitochondrial fusion and/or fission and also in the determination and maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (18Simon V.R. Karmon S.L. Pon L.A. Cell Motil.

Vacuoles bind to a type V myosin (Myo2p) using adapter proteins (Vac8p and Vac17p) and use Myo2p as a motor and actin cables as tracks for unidirectional movement from the mother cell to the bud (22Hill K.L. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Ishikawa K. Catlett N.L. Novak J.L. Tang F. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. J.

Nature. 2003; 422: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mitochondria move bidirectionally to the cellular poles (the bud tip and mother cell tip) where they become immobilized. Mitochondria, like vacuoles, use actin cables as tracks for anterograde movement from mother cells to buds (18Simon V.R. Karmon S.L. Pon L.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the force for anterograde mitochondrial movement is Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization and is not myosin-dependent (25Boldogh I.R. Yang H.C. Nowakowski W.D. Karmon S.L. Hays L.G.

Cell. 2004; 15: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The movement of mitochondria toward the opposite pole is driven by the retrograde flow of actin cables; that is, mitochondria bind to actin cables and use the motile cables as conveyor belts for retrograde movement toward the mother cell tip (19Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the interactions between a number of actin-binding proteins and actin involve subdomain 1, the His/Arg difference between yeast and higher eukaryotic actins at residue 372 might contribute to the incompatibility discussed above despite the ionic similarity between these two residues. Here, we use site-directed mutagenesis of yeast actin to assess the effects of these C-terminal differences on the behavior of actin itself and on the behavior of two organelles in yeast, mitochondria, and vacuoles. DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals. Affi-Gel 10 activated resin and Bio-Spin® 30 Tris columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the DNA primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Yeast cakes for the preparation of wild type actin were obtained locally. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade quality. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used to introduce mutations into the yeast actin coding sequence. The starting plasmid for mutagenesis was pRS314WN, a derivative of pRS314 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the WT yeast actin coding sequence and promoter region in addition to the TRP1 gene. Subsequent mutations were carried out on the mutagenic plasmids. In each case, the plasmid DNA was sequenced to verify the mutation(s). The mutant plasmids were transformed into a trp1, ura3-52 haploid cell in which the chromosomal ACT1 gene had been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with the LEU2 gene. Wild-type actin was expressed in these cells from another centromeric plasmid, pCENWT, containing the URA3 gene. Transformants were selected on tryptophan-deficient medium and then subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the WT actin gene. The mutant plasmids were rescued from the trp+, ura- cells and sequenced to verify that the mutations were still intact. Overnight cultures of WT and mutant strains were sub-cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) growth media to an OD600 of 0.1 and placed at 30 °C with agitation. The OD600 taken after 1 h of sub-culturing was considered to be the zero time point, and cell optical densities were monitored until reaching a plateau (usually at least 48 h). Growth curves were plotted as OD600 versus time. To determine the doubling times, early and mid-log phase time points were plotted as ln(OD600) versus time, and a linear regression line was fit to the data. The doubling time was then determined by the equation doubling time = 0.693/slope Mutant strains were tested for temperature sensitivity, hyperosmotic sensitivity, and mitochondrial defects in the following manner. Overnight cultures of cells were sub-cultured to an OD600 of ∼0.1 in YPD. Cultures were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.3 (∼3 × 106 cells/ml). Then, 3 μl of a 1×, 10×, 100×, and 1000× dilution were spotted on YPD plates placed at 24, 30, and 37 °C to test for temperature sensitivity. The same amount and dilutions were spotted on YPD plus 0.9 M NaCl agar at 30 °C to test for hyperosmolar sensitivity and on YPG complete medium containing 2% glycerol as a sole carbon source at 30 °C to test for mitochondrial defects. Plates were observed at 24, 48, and 72 h. Visualization of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were visualized in living cells using a fusion protein containing the mitochondrial signal sequence of citrate synthase 1 (CS1) fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CS1-GFP). CS1-GFP was expressed using a centromere-based plasmid under control of the endogenous citrate synthase promoter (28Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 277-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed using the lithium acetate method (29Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). CS1-GFP labeling of mitochondria was specific and had no detectable effect on mitochondrial morphology, respiration, or movement under our experimental conditions. Cells expressing CS1-GFP were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic, glucose-based, liquid media at 30 °C. Temperature-sensitive mutants were grown at 23 °C. Samples were mounted on microscope slides and visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described below. Actin Visualization—The actin cytoskeleton was visualized using rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen), a ligand that binds specifically to actin polymers (30Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Fixed cells were exposed for 10 min in the dark to rhodamine-phalloidin at a final concentration of 2.5 μm in a solution consisting of a 4:1 ratio of NS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.25 m sucrose, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) to methanol. Stained cells were mounted on microscope slides and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Light Microscopy—Images were collected with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a Plan-Apochromat 100×, 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens, and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Orca-100; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Illumination with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp was controlled with a shutter (Uniblitz D122, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Camera control and image enhancement were performed using OpenLab software (Improvision Inc., Coventry, UK). For analysis of mitochondrial morphology, 25 z-sections were obtained at 0.2-μm intervals through the entire cell. The z-sectioning for three-dimensional imaging was carried out using a piezoelectric focus motor mounted on the objective lens of the microscope (Polytech PI, Auburn, MA). Out-of-focus light was removed by deconvolution, and each series of deconvolved images was projected and rendered with Volocity software (Improvision Inc.). Yeast WT actin was purified in the calcium form by a DNase-I affinity chromatography/DEAE ion exchange chromatography protocol as described previously (31Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a modification that consisted of the use of 75 ml of 0.6 m NaCl to wash the DNase-I affinity column bound with yeast cellular proteins in order to eliminate the possible binding of cofilin to G-actin (32Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The quality of the G-actin preparation was analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. G-actin was stored in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C and used within 3 days. The actin concentration was determined by UV light absorbance at 290 nm using the extinction coefficient: ϵ = 25.6 cm-1·mm-1. Dithiothreitol-free actin, 40 μm, was labeled with 45 μm N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide as described previously (33Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The pyrene-labeled F-actin was collected by centrifugation and depolymerized by dialysis against G buffer. Extent of labeling was determined by UV light absorbance at 344 nm using the extinction coefficient for pyrene, ϵ = 22 mm-1·cm-1. Actin was polymerized by the addition to G-actin of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm respectively, and the increase in light scattering was followed as a function of time. To measure the critical concentration of actin polymerization, the net change in light scattering was measured as a function of increasing actin concentration. The critical concentration of actin was obtained by drawing a line through the points and determining its intersection on the x-axis. Actin polymerization was also assessed by the increase in fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 365 and 386 nm respectively. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a FluoroMax (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) fluorescence spectrometer with a thermostatted water bath attached to the cuvette chamber. Pyrene fluorescence emission spectra were obtained by exciting the sample at 365 nm and recording the fluorescence emission from 375 to 450 nm. Growth Characteristics and Staining of H372R—To assess the consequences of a non-yeast residue, Arg, at position 372, we first assessed the effect of the H372R substitution in vivo. The strain expressing H372R actin exhibited a 1.6× slower doubling time in complete liquid medium and reached a stationary phase at a cell density ∼40% of that achieved by WT cells (Fig. 2). On solid YPD medium the growth characteristics of the cell were much closer to those of a WT strain (Fig. 3). In addition, there was no significant change in growth on plates containing hyperosmolar conditions or at 37 °C (data not shown). Strikingly, however, yeast cells expressing H372R actin showed no growth on glycerol-based medium (Fig. 3). Because mitochondrial respiratory activity is required for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources like glycerol, this result indicates that the H372R substitution may cause a defect in mitochondrial function.FIGURE 3Comparison of growth of WT and mutant yeast strains on complete solid medium with either 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% glycerol (YPG) as the sole carbon source. The picture was taken 48 h after plating the cells. Growth was at 30 °C. Mutant notation was as described in Fig. 2. This composite figure was generated by removing lanes of data unrelated to the present work.

In wild type cells, mtDNA is resolved as punctate, DAPI-stained cytoplasmic structures. In contrast, in H372R cells, there was no detectable mtDNA (Fig. 4). Consistent with this observation, replacement of H372R actin with plasmid-borne wild type actin does not restore mitochondrial respiratory activity (data not shown). Thus, the irreversible loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity observed in H372R cells most likely stems from the elimination of mtDNA. Finally, we visualized mitochondria in fixed cells using a fusion protein consisting of the mitochondrial targeting signal sequence of CS1 fused to GFP (CS1-GFP) (19Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The cells were counter-stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to allow for comparison of the actin deposition pattern with the mitochondria (Fig. 5A). In wild type cells, F-actin localizes to two major structures, actin patches and actin cables. Actin patches are endosomes that are invested with F-actin and enriched in the bud (34Kaksonen M. Sun Y. Drubin D.G. Cell. 2003; 115: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Actin cables are bundles of F-actin that align along the mother bud axis. In the same cells, mitochondria are long tubular structures that are dispersed through the cell and align roughly along the mother bud axis, accumulate at the poles of the cell (the bud tip and mother cell tip), and tend to co-localize with actin cables. Yeast cells expressing H372R actin exhibit severe defects in mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). Whereas mitochondria is tubular in yeast expressing the H372R mutant, >90% of the cells contain abnormally aggregated mitochondrial structures. This aggregation appears to be linked to actin disorganization. We also observed defects in the organization of actin cytoskeleton, i.e. ∼50% of the cells analyzed show depolarized actin patches and cables. Vacuole Defects—To determine whether the effects of the H372R mutation extended beyond mitochondria, we also examined the effect of the mutation on vacuoles, another actin-dependent organelle. Staining with the vacuole-specific dye FM 4-64 revealed that the vacuole in the mutant cells was hypervesiculated as opposed to the WT cells in which generally 2-3 vacuole lobes were observed per cell (Fig. 6). Furthermore, in the mutant cells in which the bud was less than one-third the diameter of the mother cell, no vacuolar structures were seen in 44 of 87 cells whereas in WT cells this number was 2 of 60 cells. Thus, the mutation also caused a mild inheritance defect. Intragenic Suppressors of the H372R Mutation—As part of other research efforts in the laboratory, we introduced two additional mutations in H372R actin. One of these second site mutations is S365A, a second muscle-specific substitution in the C terminus. The other is replacement of the two N-terminal acidic amino acids with four acidic residues (4Ac) found in the N terminus of striated muscle actin. The positions of these second mutations relative to H372R are depicted in Fig. 1. Figs. 4, 5, 6 show that in both cases the introduction of the second mutation reverted both the mitochondrial and the vacuolar defects caused by the H372R mutation as judged by growth on glycerol and the staining of mtDNA, mitochondria, and vacuoles. In Vitro Properties of Mutant Yeast Actins—Actin polymerization is often measured by assessing the polymerization-dependent increase in fluorescence of Cys-374 pyrene-labeled actin. However, the emission spectrum in Fig. 7 demonstrates that the fluorescence increase caused by actin polymerization is substantially higher for H372R, S365A/H372R, and 4Ac/H372R actins than that of labeled WT actin, although the extent of polymerization of all the actins, as measured by light scattering (Fig. 8A), is about the same in each case. Because the Arg substitution for His-372 is a feature shared by these three mutants, it is possible that the residue at this position governs the environment in the monomer/monomer interface between neighboring actins in the filament, which would affect pyrene fluorescence. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined a mutant that only contains the S365A substitution. The cells containing S365A actin have no aberrant phenotype, and the mutant actin polymerizes slightly faster than WT actin (data not shown). However, pyrene-labeled S365A actin shows an emission spectrum identical to that of WT actin, consistent with the hypothesis. This experiment also provides a molecular basis for the observation that polymerization of pyrene-labeled yeast actin produces a much lower increase than does polymerization of almost any other actin that generally contains an arginine at position 372.FIGURE 8Polymerization of WT and mutant actins in the presence and absence of yeast Arp2/3. Panel A, polymerization of 5 μm actin was initiated by the addition of salts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel B, the polymerization of 1 μm yeast actin in the presence of a 25 nm yeast Arp2/3 complex following the addition of salt to induce polymerization.

Previous studies suggest that Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation are coupled to the initiation of DNA replication, but the precise timing and molecular mechanism of Xic1 proteolysis has not been determined. Here we demonstrate that Xic1 proteolysis is temporally restricted to late replication initiation following the requirements for DNA polymerase α-primase, replication factor C, and PCNA. Our studies also indicate that Xic1 degradation is absolutely dependent upon the binding of Xic1 to PCNA in both Xenopus egg and gastrulation stage extracts. Additionally, extracts depleted of PCNA do not support Xic1 proteolysis. Importantly, while the addition of recombinant wild-type PCNA alone restores Xic1 degradation, the addition of a PCNA mutant defective for trimer formation does not restore Xic1 proteolysis in PCNA-depleted extracts, suggesting Xic1 proteolysis requires both PCNA binding to Xic1 and the ability of PCNA to be loaded onto primed DNA by replication factor C.

All Cip/Kip-type CDK inhibitors contain CDK-binding domains within their amino termini, while p21Cip1 and p57Kip2 also contain PCNA-binding domains within their carboxyl-terminal residues (52Johnson D.G.

Expression of a non-degradable p27Kip1 mutant causes mammalian cells to arrest in G1, indicating that the proteolysis of p27Kip1 is a prerequisite for the entry into S phase (62Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, CDK inhibitors are targeted for proteolysis at a point before the onset of DNA replication, but it is unclear when this turnover occurs in relation to the specific molecular events of DNA replication initiation. Studying the precise timing and mechanism of CDK inhibitor proteolysis can aid in understanding the role of CDKs and CDK inhibitors in regulating the start of processive DNA replication. In Xenopus, two CDK inhibitors have been identified that share sequence and functional similarity with both p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. Xenopus inhibitor of CDK (p27Xic1 or Xic1) and kinase inhibitor from Xenopus (p28Kix1 or Kix1) share ∼90% amino acid sequence identity with each other, preferentially inhibit the activity of CDK2-cyclins E and/or A, and bind all CDK-cyclins and PCNA (69Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70Shou W. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xic1 and Kix1 have been shown to inhibit nuclear DNA synthesis in egg extracts through their binding to CDK2-cyclins (69Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70Shou W. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while Xic1 has also been shown to inhibit the replication of single-stranded DNA through its binding to PCNA (69Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that in Xenopus interphase egg extracts, Xic1 is targeted for nuclei-dependent ubiquitination and degradation in a manner that is independent of CDK2-cyclin binding and phosphorylation at CDK consensus sites (71You Z. Harvey K. Kong L. Newport J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 72Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W.

Recently, two additional CDK inhibitors have been identified in Xenopus, p16Xic2 and p17Xic3, and these CDK inhibitors may be orthologs of the mammalian inhibitors, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, respectively (75Daniels M. Dhokia V. Richard-Parpaillon L. Ohnuma S. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 342: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cell-free interphase egg extract from Xenopus can recapitulate the synchronous temporal events of DNA replication initiation and elongation and can support the proteolysis of Xenopus CDK inhibitors (72Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 76Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Using this model extract system, past studies suggest that Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation are coupled to the initiation of DNA replication, but the molecular mechanism of Xic1 proteolysis has not been determined. Our studies indicate that Xic1 is degraded during late replication initiation following DNA unwinding, RFC, and PCNA function. Importantly, we demonstrate that the ubiquitination and degradation of Xic1 is critically dependent upon the binding of Xic1 to PCNA and the ability of PCNA to be loaded onto primed DNA by RFC. Taken together, our findings suggest that Xic1 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation when recruited to a site of initiation by PCNA, thereby coupling the proteolysis of Xic1 to DNA polymerase switching. Preparation of Xenopus Interphase Egg Extracts, Embryonic Extracts, Xenopus Demembranated Sperm Chromatin, M13 Single-stranded DNA, and Methyl Ubiquitin—Xenopus egg interphase extract (low speed supernatant or LSS) and demembranated sperm chromatin were prepared as described previously (72Yew P.R.

The membrane-free high speed supernatant (HSS) was prepared from fresh LSS by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C using a RP55S rotor and a Sorvall RC M120 centrifuge. The clear yellowish supernatant was collected and then re-centrifuged for 25 min as above. The cleared HSS was supplemented with glycerol to 4% and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Degradation and replication assays were performed in the HSS either neat or diluted with XB (100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7) to a final protein concentration of ∼15 mg/ml. Embryonic extracts were generated from stage 11-12 embryos as described for the LSS with the exception that the whitish layer containing nuclei, and the cytosolic clear layer were collected and pooled. Embryonic extracts were supplemented with cycloheximide immediately before use and used at a nuclei concentration of ∼19,000 nuclei/μl for degradation assays. M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (New England Biolabs) was amplified in XL1-Blue (Stratagene) as described previously (79Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The purified single-stranded M13 DNA was a mixture of both circular and linear species. Ubiquitin (Sigma) was methylated as described previously (81Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and used at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. DNA Constructs, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and DNA Sequencing— Xic1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis using pCS2+/Xic1-WT (72Yew P.R. Kirschner M.W.

For the generation of GST-Xic1-(161-190), PCR primers 5′-TCCCCCGGGAACATCTACACAGCGCAGAAAGAG and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAATCAGGCTTGGCACTCAGTATCT were used, and the PCR product was cloned into the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pCS2+/GST and pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). Xic1-WT was subcloned from the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCS2+ into pGEX2T. Xic1-(161-210) was subcloned from pCS2+/GST-Xic1-(161-210) as a blunt (filled-in XbaI)-BamHI fragment into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX2T. Xenopus PCNA (XPCNA) was PCR-cloned from a stage 12 Xenopus embryonic cDNA library (Clontech) into the BamHI and StuI sites of pCS2+ using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGTTTGAGGCTCGCTTGGTGCA and 5′-GAAGGCCTTAAGAAGCTTCTTCATCTTCAATCT. Point mutations in the Xic1 and XPCNA genes were generated using pCS2+/Xic1 or pCS2+/XPCNA plasmids, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the following primers: Xic1-I174A, 5′-GAGATCACCACTCCCGCCACCGATTATTTCCCT and 5′-AGGGAAATAATCGGTGGCGGGAGTGGTGATCTC; XPCNA-Y114A, 5′-CAAGAGAAAGTTTCAGACGCTGAAATGAAGCTGATGG and 5′-CCATCAGCTTCATTTCAGCGTCTGAAACTTTCTCTTG. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Amplicycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For bacterial expression, XPCNA was subcloned as a BamHI and StuI fragment from pCS2+/XPCNA into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pQE30 (Qiagen). XPCNA was also subcloned from pCS2+/XPCNA as a BamHI and XhoI fragment into pET28a (Novogen). The construct, pCS2+/Xic1-6A, was kindly provided by P. K. Jackson (73Furstenthal L. Swanson C.

In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Wild-type and mutant Xic1 were in vitro transcribed and translated from the SP6 promoter in pCS2+ using [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—GST-Xic1 fusion proteins were expressed in HB101 (for GST pull-down assays) or in BL21(pLysS)DE3 (for depletion studies). XPCNA cloned into pQE30 was expressed in M15 for antibody production, while XPCNA cloned into pET28a was expressed in BL21(pLysS)DE3 for rescue assays. GST- and His6-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen)-Sepharose as described by the manufacturers. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed into XB and concentrated before use. Inhibitors and Antibodies—Roscovitine (A. G. Scientific Inc.) and actinomycin D (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO at 50 mm and 10 mg/ml, respectively, and stored at -80 °C. Aphidicolin (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at 5 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. SJK132 hybridoma cells obtained from the ATCC were cultured, and hybridoma supernatant containing monoclonal antibody SJK132 against DNA polymerase α was purified using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).

Purified rabbit IgG against human RFC-p145 (Chemicon) was precipitated in 50% ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Monoclonal antibody against human PCNA was purchased (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit antibody generated against Xenopus PCNA (Covance) was affinity-purified using recombinant His6-XPCNA coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to hRPA-p70 (NeoMarkers), control mouse IgG, and rabbit IgG (Sigma) were purchased. Xic1-specific rabbit antibody was generated against Xic1 fused to maltose-binding protein (Covance) and affinity-purified against GST-Xic1. Degradation, DNA Replication, and Nuclei or Chromatin Spin Down Assays—Degradation, DNA replication, and nuclei or chromatin spin down assays were conducted as described previously with the following noted exceptions (74Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled Xic1 was added to a final concentration of ∼15 nm in degradation assays. For nuclei or chromatin spin down assays, the timing of Xic1 ubiquitination and PCNA chromatin association were performed in the absence of methyl ubiquitin. Additionally, demembranated sperm chromatin and [35S]methionine-labeled GST-Xic1 were added simultaneously. Centrifugations were performed at 3000 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C using the BIOshield rotor 75006435 and Sorvall Legend RT centrifuge. The percentage of DNA replication was normalized to 100% of the control sample. Quantitation of chromatin-bound Xic1 or PCNA was determined as follows. By quantitative immunoblot analysis, the concentration of in vitro translated Xic1 was determined to be 296 nm in programmed reticulocyte lysate and a final concentration of 15 nm in the supplemented egg extract which contains 2 nm of endogendous Xic1 (determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis; Ref. 70Shou W. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 457-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of endogenous PCNA in egg extract was determined to be 1 μm by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Amounts of total and chromatin-bound polyubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated Xic1 were determined by phosphorimager and quantitative immunoblot analysis. Amounts of total and chromatin-bound PCNA were determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Experiments were generally conducted at least three or more times with the results indicating the same trend but with absolute values potentially varying between 5 and 10% due to extract to extract or experimental variations. GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins (5 μg) were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated in 5-10 μl of egg extract for 1 h at 23-24 °C. The beads were washed extensively with NETN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Depletion and Rescuing—GST-Xic1-(161-190) was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B to a final concentration of 80 μm and then incubated in the egg extract for 1 h at 4 °C. The depleted extracts were then separated from the beads by centrifugation at 4 °C. Control depletions were performed using GST coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The depleted extracts were rescued with XB buffer or bacterially expressed and purified wild-type or Y114A mutant His6-T7-XPCNA.

https://openalex.org/W2059238555,"E2F transcription factors regulate proliferation, differentiation, DNA repair and apoptosis. Tight E2F regulation is crucial for epidermal formation and regeneration. However, virtually nothing is known about the molecular events modulating E2F during epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. Elucidation of these events is essential to understand epidermal morphogenesis, transformation and repair. Here we show that, in differentiating keratinocytes, Ca(2+)-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation downregulates E2F1 protein levels. Further, we have identified PKC delta and eta as those isoforms specifically involved in induction of E2F1 proteasomal degradation. We also demonstrate that E2F1 downregulation by novel PKC isozymes requires activation of p38beta mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This is the first example of regulation in the E2F transcription factor family by activation of PKC and MAPK in the context of biologically significant differentiation stimuli in epithelia."

It is involved in transcription of numerous genes by recruiting transcriptional factors to the promoters of target genes. In this study, we found in vivo and in vitro that Hsp90α was recruited to the GC-rich region of the 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter through interaction with Sp1 in A431 cells by employing DNA affinity immunoprecipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. When Hsp90α was inhibited by geldanamycin (GA, a specific inhibitor of the Hsp90 family) or by siRNA of Hsp90α (to block its activity or to knockdown protein levels), respectively, luciferase activity (driven by the 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter) and both mRNA and protein levels of 12(S)-lipoxygenase were reduced significantly in cells. In addition, the effect of GA was abolished when the Sp1 binding sites of 12(S)-lipoxygenase were mutated in A431 cells. Interestingly, binding of Sp1 to the 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter was also decreased upon GA treatment in cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that Sp1 interacts with Hsp90α to recruit it to the promoter of 12(S)-lipoxygenase and then to regulate gene transcription by modulating the binding ability of Sp1 to promoters.

Sp1 is one of the first transcription factors purified and cloned from mammalian cells (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

It can recognize and specifically bind to GC-rich sites within the simian virus 40 promoter via three Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs localized at its C-terminal region to regulate the transcription of the target genes (3Bieker J.J.

In addition to the zinc finger domain of the C-terminal region, the N-terminal regions of the Sp1 are much more variable and contain transcriptional activation or repression domains (5Muramatsu T.

Yoshida S. Neuropeptides. 1990; 16: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sp1 is generally considered as a factor that primarily determines the core activity of the promoter by direct interaction with other factors of the basal transcriptional machinery and by cooperation with several transcriptional activators such as CRSP, p300/CBP, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), vitamin D3 receptor, and TAFII130 (7Taatjes D.J.

Recent studies reveal that both DNA binding ability and transactivational activity of Sp1 may be influenced by the post-translational modification of Sp1 such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and acetylation (13Bouwman P.

Previous studies indicate that Sp1 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II, which has been reported to repress Sp1 activity, and by DNA-dependent protein kinase and CDKII, to positively regulate the transactivity and DNA binding affinity of Sp1 (15Jackson S.

In addition, glycosylation of Sp1 was found to regulate the proteasome-dependent degradation, and it is acetylated to regulate the DNA binding affinity or transactivation (19Brasse-Lagnel C.

Therefore, post-translational modification on Sp1, because of interaction with other factors, may play an important role in the regulation of Sp1 activity. Hsp90, a constituent molecular chaperone, is an abundant protein, comprising 2% of total cellular proteins under non-stress conditions. It is essential for numerous cellular proteins that regulate signal transduction such as transcription factors, protein kinases, and nitric-oxide synthase, and involved in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (25Young J.C.

Unlike Hsp70, Hsp90 does not act generally in nascent protein folding, and instead, binds to the client proteins to stabilize the folding of proteins (30Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 31Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Hsp90 reveals that the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 binds ATP, which is consistent with the observation that ATP hydrolysis is required for conformational changes involved in refolding protein substrates or client proteins of Hsp90.

It catalyzes the transformation of arachidonic acid into 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, followed by conversion to 12(S)-HETE. 12(S)-HETE plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of some epidermal and epithelial inflammation. A markedly elevated 12(S)-HETE level was found in psoriatic plaque, whereas the level of prostaglandins E2 and F2α was only minimally elevated (41Hammarstrom S. Hamberg M. Samuelesson B. Duell E.A.

Therefore, high levels of 12(S)-HETE may contribute to the inflammatory changes and the abnormal epidermal hyperproliferation in the development of a psoriatic plaque. In terms of promoter activity, the two simian virus 40 promoter factor 1 (Sp1) binding sites residing at -158 to -150 bp and -123 to -114 bp were found to be required for the transcription of the 12(S)-lipoxygenase (43Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, Sp1 recruited to the promoter of 12(S)-lipoxygenase is responsible for its basal transcription. Upon induction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), c-Jun can be recruited to the promoter through Sp1 to regulate transcription of 12(S)-lipoxygenase (43Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Chen B.K. Chang W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10400-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we first found that Sp1 could recruit Hsp90α to the GC-rich region of 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter in A431 cells. Interestingly, a specific inhibition of Hsp90 by GA blocked Sp1 activity and siRNA of Hsp90α resulted in knockdown of the Hsp90 level, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of 12(S)-lipoxygenase in A431 cells. Furthermore, the DNA binding affinity of Sp1 was inhibited in the presence of GA. Materials—Polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 and Hsp90 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against 12(S)-lipoxygenase were purchased from Oxford Medical Research Inc (Oxford, MI). Monoclonal antibodies against acetyl-H3, tubulin α, and TFIID (TBP) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). GA was purchased from Sigma. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were obtained from MD Bio, Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan). The luciferase assay system was from Promega. Luciferase plasmid pXP-1 was a gift from Dr. T. Sakai of Kyoto Prefecture University of Medicine. TRIzol RNA extraction kit, SuperScript™II, Lipofectamine 2000, RNase inhibitor, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Opti-MEM medium were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The plasmids, pSM2 and pSM2-shHsp90 were purchased from Gene-Discovery Inc (Taipei, Taiwan). Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). All other chemical reagents used were of the highest purity obtainable. Cell Culture—Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium under 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The 90% confluent cells were treated with 1 μm GA, unless otherwise stated. AmphoPack-293 cells purchased from BD Biosciences were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium under 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The 60% confluent cells were transfected with pSM2 and pSM2-shHsp90 plasmids to package the retrovirus viral particles containing the shHsp90. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped in 10 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were collected by centrifuging at 1200 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After staying on ice for 10 min, samples were vortexed for 10 s and sucked back and forth six times using 25-gauge needles. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and put on ice for 20 min. Finally, nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove the pellet and stored at -80 °C until use. Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a transfer apparatus according to the manufacturer's protocols (Bio-Rad). After incubation with 3% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 60 min, the membrane was washed once with TBST and incubated with antibodies against Sp1 (1:1000), Hsp90 (1:2000), 12(S)-lipoxygenase (1:500), acetyl-lysine (1:1000), tubulin α (1:3000), or actin (1:5000) at room temperature for 12 h. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min and incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies for 120 min. Blots were washed with TBST three times and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunoprecipitation—Cell nuclear extracts were prepared, and the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), and an equal amount of protein was used in each experiment. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove the pellets. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and incubated with either anti-Hsp90 or anti-Sp1 antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 for 12 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated pellets were subsequently incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose, washed five times with lysis buffer, and separated on an SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were processed for immunoblot analysis. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—A431 cells (2.5 × 105) were seeded on 3.5-cm dishes and reached 40-50% confluent on the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmids by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction with a slight modification. For use in transfection, 1 μg of pXP-1 or pXLO7-1 luciferase plasmids was combined with 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium without serum, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were transfected by changing the medium with 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing the plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000, and then incubating at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. After change of Opti-MEM medium to 2 ml of fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. The luciferase activity in the cell lysate was determined as described previously (44Chen B.K. Chang W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10400-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA)—The oligonucleotide, 5′-TTTGGGCTAGTCTGGGGCGGGG-3′, localized -171 to -150 bp within the promoter of 12(S)-lipoxygenase and its mutant, 5′-TTTGGGCTAGTCTAAAACAAAA-3′, were biotinylated at the 5′-termini, and then annealed with their complementary strands, respectively. The DNA affinity precipitation assay was performed by incubating 2 μg of biotinylated DNA probe with 300 μg of nuclear extract that was precleaned with 10 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 1 h, and then incubated with 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose in binding buffer (1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 1 h. Beads were collected and washed with the binding buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 three times. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 2× sample buffer and separated by 7% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis, and by 8-20% gradient SDS-PAGE for silver staining. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Assays were performed as described previously (45Boulon S. Dantonel J.C. Binet V. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Hipskind R.A. Philips A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7769-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 108) were cross-linked using 0.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS, and the cell lysate was then collected with lysis buffer. The chromatin was fragmented by sonication to an average size of 500 bp. The samples were precleaned with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h, and then immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of IgG, anti-Sp1, anti-Hsp90, anti-TFIID (TBP), anti-acetyl H3, or anti-actin antibodies. After 12 h of incubation, the samples were incubated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h, respectively. After six washes, bound proteins were eluted with TE buffer containing 1% SDS. Cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 12 h, and proteins were digested with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 2 h at 50°C.DNAwas purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting. The primer sequences for PCR were as follows: 5′-TTTGGGCTAGTCTGGGGCGGGG-3′ and 5′-GGCGCCCCCCAGCAGCTTAGGC-3′ and those for Southern blotting were as follows: 5′-AGACGGTCCTTTAAAGGTTGGAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTTCCAACCTTTAAAGGACCGTCT-3′. Recombinant Retrovirus—AmphoPack-293 cells (2.5 × 106) were seeded and then cultured overnight for retrovirus packaging. pSM2 or pSM2-shHSP90 at a dose of 1 μg was transfected into the cells with Lipofectamine 2000, and then incubated with fresh medium for 3 days (46Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected and concentrated. The titer was 2 × 106 per ml, and the viral particles were stocked at -80 °C. Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA of cells was isolated with the TRIzol RNA extraction kit, and 5 μg of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription PCR with SuperScript™ II. The primers used for PCR for 12(S)-lipoxygenase were: 5′-CACCTGTGCTCACTGCCTTA-3′ and 5′-AGTTCCTCAATGGTGCCAAC-3′, and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were: 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′. The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. In Vitro Transcription Assay—The in vitro transcription assay was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12% glycerol, 80 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mm EDTA. Nucleotide concentrations were 600 μm for ATP, GTP, and CTP and 30 μm for UTP containing 5 μCi of α-[32P]UTP. The reaction mixture included 10 μg of nuclear extract and 1 μg of template DNA with or without RNase i to inhibit the RNase activity. The transcripts were extracted once with phenol and once with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel. Finally, the gel was dried, and autoradiography was then performed. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed using isoelectric focusing (IEF) as the first dimension (IPGphor, Amersham Biosciences), using an immobilized pH gradient strip (IPG strip, 18-cm long, linear pH 4-7), followed by second-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Protean II xi cell). The quantity of protein loaded onto the two-dimensional gel was 50 μg. IEF was run following a stepwise incremental voltage program: 30 V for 16 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V for 4 h, with a total power of 34 kV-h. After IEF, the strips were subjected to two-step equilibration in equilibration buffers containing 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 with 1% DTT w/v for the first step, and 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for the second step. The strips were then transferred onto the second-dimensional SDS-PAGE and run on 1.0-mm thick 8-16% gradient polyacrylamide gels at 10 °C. The gels were fixed for silver staining. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The protein spot of interest on the two-dimensional electrophoresis was excised, ground manually, and transferred into a siliconized 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for further identification by mass spectrometry analysis. The in-gel digestion, mass spectrometry analysis, and data base search were performed as described previously (47Tyan Y.C. Wu H.Y. Su W.C. Chen P.W. Liao P.C. Proteomics. 2005; 55: 1062-1074Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopic Analysis—A431 cells were seeded on round glass slides in 24-well plates overnight. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS three times and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and in 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 min. These cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 60 min at 25 °C and incubated with antibody against Hsp90 at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h, with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and antibodies against Sp1 at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h, and with Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G for 1 h. These samples were washed with PBS, mounted in 50% glycerol, and analyzed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Hsp90α Was Recruited by Sp1 to the Promoter of 12(S)-Lipoxygenase in A431 Cells—Sp1 acts as an anchor protein to recruit other transcriptional factors to carry out the transcriptional mechanism (43Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, a biotinylated DNA fragment localized at the -171 to -150 bp region of the 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter containing Sp1 binding sites was used as a probe to study the factors that could be recruited to the promoter by Sp1. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Sp1 antibodies and shown in Fig. 1A. This indicated that Sp1 could bind to the GC-rich region of 12(S)-lipoxygenase, but not to the mGC-rich region in which the sequence was modified from 5′-TTTGGGCTAGTCTGGGGCGGGG-3′ to 5′-TTTGGGCTAGTCTAAAACAAAA-3′ (Fig. 1A). These samples were subsequently analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, revealing that more proteins were recruited to the GC-rich probe, but not to the mGC-rich probe (Fig. 1B). The proteins on the gel were collected and analyzed employing MALDI-TOF MS to verify their identities. Among those, Hsp90α was clearly identified (Fig. 1C). ChIP assay was carried out to mimic the in vivo recruitment of Hsp90α to the promoter of 12(S)-lipoxygenase. The results revealed that GC-rich region of 12(S)-lipoxygenase promoter could be pulled down by anti-Sp1 and anti-Hsp90α antibodies (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that the Hsp90α could be recruited to the promoter of 12(S)-lipoxygenase by Sp1 in A431 cells. Further, immunoprecipitation with anti-Sp1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp90α and anti-Sp1 antibodies was performed. As shown in Fig. 2A, Hsp90α could be immunoprecipitated by anti-Sp1 antibodies. In addition, we also expressed and purified the GST-Sp1 protein from Escherichia coli and used it to pull-down interacting proteins residing in the nuclear extract. Immunoblots with anti-Hsp90α and anti-GST antibodies revealed that GST-Sp1 could pull-down the Hsp90α, but the GST protein alone could not (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether Sp1 and Hsp90α interacted directly, both Hsp90α and GST-Sp1 were expressed and purified for in vitro interaction assay. These results revealed that no direct interaction between Sp1 and Hsp90α occurred (Fig. 2C). In addition, cells were also observed with confocal microscopy to study the co-localization between the Sp1 and Hsp90α (Fig. 2D). The result revealed that a little Hsp90α was inside the nucleus, and it was"

This rational approach is generally more effective for the engineering of local properties, such as substrate specificity, than global ones such as allostery.

These results suggest that the molecular recognition properties of intrinsically unstructured proteins are relatively easy to engineer and that the absence of crystal structures should not deter the rational engineering of this class of proteins. Cells generally employ sensor proteins (also called “biosensors” or “switches”) to detect chemical stimuli and activate downstream components of signal transduction systems. We sought to fabricate artificial molecular sensors by engineering proteins that are specifically activated when bound or modified by novel effectors. Such sensors have practical utility in high throughput screens for drug discovery or directed protein evolution. They have also proved to be useful as research reagents. For example, two-hybrid systems (1Baker K. Bleczinski C. Lin H. Salazar-Jimenez G. Sengupta D. Krane S. Cornish V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16537-16542Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Drees B.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and protein fragment complementation assays (3Michnick S.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) couple the interactions of fusion proteins within transgenic cells to the production of signals. Cleverly designed sensors based upon fluorescent resonance energy transfer between green fluorescent protein analogues have also enabled the observation of intracellular protein modification events (4Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), including protein phosphorylation (5Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and proteolysis (6Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). We expect that the utility of engineered protein sensors will continue to increase as they are deployed as diagnostic reagents (7Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and pathogen-activated biotherapeutics (8Liu S. Redeye V. Kuremsky J.G. Kuhnen M. Molinolo A. Bugge T.H. Leppla S.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Vocero-Akbani A.M. Heyden N.V. Lissy N.A. Ratner L. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Rational protein design is generally synonymous with structure based site-directed mutagenesis (10Brannigan J.A. Wilkinson A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 964-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reporter proteins are usually selected as starting points for sensor design because their structure-have been solved and because their activities are amenable to high throughput screening. Previous workers have inserted peptide epitopes into β-galactosidase (11Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase (12Brennan C.A. Christianson K. La Fleur M.A. Mandecki W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or β-lactamase (13Legendre D. Soumillion P. Fastrez J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This approach has generally produced catalytically compromised enzymes that are activated up to 4-fold by antibody binding (14Feliu J.X. Ferrer-Miralles N. Blanco E. Cazorla D. Sobrino F. Villaverde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), presumably through allosteric mechanisms (7Villaverde A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It nevertheless remains difficult to predict whether the insertion of any peptide epitope into a particular position of a protein will generate the desired antibody-dependent activity. In contrast, natural selection has no bias in favor of proteins that crystallize readily or those with spectroscopically detectable activities. It has in effect generated vast numbers of proteins that are regulated through modification or binding, presumably through parsimonious evolutionary pathways. We therefore considered nature's solutions to the problem of sensor design before formulating our own strategies.By choosing globular and normally unregulated reporter enzymes such as β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, protein engineers may be undertaking unnecessarily difficult design problems. In contrast, natural proteins that participate in signal transduction and gene expression tend to be intrinsically unstructured (15Tompa P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3346-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The unbound forms of these proteins have been described as “beads on a flexible string,” where the beads are domains (often molecular recognition elements) connected by linkers (16Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that intrinsically unstructured proteins are easy to engineer because of their inherent modularity and relative absence of functional constraint.Our strategy was therefore to fabricate novel sensors by engineering an intrinsically unstructured protein. Sensors that are activated are preferable to those that are inactivated because the latter are more likely to produce “false positives” during high throughput screens. Lim and coworkers (17Dueber J.E. Yeh B.J. Chak K. Lim W.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1904-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) previously reprogrammed the effector dependence and gating behavior of the neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which also contains unstructured regions (according to the DisProt data base, Ref. 18Vucetic S. Obradovic Z. Vacic V. Radivojac P. Peng K. Iakoucheva L.M. Cortese M.S. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Sikes J.G. Newton C.D. Dunker A.K. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). N-WASP is modular in design and easily reprogrammed, but its activity (actin polymerization) is not particularly convenient to assay.We chose the transcription factor p53 as a starting point for several reasons. It is an important tumor suppressor, so its structure and function are well understood (Fig. 1). Regions within the N and C termini of p53 are thought to be intrinsically unstructured (19Bell S. Klein C. Muller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and are therefore likely to accommodate almost any insertion. The wild-type p53 remains inactive in vitro until the C-terminal 30 amino acids are bound by an antibody, deleted, or phosphorylated (21Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of activation remains unclear (22Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) but can nevertheless be exploited. The sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 can be detected in vitro using labeled DNA probes or in vivo using reporter genes within yeast or mammalian cells (Fig. 1b).p53 binds double-stranded DNA with two adjacent copies of the consensus sequence 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′ (23el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), and its transcription activation activity in cultured cells is dependent on DNA binding (24Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We and others employ the artificial p53CON target sequence, 5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′, which was isolated from a pool of random sequence double-stranded oligonucleotides (25Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Active p53 protein can be expressed in Escherichia coli and is thus inexpensive and easy to produce. The high affinity of p53 for p53CON (KD = 5 × 10-10 m, (26Hall A.R. Milner J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 561-567PubMed Google Scholar)) enables highly sensitive assays. Active and latent p53 proteins differ greatly in sequence-specific DNA binding activity. In fact, the “activation factor” we observed of p53 (as high as ∼100-fold increase in signal) greatly exceeds those of textbook allosteric enzymes (<70% increase, (27Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 5th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York2002: 266Google Scholar)). The signal produced by p53 in vitro remains constant once it reaches equilibrium, so assays are less time dependent and labor intensive than those that employ enzymes.Here we have demonstrated the versatility of p53-based molecular sensors. Site-directed insertion mutagenesis and heterologous expression were used to fabricate p53 variants that display peptides recognized by proteases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 3The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusIMACimmobilized metal affinity chromatographyEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayIPTGisopropyl-thio-galactopyranosideHAhemagglutininHSVherpes simplex virusLFlethal factor. 3The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusIMACimmobilized metal affinity chromatographyEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayIPTGisopropyl-thio-galactopyranosideHAhemagglutininHSVherpes simplex virusLFlethal factor. protease, Bacillus anthracis Lethal Factor) or monoclonal antibodies (three different epitopes). All of the p53 variants were specifically activated by their designated effectors in in vitro assays. These sensors have immediate utility in high throughput screens and could potentially be used in other applications (see “Discussion”). More importantly, this work has demonstrated a simple but effective alternative to structure-based site-directed mutagenesis for the fabrication of artificial sensors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Expression vectors pET20b+, pET28a+, and pCDF Duet were from Novagen (Madison, WI). The p1+IQ HIV protease expression vector (ATCC number 68352) and the human p53 cDNA (ATCC number 57254) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The Lethal Factor expression vector, pLF, was a gift from Dr. Stephen Leppla. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Gold/pLysS was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). E. coli strain InvαF′ was from Invitrogen. γ-labeled P-32 ATP was from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA) and Butterfly nitro-cellulose membranes from Schleicher and Schuell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA); the IRD-700-labeled oligo was from LiCor (Lincoln, NE). The anti-p53 p53 monoclonal antibody (pAb1801) and the anti-Lethal Factor antibody (BAL0105) were from AbCam (Cambridge, UK). The HA antibody was from Covance (Princeton, NJ); the HSV antibody and purified Lethal Factor protease were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The BigDye 3.1 DNA sequencing and GeneAmp XL long PCR kits were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).Construction of p53 Variants—The human p53Δ30 gene from vector p53Δ30-pET20b+ (28Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was fused to a sequence encoding an N-terminal His6 tag by subcloning p53Δ30 into pET28a+ (Novagen) using restriction enzymes NdeI and Hind III. The His6-p53Δ30 was then subcloned back into pET20b+ using XbaI and Hind III. The TEM-1 β-lactamase gene of the resulting His6-p53Δ30-pET20b+ was replaced with the kanamycin phosphotransferase gene from pET28a+ using BspHI, thereby creating His6-p53Δ30-pET20b+(kanR). The 3′-end of the full-length wild-type p53 from pHp53B was subcloned into His6-p53Δ30-pET20b+ using NcoI and BamHI, thereby creating the His6-wild-type p53-pET20b+ (kanR) vector.The p53 to detect HIV protease cleavage (p53/p6) was created by replacing amino acids 360-369 with the p6 site by whole plasmid PCR (29Geddie M.L. Matsumura I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26462-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the following 5′-phosphorylated primers (p6 encoding sequence underlined): 5′-CCTCAGATCACTCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACC-3′ (p53 p6-1) and 5′-GAAGTTAAAGCTTACTGGCTCCTTCCCAGCCTGGGCATC-3′ (p53 p6-2). The p53/-LF10 expression vector was similarly created using site-directed insertion of the recognition sequence at p53 codon 364. The primers used were 5′-CCGTATCCGATGGAAGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAA-3′ (LF p53) and 5′-CTCGAGATACACTTTCTTCCTGCTCCCCCCTGGCTCCTTCC-3′ (LF p53rev).The p53-Δ68 mutant was created by deleting the sequence encoding the tetramerization and activation domains of p53 in a whole plasmid PCR (29Geddie M.L. Matsumura I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26462-26468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using primers 5′-TAGGACGTCGAAGCCGAATTCCAGCACACTGGCG-3′ (p53Δ68) and 5′-ATCCAGTGGTTTCTTCTTTGGCTGGGG-3′ (p53Δ68rev). All antibody epitopes were inserted in place of the native pAb1801 epitope (codons 46-55) by whole plasmid PCR as described above. The constructs were created using the following primers (epitope is underlined): His6-p53-HSV-Δ68 5′-CCGGAAGATCCGGAAGATGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCC-3′ (HSVp53out) and 5′-CGCCAGTTCCGGCTGCATCAAATCATCCATTGCTTGGGACGG-3′ (HSVp53rev); His6-p53-LF(ab)-Δ68 5′-GCGTTCCGCATGATCGGTGCTCAAATCATCCATTGCTTGGGACGGCAA-3′ LFp53rev(Ab) and 5′-CTGAAAGTGCAGAAAAACGCGCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATG-3′ (LFp53out(ab)).Construction of Protease Expression Vectors—The inducible HIV pro-tease expression vector, p1+IQ (lacZ-) was constructed as follows. The lacZ gene was excised from expression vector p1 + IQ (30Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Gluzman Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10023-10027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using BamHI; the remaining DNA was purified, self-ligated, and used to transform E. coli strain InvαF′. The PBAD-HIV PR-pCDF expression vectors were constructed in two stages. First, we made the PBAD-pCDF expression vector by subcloning the araC repressor and PBAD promoter from pBAD myc His A into pSL1180 using SphI and NcoI; the PBAD promoter was then subcloned from PBAD-pSL1180 into pCDF Duet using NcoI and XbaI. Second, the HIV protease gene in p1+IQ was PCR amplified, subcloned into pET28a+ using NdeI and Hind III, and sequenced to confirm its wild-type identity. The subcloning fused DNA encoding a hexahistidine tag to its 5′-end; this tag does not affect enzyme activity (31Vickrey J.F. Logsdon B.C. Proteasa G. Palmer S. Winters M.A. Merigan T.C. Kovari L.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The inactivating D25N mutation was introduced into His6-HIV PR-pET28 by whole circle PCR using primers 5′-GAAGCTCTATTAAATACAGGAGCAGATG-3′ (HIVPR-D25N-62) and 5′-CTTTAGTTGCCCCCCTATCTTTATTGTG-3′ (HIVPR-62out). The wild-type and D25N variants of the His6-HIV PR gene were subcloned from their respective His6-HIV PR-pET28 plasmids into PBAD-pCDF using NcoI and XhoI.The Lethal Factor protease gene was cloned from the pLF7 vector. The signal peptide and an internal NcoI site was removed using two-step cloning (based on Park and Leppla, Ref. 32Park S. Leppla S.H.

The first PCR reaction used the primers 5′-AAAAAAACCATGGCGGGCGGTCATGGTGATGTAGG-3′ (5′-LF NcoI) and 5′-TTGAAGGTCCATGCAGTAATATAGAACGG-3′ (LF 2088rev). The second PCR reaction used primers 5′-CCGTTCTATATTACTGCATGGACCTTCAA-3′ (LF 2126) and 5′-TTTTTGGGCCCGGATCCTTATGAGTTAATAATGAAC-3′ (3′LF BamHI). The two products were combined in a third PCR reaction in which the entire Lethal Factor gene amplified using the external 5′-LF NcoI and 3′-LF BamHI primers. The Lethal Factor gene was then cloned into the pCDF Duet vector (Novagen) for the in vivo assays. All variants were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Big Dye protocol at the Center for Fundamental and Applied Molecular Evolution (Emory University).Protein Purification—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid pLysS were transformed with constructs that expressed the wild-type or engineered p53 genes fused to N-terminal six-histidine tags. The transformants were grown at 37 °C to mid-log (A600 = 0.3) and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and shaken at 23 °C for 4 h. The cells were spun down and stored as a pellet at -80 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication and the insoluble fraction removed by centrifugation. The protein was purified as described in the pET manual (Novagen) except that the binding, wash, and elution buffers were replaced with p53 binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) without β-mercaptoethanol, plus 450 mm NaCl and 0, 60, and 1000 mm imidazole, respectively. The eluted p53 proteins were dialyzed in p53 binding buffer (plus 450 mm NaCl) and stored in p53 binding buffer (plus 45% glycerol and 450 mm NaCl) at -20 °C. The total protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford protein assay (BioRad). HIV protease was purified and refolded according to an established protocol (31Vickrey J.F. Logsdon B.C. Proteasa G. Palmer S. Winters M.A. Merigan T.C. Kovari L.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and protein concentration also quantified using the Bradford protein assay. We used a commercially available fluorogenic substrate to show that our HIV protease was as active as those described in the literature (33Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J. Science. 1990; 247: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar).The p53/p6 expression vector was co-expressed with HIV protease by induction with 0.5 mm IPTG for 4 h at 23°C, whereas the p53/LF10 expression vector was co-expressed with Lethal Factor by induction with 0.5 mm IPTG for 18 h at 18 °C. The wild-type and engineered p53 proteins were expressed, either alone or co-expressed with HIV protease (from p1+IQ (30Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Gluzman Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10023-10027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) or LF protease (from LF-pCDF), and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described above. The purified proteins (2.0 μm) were incubated with 1.0 pm N-terminal infrared-labeled oligo p53CON, 50 ng of pLS1180, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the mixtures were loaded onto 4% non-denaturing acryl-amide gels and evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described below.EMSA Assays—The EMSAs were performed as described (34Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) except p53 binding buffer was used. The purified proteins (50 nm p53-Δ30, 10 nm p53-Δ68, 10 nm p53-HA-Δ68, 10 nm p53-LF(ab)-Δ68, 20 nm p53-HSV-Δ68) were incubated with 1.0 pm 5′-IRD-700-labeled oligo p53CON (5′-ATGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′ (25Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar)) and 0.25-1.0 μg of monoclonal antibodies in a total volume of 20 μl. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the mixtures were loaded onto 4% acrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 0.33× TBE, 0.1% Triton X-100) and run at 200 V for 1 h at 4°C. The gels were scanned using the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imager; the intensities of the pixels within each band were quantified with the associated Odyssey software (version 1.1). The activation factors were calculated by dividing the intensities of the anti-body/engineered p53/p53CON complexes by the intensity of the engineered p53/p53CON complex.The in vitro protease assays were performed using purified p53 (p53/p6, p53/LF10, p53Δ30, or wild-type) and protease (HIV protease (31Vickrey J.F.

The purified p53 proteins (2 μm) were reacted with the HIV protease (10 μm) or LF (2 μm) proteases (EMD Biosciences) for 48 h in p53 binding buffer at 4 °C. Following the incubation, the p53 activity was determined by EMSA as described above.High Throughput Assay—The screen for p53 function is based on a method developed by Singh et al. (35Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells carrying the T7 lysozyme expression vector, pLysS, were transformed with the p53 expression constructs and plated on Luria Broth (LB) plates containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-kan/chl). After 16 h of growth at 37 °C, the colonies were adsorbed onto a nitrocellulose filter and transferred colony-side-up to LB-kan/chl plates containing 0.5 mm IPTG to induce expression of p53. The colonies adsorbed to the nitrocellulose filter were induced at 23 °C for 4 h. The cells remaining on the original plate were regrown into full colonies by a further 8 h of incubation at 37 °C.The cell membranes of the p53-expressing colonies were disrupted with chloroform gas for 15 min, giving the intracellular T7 lysozyme access to the peptidoglycan. The remaining manipulations were carried out in p53 binding buffer (described above) at 23 °C. The filters were treated with 2.5 units/ml DNase I (in p53 binding buffer plus 10 mm MgCl2) for 15 min, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (in p53 binding buffer plus 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) for an hour, washed three times in binding buffer for 5 min each, and probed with 20 nm radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the p53CON sequence (underlined) 5′-GTGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC (25Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) (plus 5 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) for 1 h. The fluorescent IRD700-p53CON probe apparently interacts non-specifically with endogenous E. coli proteins (data not shown) and is therefore unsuitable for the colony lift screen. The filters were washed four times more for 7.5 min each, and the quantity of probe bound to each filter was measured using a BAS-1000 Bio-imaging Analyzer System (Fujifilm Medical Systems USA, Stamford, CT).RESULTSProtease Activation of p53In Vivo Activation—We first engineered p53 variants that were specifically activated by HIV protease or the B. anthracis Lethal Factor (a metalloprotease). These effectors were novel because p53 does not ordinarily recognize or respond to them. Both proteases catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide substrates but do not overlap in sequence or conformation specificity (36Prabu-Jeyabalan M. Nalivaika E. Schiffer C.A.

Site-directed insertion mutagenesis was applied to replace p53 codons 360-369, which encode an unstructured spacer upstream of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 1), with a sequence encoding the HIV protease substrate (p6, VSFNFPQITL). Similarly the sequence encoding the Lethal Factor substrate (LF10, KKVYPYPME (37Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Jarrell E.T. Leppla S.H. Collier R.J. Liddington R.C. Cantley L.C. Nat. Struct.

The engineered p53 variants (designated p53/p6 and p53/LF10) and the wild-type p53 gene were separately co-expressed in E. coli with either HIV protease, LF, or no protease.The hexahistidine-tagged p53 proteins were purified by IMAC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The engineered protein migrated more quickly than the wild-type (at the same rate as the p53Δ30 control, which lacks its C-terminal domain), but only after co-expression with protease (data not shown). Equimolar quantities of the purified proteins were incubated with a double-stranded p53CON target sequence (25Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) conjugated to a near-infrared dye (IRD700-p53CON); the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of each was measured in an EMSA. The bands at the top of the gel reflect protein-DNA complexes, and their intensities are a measure of activation. Protease co-expression increased the apparent activity of the engineered p53 variants by ∼30-fold for p53/p6 and a factor of >100-fold for p53/LF10.

The p53 proteins were purified by IMAC, and their sequence-specific DNA binding activity was measured in an EMSA. b, the engineered and wild-type p53 proteins were separately expressed in E. coli and purified by IMAC. Each of the full-length p53 proteins was reacted with purified HIV protease (31Vickrey J.F. Logsdon B.C. Proteasa G. Palmer S. Winters M.A. Merigan T.C. Kovari L.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 28: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or purified LF protease for 48 h in p53 binding buffer at 4 °C. The DNA binding activity of each variant was determined in an EMSA. c, the wild-type, activated (p53Δ30) and engineered (p53/p6) genes were induced within E. coli colonies. The colonies were lysed and probed with a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a p53 binding site (p53CON). d, E. coli were co-transformed with a p53/p6 expression vector and either PBAD-wild-type HIV PR-pCDF (bottom row) or PBAD-D25N HIV PR-pCDF (top row). The resulting colonies were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG (p53/p6 only, left column) or 0.5 mm IPTG plus 0.2% l-arabinose (p53/p6 and HIV PR, right column).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vitro Protease Activation—We confirmed that the proteases directly activated the engineered p53 variants through in vitro assays using purified proteins.

In the frog, Xenopus laevis, the CDK inhibitor p27Xic1 (Xic1) inhibits DNA synthesis by negatively regulating CDK2-cyclin E. Using the frog egg extract as a model system for the study of Xic1, studies have demonstrated that Xic1 protein levels are regulated by nuclear ubiquitination and proteolysis. To characterize the molecular mechanism that regulates Xic1 turnover, we have identified the minimal sequences of Xic1 that are necessary and sufficient for its nuclear ubiquitination and degradation. Using deletion mutagenesis, our studies indicated that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 are critical for its proteolysis beyond a role in nuclear transport. Replacement of the Xic1 C terminus with the SV40 nuclear localization sequence resulted in the nuclear localization of Xic1 but not its ubiquitination or degradation. Our deletion studies also indicated that the CDK2-cyclin binding domain of Xic1 is important for its efficient retention in the nucleus. Further deletion analyses identified at least 3 lysine residues within the Xic1 C terminus that are targeted for specific ubiquitination. Importantly, our studies demonstrated that the Xic1 C-terminal 50 amino acids can serve as a nuclear degradation signal when fused to a stable heterologous nuclear protein. Moreover, a 30-amino-acid region within the C terminus of Xic1 can serve as a nuclear ubiquitination signal. To address the role of phosphorylation on Xic1 turnover, all the potential phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 were mutated to alanine to prevent possible phosphorylation. This resulted in a Xic1 protein that was nevertheless degraded in a manner similar to wild-type Xic1, suggesting that phosphorylation of Xic1 is not critical for its nuclear ubiquitination or proteolysis.

The ubiquitination and degradation of Xic1 is dependent upon its nuclear localization, which is mediated equally by three nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) located within the Xic1 C terminus and through the binding of CDK2-cyclins (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Once localized within the nucleus, binding to CDK-cyclins is dispensable for Xic1 proteolysis (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol.

Additionally, we have shown that amino acids 180–183 of Xic1 serve as a critical determinant of Xic1 degradation, which we postulate functions to bind a critical regulator of Xic1 ubiquitination (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that the phosphorylation of Xic1 within six possible CDK consensus (S/T)-P sites is not required for Xic1 turnover (13Furstenthal L. Swanson C. Kaiser B.K. Eldridge A.G. Jackson P.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that the targeted proteolysis of mammalian p27Kip1 is mediated by the E3 called SCFSkp2 (15Amati B. Vlach J. Nat.

The SCF is comprised of an F-box-binding protein called Skp1, a cullin family member called Cul1, a variable F-box protein, and a ring finger protein called Rbx1/Roc1. The ubiquitination of p27Kip1 during S phase requires association with CDK2-cyclin E and subsequent phosphorylation on residue Thr-187 for Skp2-mediated targeting to the SCF (19Montagnoli A. Fiore F.

Similarly, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDK inhibitor, p40Sic1, is multiply phosphorylated by Cln kinases in G1 before ubiquitination by the E3, SCFCdc4 (22Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 23Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T.

Science. 1997; 278: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, a common requirement for ubiquitination by the SCF is substrate phosphorylation. Although the E3 of Xic1 has not yet been identified, it is predicted to be the Xenopus homolog of mammalian SCF, suggesting that Xic1 may require prior phosphorylation before efficient ubiquitination during DNA replication initiation. To characterize the molecular mechanism, which regulates Xic1 turnover in Xenopus interphase egg extracts, we have identified the minimal domain of Xic1 that can efficiently support the nuclear ubiquitination and degradation of Xic1. Additionally, we further addressed whether phosphorylation of Xic1 within this C-terminal domain is a requirement for nuclei-dependent Xic1 degradation. Our results indicated that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 are both necessary and sufficient to target Xic1 for efficient nuclei-dependent proteolysis. This domain of Xic1 (amino acids 161–210) can also serve as a transposable element to target a stable heterologous nuclear protein for degradation, while an abbreviated domain of Xic1-(161–190) can mediate the ubiquitination of a heterologous nuclear protein. Mutation of all possible Xic1 phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 suggested that the nuclei-dependent turnover of Xic1 in the egg extract does not require phosphorylation within this minimal domain. These studies suggested that Xic1 associates with the ubiquitination machinery and regulators of Xic1 ubiquitination through its C-terminal domain during DNA replication initiation. Preparation of Xenopus Interphase Egg Extract, Nucleoplasmic Extract (NPE), Xenopus Demembranated Sperm Chromatin, and Methyl-ubiquitin—Xenopus laevis interphase egg extract (low speed supernatant or LSS) and demembranated sperm chromatin were prepared as described previously (12Chuang L.C.

Endogenous Xic1 in the Interphase Egg Extract Is Degraded in a Nuclei-dependent Manner—Previous studies of Xic1 turnover have used the Xenopus interphase egg extract as a model system to study the ubiquitination and degradation of [35S]methionine-labeled exogenously added Xic1 (11Yew P.R.

To validate the continued use of this model system for the study of Xic1 proteolysis, we generated an antibody to Xic1 to examine the turnover of endogenous Xic1 in the interphase egg extract in the presence of sperm nuclei. Upon the addition of sperm chromatin to the interphase egg extract, endogenous Xic1 was degraded over time in a nuclei-dependent manner with kinetics similar to the degradation of exogenously added [35S]methionine-labeled Xic1 (Figs. 1 and 2B). These results suggested that in the interphase egg extract supplemented with sperm nuclei, both Xic1 present endogenously and Xic1 added exogenously are degraded by a similar mechanism.FIGURE 2The C-terminal domain of Xic1 mediates its nuclei-dependent proteolysis.

In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Xic1 WT or deletion mutants were incubated in the Xenopus interphase egg extract (also called LSS) with (+) or without (–) nuclei for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The results of two separate experiments were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis, and the mean percentage of Xic1 remaining is shown (% XIC1 REMAINING), where the 0-h time point of Xic1 was normalized to 100% of Xic1 remaining for each sample.

We reasoned that this knowledge would help us to identify the mediators or regulators that are required for Xic1 proteolysis. To this end, we first performed deletion mutagenesis of Xic1 (Fig. 2A) and found that although deletion of the N-terminal 25 amino acids of Xic1 did not affect its turnover, further deletion of the N-terminal 100 amino acids of Xic1 resulted in a protein that was inherently unstable in the egg extract in the presence or absence of nuclei (Fig. 2, B, top panel and C). This suggests that the N-terminal 25 amino acids of Xic1 are dispensable for its proteolysis, whereas deletion of additional N-terminal amino acids, including the residues required for binding to CDK2-cyclins (amino acids 31–91) (6Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), results in a mutant of Xic1 that is degraded in an unregulated manner. Deletion of the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Xic1 resulted in a mutant that was degraded in a nuclei-dependent manner but at an efficiency clearly reduced when compared with the wild-type protein, suggesting that the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Xic1 contain residues that are required for efficient Xic1 degradation (Fig. 2B, bottom panel, and 2C). In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 resulted in a complete stabilization of Xic1 that was not increased by further C-terminal deletions (Fig. 2, B and C). This result suggested that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 contain residues that are critical for its nuclei-dependent degradation. The C-terminal Domain of Xic1 Plays an Essential Role in Xic1 Proteolysis beyond Its Role in Xic1 Nuclear Localization—Our previous studies have shown that Xic1 degradation requires efficient Xic1 nuclear localization, which is independently mediated by binding to CDK2-cyclin E and by nuclear localization sequences within the C terminus (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test whether the C terminus of Xic1 functions only to correctly localize Xic1 to the nucleus, where it is ubiquitinated and degraded, we replaced the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 containing its three nuclear localization sequences with the canonical simian virus 40 (SV40) NLS (Fig. 3A). For these studies and further studies, we utilized a Xic1 protein fused to GST because it facilitated the detection of Xic1 ubiquitinated species by allowing Xic1 to be labeled with [35S]methionine to a higher specific activity (Xic1 contains 2 methionines, whereas GST-Xic1 contains 11 methionines) (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using a GST-tagged Xic1 demonstrated that it was degraded like the wild-type Xic1, whereas GST alone was stable (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, this approach enabled us to determine which sequences of Xic1 could serve as a portable domain to target the normally stable GST for nuclei-dependent proteolysis in the egg extract. Our results showed that although a GST fusion of Xic1 residues 31–210 (GST-Xic1-(31–210)) was efficiently degraded, replacement of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of GST-Xic1-(31–210) with the SV40 NLS resulted in a mutant (GST-Xic1-(31–160)-SV40-NLS) that was not ubiquitinated or degraded, although it was efficiently localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3, B and C). An additional Xic1 mutant bearing the SV40-NLS in place of the C-terminal 50 amino acids and deleted for the N-terminal 91 residues, including the CDK2-cyclin binding domain (GST-Xic1(92–160)SV40-NLS), was similarly defective for proteolysis. However, this mutant was not efficiently localized to the nucleus despite its expression of the SV40 NLS, which is sufficient for nuclear transportation (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Because Xic1 residues from 33 to 67 have been previously shown to be critical for CDK2-cyclin binding (6Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this indicated that the binding of Xic1 to CDK2-cyclins is important for the efficient nuclear retention of Xic1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results suggested that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1 play a critical role in the degradation of Xic1 beyond their participation in Xic1 nuclear localization. Xic1 Is Specifically Ubiquitinated on at Least Three Lysine Residues Within the C Terminus—To further define the minimal sequences required for Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation, additional deletion mutagenesis was performed (Fig. 4A). Xic1 mutants were expressed as fusions to GST, and the nuclearly localized ubiquitinated Xic1 species were visualized following a nuclei spin-down assay to separate the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Xic1 mutants were also analyzed for nuclei-dependent degradation in the Xenopus interphase egg extract. Our studies indicated that although GST alone was stable, both the GST-Xic1 WT protein and the GST-Xic1-(31–210) proteins were efficiently ubiquitinated and degraded in a nuclei-dependent manner (Figs. 4B, lanes 3 and 5, and 5A, top panel). Moreover, analysis of the GST-Xic1-WT by nuclei spin-down assay in the presence of methyl ubiquitin to inhibit polyubiquitination suggested that Xic1 is ubiquitinated on ∼3–4 lysine residues (Fig. 4B). Further deletion of Xic1 sequences resulted in Xic1 mutants that could target GST for ubiquitination, but progressive deletions of Xic1 resulted in less and less efficient Xic1 nuclear retention, and thus, reduced Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation. Xic1 mutants GST-Xic1-(92–210), GST-Xic1-(132–210), GST-Xic1-(31–91)(132–210), and GST-Xic1-(92–131)(161–210) were ubiquitinated on ∼3–4 lysine residues but at a reduced level due to their less efficient nuclear localization or retention (Fig. 4B). The mutants specifically deleted for residues 31–91 encoding the CDK2-cyclin binding domain of Xic1 were significantly reduced for nuclear localization of Xic1 and were therefore reduced for proteolysis (Fig. 5A). Our results had previously indicated that binding to CDK2-cyclin E was dispensable for Xic1 proteolysis but was required for efficient nuclear localization and retention (12Chuang L.C. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In support of this, our studies showed that mutants deleted for the CDK2-cyclin binding domain were still ubiquitinated. The most extensive N-terminal deletion (1–160) of Xic1 (GST-Xic1-(161–210)) resulted in a mutant that was greatly reduced for nuclear localization and degradation but was still weakly ubiquitinated on 3–4 lysine residues (Fig. 4B, lane 11). These studies suggested that when fused to the cytoplasmic protein, GST, the minimal domain of Xic1 that can support Xic1 ubiquitination and a modest degree of Xic1 degradation is the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Xic1. To more directly test this finding in the absence of the requirement for nuclear transport, we later fused Xic1 to the nuclear protein, CDK8, and studied the minimal sequences required for Xic1 ubiquitination and degradation.FIGURE 5The C terminus of Xic1 defines a motif essential for Xic1 degradation.
