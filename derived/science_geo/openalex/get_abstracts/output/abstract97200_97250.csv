https://openalex.org/W1968882642,"We have characterized a clone carrying a chicken preproinsulin gene, which is present in only one copy in the chicken genome. The gene contains two introns: a 3.5 kb intron interrupting the region encoding the connecting peptide and a 119 bp intron interrupting the DNA corresponding to the 5' non-coding region of the mRNA. This is similar to the structure of rat insulin gene II; therefore it represents the common ancestor. Since the rat insulin gene I lacks a 499 bp intron in the coding region, the rat genes have evolved by a recent gene duplication followed by loss of this intron in one copy. The divergences between insulin gene sequences, and also between globin genes, show that changes at introns and silent positions in coding regions appear very rapidly (7 X 10(-9) substitutions per nucleotide site per year), but that the accumulation of changes in these sites saturates, although not completely, after about 100 million years. From this we conclude that not all of these sites are neutral and that they do not behave as accurate evolutionary clocks over long periods of time. However, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid replacements are an excellent clock. Our analysis indicates that this clock is driven by selection."
https://openalex.org/W2055415506,"The acetylcholine receptor from the electric ray Torpedo californica is composed of five subunits; two are identical and the other three are structurally related to them. Microsequence analysis of the four polypeptides demonstrates amino acid homology among the subunits. Further sequence analysis of both membrane-bound and Triton-solubilized, chromatographically purified receptor gave the stoichiometry of the four subunits (40,000:50,000:60,000:65,000 daltons) as 2:1:1:1, indicating that this protein is a pentameric complex with a molecular weight of 255,000 daltons. Genealogical analysis suggests that divergence from a common ancestral gene occurred early in the evolution of the receptor. This shared ancestry argues that each of the four subunits plays a functional role in the receptor's physiological action."
https://openalex.org/W2012855221,"Estrogen induces the synthesis of a glycoprotein of molecular weight 46,000 daltons in three estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, ZR75 and T47D), but not in an estrogen receptor-negative cell line (BT 20) or a nonmalignant cell line (HBL 100). The 46K protein, which accounts for 40% of 35S-methionine incorporation into secreted proteins, is only induced by steroids able to interact with the estrogen receptor. The anti-estrogens tamoxifen and hydroxytamoxifen, which by themselves were inactive, suppressed the induction of this protein by estradiol. In MCF7 cells, estradiol also induces three intracellular proteins which are resolved in two-dimensional electrophoresis. The induction of the 46K secreted protein(s) makes these cell lines excellent in vitro systems for studying the mechanism of estrogen and anti-estrogen action. This protein may also be a useful probe for studying the action of estrogen on breast cancer growth, and may be a useful marker for predicting the hormonal responsiveness of breast cancer in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2057279985,"Abstract Using recombinant chicken DNA clones as probes, we have investigated the DNAase I sensitivity of chromosomal DNA regions bordering the α- and β-globin structural genes. By both a blot hybridization assay and solution hybridization, we find that regions around these globin genes are preferentially sensitive (relative to the ovalbumin gene) to DNAase I after mild digestion of isolated red cell nuclei. These regions are resistant in cells that do not express globin. The preferential DNAase I sensitivity extends to at least 8 kb on the 3′ side of the β-globin gene cluster and to 6 or 7 kb on the 5′ side, where relatively resistant DNA fragments have been identified. Using low levels of DNAase I to titrate the sensitivities of coding and adjacent noncoding regions, it was observed that coding regions are organized into a very sensitive structure, while adjacent noncoding regions are organized into a moderately sensitive structure. The blot hybridization assay has also revealed that DNAase I introduces specific, double-stranded cuts into both the α- and β-globin gene clusters. Many of these cuts are tissue-specific. Several α gene-specific sites occur toward the 3′ side of the α-coding sequences. The β sites are different in embryonic and adult red cells. In embryonic cells, the cut occurs near the 5′ end of an embryonic β gene, while in adult cells there are two cuts, one at approximately 2 kb and the other at approximately 6 kb from the 5′ side of an adult gene. Based on the observation that the general region around the origin for replication and promotors for transcription in the SV40 minichromosome is also very sensitive to specific, double-stranded scissions by DNAase I, we speculate that the specific cuts in the globin domain may be structural modifications of the chromatin that are associated with origins for DNA replication or promotors for transcription."

The maximal binding in the depressed group was significantly lower than that of the controls, although the affinity constants were similar. These results suggest that binding of tritiated imipramine in human platelets may represent a biochemical index of depression, possibly reflecting similar changes in the brain."

This protein (about 50,000 daltons) appears to contain seven copies of [Met]enkephalin and one copy of [Leu]enkephalin. Digestion with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B yields [Met]enkephalin and [Leu]enkephalin in a ratio of almost 7 to 1. The enkephalins were identified by chromatography and by their binding to opiate receptors. Some characteristics of several other adrenal peptides that may serve as intermediates in the biosynthesis of the enkephalins are presented."

https://openalex.org/W2035027118,"The recA protein, which is essential for genetic recombination in E. coli, promotes the homologous pairing of double-stranded DNA and linear single-stranded DNA, thereby forming a three-stranded joint molecule called a D loop. Single-stranded DNA stimulates recA protein to unwind double-stranded DNA. By a presumably related mechanism, recA protein promoted the homologous pairing of two circular double-stranded molecules when one of them has a gap in one strand. The two molecules were joined at homologous sites by noncovalent bonds. The covalently closed molecule remained intact and was not topologically linked to the intact circular strand of the gapped substrate. Electron microscopy showed that molecules were usually linked at two or more nearby points. The junctions in most molecules were shorter than 300 nucleotides. Sometimes the region between two extreme points was separated into two arms, producing an ellipsoidal loop (called an eye loop). The junctions in these biparental joint molecules were frequently remote from the site of the gap. We infer that a free end of the interrupted strand crosseover to form a structure like a D loop which moved away from the gap by branch migration."
https://openalex.org/W1970438634,"Infection of legume roots with Rhizobium species results in the development of a root nodule structure in which the bacteria form an intracellular symbiosis with the plant. We report here that the infection of soybean (Glycine max L.) roots with Rhizobium japonicum results in the synthesis by the plant of at least 18-20 polypeptides other than leghemoglobin during the development of root nodules. Identification of these ""nodule-specific"" host polypeptides (referred to as nodulins) was accomplished by two-dimensional gel analysis of the immunoprecipitates formed by a ""nodule-specific"" antiserum with in vitro translation products of root-nodule polysomes that are free of bacteroidal contaminations. Nodulins account for 7-11% of the total 35S-methionine-labeled protein synthesized in the host cell cytoplasm, and the majority of them are of 12,000-20,000 molecular weight. These proteins are absent from the uninfected roots, bacteroids and free-living Rhizobium, and appear to be coded for the plant genes that may be obligatory for the development of symbiosis in the legume root nodules. Analysis of nodulins in ineffective (unable to fix nitrogen) nodules developed due to Rhizobium strains SM5 and 61A24 showed that their synthesis is reduced and their expression differentially influenced by mutations in rhizobia. Two polypeptides of bacterial origin were also found to be cross-reactive with the ""nodule-specific"" antiserum, suggesting that they are secreted by Rhizobium into the host cell cytoplasm during symbiotic nitrogen fixation."
https://openalex.org/W1980798571,"Single-step mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been isolated which are resistant to killing by the anti-mitotic drugs colchicine, colcemid or griseofulvin. Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that two mutants resistant to griseofulvin, one resistant to colcemid and one resistant to colchicine carry an alteration in the beta-tubulin subunit. Most of the remaining isolates are believed to be permeability mutants on the basis of their cross resistance to drugs which do not interefere with microtubular polymerization or function (Ling and Thompson, 1974; Bech-Hansen, Till and Ling, 1976). A reduced amount of the wild-type beta-tubulin protein remained in each of the beta-tubulin mutants, but a beta-tubulin protein with a more basic isoelectric point also appeared. Messenger RNAs coding for both wild-type and variant beta-tubulins were found in at least one mutant as assayed by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate. This indicates that the altered tubulin does not arise as the result of a posttranslational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1582175171,"Noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) were obtained rrom rat dentin using several precautionary measures to prevent artifactual degradation and losses of the proteins. Prior to demineralization, rat incisor dentin was extracted with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) containing enzyme inhibitors. The only major component extracted with GdmCl was a proteoglycan fraction. Most of the NCPs were extracted when the incisors were decalcified with an EDTA solution containing protease inhibitors. The EDTA extract contained four types of macromolecules: acidic glycoproteins, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing proteins, phosphoproteins, and proteoglycans. With two exceptions, the apparent molecular weights of these NCPs were greater than 50,000. Our observations contrast sharply with the results obtained by others for human dentin NCPs and suggest that artifactual degradation and losses of some NCPs occurred in these previous studies. The organic phosphate-containing fraction was biphasic when the EDTA extract was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose. Rechromatography of this fraction by two different procedures separated the material into a complex glycoprotein-containing fraction and, a single rat incisor phosphoprotein peak (RIP). Thus, the earlier interpretation by others that the biphasic nature of the RIP-containing fraction represents two widely differing phosphoprotein species was premature. Highly purified RIP, prepared by passage through a sulfonated polystyrene column, contained no cysteine, valine, methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, or arginine, and the level of phosphoseryl residues was higher than for any previous report. When this preparation of phosphoprotein was dephosphorylated (dP-RIP) and rechromatographed on DEAE-cellulose, a partial separation into two fractions was observed. Automated Edman degradation of fraction dP-RIP suggested the presence of two NH2-terminal sequences: Asp-Asp-Asp-Asn and Asp-Asp-Pro-Asn. However, this material displayed a single protein band when applied to 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The apparent molecular weight of dP-RIP, compared to standard globular proteins, was about 72,000. The data suggest that rat dentin contains at least two major molecular species of RIP that are closely related in size and-structure. In addition, preliminary evidence suggested that other minor forms of related phosphoproteins may exist."
https://openalex.org/W2025552464,"Sarcolemmal membrane vesicles isolated from canine ventricular tissue accumulate calcium through the sodium-calcium exchange system when an outwardly directed sodium gradient is generated across the vesicle membrane. Moreover, calcium uptake under these conditions is accompanied by the transient accumulation of the lipophilic cation tetraphenylphosphonium. Since the distribution of tetraphenylphosphonium across biological membranes reflects the magnitude and direction of transmembrane potential differences and the characteristics of the transient accumulation of this cation closely resemble those of sodium-calcium exchange activity, it is concluded that a membrane potential, interior negative, is produced during calcium accumulation through the exchange system. Thus, the operation of the sodium-calcium exchange system generates a current in cardiac membrane vesicles, suggesting that three or more sodium ions exchange for each calcium ion."
https://openalex.org/W2093919695,"The human genes for growth hormone (GH), chorionic somatomammotropin (CSH), and a third growth hormone-like gene (GHL) have been located on chromosome 17 in humans. DNA fragments of 2.6, 2.8, and 9.5 kilobase pairs containing GH, CSH, and GHL, respectively, were identified in human genomic DNA, and a 7.5-kilobase DNA fragment related to growth hormone DNA sequences was found in mouse cells. In somatic hybrids of human and mouse cells containing reduced numbers of human chromosomes, but a normal complement of mouse chromosomes, the mouse 7.5-kilobase DNA fragment was always present, whereas the 2.6-, 2.8-, and 9.5-kilobase human fragments were present only when human chromosome 17 was also present."
https://openalex.org/W2040122018,"Antibodies, by virtue of marked selectivity and affinity, may lend themselves to identification of structures of unique antigenic specificity in vivo. In experimental myocardial infarction in dogs, F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies to cardiac myosin that had been labeled with iodine-131 were shown to localize within the lesion. Because the energy characteristics of iodine isotopes are not ideal for imaging with a gamma camera, a new method for labeling antibody fragments with divalent or polyvalent radionuclides was developed. A bifunctional chelating agent, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was covalently coupled, by an amide bond, to Fab fragments of antibodies to canine cardiac myosin. A stable chelate was then formed with indium-111, a nuclide that has appropriate half-life and energy characteristics for gamma imaging. Antibodies treated in this way retain their antigen-binding activity and are useful in locating myocardial infarcts in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2074835946,"False bad news about population growth, natural resources, and the environment is published widely in the face of contradictory evidence. For example, the world supply of arable land has actually been increasing, the scarcity of natural resources including food and energy has been decreasing, and basic measures of U.S. environmental quality show positive trends. The aggregate data show no long-run negative effect of population growth upon the standard of living. Models that embody forces omitted in the past, especially the influence of population size upon productivity increase, suggest a long-run positive effect of additional people."
https://openalex.org/W2002666303,"A polymorphic Hpa I endonuclease recognition site on the 3′ side of the β-globin gene was used to analyze the evolution of the β-globin gene mutants S and C. Study of the worldwide distribution of the normal and variant Hpa I sites showed that the mutation which resulted in the variant 13.0-kilobase fragment arose in a localized region in West Africa. It predated the hemoglobin S and C mutations, both of which arose separately from a chromosome with the variant 13.0-kilobase Hpa I site. In contrast, the sickle genes in other parts of Africa and in Asia are associated with the normal 7.6-kilobase Hpa I fragment, indicating that the sickle mutations in these other areas arose separately from that in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1538094581,"Dry wheat embryos were allowed to imbibe water in the presence or absence of an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis (alpha-amanitin). At each of a series of times after the onset of imbibition, newly synthesized polypeptides were labeled, isolated, and compared with those made by cell-free translation of RNA prepared from the same embryos. In the absence of alpha-amanitin, characteristic time-dependent changes in the relative proportions of many polypeptides in the electrophoretic distributions of proteins synthesized in imbibing wheat embryos could be correlated with parallel changes in the cell-free translational capacity of bulk mRNA from the same embryos. These changes were virtually eliminated when alpha-amanitin was present in the imbibing medium. The findings are consistent with the possibility that transcription of new mRNA, which begins with the onset of imbibition, is responsible for change in the electrophoretic distributions of nascent polypeptides between 40 min and 5 h postimbibition of dry wheat embryos (Cuming, A. C. & Lane, B. G (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 99, 217-224). Allied with the principal investigation, a useful modification has been developed in order to obtain an improved field of resolution (encompassing a range of Mr values between less than 5 X 10(5) and greater than 200 X 10(3), without using a gradient in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel."

The decrease was antagonized by amfonelic acid, an inhibitor of uptake into dopamine neurons. The long-lasting depletion of cerebral dopamine by amphetamine may be analogous to the depletion of cerebral serotonin by halogenated derivatives of amphetamine."

If molybdate is added to cytosol containing the nontransformed estradiol . receptor complex, it blocks the receptor transformation which otherwise occurs during incubation at 28 degrees C. The inhibition by molybdate is apparent both in sucrose gradient centrifugation analyses of estradiol . receptor complexes and [3H]estradiol dissociation kinetic studies. A molybdate-sensitive change of the nontransformed estradiol . receptor complex can also be inferred from behavior of the estradiol . receptor complex on low ionic strength sucrose gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1500224677,"Rat testis contains a unique H1 histone variant (H1t) not detected in a variety of other rat organs. H1t is extracted from chromatin by salt as expected for an H1 component (released by 0.6 M NaCl but not by 0.3 M); however, in contrast to other mammalian H1 species, H1t is not extracted in significant amounts by 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. H1t is undetectable in testes from 3-or 15-day-old rats, but is evident in extracts from 21-day-old animals. Its initial appearance in the developing testis thus correlates with the progression of germinal cells to the meiotic stage of differentiation. H1t was isolated in homogeneous form by extraction of whole tissue with 0.75 M perchloric acid, fractional precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and two cycles of chromatography over a cation exchange resin (Bio Rex 70). The amino acid composition of H1t differs significantly from that of somatic type H1 variants (for example, higher arginine and methionine content). Its identification as an H1 species is supported by analysis of the two fragments resulting from treatment of the protein with N-bromosuccinimide. H1t, as well as the six recognized somatic type H1 components of rat testis may be resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run in the absence of denaturants at pH 4.5 in the first dimension and in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the second dimension."

https://openalex.org/W1498058603,"Serine esterase inhibitors (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) fluoride, 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-N,N-diphenylcarbamate, or p-nitrophenyl anthranilate) blocked the production of malonyldialdehyde by platelets induced with a variety of stimuli (including thrombin, trypsin, collagen, and A23187). These inhibitors did not block malonyldialdehyde production by platelets from exogenous arachidonic acid. Those inhibitors studied in greater detail (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-N,N-diphenylcarbamate) were shown to inhibit the release of [1-14C]arachidonic acid from phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine in intact platelets but not the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxanes, prostaglandins, or hydroxyfatty acids. These inhibitors also blocked the stimulus-induced production of [32P]phosphatidic acid in intact platelets. Both arachidonic acid release from phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid production have been reported to depend on the production of diglyceride by the action on the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.f a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. That enzyme in the soluble fraction from disrupted platelets was inhibited at concentrations of serine esterase inhibitors which block arachidonic acid release in intact platelets.

The protein is encoded by a 4–5 member multigene family. Mapping of the genomic sequences by DNA blot hybridization suggests that several of the genes are closely linked. RNA excess hybridization kinetics indicate that Discoidin-I mRNA is found in less than one copy per gene per cell during vegetative growth, and increases 500–1000 fold during the first 6 hr of development. The Discoidin-I mRNA concentration decreases during later stages of development. mRNA complementary to the genes shows two bands of ∼1.0–1.1 kb on acrylamide gels, indicating heterogeneity either in the genes or in mRNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W2078047334,"Molecules making up the Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion sites (CIDS) of Chinese hamster V79 cells have been investigated. Previous studies showed that Fab fragments (Fab) of the antibody raised against the surface of V79 cells inhibit the Ca2+-independent aggregation of V79 cells, and that this inhibitory effect is neutralized by the addition of some proteinous substance released from the surface of V79 cells treated with 0.01% trypsin. In the present study, we found that the antibody raised against this substance (anti-TRF) displays the complement-dependent cytotoxicity more strongly to the cells with active CIDS than to those without it. The Fab of this antibody inhibited the Ca2+-independent aggregation of V79 cells strongly, particularly in the presence of a hyaluronidase. Electrophoresis of the materials immunoprecipitated with anti-TRF from lysates of cells labeled with radioactive iodine, monosaccharides or methionine showed that a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 125,000 is the only component to react with this antibody in cells with the active CIDS. Indirect immunofluorescence of anti-TRF showed that the antigens are distributed over the entire surface of V79 cells, and are present only in fibroblastic cells in the primary culture of Chinese hamster hepatic cells. These results suggest that the glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 125,000 has a specific role in the Ca2+-independent adhesion of Chinese hamster fibroblastic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1501490772,"Inducible ornithine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus sp. 30a has been purified to homogeneity as judged by ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis. Unlike histidine decarboxylase from the same species (a pyruvoyl enzyme), ornithine decarboxylase is a pyridoxal phosphate enzyme. The purified enzyme is specific for L-pornithine (Km 1.7 mM; specific activity, 150 to 200 mumol min-1 mg-1 at 37 degrees C) and is inhibited by various homologous omega-amino acids, amines, and polyamines. The native enzyme has an isoelectric point of 4.55 and a molecular weight of 1.04 X 10(6). At pH 7.3 and above, it dissociates reversibly to a species of Mr = 184,000, and on gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate shows a single band of Mr = 85,000. We ascribe these species to the dodecamer, dimer, and monomer, respectively, of a single peptide subunit; electron micrographs show a hexagonal array of apparently dimeric subunits in the native enzyme. Highest enzymatic activity is present in the dodecamer. The holoenzyme is resolved by dialysis against cysteine; spectrophotoemetric titration of the apoenzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate indicates the presence of 1 coenzyme-binding site/monomeric subunit."

The soluble fraction from rat liver also contained the nonspecific, but not the specific phosphatidylglycerol-transfer protein. It is suggested that the specific phosphatidylglycerol-transfer protein, as well as the phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein, which is also present in rat lung, contribute in the lung to the biogenesis of lamellar bodies, the organelles where surfactant phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol are stored prior to secretion onto the alveolar surface."

The contamination zone is estimated to contain 10(5) to 10(6) curies of strontium-90 (reference radionuclide); a relatively small fraction of the total may have been dispersed as an aerosol. A plausible explanation for the incident is the use of now-obsolete techniques for waste storage and cesium-137 isotope separation. However, the source of the contamination was not unequivocally attributable to a single event, and its exact nature must await releaseo of more information by the Soviet Union. Radioactive contamination appears to have resulted in resettlement of the human population from a significant area (100 to 1000 square kilometers). It therefore seems imperative to obtain a complete explanation of the cause (or causes) and consequences of the accident; Soviet experience gained in the application of corrective measures would be invaluable to the world nuclear community."

Although there may be such influence, supplementary hypotheses are also possible. The nickeliferous ores from at least one major smelter in New Caledonia (excess numbers of cancers have been found in these smelter workers) are derived from serpentinized host rocks which contain large amounts of chrysotile asbestos. Analysis indicates that nickel ores from this area are heavily contaminated by these fibers. The deposits are mined for their nickel content, but workers may be exposed to the asbestos fibers contained in the deposits.

https://openalex.org/W1608786402,"Human gamma-thrombin is a three (noncovalently linked)-domain enzyme which contains the known serine protease catalytic triad, Asp-His-Ser, one on each of the three noncovalent domains (Asp 99 on the A-B3 chain). While protein-folding dogma does not necessarily predict that the denatured form of this enzyme could refold to the correct conformation, a monitor of the esterase activity (Tos-Arg-OMe) shows complete recovery of native catalytically active conformation. When compared with the covalently intact alpha form which refolds from urea in less than 2 min with complete return of both clotting and esterase activity, gamma-thrombin requires up to 90 min to regain full esterase activity. The gamma-thrombin reactivation data best fit a single first order rate constant, k = 0.03 +/- 0.005 min-1. It was suggested that the gamma-thrombin renaturation process might represent first the rapid refolding, then subsequent reassociation and reisomerization of the three noncovalent domains to yield a lower energy, fully active, conformation. This study represents the only example known of the refolding (reconstitution) of a three (noncovalent)-domain protein."

https://openalex.org/W1514386986,"The mRNA coding for pre-prolactin (pPRL) of the adult bovine anterior pituitary was purified to 85% homogeneity and used as a template for cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus. The cDNA sequences complementary to pPRL mRNA were further purified by employing a limited back-hybridization step and treatment with S1 nuclease. The pPRL cDNA preparation was judged to be homogeneous by comparing its hybridization kinetics to those of ovalbumin and globin mRNA standards and by thermal melt analysis of the pPRL mRNA:cDNA hybrids. Total cellular RNA was extracted from individual bovine fetal pituitaries of either sex, ranging from 90 to 200 days of gestation, and examined for its pPRL mRNA concentration by hybridization with an excess of pPRL cDNA. The hybridization assay was capable of detecting picogram amounts of pPRL mRNA, e.g. amounts less than 0.002% of input total cellular RNA. These results indicated that from 90 to 200 days of gestation, the levels of pPRL mRNA relative to total cellular RNA in bovine fetal pituitaries increase exponentially. This increase in pPRL mRNA occurs to the same extent in either sex, with the most dramatic shift (over 10-fold) occurring between 120 and 145 days of gestation."
https://openalex.org/W202909609,"Abstract Bovine lens fiber cells contain two major isoacceptors of phenylalanine tRNA, tRNA1Phe and tRNA2Phe whereas lens epithelial cells contain mainly tRNA2Phe (Ortwerth, B.J,, Yonuschot, G.R., Heidlege, J.F., Chu-Der, O.M.Y., Juarez, D., and Hedgcoth, C. (1975) Exp. Eye Res. 20, 417-426). Thus, the induction of a new species of tRNAPhe accompanies the differentiation of lens cells in vivo. These two species of tRNAPhe have been purified and their sequences have been analyzed. The results of the analyses show that the sequence of tRNA2Phe is identical with beef liver tRNAPhe while tRNA1Phe differs from tRNA2Phe by a guanosine to adenosine substitution at position 57. Therefore, the T psi CG sequence in the ribosylthymine loop of tRNA2Phe is replaced by T psi CA in tRNA1Phe, This observation demonstrates a case in which a change in sequence of tRNA isoacceptors accompanies cell development rather than changes in the level of post-transcriptional modification as noted in other systems (reviewed by Osterman L.A. (1979) Biochimie (Paris) 61, 323-342). The conversion of guanosine to adenosine in the ribosylthymine loop of lens tRNA1Phe suggests a possible activation of a new tRNAPhe gene during the differentiation of lens cells, although the possibility that this replacement may be catalyzed by a transglycosylase type enzyme has not been ruled out."

They will range from improved cropping systems for farmers or small labor-intensive enterprises (small and beautiful) to nationwide transportation and communications systems, power grids, and other distribution and marketing capabilities (big and beautiful). Concerted action through a combination of commodity production campaigns, area development efforts, and overhaul of outdated national agencies offers the best prospect for overcoming both hunger and poverty."

The results indicate that stable intermediates are formed in the body and distributed as proximate mutagens."
