https://openalex.org/W4308485699,"Abstract Relatlimab and nivolumab combination immunotherapy improves progression-free survival over nivolumab monotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced melanoma 1 . We investigated this regimen in patients with resectable clinical stage III or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma (NCT02519322). Patients received two neoadjuvant doses (nivolumab 480 mg and relatlimab 160 mg intravenously every 4 weeks) followed by surgery, and then ten doses of adjuvant combination therapy. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate 2 . The combination resulted in 57% pCR rate and 70% overall pathologic response rate among 30 patients treated. The radiographic response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 57%. No grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events were observed in the neoadjuvant setting. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rate was 100% and 92% for patients with any pathologic response, compared to 88% and 55% for patients who did not have a pathologic response ( P = 0.005). Increased immune cell infiltration at baseline, and decrease in M2 macrophages during treatment, were associated with pathologic response. Our results indicate that neoadjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab induces a high pCR rate. Safety during neoadjuvant therapy is favourable compared to other combination immunotherapy regimens. These data, in combination with the results of the RELATIVITY-047 trial 1 , provide further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of this new immunotherapy regimen."

https://openalex.org/W4307657817,"Single-atom catalysts1 make exceptionally efficient use of expensive noble metals and can bring out unique properties1–3. However, applications are usually compromised by limited catalyst stability, which is due to sintering3,4. Although sintering can be suppressed by anchoring the metal atoms to oxide supports1,5,6, strong metal–oxygen interactions often leave too few metal sites available for reactant binding and catalysis6,7, and when exposed to reducing conditions at sufficiently high temperatures, even oxide-anchored single-atom catalysts eventually sinter4,8,9. Here we show that the beneficial effects of anchoring can be enhanced by confining the atomically dispersed metal atoms on oxide nanoclusters or ‘nanoglues’, which themselves are dispersed and immobilized on a robust, high-surface-area support. We demonstrate the strategy by grafting isolated and defective CeOx nanoglue islands onto high-surface-area SiO2; the nanoglue islands then each host on average one Pt atom. We find that the Pt atoms remain dispersed under both oxidizing and reducing environments at high temperatures, and that the activated catalyst exhibits markedly increased activity for CO oxidation. We attribute the improved stability under reducing conditions to the support structure and the much stronger affinity of Pt atoms for CeOx than for SiO2, which ensures the Pt atoms can move but remain confined to their respective nanoglue islands. The strategy of using functional nanoglues to confine atomically dispersed metals and simultaneously enhance their reactivity is general, and we anticipate that it will take single-atom catalysts a step closer to practical applications. Nanometre-sized ‘nanoglue’ islands of CeOx on high-surface-area SiO2 are shown to suppress sintering and confine on average one Pt atom per island, leading to stable single-atom catalysts under oxidizing and reducing environments."
https://openalex.org/W4308286587,"The phytohormone auxin is the major coordinative signal in plant development1, mediating transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling pathway. TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1)/AUXIN-SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) auxin receptors are F-box subunits of ubiquitin ligase complexes. In response to auxin, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and target them for degradation via ubiquitination2,3. Here we identify adenylate cyclase (AC) activity as an additional function of TIR1/AFB receptors across land plants. Auxin, together with Aux/IAAs, stimulates cAMP production. Three separate mutations in the AC motif of the TIR1 C-terminal region, all of which abolish the AC activity, each render TIR1 ineffective in mediating gravitropism and sustained auxin-induced root growth inhibition, and also affect auxin-induced transcriptional regulation. These results highlight the importance of TIR1/AFB AC activity in canonical auxin signalling. They also identify a unique phytohormone receptor cassette combining F-box and AC motifs, and the role of cAMP as a second messenger in plants. Adenylate cyclase activity in TIR1/AFB, the canonical auxin receptor, has an essential role in auxin-mediated root growth inhibition in land plants."
https://openalex.org/W4307658844,"Genetic and epigenetic variation, together with transcriptional plasticity, contribute to intratumour heterogeneity1. The interplay of these biological processes and their respective contributions to tumour evolution remain unknown. Here we show that intratumour genetic ancestry only infrequently affects gene expression traits and subclonal evolution in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using spatially resolved paired whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, we find that the majority of intratumour variation in gene expression is not strongly heritable but rather 'plastic'. Somatic expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified a number of putative genetic controls of expression by cis-acting coding and non-coding mutations, the majority of which were clonal within a tumour, alongside frequent structural alterations. Consistently, computational inference on the spatial patterning of tumour phylogenies finds that a considerable proportion of CRCs did not show evidence of subclonal selection, with only a subset of putative genetic drivers associated with subclone expansions. Spatial intermixing of clones is common, with some tumours growing exponentially and others only at the periphery. Together, our data suggest that most genetic intratumour variation in CRC has no major phenotypic consequence and that transcriptional plasticity is, instead, widespread within a tumour."
https://openalex.org/W4307659092,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) represents a set of heterogeneous myeloid malignancies, and hallmarks include mutations in epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors and kinases1-5. The extent to which mutations in AML drive alterations in chromatin 3D structure and contribute to myeloid transformation is unclear. Here we use Hi-C and whole-genome sequencing to analyse 25 samples from patients with AML and 7 samples from healthy donors. Recurrent and subtype-specific alterations in A/B compartments, topologically associating domains and chromatin loops were identified. RNA sequencing, ATAC with sequencing and CUT&Tag for CTCF, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in the same AML samples also revealed extensive and recurrent AML-specific promoter-enhancer and promoter-silencer loops. We validated the role of repressive loops on their target genes by CRISPR deletion and interference. Structural variation-induced enhancer-hijacking and silencer-hijacking events were further identified in AML samples. Hijacked enhancers play a part in AML cell growth, as demonstrated by CRISPR screening, whereas hijacked silencers have a downregulating role, as evidenced by CRISPR-interference-mediated de-repression. Finally, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 20 AML and normal samples revealed the delicate relationship between DNA methylation, CTCF binding and 3D genome structure. Treatment of AML cells with a DNA hypomethylating agent and triple knockdown of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B enabled the manipulation of DNA methylation to revert 3D genome organization and gene expression. Overall, this study provides a resource for leukaemia studies and highlights the role of repressive loops and hijacked cis elements in human diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4307658722,"The dynamic turnover of actin filaments (F-actin) controls cellular motility in eukaryotes and is coupled to changes in the F-actin nucleotide state1-3. It remains unclear how F-actin hydrolyses ATP and subsequently undergoes subtle conformational rearrangements that ultimately lead to filament depolymerization by actin-binding proteins. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of F-actin in all nucleotide states, polymerized in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ at approximately 2.2 Å resolution. The structures show that actin polymerization induces the relocation of water molecules in the nucleotide-binding pocket, activating one of them for the nucleophilic attack of ATP. Unexpectedly, the back door for the subsequent release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is closed in all structures, indicating that Pi release occurs transiently. The small changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket after ATP hydrolysis and Pi release are sensed by a key amino acid, amplified and transmitted to the filament periphery. Furthermore, differences in the positions of water molecules in the nucleotide-binding pocket explain why Ca2+-actin shows slower polymerization rates than Mg2+-actin. Our work elucidates the solvent-driven rearrangements that govern actin filament assembly and aging and lays the foundation for the rational design of drugs and small molecules for imaging and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W4307424988,"Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale1,2, yet countries sometimes implement policies that increase costs by restricting the free flow of capital, talent and innovation in favour of localizing benefits such as economic growth, employment and trade surpluses3,4. Here we assess the cost savings from a globalized solar photovoltaic (PV) module supply chain. We develop a two-factor learning model using historical capacity, component and input material price data of solar PV deployment in the United States, Germany and China. We estimate that the globalized PV module market has saved PV installers US$24 (19-31) billion in the United States, US$7 (5-9) billion in Germany and US$36 (26-45) billion in China from 2008 to 2020 compared with a counterfactual scenario in which domestic manufacturers supply an increasing proportion of installed capacities over a ten-year period. Projecting the same scenario forwards from 2020 results in estimated solar module prices that are approximately 20-25 per cent higher in 2030 compared with a future with globalized supply chains. International climate policy benefits from a globalized low-carbon value chain4, and these results point to the need for complementary policies to mitigate welfare distribution effects and potential impacts on technological crowding out."
https://openalex.org/W4307657533,"Abstract Colorectal malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related death 1 and have undergone extensive genomic study 2,3 . However, DNA mutations alone do not fully explain malignant transformation 4–7 . Here we investigate the co-evolution of the genome and epigenome of colorectal tumours at single-clone resolution using spatial multi-omic profiling of individual glands. We collected 1,370 samples from 30 primary cancers and 8 concomitant adenomas and generated 1,207 chromatin accessibility profiles, 527 whole genomes and 297 whole transcriptomes. We found positive selection for DNA mutations in chromatin modifier genes and recurrent somatic chromatin accessibility alterations, including in regulatory regions of cancer driver genes that were otherwise devoid of genetic mutations. Genome-wide alterations in accessibility for transcription factor binding involved CTCF, downregulation of interferon and increased accessibility for SOX and HOX transcription factor families, suggesting the involvement of developmental genes during tumourigenesis. Somatic chromatin accessibility alterations were heritable and distinguished adenomas from cancers. Mutational signature analysis showed that the epigenome in turn influences the accumulation of DNA mutations. This study provides a map of genetic and epigenetic tumour heterogeneity, with fundamental implications for understanding colorectal cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W4307658070,"Abstract How cell-to-cell copy number alterations that underpin genomic instability 1 in human cancers drive genomic and phenotypic variation, and consequently the evolution of cancer 2 , remains understudied. Here, by applying scaled single-cell whole-genome sequencing 3 to wild-type, TP53- deficient and TP53 -deficient; BRCA1 -deficient or TP53 -deficient; BRCA2- deficient mammary epithelial cells (13,818 genomes), and to primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) cells (22,057 genomes), we identify three distinct ‘foreground’ mutational patterns that are defined by cell-to-cell structural variation. Cell- and clone-specific high-level amplifications, parallel haplotype-specific copy number alterations and copy number segment length variation (serrate structural variations) had measurable phenotypic and evolutionary consequences. In TNBC and HGSC, clone-specific high-level amplifications in known oncogenes were highly prevalent in tumours bearing fold-back inversions, relative to tumours with homologous recombination deficiency, and were associated with increased clone-to-clone phenotypic variation. Parallel haplotype-specific alterations were also commonly observed, leading to phylogenetic evolutionary diversity and clone-specific mono-allelic expression. Serrate variants were increased in tumours with fold-back inversions and were highly correlated with increased genomic diversity of cellular populations. Together, our findings show that cell-to-cell structural variation contributes to the origins of phenotypic and evolutionary diversity in TNBC and HGSC, and provide insight into the genomic and mutational states of individual cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W4307838856,"Most animals have compound eyes, with tens to thousands of lenses attached rigidly to the exoskeleton. A natural assumption is that all of these species must resort to moving either their head or their body to actively change their visual input. However, classic anatomy has revealed that flies have muscles poised to move their retinas under the stable lenses of each compound eye1-3. Here we show that Drosophila use their retinal muscles to smoothly track visual motion, which helps to stabilize the retinal image, and also to perform small saccades when viewing a stationary scene. We show that when the retina moves, visual receptive fields shift accordingly, and that even the smallest retinal saccades activate visual neurons. Using a head-fixed behavioural paradigm, we find that Drosophila perform binocular, vergence movements of their retinas-which could enhance depth perception-when crossing gaps, and impairing the physiology of retinal motor neurons alters gap-crossing trajectories during free behaviour. That flies evolved an ability to actuate their retinas suggests that moving the eye independently of the head is broadly paramount for animals. The similarities of smooth and saccadic movements of the Drosophila retina and the vertebrate eye highlight a notable example of convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4307644230,"Proposed mechanisms for the production of calcium in the first stars (population III stars)-primordial stars that formed out of the matter of the Big Bang-are at odds with observations1. Advanced nuclear burning and supernovae were thought to be the dominant source of the calcium production seen in all stars2. Here we suggest a qualitatively different path to calcium production through breakout from the 'warm' carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle through a direct experimental measurement of the 19F(p, γ)20Ne breakout reaction down to a very low energy point of 186 kiloelectronvolts, reporting a key resonance at 225 kiloelectronvolts. In the domain of astrophysical interest2, at around 0.1 gigakelvin, this thermonuclear 19F(p, γ)20Ne rate is up to a factor of 7.4 larger than the previous recommended rate3. Our stellar models show a stronger breakout during stellar hydrogen burning than previously thought1,4,5, and may reveal the nature of calcium production in population III stars imprinted on the oldest known ultra-iron-poor star, SMSS0313-67086. Our experimental result was obtained in the China JinPing Underground Laboratory7, which offers an environment with an extremely low cosmic-ray-induced background8. Our rate showcases the effect that faint population III star supernovae can have on the nucleosynthesis observed in the oldest known stars and first galaxies, which are key mission targets of the James Webb Space Telescope9."
https://openalex.org/W4307659179,"Conducting organic materials, such as doped organic polymers1, molecular conductors2,3 and emerging coordination polymers4, underpin technologies ranging from displays to flexible electronics5. Realizing high electrical conductivity in traditionally insulating organic materials necessitates tuning their electronic structure through chemical doping6. Furthermore, even organic materials that are intrinsically conductive, such as single-component molecular conductors7,8, require crystallinity for metallic behaviour. However, conducting polymers are often amorphous to aid durability and processability9. Using molecular design to produce high conductivity in undoped amorphous materials would enable tunable and robust conductivity in many applications10, but there are no intrinsically conducting organic materials that maintain high conductivity when disordered. Here we report an amorphous coordination polymer, Ni tetrathiafulvalene tetrathiolate, which displays markedly high electronic conductivity (up to 1,200 S cm−1) and intrinsic glassy-metallic behaviour. Theory shows that these properties are enabled by molecular overlap that is robust to structural perturbations. This unusual set of features results in high conductivity that is stable to humid air for weeks, pH 0–14 and temperatures up to 140 °C. These findings demonstrate that molecular design can enable metallic conductivity even in heavily disordered materials, raising fundamental questions about how metallic transport can exist without periodic structure and indicating exciting new applications for these materials. An unusual new material, NiTTFtt, is reported that is structurally amorphous, precluding a classical band structure, but detailed characterization reveals high conductivity and a metallic character."
https://openalex.org/W4307659347,"The SEA complex (SEAC) is a growth regulator that acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) towards Gtr1, a Rag GTPase that relays nutrient status to the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) in yeast1. Functionally, the SEAC has been divided into two subcomplexes: SEACIT, which has GAP activity and inhibits TORC1, and SEACAT, which regulates SEACIT2. This system is conserved in mammals: the GATOR complex, consisting of GATOR1 (SEACIT) and GATOR2 (SEACAT), transmits amino acid3 and glucose4 signals to mTORC1. Despite its importance, the structure of SEAC/GATOR, and thus molecular understanding of its function, is lacking. Here, we solve the cryo-EM structure of the native eight-subunit SEAC. The SEAC has a modular structure in which a COPII-like cage corresponding to SEACAT binds two flexible wings, which correspond to SEACIT. The wings are tethered to the core via Sea3, which forms part of both modules. The GAP mechanism of GATOR1 is conserved in SEACIT, and GAP activity is unaffected by SEACAT in vitro. In vivo, the wings are essential for recruitment of the SEAC to the vacuole, primarily via the EGO complex. Our results indicate that rather than being a direct inhibitor of SEACIT, SEACAT acts as a scaffold for the binding of TORC1 regulators."
https://openalex.org/W4307412641,"Social computing software and online tools are gaining credence in teaching and learning spaces, including higher education contexts. However, the adoption of social computing software does not automatically translate into effective teaching and learning if students' views and needs are not considered along with course learning outcomes. Thus, this study was conducted to explore students' perspectives and preferences for social computing software and online tools in a university elective course. We employed quantitative and qualitative approaches to understand students' shared and nuanced thoughts about social computing applications in the study. A questionnaire with quantitative and open-ended qualitative questions was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis approach. Our findings indicated mixed students' viewpoints, with some tools reported as highly beneficial while others were less beneficial. For instance, students valued asynchronous sessions, assignment feedback, online discussion, videos, and gamification but reported less interest in phones, journals, icons, and blogs. Students' specializations also appeared to influence their choice of tools. Those from Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences expressed a slightly different preference than their comparts from Medicine and Health Sciences. Drawing on the findings, we discuss the implications for effective teaching and learning using social computing software, focusing on essential stakeholders. For instance, instructors must regularly conduct diagnostic feedback to determine appropriate tools that can effectively customize students' learning."

https://openalex.org/W4307441946,"Ecosystem services such as food provisioning, climate regulation, nutrient cycling, or recreation in open landscapes underpin human wellbeing. They are highly dependent on land use, land cover and utilization pattern as well as environmental factors like climate, topography and soil. In consequence, ecosystem services supply shows a high spatial variability. However, it is less clear if the perception of the importance of ecosystem services is similarly heterogeneous in space and amongst societal actors. The aim of this large-scale study was to explore whether land cover and climate gradients as well as socio-cultural factors influence the perceptions of ecosystem services of four groups of societal actors: citizens, farmers, foresters and nature managers. Spatially explicit survey data of 3018 respondents allowed to gain insight into the distribution of perceived importance of 21 ecosystem services in the federal state of Bavaria, Germany together with the respondents' socio-cultural characterisation (e.g. gender, education and hobbies in nature). Responses were analysed through descriptive statistics, redundancy analysis, and Generalized Linear Models. Results reveal that the perceived importance of many ecosystem services was consistently high across groups, although perception differed for some ecosystem services (e.g. production of energy plants and timber as well as recreation in urban green space). Compared to other actor groups, farmers attributed slightly lower importance to all ES except provisioning services. Socio-cultural factors better explained variability in perceived importance of ecosystem services than land cover and climate gradients. This might be either explained by the fact that the environmental gradients vary not strong enough in our case study or that they do not shape the perceptions of respondents. A limitation of the study is that the sample of respondents obtained is not representative for the population, but biased towards persons interested in the topics of the survey. Still the consensus indicated by the overall positive perception of ecosystem services among respondents highlights the integrative potential of ecosystem services when included in decision-making."

Although there are studies conducted before, the magnitude of PTB remains a major issue in most developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence and associated factors of premature birth among newborns delivered in Amhara Region Referral Hospitals, Northern Ethiopia.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was undertaken from February to April 2020. A systematic sampling technique was used to select 482 mother-newborn pairs. The data were collected by interviewing the mothers and reviewing their charts using a structured and pretested questionnaire. The outcome variable was preterm birth. Data were entered using Epi-data version 4.6 and then analyzed using STATA software (version 14). Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to determine the risk factors associated with premature birth.In this study, the prevalence of premature birth was 11.41% (95% CI: 8.9, 14.6%). In multivariable logistic regression model; maternal age < 20 years (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 7.8: 95% CI 2.3-26), preeclampsia (AOR = 5: 95% CI 2.3-11), premature rupture of membrane (AOR = 3.9: 95%CI 1.6-9.0), chronic medical illness (AOR = 4.6:95% CI2.1-10), and history of stillbirth (AOR = 2.7: 95% CI 1.1-7.3) were significantly associated with preterm birth.The study indicates preterm birth is a major public health problem among newborns delivered in Amhara region referral hospitals. The risk factors associated with preterm birth are maternal age <20 years, preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, chronic medical illness, and history of stillbirth. Therefore, public health interventions have to be made to reduce the burden of prematurity through early detection and management of preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, and chronic medical illness. Obstetric care providers should give due attention to women with an age of <20 years and a history of stillbirth."

This study aims to classify bronchitis and pneumonia in children by analyzing cough sounds. We propose a C lassification F ramework based on C ough S ounds (CFCS) to identify bronchitis and pneumonia in children. Our dataset includes cough sounds from 173 outpatients at the West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. We adopt aggregation operation to obtain patients’ disease features because some cough chunks carry the disease information while others do not. In the stage of classification in our framework, we adopt Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the diseases due to the small scale of our dataset. Furthermore, we apply data augmentation to our dataset to enlarge the number of samples and then adopt Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to classify. After 45 random tests on RAW dataset, SVM achieves the best classification accuracy of 86.04% and standard deviation of 4.7%. The precision of bronchitis and pneumonia is 93.75% and 87.5%, and their recall is 88.24% and 93.33%. The AUC of SVM and LSTM classification models on the dataset with pitch-shifting data augmentation reach 0.92 and 0.93, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4307411067,"Objective Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is associated with both motor and non-motor problems, such as cognitive impairment. Particular focus in this area has been on the relationship between language impairment and decline in other cognitive functions, with the literature currently inconclusive on how the nature and degree of language impairment relate to cognition or other measures of disease severity. In addition, little information is available on how language problems identified in experimental task set-ups relate to competency in self-generated language paradigms such as picture description, monologues or conversations. This study aimed to inform clinical management of language impairment in PD by exploring (1) language performance across a range of experimental as well as self-generated language tasks, (2) how the relationship between these two aspects might be affected by the nature of the cognitive and language assessment; and (3) to what degree performance can be predicted across the language tasks. Methods 22 non-demented people with PD (PwPD) and 22 healthy control participants performed a range of cognitive and language tasks. Cognitive tasks included a screening assessment in addition to tests for set shifting, short term memory, attention, as well as letter and category fluency. Language was investigated in highly controlled grammar tasks as well as a Sentence Generation and a Narrative. Results The study highlighted impaired ability in set-shifting and letter fluency in the executive function tasks, and a higher rate of grammatical and lexical errors across all language tasks in the PD group. The performance in the grammar task was linked to set shifting ability, but error rates in Sentence Generation and Narrative were independent of this. There was no relevant relationship between performances across the three language tasks. Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a link between executive function and language performance, but that this is task dependent in non-demented PwPD. This has implications for the management of language impairment in PD, both for assessment and for designing effective interventions."

The outbreak was studied retrospectively, and population-based screening was used to assess the extent of virus circulation and decelerate transmission. Cases were SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed and were residents of Lansingerland (November 16th 2020 until February 22th 2021), or had an epidemiological link with School X or neighbouring schools. The SARS-CoV-2 variant was determined using variant PCR or whole genome sequencing. A questionnaire primarily assessed clinical symptoms. A total of 77 Alpha variant cases were found with an epidemiological link to School X, 16 Alpha variant cases linked to the neighbouring schools, and 146 Alpha variant cases among residents of Lansingerland without a link to the schools. The mean number of self-reported symptoms was not significantly different among Alpha variant infected individuals compared to non-Alpha infected individuals. The secondary attack rate (SAR) among Alpha variant exposed individuals in households was 52% higher compared to non-Alpha variant exposed individuals (p = 0.010), with the mean household age, and mean number of children and adults per household as confounders. Sequence analysis of 60 Alpha variant sequences obtained from cases confirmed virus transmission between School X and neighbouring schools, and showed that multiple introductions of the Alpha variant had already taken place in Lansingerland at the time of the study. The alpha variant caused a large outbreak at both locations of School X, and subsequently spread to neighbouring schools, and households.

We conducted a prospective longitudinal evaluation of 11 consenting SARS-CoV-2–positive nursing home residents to evaluate the quantitative titers and durability of binding antibodies detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 vaccination. The evaluation included nine visits over 150 days from October 25, 2020, through April 1, 2021. Visits included questionnaire administration, blood collection for serology, and paired anterior nasal specimen collection for testing by BinaxNOW ™ COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and viral culture. We evaluated quantitative titers of binding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-infection and post-vaccination (beginning after the first dose of the primary series). The median age among participants was 74 years; one participant was immunocompromised. Of 10 participants with post-infection serology results, 9 (90%) had detectable Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgA antibodies, and 8 (80%) had detectable IgM antibodies. At first antibody detection post-infection, two-thirds (6/9, 67%) of participants were RT-PCR–positive, but none were culture- positive. Ten participants received vaccination; all had detectable Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgA antibodies through their final observation ≤90 days post-first dose. Post-vaccination geometric means of IgG titers were 10–200-fold higher than post-infection. Nursing home residents in this cohort mounted robust immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 post-infection and post-vaccination. The augmented antibody responses post-vaccination are potential indicators of enhanced protection that vaccination may confer on previously infected nursing home residents."

Results Our study included 2914 people living with HIV. Two hundred and forty-two (8.3%) patients had hyperglycemia, with an increasing prevalence by age. Three hundred one (9.7%) participants died over the median 3.71 (IQR: 2.14–5.37) years of follow-up. Among these, 139 (46.2%) were due to AIDS- related causes, 123 (40.9%)—were due to non-AIDS causes, and in 39 (12.9%) cases, the cause of death could not be determined. Overall, the cohort contributed to 11,148 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), translating into a mortality rate of 2.70 deaths per 100 PYFU. The mortality rate was significantly higher among individuals with hyperglycemia—11.17 deaths per 100 PYFU vs 2.07 deaths per 100 PYFU among normoglycemic patients(p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions Hyperglycemia was associated with increased odds of mortality. Screening and management of hyperglycemia should be integrated into routine HIV clinical services as part of a comprehensive care package."
https://openalex.org/W4307639687,"More travellers are making swift ascents to higher altitudes without sufficient acclimatization or pharmaceutical prophylaxis as road connectivity develops in the Himalayan region of Nepal. Our study connects ascent rate with prevalence and severity of acute mountain sickness (AMS) among patients admitted to the emergency ward of the Mustang district hospital in Nepal. A register-based, cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2018 and June 2019 to explore associations of Lake Louise scores with ascent profile, sociodemographic characteristics, and comorbidities using chi-square test, t-test, and Bayesian logistic regression. Of 105 patients, incidence of AMS was 74%, of which 61%, 36%, and 3% were mild, moderate, and severe cases, respectively. In the Bayesian-ordered logistic model of AMS severity, ascent rate (odds ratio 3.13) and smoking (odds ratio 0.16) were significant at a 99% credible interval. Based on the model-derived counterfactual, the risk of developing moderate or severe AMS for a middle-aged, non-smoking male traveling from Pokhara to Muktinath (2978m altitude gain) in a single day is twice that of making the ascent in three days. Ascent rate was strongly associated with the likelihood of developing severe AMS among travellers with AMS symptoms visiting Mustang Hospital’s Emergency Ward."
https://openalex.org/W4307640258,"Obesity is a growing problem worldwide, especially in countries with improved socioeconomic circumstances. Also, in the Netherlands the incidence of overweight and obesity is rising. There is increasing evidence on the association between obesity and tumorigenesis. Of all cancer types, endometrial cancer (EC) has the strongest positive correlation with obesity. Obesity is generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) >30, yet does not cover the differences in fat distribution in visceral and subcutaneous compartments. Visceral fat is assumed to be relatively more metabolically active and likely negative prognostic biomarker in non-endometrioid EC. Whereas subcutaneous fat is mainly responsible for oestrogen production through increased aromatase activity.The aim of this study is to compare hormone levels and inflammatory markers after bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in obese and non-obese patients. Secondary objectives are to compare the effect of fat distribution and diagnosis (benign vs. EC) on the observed changes in hormone levels and inflammatory markers, and to compare the effect of BSO on menopausal complaints.Prospective multicentre observational cohort study. A total of 160 patients will be included, of which 80 patients with a normal BMI (18-25 kg/m2) and 80 patients with an obese BMI >32-35 kg/m2. Preoperative abdominal CT will be performed and fasting venous blood samples are obtained for hormone levels and inflammation markers analysis. During surgery, adipose tissue biopsies of subcutaneous and visceral (omental and intestinal epiploic fat) compartments will be collected and stored fresh frozen. In addition a fasting blood draw six weeks after surgery will be obtained. All subjects will fill in two questionnaires before surgery and one after surgery.We hypothesize that BMI, the type of fat distribution, and possibly the underlying pathology significantly influence in hormone levels, and systemic inflammation changes after BSO. Previous studies have found several clues for a relationship between obesity and endometrial cancer. We expect that our study will contribute to pinpoint the exact differences between 'healthy obesity' and 'unhealthy obesity' and will help to identify patients that are more at risk of developing cancer (or possibly suffer from other related problems such as cardiovascular problems e.g.)."
https://openalex.org/W4307640648,"Background Precise models are necessary to estimate mortality risk following traumatic injury to inform clinical decision making or quantify hospital performance. The Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) has been the historical gold standard in survival prediction but its limitations are well-characterized. The present study used International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision (ICD-10) injury codes with machine learning approaches to develop models whose performance was compared to that of TRISS. Methods The 2015–2017 National Trauma Data Bank was used to identify patients following trauma-related admission. Injury codes from ICD-10 were grouped by clinical relevance into 1,495 variables. The TRISS score, which comprises the Injury Severity Score, age, mechanism (blunt vs penetrating) as well as highest 24-hour values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was calculated for each patient. A base eXtreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost), a machine learning technique, was developed using injury variables as well as age, SBP, RR, mechanism and GCS. Prediction of in-hospital survival and other in-hospital complications were compared between both models using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and reliability plots. A complete XGBoost model, containing injury variables, vitals, demographic information and comorbidities, was additionally developed. Results Of 1,380,740 patients, 1,338,417 (96.9%) survived to discharge. Compared to survivors, those who died were older and had a greater prevalence of penetrating injuries (18.0% vs 9.44%). The base XGBoost model demonstrated a greater receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) than TRISS (0.950 vs 0.907) which persisted across sub-populations and secondary endpoints. Furthermore, it exhibited high calibration across all risk levels (R 2 = 0.998 vs 0.816). The complete XGBoost model had an exceptional ROC of 0.960. Conclusions We report improved performance of machine learning models over TRISS. Our model may improve stratification of injury severity in clinical and quality improvement settings."
https://openalex.org/W4307641195,"Background Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) workers travel to work at isolated locations, and rotate continuous workdays with leave periods at home, and such work practice is common in the offshore oil and gas and onshore mining industry worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying public health actions appear to have had a negative impact on several health-related behaviours among the general population. However, little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health behaviours of FIFO workers, who have shown higher pre-pandemic rates of risky behaviours than the general population in Australia. This study examined the health-related behaviours of FIFO workers in the mining industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. FIFO workers from an Australian mining company who underwent COVID-19 screening between May and November 2020 completed an online survey about their regular health-related behaviours. The independent sample t-test and Pearson’s chi-square test where appropriate were conducted to examine the differences between males and females for the behavioural outcomes. Results A total of 768 FIFO workers (633 males and 135 females) participated in the study. Prevalence of smoking was high (32%). Males smoked more cigarettes per day than females (15.2±7.0 vs 13.1±7.1, p = .174). Most participants (74.7%) drank alcohol on more than two days per week. Compared to females, more males (20.2% vs 8.0%) consumed alcohol at short-term harmful levels ( p = .010). About a third (34.4%) of the workers (33.5% of males and 38.5% of females, p = .264) engaged in inadequate moderate-vigorous exercises/physical activity. About a third (33.1%) of workers (33.7% of males and 30.4% of females; p = .699) had multiple risk behaviours. Conclusions Prevalence of multiple risk behaviours was high. Interventions aimed at the prevention of risky health-related behaviours should target the different behavioural patterns and may require emphasis on gender-informed techniques particularly when addressing alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4296334641,"Translation terminates by releasing the polypeptide chain in one of two chemical reactions catalyzed by the ribosome. Release is also a target for engineering, as readthrough of a stop codon enables incorporation of unnatural amino acids and treatment of genetic diseases. Hydrolysis of the ester bond of peptidyl-tRNA requires conformational changes of both a class I release factor (RF) protein and the peptidyl transferase center of a large subunit rRNA. The rate-limiting step was proposed to be hydrolysis at physiological pH and an RF conformational change at higher pH, but evidence was indirect. Here, we tested this by activating the ester electrophile at the Escherichia coli ribosomal P site using a trifluorine-substituted amino acid. Quench-flow kinetics revealed that RF1-catalyzed release could be accelerated, but only at pH 6.2-7.7 and not higher pH. This provided direct evidence for rate-limiting hydrolysis at physiological or lower pH and a different rate limitation at higher pH. Additionally, we optimized RF-free release catalyzed by unacylated tRNA or the CCA trinucleotide (in 30% acetone). We determined that these two model release reactions, although very slow, were surprisingly accelerated by the trifluorine analog but to a different extent from each other and from RF-catalyzed release. Hence, hydrolysis was rate limiting in all three reactions. Furthermore, in 20% ethanol, we found that there was significant competition between fMet-ethyl ester formation and release in all three release reactions. We thus favor proposed mechanisms for translation termination that do not require a fully-negatively-charged OH− nucleophile.

We thus favor proposed mechanisms for translation termination that do not require a fully-negatively-charged OH− nucleophile. Stop codons within mRNAs are recognized during translation at the ribosomal A site by class I release factors (RFs), termed RF1 and RF2 in bacteria. RF1 binds UAA and UAG, whereas RF2 binds UAA and UGA. The bound RF then undergoes a conformational change that causes the peptidyl-tRNA ester electrophile at the P site to be attacked by a water or hydroxide nucleophile (1Loh P.G. Song H. Structural and mechanistic insights into translation termination.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the polypeptide dissociates from the ribosome (Fig. 1A). After peptidyl release, the class II RF termed RF3 disassociates RF1 or RF2 from the ribosome and enables a recycling of protein synthesis by ribosome recycling factor (2Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. Macdougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Release factor RF3 in E. coli accelerates the dissociation of release factors RF1 and RF2 from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic class I RFs share the universally conserved motif Gly-Gly-Gln (GGQ), and mutation of each of these amino acids is lethal (3Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. The essential role of the invariant GGQ motif in the function and stability in vivo of bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In vitro, mutations in GGQ either decrease RF efficiency or induce nonspecific binding of nucleophiles (4Shaw J.J. Green R. Two distinct components of release factor function uncovered by nucleophile partitioning analysis.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 458-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that correlate with lethality. Furthermore, the Gln side-chain amide is methylated in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and the methylation is important for improving the accuracy of peptidyl release (5Pundir S. Ge X. Sanyal S. GGQ methylation enhances both speed and accuracy of stop codon recognition by bacterial class-I release factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Crystallography of free class I RF found that the distance between the GGQ and RF sequence that binds the stop codon was too little to span from the codon to the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC), but crystallography of the activated release complex (RC) showed that the RF had opened up to span the distance (1Loh P.G. Song H. Structural and mechanistic insights into translation termination.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Time-resolved cryo-EM further revealed that, within 24 ms of binding to the pretermination ribosomal complex at 25 °C, one-quarter of the RFs were in the compact conformation, whereas, within 60 s, virtually all RFs had opened (6Fu Z. Indrisiunaite G. Kaledhonkar S. Shah B. Sun M. Chen B. et al.The structural basis for release-factor activation during translation termination revealed by time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the water substrate has not been placed reliably, it was suggested that it hydrogen bonds to the methylated Gln to facilitate nucleophilic attack (7Jin H. Kelley A.C. Loakes D. Ramakrishnan V. Structure of the 70S ribosome bound to release factor 2 and a substrate analogue provides insights into catalysis of peptide release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 8593-8598Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The RNA moieties of the PTC and peptidyl-tRNA substrate are also involved in release, which makes sense considering that ribosomal release and peptidyl transfer share the same ribosomal locations and similar mechanisms. The 2′OH of the peptidyl-tRNA 3′-terminal A76 was found to mediate substrate-assisted catalysis for both peptidyl transfer and release (8Zaher H.S. Shaw J.J. Strobel S.A. Green R. The 2’-OH group of the peptidyl-tRNA stabilizes an active conformation of the ribosomal PTC.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, release is abolished by mutation of the universally conserved A2602 of the PTC, although peptidyl transfer withstands this (9Amort M. Wotzel B. Bakowska-Zywicka K. Erlacher M.D. Micura R. Polacek N. An intact ribose moiety at A2602 of 23S rRNA is key to trigger peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis during translation termination.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5130-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Remarkably, efficient release was even possible in vitro if the RF was substituted with unacylated tRNA or CCA trinucleotide (10Caskey C.T. Beaudet A.L. Rosman E. Hydrolysis of fMet-tRNA by peptidyl transferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3163-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), although 30% acetone was required. Crystallography showed that the CCA performed two functions: (i) binding the PTC to cause an activating conformational change nearly identical to that occurring for peptidyl transfer and (ii) positioning the water nucleophile to attack the ester (11Simonović M. Steitz T.A. Peptidyl-CCA deacylation on the ribosome promoted by induced fit and the O3’-hydroxyl group of A76 of the unacylated A-site tRNA.RNA. 2008; 14: 2372-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for release (12Kuhlenkoetter S. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Different substrate-dependent transition states in the active site of the ribosome.Nature. 2011; 476: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y.

Åqvist J. Peptide release on the ribosome involves substrate-assisted base catalysis.ACS Catal. 2016; 6: 8432-8439Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) where the crucial A76 2′OH plays an identical role or a different role from that proposed in peptidyl transfer. Release or peptidyl transfer could either begin with deprotonation of the 2′OH or be concerted, and 4-, 6-, and 8-membered ring mechanisms are possible, depending on how many OH groups are directly involved. Both release and peptidyl transfer are accelerated by higher pH (12Kuhlenkoetter S. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Different substrate-dependent transition states in the active site of the ribosome.Nature. 2011; 476: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y.

Ieong K.W. Trobro S. Strazewski P. Åqvist J. Pavlov M.Y. et al.pH-sensitivity of the ribosomal peptidyl transfer reaction dependent on the identity of the A-site aminoacyl-tRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The pH-sensitive group(s) in release is thought to be the nucleophilic water/OH−, nearby waters or the A76 2′OH, but other ribosomal or RF groups cannot be ruled out. Mindful that their results were consistent with titration of an unknown group with pKa of 7.6, Indrisiunaite et al. (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) favored instead that their pH sensitivity below pH 7.6 reflected rate-limiting hydrolysis chemistry, whereas their lack of pH sensitivity above pH 7.6 reflected a rate-limiting conformational change of the RF. Another conformational change to consider is the activating one at the PTC (11Simonović M. Steitz T.A. Peptidyl-CCA deacylation on the ribosome promoted by induced fit and the O3’-hydroxyl group of A76 of the unacylated A-site tRNA.RNA. 2008; 14: 2372-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as this may also be pH insensitive and its rate is unknown. The rate of the actual release of a short peptide from the ribosome after hydrolysis (kdiss in Fig. 1A) was determined not to be rate limiting (see Table 2 of Ref. (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) based on a comparison between quench-flow kinetics (which used radioactivity to measure up to the hydrolysis chemistry) and stopped flow kinetics (which used an N-terminal fluorophore to measure up to, and including, the dissociation of the free peptide from the ribosome). Thus, for clarity, we define release here as meaning all the steps in Figure 1A except kdiss. To summarize, the termination process in Figure 1A is likely to be rate limited by one of four steps: (i) binding of the RF to the ribosome, (ii) the conformational change of the RF from compact to open, (iii) the activating conformational change of the ribosomal PTC, or (iv) hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester at the P site. In vitro, step (i) was generally not limiting because of using saturating RF, but (ii)–(iv) could not be distinguished conclusively. We reasoned that step (iv) could be monitored directly by making the unique ester in the RC more electrophilic. Previously, we found that a slow ribosomal peptide formation could be accelerated by incorporating three fluorines into the amino-acid side chain at the P site; hydrolysis assays off the ribosome found that this trifluoro substitution chemically activated the ester 11-fold (16Wang J. Kwiatkowski M. Forster A.C. Ribosomal peptide syntheses from activated substrates reveal rate limitation by an unexpected step at the peptidyl site.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 15587-15595Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As ribosomal peptide bond formation is chemically related to peptidyl ester hydrolysis, we wondered if such an activated analog might also accelerate release (Fig. 1C, red and green; Fig. S1B cartoon). Defining the rate-limiting step(s) in termination is important to understand experimental read out, in vivo accuracy of termination, and evolutionary bottlenecks for optimization. Also, this knowledge might aid applications with unnatural amino acids where their incorporation typically competes poorly with release (17Vogel C. Gynn A.H. Yuan J. Bao L. Liljeruhm J. Forster A.C. Rationally designed Spot 42 RNAs with an inhibition/toxicity profile advantageous for engineering E. coli.Eng. Rep. 2020; 2e12126Google Scholar) and aid therapies with drugs that compete with release (18Welch E. Barton E. Zhuo J. Tomizawa Y. Friesen W.J. Trifillis P. et al.PTC124 targets genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations.Nature. 2007; 447: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In contrast to many release assays that harbored only one amino acid at the P site and also our acceleration of peptide bond formation, here we mostly used purified RCs harboring tripeptides (Fig. 2A). This allowed for ready incorporation of radiolabel via the fMet and may be more physiological as a tripeptide is longer and showed 1.4- and 2.8-fold faster release than fMet by RF1 and RF2, respectively (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In order to place our trifluoromethylalanine (TFMeAla) analog at the third position instead of the first, rather than irreversibly acetylating the amino group of TFMeAla (16Wang J. Kwiatkowski M. Forster A.C. Ribosomal peptide syntheses from activated substrates reveal rate limitation by an unexpected step at the peptidyl site.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 15587-15595Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the pCpA-amino acid was acylated here with NVOC to allow photodeprotection (see the Experimental procedures section) and subsequent peptide bond formation. Two potential concerns with this tripeptide approach were (i) chemical activation of the analog’s ester is concomitant with partial deactivation of the amino nucleophile for prior peptide bond formation (Fig. 1C; ignore the green) and (ii) an RC with an activated ester (Fig. 2A) is less stable through synthesis, purification, and storage. In practice, however, using chemoenzymatically synthesized TFMeAla–tRNAAlaBUGC, we found that activated RCs could nevertheless be formed, purified, and stored with similar efficiency and residual activity to the control complex made with methylalanine (MeAla)–tRNAAlaBUGC (Fig. 1D; see the Experimental procedures section). Armed with RCs to test for rate-limiting chemistry in release, rapid time points of the reaction were obtained by addition of saturating RF1 (5Pundir S. Ge X. Sanyal S. GGQ methylation enhances both speed and accuracy of stop codon recognition by bacterial class-I release factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in a quench-flow apparatus (Figs. 2A and S1). Interestingly, TFMeAla significantly accelerated the rate of release at pH 7.5 compared with MeAla (Fig. S1C, which is a subset of Fig. 2D). This was, to our knowledge, the first acceleration of release by substrate activation and the first direct evidence for rate-limiting hydrolysis chemistry. However, the activation was only 1.5-fold (kobs = 30.4 ± 1.3 s−1 versus kobs = 20.6 ± 3.4 s−1 in Table S1) compared with 11-fold chemical activation per se of very similar model compounds (off the ribosome) and 27-fold or no acceleration of slow and fast ribosomal peptide bond formations, respectively (16Wang J. Kwiatkowski M. Forster A.C. Ribosomal peptide syntheses from activated substrates reveal rate limitation by an unexpected step at the peptidyl site.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 15587-15595Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the smaller effect here is that accelerating hydrolysis unmasked another rate-limiting step. Alternatively, the fluorines may favor a suboptimal orientation at the P site for hydrolysis. Next, we varied the pH because the innate rate of alkaline hydrolysis of the ester should increase linearly with OH− concentration, notwithstanding any potential effect of pH on another step. Indrisiunaite et al. (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that release increased linearly with OH− concentration at lower pHs but saturated at higher pHs, hypothesizing that rate limitation switched at higher pH from hydrolysis to a pH-independent conformational change of RF1, thereby masking ever-faster innate hydrolysis on the ribosome. Our pH sensitivity of release rates with the control tripeptide containing MeAla was also hyperbolic, not linear, saturating at higher pHs (Fig. 2, B and D, black). It looked similar to that of Indrisiunaite et al. (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that our pH dependence was less marked at acidic pHs. A possible explanation for the loss of linearity at our extremes of pH is due to partial denaturation of the RC and/or RF1. For TFMeAla (Fig. 2C), release was accelerated compared with MeAla by up to twofold at lower to mid pHs but had minimal effect at higher pHs (Fig. 2D and Table S1). Saturation occurred at lower pHs for TFMeAla than MeAla, as might be expected by the ester activation accelerating hydrolysis but not a conformational change, that is, the rate-limiting step changing at higher pH. Paradoxically, even when innate TFMeAla ester hydrolysis was slowed at pHs below 7.5, the measured accelerations were still much less than predicted from the 11-fold chemical activation (only 1.6–2.0 times, but up to 2.9 times if subtracting for the apparent rate of conformational change; Table S1). Ribosomal release catalyzed in vitro by tRNA or CCA instead of an RF (10Caskey C.T. Beaudet A.L. Rosman E. Hydrolysis of fMet-tRNA by peptidyl transferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3163-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although nonphysiological, offers a useful mechanistic tool because the potentially rate-limiting RF conformational change is circumvented. Like the “fragment reaction” (peptide bond formation between an fMet–tRNA fragment and puromycin catalyzed by the 50S ribosomal subunit), which is only efficient in 30% ethanol or methanol solvent, RF-free release also requires organic solvent for efficiency. However, RF-free release experiments typically employed 30% acetone solvent instead of alcohols because alcohols are too nucleophilic and favor fMet-ester products over the more-physiological, standard, hydrolysis product, fMet. As all published RF-free release assays used only fMet–tRNA at the P site and kinetics studies were minimal, we first surveyed experimentally various conditions to optimize the reactions. Although the reason for the requirement of organic solvent is unknown, it is plausible that it aids P-site binding (as established in the fragment reaction by Schmeing et al. (19Schmeing T.M. Seila A.C. Hansen J.L. Freeborn B. Soukup J.K. Scaringe S.A. et al.A pre-translocational intermediate in protein synthesis observed in crystals of enzymatically active 50S subunits.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 225-230Google Scholar)). Given that we used ribosomal tripeptide RCs here, which should be more stable than ribosomal fMet–tRNA initiation complexes, we wondered if the solvent requirement could be overcome. However, our tripeptide RCs still exhibited strong dependence (20–120 times stimulation) by organic solvent for release catalyzed by either unmodified tRNAPhe or CCA (Figs. S2 and S3). For CCA-catalyzed release, we used the same RCs as for RF-catalyzed release, but for tRNAPhe-catalyzed release, we changed the mRNA stop codon (UAA) into a cognate A-site codon (UUC). Unexpectedly, another property of the acetone in the tRNA-catalyzed reactions was that it obviated the assumed need (20Zavialov A.V. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Release of peptide promoted by the GGQ motif of class 1 release factors regulates the GTPase activity of RF3.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) for a cognate codon in the A site (Fig. S4). However, recognition of the CCA portion of the tRNA was necessary as expected, as removal of 3′-terminal CA of tRNA essentially abolished release (Fig. S4). We titrated the concentrations of CCA and tRNAPhe in the model release reactions with both unactivated and activated RCs (Figs. 3A and 4A). The Km values with CCA for MeAla and TFMeAla (29.4 and 33.0 μM, respectively) were much higher than for tRNAPhe (0.78 and 1.2 μM, respectively), as expected given that only the full tRNA could make most of the standard contacts at the ribosomal A site. Yet, despite the much lower binding affinity of CCA, use of saturating concentrations yielded much higher release rates with CCA than attainable with tRNAPhe (for pH 7.5, see Figs. S5D and S6D). Nevertheless, these RF-free release reactions were more than three orders of magnitude slower than with RF (Table 1). Intriguingly, all three types of release reactions were accelerated by TFMeAla by different magnitudes (Table 1, right) and, in the case of CCA, acceleration was close to the previously measured 11-fold chemical activation. This indicated that hydrolysis, not a conformational change, was still the slowest step in these RF-free reactions, despite being more than three orders of magnitude slower than with RF.Figure 4tRNAPhe-catalyzed release with ribosomal tripeptide RCs in the absence of RF1.

Acceleration factors are TFMeAla rates divided by MeAla rates. Open table in a new tab SEs are given. Acceleration factors are TFMeAla rates divided by MeAla rates. Given the acceleration of RF-free release reactions by TFMeAla at pH 7.5, we predicted that they would also be dependent on pH. Indeed, that was the case for CCA (Fig. 3, B–D) and tRNAPhe (Fig. 4, B–D). These plots contrasted with that of RF1 where saturation of rates occurred at higher pHs (Fig. 2D). Also, unlike RF1, the accelerations by TFMeAla for both CCA and tRNA release reactions were substantial over the whole pH range (Tables S2 and S3). This implied rate-limiting hydrolysis over the whole pH range, consistent with the absence of the proposed rate-limiting pH-independent conformational change of RF1. A possible explanation for the moderate deviation from linearity at higher pH is due to partial denaturation of the RC. A fascinating feature of the RF1-free release reactions is that switching the solvent from aqueous acetone to aqueous ethanol switches them from ester hydrolysis to predominantly transesterification with ethanol (10Caskey C.T. Beaudet A.L. Rosman E. Hydrolysis of fMet-tRNA by peptidyl transferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3163-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given our finding that RF1-free release reactions were highly pH dependent, we wondered if ester formation would be also. The standard assays use an 3H-fMet–tRNA RC (Fig. 1B) in 20% ethanol followed by extraction of the fMet-OEt product into ethyl acetate (incompatible with tripeptide release assays). Figure 5A shows that these tRNA-catalyzed ester formations are also pH dependent in an almost linear manner without saturation at high pH, indicating rate-limiting deprotonation in ester formation. The RF governed complete specificity in vitro for water/OH− over ethanol as the nucleophile in 10% ethanol (4Shaw J.J. Green R. Two distinct components of release factor function uncovered by nucleophile partitioning analysis.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 458-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). But normally, at least 20% ethanol was used for ester formation, so we checked that condition. Surprisingly, RF1 enabled very rapid ester formation in 20% ethanol, although the Met release product was substantially more favored than in RF-free reactions (Fig. 5B). Thus, although we confirmed that RF governed the specificity of the nucleophile, we found that the specificity was not absolute. We have opened a new window into rate-limiting steps in translation termination by chemically activating the scissile ester bond at the P site of ribosomal RCs. Whereas our analogous ribosomal approach only accelerated slow, not fast, peptide bond formations (16Wang J. Kwiatkowski M. Forster A.C. Ribosomal peptide syntheses from activated substrates reveal rate limitation by an unexpected step at the peptidyl site.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 15587-15595Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), here we accelerated a fast release reaction by substrate activation for the first time, to our knowledge. Although peptide bond formation and release are considered to be related reactions that both involve the PTC, the release is fourfold slower, which may be why we were more successful at accelerating release. The acceleration provides the first direct evidence that hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in release at physiological pH, whereas the lack of acceleration at higher pH indicates that ever-faster hydrolysis becomes masked by a pH-insensitive slower step, presumably a conformational change of the RF, ribosome, or substrate. Our results support the earlier combined proposal that hydrolysis is rate limiting at lower pH, whereas the known conformational change of the RF remains insensitive to pH and becomes limiting at higher pH (13Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 61: 1848-1860Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the complexity of the system and our data do not rule out other possibilities at higher pH. For example, crystallographic evidence showed that the PTC undergoes a conformational change for both peptide bond formation and release, and the rates of these steps are unknown. We have proposed rate-limiting “P-site accommodation” to explain why we only accelerated slow, not fast, peptide bond formations (16Wang J. Kwiatkowski M. Forster A.C. Ribosomal peptide syntheses from activated substrates reveal rate limitation by an unexpected step at the peptidyl site.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 15587-15595Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); such a model may also explain why our acceleration of release was a few-fold less than expected from the measured chemical activation in solution. Slow P-site accommodation in release might allow proofreading by protecting the RC from hydrolysis that is too rapid. Alternatively, the ester activation measured on the RC might be less than that of the innate chemical activation of the ester because of the unnatural amino acid causing mispositioning of the substrate on the ribosome, as apparently occurred in peptide bond formation assays (16W"

In Study 1, a mall-intercept study achieved 247 completed questionnaires. Results demonstrated that men and women indicated the highest behavioural intentions for communal wording presented by a male endorser. However, pairwise comparisons revealed that when the wording of the advert was agentic and the endorser was male, males indicated significantly higher scores of behavioural intentions compared with females. Attitude towards the ad for women was highest for communal wording/female endorser; for men it was for agentic wording/male endorser. In Study 2, consumers' views towards the gendered content were explored in 20 semi-structured interviews. In study 3 we examined the impact of the respondent's gender role identity on gendered content effectiveness. Overall, when controlled for level of gender role identity, only masculine males evaluated leaflets featuring communal wording negatively which suggests that wording matters only for masculine males, but not for other men and women. Theoretically, we identified that gender-based message-respondent congruence is not a necessary aspect of communications to be effective, except for one group: masculine males. Our study identified dominant gender role identity as a factor that explained respondents' preferences for presented stimuli. Specifically, males who display masculine gender role identity differ in evaluations of communal wording from all other groups. Social and commercial marketers who target men and women with exercise-related services should consider the use of agentic wording endorsed by a male endorser when targeting masculine men to increase the likelihood of eliciting positive attitudes towards the communication. However, such distinctions should not be associated with differences in women's evaluations or men who do not report masculine gender role identity."
https://openalex.org/W4307412613,"The steam turbine is one of the major pieces of equipment in thermal power plants. It is crucial to predict its output accurately. However, because of its complex coupling relationships with other equipment, it is still a challenging task. Previous methods mainly focus on the operation of the steam turbine individually while ignoring the coupling relationship with the condenser, which we believe is crucial for the prediction. Therefore, in this paper, to explore the coupling relationship between steam turbine and condenser, we propose a novel approach for steam turbine power prediction based on the encode-decoder framework guided by the condenser vacuum degree (CVD-EDF). In specific, the historical information within condenser operation conditions data is encoded using a long-short term memory network. Moreover, a connection module consisting of an attention mechanism and a convolutional neural network is incorporated to capture the local and global information in the encoder. The steam turbine power is predicted based on all the information. In this way, the coupling relationship between the condenser and the steam turbine is fully explored. Abundant experiments are conducted on real data from the power plant. The experimental results show that our proposed CVD-EDF achieves great improvements over several competitive methods. our method improves by 32.2% and 37.0% in terms of RMSE and MAE by comparing the LSTM at one-minute intervals."
https://openalex.org/W4307412614,"Investigating psychological characteristics through self-reported measures (e.g., anger, sensation seeking) and dynamic behaviors through objective measures (e.g., speed, 2D acceleration, GPS position etc.) may allow us to better understand the behavior of at-risk drivers. To assess drivers’ motivation, the theoretical framework of achievement goals has been studied recently. These achievement goals can influence the decision-making and behaviors of individuals engaged in driving. The four achievement goals in driving are: seeking to improve or to drive as well as possible (mastery-approach), to outperform other drivers (performance-approach), to avoid driving badly (mastery-avoidance), and to avoid being the worst driver (performance-avoidance). Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDS) provide access to the objective measurements of data not accessible through self-reported measurements (i.e., speed, accelerations, GPS position). Three dynamic criteria have been developed to characterize the behavior of motorists objectively: driving events, time spent above acceleration thresholds (longitudinal and transversal), and the extent of dynamic demands. All these criteria have been measured in different road contexts (e.g., plain). The aim of this study was to examine the predictive role of the four achievement goals on these objective driving behaviors. 266 drivers (96 women, 117 men) took part in the study, and 4 242 482 km was recorded during 8 months. Simultaneously, they completed the Achievement Goals in Driving Questionnaire. The main results highlighted that mastery-approach goals negatively predicted hard braking and the extent of dynamic demands on plain and hilly roads. Mastery-approach goals seem to be the most protective goals in driving. Future research on the promotion of mastery-approach goals in driving may be able to modify the behavior of at-risk drivers."

Then, HDPE/wood fiber composites are fabricated with a two-stage plastic extruder, and the effects of impulse-cyclone drying technique on the UV-accelerated aging properties of composites are investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) reveals that the silane coupling agent chemically reacts with the hydroxyl groups on the wood fiber surfaces, the anti-UV aging properties of composites is enhanced. Mechanical test shows that during the 0–3000 h of UV aging process, the mechanical properties of samples tend to increase initially and then decrease within a period of time. After 3000 h of UV aging, the specimen 4 exhibits the least loss of mechanical properties, with flexural modulus, flexural modulus and impact strength of 65.40 Mpa, 2082.08 Mpa and 12.85 Mpa, respectively. The effects of impulse-cyclone drying technique on the UV-accelerated aging properties of composites are investigated through Spectrophotometry and Surface microstructure observation. indicates that the ΔL* and ΔE * values increase greatly at the stage of 0–1000 h aging, which though tend to stabilize after 1000 h. The degree of discoloration changes little for specimen 4,and the number of surface cracks is relatively small, which exhibits the optimal aging resistance. In conclusion, the addition of wood fibers treated by impulse-cyclone drying (220°C) and A187 modification is effective in enhancing the anti-UV aging properties of HDPE/wood fiber composites. Nevertheless, such enhancing effect turns to decline when the temperature of impulse-cyclone drying treatment is excessively high."
https://openalex.org/W4307412629,"Community attitudes towards large carnivores are of central importance to their conservation in human-dominated landscapes. In this study, we evaluate community attitudes and perceptions towards the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) and bears (Ursus thibetanus and Ursus arctos), as well as their prey species, namely sika deer (Cervus nippon), roe deer and wild boar (Sus scrofa), in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin province, northeast China. We surveyed 139 households and found that community members' perceptions of large carnivores and their prey species were influenced by their predominant economic activities; their prior interactions with wildlife; their household income level; and whether they were either long-term residents of Yanbian or had migrated to the region from elsewhere in China. We recorded fairly neutral attitudes towards large carnivores among the communities we surveyed, but strongly negative attitudes were shown towards wild boar, particularly where respondents had lost agricultural products to crop raiding by wild boar. We recommend conservation stakeholders in northeast China utilise this finding to encourage support for large carnivore recovery and conservation by targeting messaging around the importance of the tiger as a key predator of wild boar in the ecosystem. Furthermore, our findings suggest that government provided compensation paid for cattle lost to large carnivore predation (notably, by tigers) may be helping to reduce animosity from cattle owners towards large carnivores. However, we also highlight that compensation for loss of livestock is therefore performing a useful role in mitigating human-wildlife conflict, that there are potentially unintended consequences of the current compensation program, for example it fails to dissuade livestock grazing in protected areas."

However, setting up a time-lapse movie experiments is not only laborious but also with low output, mainly due to the cell-losing problem (i.e., cells moving out of limited field of view), especially in a long-time recording.

https://openalex.org/W4307412661,"A subsample of children and young people (CYP) with anxiety disorders presents with comorbid behavioral problems. These CYP have greater impairment in daily life, profit less from current treatments, and have an increased risk for continued mental problems. We investigated two potential explanations for these comorbid behavioral problems. First, high punishment sensitivity (PS) may lead to a strong inclination to experience threat, which may not only elicit anxiety but also defensive behavioral problems. Second, behavioral problems may arise from high reward sensitivity (RS), when rewards are not obtained. Behavioral problems may subsequently elicit parental rejection, thereby fueling anxiety. We used a cross-sectional (age = 16.1, N = 61) and prospective (age = 22.2, N = 91) approach to test the relationship between PS/RS and comorbid behavioral problems. Participants were a subsample of highly anxious CYP from a large prospective cohort study. PS/RS were indexed by a spatial orientation task. We also investigated the prospective association between behavioral problems and anxiety at 6-year follow-up, and the proposed mediation by parental rejection. PS and RS showed no cross-sectional or prospective relationships with comorbid behavioral problems in highly anxious CYP. Yet, behavioral problems in adolescence showed a small prospective relationship with anxiety in young adulthood, but this was not mediated nor moderated by parental rejection. No evidence was found for PS/RS being involved in comorbid behavioral problems in anxious CYP. Findings point to comorbid behavioral problems as potential factor contributing to the further increase of anxiety."

Dentists can modify the smoking behaviors of their patients. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, beliefs, attitude, and practice of E-cigarette use among dental students. Materials and methods This multinational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study recruited undergraduate dental students from 20 dental schools in 11 countries. The outcome variable was current smoking status (non-smoker, E-cigarette user only, tobacco cigarette smoker only, dual user). The explanatory variables were country of residence, sex, age, marital status, and educational level. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the explanatory variables associated with E-cigarette smoking. Results Of the 5697 study participants, 5156 (90.8%) had heard about E-cigarette, and social media was the most reported source of information for 33.2% of the participants. For the 5676 current users of E-cigarette and/or tobacco smoking, 4.5% use E-cigarette, and 4.6% were dual users. There were significant associations between knowledge and country (P&lt; 0.05), educational level (B = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.21; P = 0.016) and smoking status (P&lt; 0.05). The country of residence (P&lt; 0.05) and smoking status (P&lt; 0.05) were the only statistically significant factors associated with current smoking status. Similarly, there were statistically significant associations between attitude and country (P&lt; 0.05 for one country only compared to the reference) and history of previous E-cigarette exposure (B = -0.52; 95% CI: -0.91, -0.13; P = 0.009). Also, the practice of E-cigarettes was significantly associated with country (P&lt; 0.05 for two countries only compared to the reference) and gender (B = -0.33; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.13; P = 0.001). Conclusion The knowledge of dental students about E-cigarette was unsatisfactory, yet their beliefs and attitudes were acceptable. Topics about E-cigarette should be implemented in the dental curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W4307441945,"Methionine (Met) is an indispensable amino acid (AA) in piglets. Met can synthesize cysteine (Cys), and Cys has the ability to reduce the Met requirement by 40% in piglets. However, whether this sparing effect on Met is facilitated by downregulation of Cys synthesis has not been shown. This study investigated the effects of graded levels of Cys on Met and Cys oxidation, and on plasma AA concentrations. Piglets (n = 32) received a complete elemental diet via gastric catheters prior to being randomly assigned to one of the eight dietary Cys levels (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.40, 0.50 g kg-1d-1) with an adequate Met concentration (0.25g kg-1d-1). Constant infusion of L-[1-14C]-Met and L-[1-14C]-Cys were performed for 6 h on d 6 and d 8 to determine Met and Cys oxidation, respectively. Met oxidation decreased as Cys intake increased (P<0.05). At higher Cys intakes (0.15 to 0.5g kg-1d-1), Met oxidation decreased (P<0.05) at a slower rate. Cys oxidation was similar (P>0.05) among dietary Cys intakes; however, a significant polynomial relationship was observed between Cys oxidation and intake (P<0.05, R2 = 0.12). Plasma Met concentrations increased (P<0.05) linearly with increasing levels of dietary Cys, while plasma Cys concentrations changed (P<0.05) in a cubic manner and the highest concentrations occurred at the highest intake levels. Increasing dietary levels of Cys resulted in a reduction in Met oxidation until the requirement for the total sulfur AA was met, indicating the sparing capacity by Cys of Met occurs through inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway in neonatal piglets."

The responses of 145 children attending summer camps were compared with those of 111 pupils. A significant increase in the altruism score was found between the pre-test and post-test in the camp condition, but no change in the children’s self-esteem was found with the entire sample. Exploratory analyses suggest variables that may be associated with more favourable participation in summer camps; certain dimensions of temperament are among them, as well as factors related to the camps themselves. Differences in the increase of altruism and self-esteem scores in summer camp were observed according to the identified child profiles.

To further assess testing barriers, we surveyed a random sample of residents who did not attend the events.Fifty-five residents and CBO staff participated in the Latino collaborative. Leading facilitators identified to increase testing were extended hours of community-based testing and financial support during isolation. In March-April 2021, 1,217 people attended mass-testing events over 13 days: COVID-19 positivity was 3% and 1% in Canal and Planada, respectively. The RE-AIM evaluation found: census tract testing coverage of 4.2% and 6.3%, respectively; 90% of event attendees were Latino, 89% had household income <$50,000/year, and 44% first-time testers (reach), effectiveness in diagnosing symptomatic cases early (median isolation time: 7 days) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (41% at diagnosis), high adoption by CBOs in both counties, implementation of rapid testing (median: 17.5 minutes) and disclosure, and post-event maintenance of community-based testing. Among 265 non-attendees surveyed, 114 (43%) reported they were aware of the event: reasons for non-attendance among the 114 were insufficient time (32%), inability to leave work (24%), and perceptions that testing was unnecessary post-vaccination (24%) or when asymptomatic (25%).Community-engaged mass ""test and respond"" events offer a reproducible approach to rapidly increase COVID-19 testing access in low-income, Latinx communities."
https://openalex.org/W4307639696,"Objective To systematically assess white matter injury (WMI) in preterm infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) using a high-threshold intervention strategy. Study design This retrospective analysis included 85 preterm infants (≤34 weeks of gestation) with grade 2–3 germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage. Cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans were assessed for WMI and ventricular width and shape. Forty-eight infants developed PHVD, 21 of whom (intervention group) underwent cerebrospinal fluid drainage according to a predefined threshold (ventricular index ≥p97+4 mm or anterior horn width &gt;10 mm, and the presence of frontal horn ballooning). The other 27 infants underwent a conservative approach (non-intervention group). The two PHVD groups were compared regarding ventricular width at two stages: the worst cUS for the non-intervention group (scans showing the largest ventricular measurements) versus pre-intervention cUS in the intervention group, and at term equivalent age. WMI was classified as normal/mild, moderate and severe. Results The intervention group showed significantly larger ventricular index, anterior horn width and thalamo-occipital diameter than the non-intervention group at the two timepoints. Moderate and severe WMI were more frequent in the infants with PHVD (p&lt;0.001), regardless of management (intervention or conservative management). There was a linear relationship between the severity of PHVD and WMI (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Preterm infants with PHVD who undergo a high-threshold intervention strategy associate an increased risk of WMI."
