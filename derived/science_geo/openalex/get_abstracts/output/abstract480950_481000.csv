https://openalex.org/W1563362314,"The transmission spectrum of the super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is observed to be featureless at near-infrared wavelengths and its atmosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data. Two papers in this issue of Nature report Hubble Space Telescope observations of two separate sub-Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets. Heather Knutson et al. observed four transits of the Neptune-mass planet GJ 436b and Laura Kreidberg et al. observed 15 transits of the smaller 'super-Earth' GJ 1214b. The transmission spectra of starlight passing through the atmospheres of these planets should give a good indication of the nature of their respective atmospheres, and for both planets the spectra obtained from Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 are virtually featureless. Knutson et al. argue that their data are consistent with either a high cloud deck at pressures of 0.1–10 mbar or a hydrogen-poor atmosphere on GJ 436b. Kreidberg et al. conclude that their near-infrared spectra are consistent with the presence of high-altitude clouds that obscure the lower layers of GJ 1214b. Recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune (‘super-Earths’) are among the most common planets in the Galaxy1,2,3. Atmospheric studies are the next step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of this new class of object4,5,6. Much effort has been focused on using transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b (refs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), but previous observations did not have sufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for the atmosphere. The planet’s atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (for example, a 100 per cent water vapour composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. The data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean-molecular-mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with compositions dominated by water, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen or carbon dioxide at greater than 5σ confidence. The planet’s atmosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data."

(p. 263 , published online 2 January; see the Policy Forum by Fisman ) report on the latest analysis of an ongoing controlled experiment—the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment—that seeks to identify and quantify the effects of extending health insurance coverage to a low-income adult population. A substantial increase was observed in visits to the emergency departments of hospitals, corresponding to approximately 120 U.S. dollars per year more in hospital costs."

https://openalex.org/W2064260672,"Cold Glacier Growth Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica has thinned significantly during the last two decades and has provided a measurable contribution to sea-level rise as a result. Both glacier dynamics and climate are thought to be responsible for thinning, but exactly how they influence the glacier are incompletely known. Dutrieux et al. (p. 174 , published online 2 January) provide another layer of detail to our understanding of the process through observations of ocean temperatures in the surrounding waters. The thermocline adjacent in the sea adjacent to the glacier calving front (where ice is discharged) lowered by 250 meters in the austral summer of 2012. This change exposed the bottom of the ice shelf to colder surface waters rather than to the warmer, deeper layer, thereby reducing heat transfer from the ocean to the overlying ice and decreasing basal melting of the ice by more than 50% compared to 2010. Those 2012 ocean conditions were partly caused by a strong La Niña event, thus illustrating how important atmospheric variability is for regulating how the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2032885475,"The transmission spectrum of the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is shown to be featureless, implying that the planet has either a hydrogen-poor atmosphere or a high cloud layer. Two papers in this issue of Nature report Hubble Space Telescope observations of two separate sub-Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets. Heather Knutson et al. observed four transits of the Neptune-mass planet GJ 436b and Laura Kreidberg et al. observed 15 transits of the smaller 'super-Earth' GJ 1214b.

Kreidberg et al. conclude that their near-infrared spectra are consistent with the presence of high-altitude clouds that obscure the lower layers of GJ 1214b. GJ 436b is a warm—approximately 800 kelvin—exoplanet that periodically eclipses its low-mass (half the mass of the Sun) host star, and is one of the few Neptune-mass planets that is amenable to detailed characterization. Previous observations1,2,3 have indicated that its atmosphere has a ratio of methane to carbon monoxide that is 105 times smaller than predicted by models for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres at these temperatures4,5. A recent study proposed that this unusual chemistry could be explained if the planet’s atmosphere is significantly enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium6. Here we report observations of GJ 436b’s atmosphere obtained during transit. The data indicate that the planet’s transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely high significance of 48σ. The measured spectrum is consistent with either a layer of high cloud located at a pressure level of approximately one millibar or with a relatively hydrogen-poor (three per cent hydrogen and helium mass fraction) atmospheric composition7,8,9."
https://openalex.org/W2155117030,"Pregnenolone is considered the inactive precursor of all steroid hormones, and its potential functional effects have been largely uninvestigated. The administration of the main active principle of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), substantially increases the synthesis of pregnenolone in the brain via activation of the type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor. Pregnenolone then, acting as a signaling-specific inhibitor of the CB1 receptor, reduces several effects of THC. This negative feedback mediated by pregnenolone reveals a previously unknown paracrine/autocrine loop protecting the brain from CB1 receptor overactivation that could open an unforeseen approach for the treatment of cannabis intoxication and addiction."

However, the majority require protection of the nitrogen precursor with a sulfonyl group that is subsequently inconvenient to remove. Jat et al.

https://openalex.org/W2093320357,"Chromosome Condensation The forces that shape the structure of the highly condensed metaphase chromosomes seen during cell division in eukaryotes are still largely unknown. In vitro evidence suggests that the amino-terminal tails of the histones—such as interaction of the histone H4 tail with H2A-H2B—play an important role in chromosome hypercondensation. Wilkins et al. (p. 77 ) used ultraviolet cross-linker amino acids in the histones of bakers' yeast to show that during early mitosis, phosphorylation of H3 threonine 3 by Haspin kinase recruits the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). The subsequent phosphorylation of H3 serine 10 by CPC allows the recruitment of the deacetylase Hst2p to nucleosomes. Hst2p drives the deacetylation of H4 lysine 16, facilitating the interaction between H4 and H2A-H2B in neighboring nucleosomes, promoting chromatin condensation."
https://openalex.org/W1983229568,"What Does It All Mean? Strong emissions of methane have recently been observed from shallow sediments in Arctic seas. Berndt et al. (p. 284 , published online 2 January) present a record of methane seepage from marine sediments off the coast of Svalbard showing that such emissions have been present for at least 3000 years, the result of normal seasonal fluctuations of bottom waters. Thus, contemporary observations of strong methane venting do not necessarily mean that the clathrates that are the source of the methane are decomposing at a faster rate than in the past."

The Dpp that cytonemes receive moves together with activated receptors toward the recipient cell body in motile puncta. Genetic loss-of-function conditions for diaphanous, shibire, neuroglian, and capricious perturbed cytonemes by reducing their number or only the synapses they make with cells they target, and reduced cytoneme-mediated transport of Dpp and Dpp signaling. These experiments provide direct evidence that cells use cytonemes to exchange signaling proteins, that cytoneme-based exchange is essential for signaling and normal development, and that morphogen distribution and signaling can be contact-dependent, requiring cytoneme synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2034178032,"Accumulating evidence supports the importance of macrophage plasticity in a broad spectrum of biological processes operative in health and disease. A major locus of control regulating macrophage polarization is at the transcriptional level, and several major pathways have been elucidated in recent years. In this study, we identify the Kruppel-like transcription factor 6 (KLF6) as a molecular toggle controlling macrophage speciation. KLF6 expression was robustly induced by pro-inflammatory M1 stimuli (e.g. LPS and IFN-γ) and strongly suppressed by M2 stimuli (e.g. IL4 and IL-13) in human and murine macrophages. Gain- and loss-of-function studies suggest that KLF6 is required for optimal LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression, acting cooperatively with NF-κB. Furthermore, KLF6 inhibits anti-inflammatory gene expression by negatively regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression in macrophages. Collectively, these observations identify KLF6 as a novel transcriptional regulator of macrophage polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2026828503,"Electron bifurcation is a fundamental strategy of energy coupling originally discovered in the Q-cycle of many organisms. Recently a flavin-based electron bifurcation has been detected in anaerobes, first in clostridia and later in acetogens and methanogens. It enables anaerobic bacteria and archaea to reduce the low-potential [4Fe-4S] clusters of ferredoxin, which increases the efficiency of the substrate level and electron transport phosphorylations. Here we characterize the bifurcating electron transferring flavoprotein (EtfAf) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BcdAf) of Acidaminococcus fermentans, which couple the exergonic reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA to the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin both with NADH. EtfAf contains one FAD (α-FAD) in subunit α and a second FAD (β-FAD) in subunit β. The distance between the two isoalloxazine rings is 18 Å. The EtfAf-NAD(+) complex structure revealed β-FAD as acceptor of the hydride of NADH. The formed β-FADH(-) is considered as the bifurcating electron donor. As a result of a domain movement, α-FAD is able to approach β-FADH(-) by about 4 Å and to take up one electron yielding a stable anionic semiquinone, α-FAD, which donates this electron further to Dh-FAD of BcdAf after a second domain movement. The remaining non-stabilized neutral semiquinone, β-FADH(•), immediately reduces ferredoxin. Repetition of this process affords a second reduced ferredoxin and Dh-FADH(-) that converts crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W2149336004,"Extravillous trophoblast invasion is a fundamental component of human placentation. Invading trophoblast cells promote blood flow to the conceptus by actively remodeling the uterine vasculature. The extent of trophoblast invasion is tightly regulated; aberrant invasion is linked with several obstetrical complications. However, the transcriptional networks responsible for controlling the extent of trophoblast invasion are not well defined. Previous studies have identified high levels of FOS (FOS, FOSB, FOS-like (FOSL) 1, and FOSL2) proteins in extravillous trophoblast cells. These proteins form part of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex and are implicated in regulating gene networks controlling cellular invasion in diverse biological systems. Therefore, we hypothesized that FOS family proteins play a role in regulating trophoblast invasion. We assessed expression of FOS family proteins in trophoblast cell lines and human placentae at different gestational ages. FOS, FOSB, and FOSL1 proteins were robustly increased in trophoblast cells subject to wound-based migration assays as well as Matrigel-based invasion assays. FOS knockdown resulted in cessation of proliferation and an induction of migration and invasion concomitant with robust expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, MMP3, and MMP10. Conversely, FOSL1 knockdown abrogated trophoblast migration and invasion and inhibited the production of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10. In human placenta, FOS was expressed in proximal anchoring villi in conjunction with phospho-ERK. FOSL1 was temporally expressed only in the distal-most extravillous trophoblast cells, which represent a migratory cell population. Therefore, FOS and FOSL1 exert opposing effects on trophoblast invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2004142774,"Many animals are able to regenerate amputated or damaged body parts, but it is unclear whether different taxa rely on similar strategies. Planarians and vertebrates use different strategies, based on pluripotent versus committed progenitor cells, respectively, to replace missing tissues. In most animals, however, we lack the experimental tools needed to determine the origin of regenerated tissues. Here, we present a genetically tractable model for limb regeneration, the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. We demonstrate that regeneration in Parhyale involves lineage-committed progenitors, as in vertebrates. We discover Pax3/7-expressing muscle satellite cells, previously identified only in chordates, and show that these cells are a source of regenerating muscle in Parhyale. These similarities point to a common cellular basis of regeneration, dating back to the common ancestors of bilaterians."
https://openalex.org/W1977064948,"Clusterin, also known as apolipoprotein J, is a multifunctional glycoprotein with the capacity to interact with a wide range of molecules. Although clusterin has been implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes, such as Alzheimer disease or cancer, its precise functions remain elusive. Here we report, that clusterin binds to apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and is internalized by cells expressing either one of these receptors. Binding of clusterin to these receptors triggers a Reelin-like signal in cells expressing disabled-1 (Dab1). It induces phosphorylation of Dab1, which leads to activation of PI3K/Akt and n-cofilin. Cell proliferation and neuroblast chain formation in subventricular zone (SVZ) explants are compromised when clusterin, which is present in the subventricular zone, is blocked in vitro. These data suggest that in the subventricular zone where Reelin is not present but ApoER2, VLDLR, and Dab1, clusterin might be involved in maintaining neurogenesis in vivo.

Above a critical density and below a critical temperature the photogenerated electrons and holes separate into two phases, an electron-hole plasma and an exciton liquid, with a clear sharp boundary between them. The two phases are characterized by distinct photoluminescence spectra and by different electrical conductance. The liquid phase is formed by the repulsive interaction between the dipolar excitons, and exhibits a short range order, which is manifested in the photoluminescence lineshape."
https://openalex.org/W2124124332,"The transient receptor potential melastatin member 7 (TRPM7) and member 6 (TRPM6) are divalent cation channel kinases essential for magnesium (Mg(2+)) homeostasis in vertebrates. It remains unclear how TRPM6 affects divalent cation transport and whether this involves functional homomeric TRPM6 plasma membrane channels or heteromeric channel assemblies with TRPM7. We show that homomeric TRPM6 is highly sensitive to intracellular free Mg(2+) and therefore unlikely to be active at physiological levels of [Mg(2+)]i. Co-expression of TRPM7 and TRPM6 produces heteromeric TRPM7/M6 channels with altered pharmacology and sensitivity to intracellular Mg·ATP compared with homomeric TRPM7. Strikingly, the activity of heteromeric TRPM7/M6 channels is independent of intracellular Mg·ATP concentrations, essentially uncoupling channel activity from cellular energy status. Disruption of TRPM6 kinase phosphorylation activity re-introduces Mg·ATP sensitivity to the heteromeric channel similar to that of TRPM7. Thus, TRPM6 modulates the functionality of TRPM7, and the TRPM6 kinase plays a critical role in tuning the phenotype of the TRPM7·M6 channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2140210268,"After protracted stimulation, the β2-adrenergic receptor and many other G-protein-coupled receptors are ubiquitinated and down-regulated. Arrestin-related domain-containing protein-3 (ARRDC3) has been proposed to recruit the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 to the β2-adrenergic receptor. ARRDC3 contains two PPXY motifs that could potentially interact with any of the four WW domains of Nedd4. Here we dissect the interaction determinants. ARRDC3 PPXY-Nedd4 WW dissociation constants vary from unmeasurable to Kd = 3 μM for the third WW domain of Nedd4 binding to the first PPXY motif of ARRDC3. Structures of the uncomplexed and PPXY1-bound WW3 domain were determined at 1.1 and 1.7 Å resolution. The structures revealed conformational changes upon binding and the hydrogen bonding network in exquisite detail. Tight packing of ARRDC3 Val-352', part of a 310 helix at the C terminus of PPXY1, is important for high affinity binding to WW3. Although no single WW domain is strictly essential for the binding of Nedd4 and ARRDC3 expressed in HEK293 cells, high affinity binding of full-length ARRDC3 and Nedd4 is driven by the avid interaction of both PPXY motifs with either the WW2-WW3 or WW3-WW4 combinations, with Kd values as low as 300 nM."
https://openalex.org/W2056049586,"The complex process of skeletal muscle differentiation is organized by the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), Myf5, MyoD, Myf6, and myogenin, where myogenin plays a critical role in the regulation of the final stage of muscle differentiation. In an effort to investigate the role microRNAs (miRNAs) play in regulating myogenin, a bioinformatics approach was used and six miRNAs (miR-182, miR-186, miR-135, miR-491, miR-329, and miR-96) were predicted to bind the myogenin 3'-untranslated region (UTR). However, luciferase assays showed only miR-186 inhibited translation and 3'-UTR mutagenesis analysis confirmed this interaction was specific. Interestingly, the expression of miR-186 mirrored that of its host gene, ZRANB2, during development. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-186 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 and primary muscle cells. Our findings therefore identify miR-186 as a novel regulator of myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2078659693,"Neuronal restricted progenitors (NRPs) represent a type of transitional intermediate cells that lie between multipotent neural progenitors and terminal differentiated neurons during neurogenesis. These NRPs have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into neurons, but not into glial cells, which is considered an advantage for cellular therapy of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, difficulty in the extraction of highly purified NRPs from normal nervous tissue prevents further studies and applications. In this study, we report the conversion of human fetal fibroblasts into human induced NRPs (hiNRPs) in 11 days by using just three defined factors: Sox2, c-Myc, and either Brn2 or Brn4. The hiNRPs exhibited distinct neuronal characteristics, including cell morphology, multiple neuronal marker expression, self-renewal capacity, and a genome-wide transcriptional profile. Moreover, hiNRPs were able to differentiate into various terminal neurons with functional membrane properties but not glial cells. Direct generation of hiNRPs from somatic cells will provide a new source of cells for cellular replacement therapy of human neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1976373876,"The mammalian circadian clock is a molecular oscillator composed of a feedback loop that involves transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1, and repressors Cryptochrome (CRY) and Period (PER). Here we show that a direct CLOCK·BMAL1 target gene, Gm129, is a novel regulator of the feedback loop. ChIP analysis revealed that the CLOCK·BMAL1·CRY1 complex strongly occupies the promoter region of Gm129. Both mRNA and protein levels of GM129 exhibit high amplitude circadian oscillations in mouse liver, and Gm129 gene encodes a nuclear-localized protein that directly interacts with BMAL1 and represses CLOCK·BMAL1 activity. In vitro and in vivo protein-DNA interaction results demonstrate that, like CRY1, GM129 functions as a repressor by binding to the CLOCK·BMAL1 complex on DNA.

Matsubara C. Myung J. Yoritaka T. Kamimura N. Tsutsumi S. Kanai A. Suzuki Y. Sassone-Corsi P. Aburatani H. Sugano S. Takumi T. Genome-wide profiling of the core clock protein BMAL1 targets reveals a strict relationship with metabolism.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5636-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Coincidently, a ChIP-seq and gene expression study in our group also found that Gm129 is a direct target gene of the BMAL1·CLOCK·CRY1 complex, and Gm129 exhibits high amplitude protein oscillation in mouse liver. These properties suggest that Gm129 might be an important factor in the molecular clock. Thus, we have conducted detailed molecular, biochemical, and genetic analysis to characterize the role of Gm129 in circadian clock regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that GM129 can directly interact with core clock proteins BMAL1 and PER2. GM129 also localizes in the nucleus and strongly represses CLOCK·BMAL1 transcriptional activity in a reporter gene assay. Additional in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that the GM129 protein directly interacts with the CLOCK·BMAL1 complex on DNA. In mouse liver, the absence of Gm129 extends the peak expression of Nr1d1 and Dbp. More importantly, in the Cry1−/− background, the Gm129 knock-out causes a significant phase shift of Nr1d1 and Dbp gene expression. We conclude that Gm129 functions as a novel transcriptional repressor in the mammalian clock transcription-translation feedback loop. All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Gm129 heterozygote mice were purchased from the University of California, Davis, KOMP repository and bred to obtain Gm129−/− mice. Primers were designed as indicated (Fig. 5A and Table 1) for genotyping. Cry1−/−, Gm129−/− double knock-out mice were generated by crossing Cry1−/− (9.Vitaterna M.H. Selby C.P. Todo T. Niwa H.

All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark schedule.TABLE 1Primer sets used for ChIP assayView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To generate pEGFPN1-Gm129, the Gm129 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from mouse fibroblast cDNA and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 vector. The pBABEpuro-Flag-HA-Gm129 plasmid was generated by inserting Gm129 and the FLAG tag sequence into the pBABEpuro vector backbone. The pFast-Flag-Gm129-Myc construct was generated by inserting the Gm129 coding sequence into the pFastbac1 (Invitrogen) vector with the FLAG tag sequence at the forward oligo and Myc tag sequences at the reverse oligo. Constructs for expressing mCLOCK, mBMAL1, mCRY1, and mPER2 were described previously (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells expressing FLAG-GM129 were made by retrovirus infection. Briefly, the pBABEpuro-Flag-HA-Gm129 construct was co-transfected together with pVSVG and pCIHPZ into HEK293T to produce recombinant retrovirus particles. Then MEF cells were infected with the retrovirus and transfectants were selected in media containing puromycin for 2 weeks. Single colonies were picked and cultured for subsequent analysis. The Flp-In/FLAG-C1ORF51 cell line was generated according to the manufacturer's protocols using the Flp-In T-REx-293 system (Invitrogen). Both mouse liver lysates and liver nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblotting. To make mouse liver lysate, mouse liver samples were homogenized and lysed with lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture, from Roche Applied Science). Proteins from mouse liver nuclei were prepared according to the NUN procedure described previously (14.Asher G. Reinke H. Altmeyer M. Gutierrez-Arcelus M. Hottiger M.O. Schibler U.

Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-CLOCK, anti-BMAL1 antibodies (Bethyl Lab), and anti-mPER2 antibody (ADI) and anti-Gm129 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in the immunoblotting assays. Anti-mCRY antibody was produced in our laboratory (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Insect cells or mammalian cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer; bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. For GFP fluorescence microscopy, HEK293T cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine 12-mm coverslips (BD Biosciences) placed in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 and pEGFPN1-Gm129 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at around 50% confluence. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed immediately with 3.7% methanol-free formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and washed twice with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with SlowFade Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a LeicaSP2 confocal microscope. Primers used in ChIP-PCR are given in Table 1. ChIP-PCR assays using cell nuclear extracts were conducted as described previously (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For ChIP-PCR and ChIP-Seq using mouse tissues, liver chromatin was prepared according to a previously published protocol (15.Ripperger J.A. Schibler U. Rhythmic CLOCK-BMAL1 binding to multiple E-box motifs drives circadian Dbp transcription and chromatin transitions.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, livers from mice were immediately homogenized and cross-linked in PBS buffer including 1% formaldehyde (5 ml/liver), and the homogenate was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 21 ml of ice-cold nuclei buffer (2.2 m sucrose, 125 mm glycine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol). The homogenate was layered on top of 10 ml of cold nuclei buffer and centrifuged for 90 min at 24,000 rpm (100,000 × g) at 4 °C in a Beckmann SW27 rotor. The nuclei were washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Cross-linked nuclei were then subjected to ChIP analysis as previously described (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For ChIP-seq, ChIP DNA was ligated to single-end sequencing adapters and amplified. DNA fragments of 300–800 bp in size were purified and sequenced (50 base) on an Illumina Hi-seq2000 instrument (Illumina, CA). The reads were aligned to the mm9 mouse reference genome using Bowtie accepting up to 4 reportable alignments and two mismatches per read (16.Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15048) Google Scholar). In cases where more than a single alignment was possible, only the one with the highest mapping quality was reported using the “–best” option of Bowtie. To generate ChIP-Seq signal tracks, reads were extended in silico to 150 bp, and the number of reads overlapping with each base in the genome were counted and divided by the chromosome-wide average of per-base read coverage. The average signal over 50 bp windows was calculated and viewed using the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (Fig. 1). Firefly luciferase was used as a reporter controlled by the mPer1 promoter sequence (17.Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Role of the CLOCK protein in the mammalian circadian mechanism.Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Renilla luciferase was used as a transfection control. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmids using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen). 36 h post-transfection, cells were collected, and luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Biotin-labeled E-box DNA or mutated E-box DNA (Table 1) was immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads. Immobilized DNA was washed twice in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml of BSA) before setting up binding reactions. Reactions (200 μl) were prepared in reaction buffer with the indicated combinations of CLOCK·BMAL1 (10 nm), GM129 (10 nm), PER2 (10 nm), and CRY1 (10 nm) and 500 ng of immobilized DNA. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, DNA·protein complexes were collected on a magnet and washed three times with reaction buffer. The proteins associated with the DNA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Mice of each genotype housed in light/dark (12:12) were sacrificed every 2 h starting from ZT 0 and livers were collected, washed with PBS, and immediately frozen in dry ice and stored in −80 °C until further use. RNA samples were prepared by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNAeasy (Qiagen). Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)20 using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed by using an ABI 7300 System (Applied Biosystems) and MaximaTM SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) was used. Primers are listed in Table 1. Previously we reported that CRY1 binds to CLOCK·BMAL1 on DNA by both in vitro EMSA and in vivo ChIP assays (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To systematically examine binding of the native CLOCK·BMAL1·CRY1 core clock complex to CCG (clock-controlled gene) promoters in mouse tissue, we conducted ChIP assays using the liver to map the chromatin-binding sites of CLOCK, BMAL1, and CRY1. As shown in Fig. 1A, in agreement with a previously published report (18.Stratmann M. Stadler F. Tamanini F. van der Horst G.T. Ripperger J.A. Flexible phase adjustment of circadian albumin D site-binding protein (DBP) gene expression by CRYPTOCHROME1.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), both BMAL1 and CRY1 rhythmically bind to the Dbp and Nr1d1 promoters and reach their peak affinities at ZT6-ZT10 (for BMAL1) and ZT20-ZT24 (for CRY1) in ChIP assays. To simplify the experimental design and achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio for identifying chromatin-binding sites of the core clock protein complex, we conducted CLOCK and BMAL1 ChIP-seq using liver harvested at ZT8 and CRY1 ChIP-seq with liver harvested at ZT20. Fig. 1, B and C, show the representative samples of ChIP-seq data we obtained using anti-CLOCK, anti-BMAL1, and anti-CRY1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, CLOCK, BMAL1, and CRY1 all bind to promoters of the core clock repressive factors: Cry1, Cry2, Per1, and Per2. Besides these core components, these positive (CLOCK and BMAL1) and negative (CRY1) regulators also bind to promoters of the secondary/consolidating loop component Rev-Erbα/Nr1d1 as well as to the promoter of the clock-controlled transcription factor Dbp1. Consistent with other published studies (6.Hatanaka F. Matsubara C. Myung J. Yoritaka T. Kamimura N. Tsutsumi S. Kanai A. Suzuki Y. Sassone-Corsi P. Aburatani H. Sugano S. Takumi T.

Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals.Science. 2012; 338: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), our ChIP-seq results showed that the Gm129 gene has high affinity binding sites for CLOCK, BMAL1, and CRY1 in its promoter region (Fig. 1C). To further characterize this binding, we carried out ChIP-PCR assays with livers harvested at different time points to examine circadian rhythmicity of binding of the CLOCK·BMAL1·CRY1 complex to the Gm129 promoter. Fig. 1D shows ChIP-PCR data over the course of a diurnal cycle for the Gm129 gene. Clearly, both BMAL1 and CRY1 rhythmically occupy E-boxes in the Gm129 promoter with different binding phases. It was also reported that Gm129 exhibits circadian gene expression in the mouse liver (6.Hatanaka F. Matsubara C. Myung J. Yoritaka T. Kamimura N. Tsutsumi S. Kanai A. Suzuki Y. Sassone-Corsi P. Aburatani H. Sugano S. Takumi T. Genome-wide profiling of the core clock protein BMAL1 targets reveals a strict relationship with metabolism.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5636-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To confirm these results, time series quantitative PCR was conducted with mouse livers harvested over one diurnal cycle. Indeed, Gm129 mRNA levels show very high amplitude (∼17-fold difference between zenith and nadir) oscillation with a peak at ZT12 (Fig. 2A). Because in some cases a rhythmically expressed gene can produce a constitutively expressed protein (20.Reddy A.B. Karp N.A. Maywood E.S. Sage E.A. Deery M. O'Neill J.S. Wong G.K. Chesham J. Odell M. Lilley K.S. Kyriacou C.P. Hastings M.H. Circadian orchestration of the hepatic proteome.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), the GM129 protein level was also examined by time series immunoblotting of mouse liver extracts made over a circadian cycle (constant dark). As shown in Fig. 2B, GM129 protein also exhibits high amplitude oscillation in the mouse liver nucleus with a peak at CT12. Thus, all these results suggest that Gm129 is a direct target of the CLOCK·BMAL1·CRY1 complex and encodes a protein with high amplitude circadian oscillation. GM129 is a 375-amino acid protein with no analogs in the mouse genome, and it has no known protein motifs or domains to guide for a potential functional assignment. Thus, we decided to determine its subcellular localization to obtain clues about its molecular functions. To this end, we constructed a GFP fusion construct of GM129 and transfected HEK293T cells with this plasmid. We found that the GFP-GM129 protein largely localizes in the nucleus (Fig. 2C). In contrast, GFP alone exhibits both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, the top 10 direct CLOCK·BMAL1 target genes with known function all encode nuclear proteins that function as either core clock components (PERs and CRYs) or circadian transcriptional factors that are responsible for output pathways (DBP, HLF, TEF, NR1D1, and NR1D2). Unlike circadian transcription factors in output pathways, core clock proteins normally interact with each other (21.Griffin Jr., E.A. Staknis D. Weitz C.J. Light-independent role of CRY1 and CRY2 in the mammalian circadian clock.Science. 1999; 286: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 22.Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock.Science. 2000; 288: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Thus, to further clarify the function of GM129, we decided to test protein-protein interactions between GM129 and core clock proteins using the baculovirus expression system. As shown in Fig. 3A, GM129 has a strong affinity to BMAL1 and PER2, but not CRY1. Additionally, GM129 binds to endogenous BMAL1 in an NIH3T3 cell line that stably expresses the FLAG-GM129 protein (Fig. 3B). Hence, nuclear localization and direct interaction with core clock proteins strongly support the hypothesis that GM129 is a novel circadian regulator. Although GM129 strongly binds to BMAL1 and PER2 protein, it was not know whether this interaction can regulate the activity of the core clock protein complex. Interestingly, like GM129, CRY1 also binds to BMAL1 and PER2 and functions as a strong repressor of CLOCK·BMAL1. Thus, we reasoned that GM129 might function as a transcriptional regulator by interacting with BMAL1. To investigate GM129 function, a luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted in HEK293T cells using a Per1::Luc reporter (21.Griffin Jr., E.A. Staknis D. Weitz C.J. Light-independent role of CRY1 and CRY2 in the mammalian circadian clock.Science. 1999; 286: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Coexpression of CLOCK and BMAL1 generate >6-fold induction of Luciferase activity compared with expressing BMAL1 alone (Fig. 3C). CRY1 is a positive control in this assay that efficiently represses CLOCK·BMAL1 activity. Importantly, the additional coexpression of either CRY1 or GM129 reduced the luciferase activity to the basal level (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3D, the repressor function of GM129 is also dose dependent, because as the amounts of Gm129 or Cry1 plasmids transfected were increased, there was increasing inhibition of CLOCK·BMAL1-activated transcription. In comparison with CRY1, it appears that GM129 is nearly equally efficient in repressing CLOCK·BMAL1 activity (Fig. 3D). Together with nuclear localization and protein-protein interaction results, repression of CLOCK·BMAL1-activated transcription by GM129 suggests a role in the negative arm of the transcription-translation feedback loop. Although GM129 protein represses activity of the CLOCK·BMAL1 in the reporter gene assay, the detailed molecular mechanism is unclear. Generally, a protein can function as a repressor by two mechanisms: (a) the repressor can bind to the activator complex on DNA and interfere with its interaction with co-activator or with RNA polymerase II complex or (b) the repressor can directly dissociate the activator from DNA. Previously, we have reported that CRY1 binds to the CLOCK·BMAL1 complex on DNA in vitro and in vivo (13.Ye R. Selby C.P. Ozturk N. Annayev Y. Sancar A. Biochemical analysis of the canonical model for the mammalian circadian clock.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25891-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we have conducted parallel experiments to examine how GM129 functions as a repressor of CLOCK·BMAL1. The in vivo system that we used employed an NIH3T3 cell line that stably expresses FLAG-tagged GM129. A ChIP assay was conducted with these cells to measure the binding of GM129 to the E-box elements in the Per2, Dbp, Nr1d1, and Bmal1 promoters. As shown in Fig. 4A, FLAG-GM129 showed significant recruitment to the Per2, Dbp, and Nr1d1 E-box compared with the NIH3T3 controls. No significant recruitment was detected in the Bmal1 promoter that does not contain CLOCK·BMAL1-binding sites, which suggest the recruitment is specific and CLOCK·BMLA1 dependent. Equally important, FLAG-tagged C1ORF51, a human homolog of Gm129, also interacts with hBMAL1 and binds to the hPer2 promoter in HEK293R cells that stably expresses the FLAG-C1ORF51 protein, which suggests that the molecular function of the GM129 protein is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 4, B and C). The in vivo interactions between GM129 and the Per2 promoter could be achieved either directly through the CLO"
https://openalex.org/W2030350346,"Streptococcus sanguinis is a cause of infective endocarditis and has been shown to require a manganese transporter called SsaB for virulence and O2 tolerance. Like certain other pathogens, S. sanguinis possesses aerobic class Ib (NrdEF) and anaerobic class III (NrdDG) ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) that perform the essential function of reducing ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. The accompanying paper (Makhlynets, O., Boal, A. K., Rhodes, D. V., Kitten, T., Rosenzweig, A. C., and Stubbe, J. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 6259-6272) indicates that in the presence of O2, the S. sanguinis class Ib RNR self-assembles an essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (Fe(III)2-Y(•)) in vitro, whereas assembly of a dimanganese-tyrosyl radical (Mn(III)2-Y(•)) cofactor requires NrdI, and Mn(III)2-Y(•) is more active than Fe(III)2-Y(•) with the endogenous reducing system of NrdH and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1). In this study, we have shown that deletion of either nrdHEKF or nrdI completely abolishes virulence in an animal model of endocarditis, whereas nrdD mutation has no effect. The nrdHEKF, nrdI, and trxR1 mutants fail to grow aerobically, whereas anaerobic growth requires nrdD. The nrdJ gene encoding an O2-independent adenosylcobalamin-cofactored RNR was introduced into the nrdHEKF, nrdI, and trxR1 mutants. Growth of the nrdHEKF and nrdI mutants in the presence of O2 was partially restored. The combined results suggest that Mn(III)2-Y(•)-cofactored NrdF is required for growth under aerobic conditions and in animals. This could explain in part why manganese is necessary for virulence and O2 tolerance in many bacterial pathogens possessing a class Ib RNR and suggests NrdF and NrdI may serve as promising new antimicrobial targets."

https://openalex.org/W1976732214,"ESCRT proteins mediate membrane remodeling and scission events and are essential for endosomal sorting of plasma membrane proteins for degradation. We have identified a novel, plant-specific ESCRT component called PROS (POSITIVE REGULATOR OF SKD1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. PROS has a strong positive effect on the in vitro ATPase activity of SKD1 (also known as Vacuolar Protein Sorting 4 or VPS4), a critical component required for ESCRT-III disassembly and endosomal vesiculation. PROS interacts with both SKD1 and the SKD1-positive regulator LIP5/VTA1. We have identified a putative MIM domain within PROS that mediate the interaction with the MIT domain of SKD1. Interestingly, whereas MIM domains are commonly found at the C terminus of ESCRT-III subunits, the PROS MIM domain is internal. The heterologous expression of PROS in yeast mutant cells lacking Vta1p partially rescues endosomal sorting defects. PROS is expressed in most tissues and cells types in Arabidopsis thaliana. Silencing of PROS leads to reduced cell expansion and abnormal organ growth."
https://openalex.org/W2145144736,"Reversible attachment and removal of palmitate or other long-chain fatty acids on proteins has been hypothesized, like phosphorylation, to control diverse biological processes. Indeed, palmitate turnover regulates Ras trafficking and signaling. Beyond this example, however, the functions of palmitate turnover on specific proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a mechanism regulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling in neuronal cells requires palmitate turnover. We used hexadecyl fluorophosphonate or palmostatin B to inhibit enzymes in the serine hydrolase family that depalmitoylate proteins, and we studied R7 regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)-binding protein (R7BP), a palmitoylated allosteric modulator of R7 RGS proteins that accelerate deactivation of Gi/o class G proteins. Depalmitoylation inhibition caused R7BP to redistribute from the plasma membrane to endomembrane compartments, dissociated R7BP-bound R7 RGS complexes from Gi/o-gated G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels and delayed GIRK channel closure. In contrast, targeting R7BP to the plasma membrane with a polybasic domain and an irreversibly attached lipid instead of palmitate rendered GIRK channel closure insensitive to depalmitoylation inhibitors. Palmitate turnover therefore is required for localizing R7BP to the plasma membrane and facilitating Gi/o deactivation by R7 RGS proteins on GIRK channels. Our findings broaden the scope of biological processes regulated by palmitate turnover on specific target proteins. Inhibiting R7BP depalmitoylation may provide a means of enhancing GIRK activity in neurological disorders."

In the fed state, elevated insulin phosphorylates FOXO1 via AKT, leading to its nuclear exclusion and degradation. A reduction in nuclear FOXO1 levels then leads to suppression of hepatic glucose production. However, the mechanism leading to expression of Foxo1 gene in the fasted state is less clear. We found that Foxo1 mRNA and FOXO1 protein levels of Foxo1 were increased significantly in the liver of mice after 16 h of fasting. Furthermore, dibutyrl cAMP stimulated the expression of Foxo1 at both mRNA and protein level in hepatocytes. Because cAMP-PKA regulates hepatic glucose production through cAMP-response element-binding protein co-activators, we depleted these co-activators using adenoviral shRNAs. Interestingly, only depletion of co-activator P300 resulted in the decrease of Foxo1 mRNA and FOXO1 protein levels. In addition, inhibition of histone acetyltransferase activity of P300 significantly decreased hepatic Foxo1 mRNA and FOXO1 protein levels in fasted mice, as well as fasting blood glucose levels. By characterization of Foxo1 gene promoter, P300 regulates the Foxo1 gene expression through the binding to tandem cAMP-response element sites in the proximal promoter region of Foxo1 gene.

https://openalex.org/W1569725267,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in hepatocytes stimulates innate antiviral responses including the production of type III interferons (IFN-λ), including IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29. However, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the expression of IFN-λ genes in HCV-infected hepatocytes remains undefined. In this study, we examined regulatory elements involved in the induction of IFN-λ genes following HCV infection in hepatocytes and further determined the binding of specific transcription factor(s) to promoter regions of IFN-λ genes. Our studies reveal that the regulatory portion for IL-28A, IL-28B, and IL-29 genes is localized to a 1-kb region in their respective promoters. Notably, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and -7 are the key transcriptional factors for the induction of IL-28A and IL-28B genes, whereas NF-κB is an additional requirement for the induction of the IL-29 gene. Ligation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, 8, and 9, which also activate IRFs and NF-κB, resulted in more robust production of IFN-λ than that observed with HCV infection, verifying the importance of TLR pathways in IFN-λ production. Furthermore, the addition of IFN-λ to HCV-infected hepatocytes decreased viral replication and produced a concurrent reduction in microRNA-122 (miR-122). The decrease in viral replication was enhanced by the co-administration of IFN-λ and miR-122 inhibitor (miRIDIAN), suggesting that such combinatorial therapies may be beneficial for the treatment of chronic HCV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2077608395,"Understanding how populations respond to habitat loss is central to conserving biodiversity. Population genetic approaches enable the identification of the symptoms of population disruption in advance of population collapse. However, the spatio-temporal scales at which population disruption occurs are still too poorly known to effectively conserve biodiversity in the face of human-induced landscape change. We employed microsatellite analysis to examine genetic structure and diversity over small spatial (mostly 1-50 km) and temporal scales (20-50 years) in the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), a gliding mammal that is commonly subjected to a loss of habitat connectivity. We identified genetically differentiated local populations over distances as little as 3 km and within 30 years of landscape change. Genetically isolated local populations experienced the loss of genetic diversity, and significantly increased mean relatedness, which suggests increased inbreeding. Where tree cover remained, genetic differentiation was less evident. This pattern was repeated in two landscapes located 750 km apart. These results lend support to other recent studies that suggest the loss of habitat connectivity can produce fine-scale population genetic change in a range of taxa. This gives rise to the prediction that many other vertebrates will experience similar genetic changes. Our results suggest the future collapse of local populations of this gliding mammal is likely unless habitat connectivity is maintained or restored. Landscape management must occur on a fine-scale to avert the erosion of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1967782027,"We present a comprehensive approach to using electronic medical records (EMR) for constructing contact networks of healthcare workers in a hospital. This approach is applied at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC)--a 3.2 million square foot facility with 700 beds and about 8,000 healthcare workers--by obtaining 19.8 million EMR data points, spread over more than 21 months. We use these data to construct 9,000 different healthcare worker contact networks, which serve as proxies for patterns of actual healthcare worker contacts. Unlike earlier approaches, our methods are based on large-scale data and do not make any a priori assumptions about edges (contacts) between healthcare workers, degree distributions of healthcare workers, their assignment to wards, etc. Preliminary validation using data gathered from a 10-day long deployment of a wireless sensor network in the Medical Intensive Care Unit suggests that EMR logins can serve as realistic proxies for hospital-wide healthcare worker movement and contact patterns. Despite spatial and job-related constraints on healthcare worker movement and interactions, analysis reveals a strong structural similarity between the healthcare worker contact networks we generate and social networks that arise in other (e.g., online) settings. Furthermore, our analysis shows that disease can spread much more rapidly within the constructed contact networks as compared to random networks of similar size and density. Using the generated contact networks, we evaluate several alternate vaccination policies and conclude that a simple policy that vaccinates the most mobile healthcare workers first, is robust and quite effective relative to a random vaccination policy."
https://openalex.org/W1967862121,"Mitochondrial proteins require protein machineries called translocators in the outer and inner membranes for import into and sorting to their destination submitochondrial compartments. Among them, the TIM22 complex mediates insertion of polytopic membrane proteins into the inner membrane, and Tim22 constitutes its central insertion channel. Here we report that the conserved Cys residues of Tim22 form an intramolecular disulfide bond. By comparison of Tim22 Cys → Ser mutants with wild-type Tim22, we show that the disulfide bond of Tim22 stabilizes Tim22 especially at elevated temperature through interactions with Tim18, which are also important for the stability of the TIM22 complex. We also show that lack of the disulfide bond in Tim22 impairs the assembly of TIM22 pathway substrate proteins into the inner membrane especially when the TIM22 complex handles excess amounts of substrate proteins. Our findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the TIM22 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1998246096,"We have shown previously that poliovirus infection disrupts cytoplasmic P-bodies in infected mammalian cells. During the infectious cycle, poliovirus causes the directed cleavage of Dcp1a and Pan3, coincident with the dispersion of P-bodies. We now show that expression of Dcp1a prior to infection, surprisingly, restricts poliovirus infection. This inhibition of infection was independent of P-body formation because expression of GFP-Dcp1a mutants that cannot enter P-bodies restricted poliovirus infection similar to wild-type GFP-Dcp1a. Expression of wild-type or mutant GFP-Dcp1a induced phosphorylation of eIF2α through the eIF2α kinase protein kinase R (PKR). Activation of PKR required the amino-terminal EVH1 domain of Dcp1a. This PKR-induced translational inhibition appears to be specific to Dcp1a because the expression of other P-body components, Pan2, Pan3, Ccr4, or Caf1, did not result in the inhibition of poliovirus gene expression or induce eIF2α phosphorylation. The translation blockade induced by Dcp1a expression suggests novel signaling linking RNA degradation/decapping and regulation of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2002376660,"Homeobox D10 (HoxD10) plays important roles in the differentiation of embryonic cells and progression of breast cancer. Our previous report revealed that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) was regulated by HoxD10 in gastric cancer cells; however, the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of IGFBP3 in gastric cancer remain unclear. Here, we found that the expression of IGFBP3 were upregulated after ectopic expression of HoxD10 in gastric cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that HoxD10 bound to three potential regions of IGFBP3 promoter. Exogenous HoxD10 significantly enhanced the activity of luciferase reporter containing these binding regions in gastric cancer cells. Further data showed that all of these binding sites had Hox binding element “TTAT”. Immunohistochemical staining results revealed that IGFBP3 expression was significantly downregulated in 86 gastric adenocarcinomas tissues relative to their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (p<0.001). Moreover, IGFBP3 expression was significantly lower in gastric tumor with lymph node metastasis compared with that without lymph node metastasis (p=0.045). Patients with high expression level of IGFBP3 showed favorable 5 year overall survival (p=0.011). Knockdown of IGFBP3 accelerated gastric cancer cell migration and invasion and induced the expression of invasive factors including MMP14, uPA and uPAR. Thus, our data suggest that HoxD10-targeted gene IGFBP3 may suppress gastric cancer cell invasion and favors the survival of gastric cancer patients."

Recently, we cloned a hypBA2 gene that encodes a novel β-l-arabinobiosidase from Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217 on the basis of the sequence of BL0421 from B. longum NCC2705, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 121 (10Fujita K.

The enzyme releases Araf-β1,2-Araf disaccharide (β-Ara2) from Araf-β1,2-Araf-β1,2-Arafβ-Hyp (Ara3-Hyp). Because released β-Ara2 should be hydrolyzed by its own enzyme for assimilation, we predicted that B. longum has a gene encoding β-l-arabinofuranosidase. BL0422 is part of a gene cluster with BL0421 and BL0420 and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF) 1680 family in the Pfam database (PF07944), which is a large family annotated as putative glycosyl hydrolases of unknown function. In this study, we cloned the gene of a BL0422 ortholog from B. longum JCM 1217 and characterized the recombinant protein as a novel β-l-arabinofuranosidase. This is the first report of the characterization of a DUF1680 family member. Extensin, potato lectin, Hyp-linked β-l-arabinooligosaccharides, β-Ara2, and Araf-β1,2-Arafβ-OMe (Ara2-Me) were prepared as described previously (10Fujita K. Sakamoto S. Ono Y. Wakao M. Suda Y.

Dansylated Hyp-linked β-l-arabinooligosaccharides were prepared as described by Gray (11Gray W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 139-151Crossref Scopus (729) Google Scholar). p-Nitrophenyl (pNP) substrates were obtained from Sigma. l-Arabinose was obtained from Wako Chemicals. The chemical structures of substrates are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. HypBA2-CΔ486 was expressed and purified as described previously (10Fujita K. Sakamoto S. Ono Y. Wakao M. Suda Y. Kitahara K. Suganuma T. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5143-5150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA of B. longum JCM 1217 was extracted using a FastPure DNA kit (Takara) and then used for PCR amplification of the gene for the BL0422 ortholog, hypBA1. The forward (5′-AAGGAGATATACATATGAACGTTACAATCACTTCCC-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTCGAGTGCGGCCGCTCGACGCTGGAAGACA-3′) primers were designed from nucleotides 4–22 and 1959–1974, respectively, of BL0422 from B. longum NCC2705 to generate a C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein. The PCR amplification product of hypBA1 was cloned into the pET-23b vector (Novagen) with the In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech). The full-length hypBA1 gene was sequenced on an ABI 3100 DNA sequencer with a Big-Dye Terminator 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The resulting pET23b-hypBA1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3) cells, which were then grown at 20 °C by using the Overnight Express Autoinduction System (Novagen). Subsequently, the cell cultures were centrifuged, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen). The His-tagged proteins were purified on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech), desalted by dialysis with a cellulose membrane (Wako), and concentrated using a 10-kDa ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore). The hydrolytic activity of the HypBA1 enzyme was assayed using dansylated cis-Araf-β1,2-Arafβ-Hyp (cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS) as a substrate. The 40-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), 25 μm substrate, 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 0.17 milliunits·ml−1 of the HypBA1 enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS per minute. After incubating the reaction mixture at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and then analyzed by HPLC. The sample was applied to a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II (2.5 × 250 mm, Nacalai) column at 30 °C with a mobile phase of methanol and 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 2.5) (60:40, v/v) and a constant flow rate (1.0 ml·min−1). The elution was monitored by a fluorescence detector (FP-202, JASCO) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 530 nm, respectively. For TLC analysis of dansylated substrates, the spots on the plates were developed with a 3:1:1 mixture (v/v/v) of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water and then visualized with UV light. Arafβ-Hyp (Ara-Hyp), Ara2-Hyp, Ara3-Hyp, Araf-α1,3-Araf-β1,2-Araf-β1,2-Arafβ-Hyp (Ara4-Hyp), Ara2-Me, β-Ara2, and pNP-substrates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with 0.17 milliunits·ml−1 of HypBA1 enzyme in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min. For TLC analysis, oligosaccharides were spotted on a silica gel 60 aluminum plate (Merck) using a 2:1:1 solvent mixture (v/v/v) of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water. The sugars were visualized by spraying an orcinol-sulfate reagent onto the plate (12Holmes E.W. O'Brien J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) analysis, oligosaccharides were analyzed with a CarboPac PA-1 column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml·min−1 by using the following gradient: 0–5 min, 100% eluent A (0.1 m NaOH); 5–30 min, 0–100% eluent B (0.5 m sodium acetate and 0.1 m NaOH); and 30–35 min, 100% eluent B. The pH dependence of enzyme activity was determined between pH 3.5 and 8.0 by using the following buffers: 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5–6.0), 50 mm MES (pH 5.5–7.0), and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5–8.0). The effect of temperature on enzyme activity was examined using 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 15–50 °C. The kinetic parameters of HypBA1 were determined using 0–750 μm β-Ara2, cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS, and cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS as the substrates. In the case of β-Ara2, the 40 μl reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min, and then stopped by adding 10 μl of 500 mm NaOH. The amount of liberated l-arabinose was quantified by HPAEC-PAD as described above, using an l-arabinose standard. In the case of cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS, liberated cis-Hyp-DNS were analyzed according to the same procedure used for cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS. The transglycosylation reactions were performed using Ara2-Hyp as a donor and 1-alkanols as acceptors. Thirty nanomoles of Ara2-Hyp were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with 340 milliunits·ml−1 of HypBA1 in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) with 5 mm TCEP and 20% methanol, ethanol, or 1-propanol as an acceptor. Subsequently, the reaction products were analyzed by TLC with a 2:1:1 solvent mixture of ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (v/v/v). The sugars were visualized by spraying an orcinol-sulfate reagent onto the plate (12Holmes E.W. O'Brien J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For structural analysis, the transglycosylation product from the reaction in 20% methanol was purified by HPLC on a Cosmosil Sugar-D (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai) column at 30 °C with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and water (75/25, v/v) and a constant flow rate (1.0 ml·min−1). The elution was monitored by a refractive index (RI) detector (RI-8022, TOSOH), and the fraction that contained the transglycosylation product was collected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with a JMM-ECA600KS spectrometer (JEOL). The QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce amino acid substitutions into HypBA1 by using the primers shown in supplemental Table S1. After confirmation of the desired mutations by DNA sequencing, these mutant enzymes were expressed and purified according to the same procedure used for the wild-type enzyme. The effect of external nucleophile of the E366A mutant was investigated by adding 0–400 mm of sodium azide in 40 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), 7.5 μg of E366A mutant, and 25 μm cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS as a substrate. After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and then analyzed by HPLC as described above. The Bifidobacterium strains grown in Gifu anaerobic medium (GAM) broth (Nissui) were B. longum JCM 1217 and JCM 7054, B. longum subsp. infantis JCM 1222, B. pseudolongum JCM 1205, B. adolescentis JCM 1275, B. breve JCM 1192, and B. bifidum JCM 1254. The in vitro fermentation ability of β-Ara2 was tested using B. longum JCM 1217 and B. adolescentis JCM 1275 in peptone-yeast extract-Fildes (PYF) medium (13Yoshimoto M. Yamakawa O. Tanoue H. JARQ. 2005; 39: 37-43Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) containing 0.25% β-Ara2, glucose, or l-arabinose. The bacteria were cultured for 3 days at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. The bacterial growth was judged from the decreased pH of the culture solution (14Suzuki Y. Tanaka K. Amano T. Asakura T. Muramatsu N. J. Jpn. Soc. Hort. Sci. 2004; 73: 574-579Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cell cultures were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant pellets were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8). Afterward, they were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) and sonicated with a Sonifier 250 (Branson). The cell lysates were incubated with 25 μm cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS for 16 h at 37 °C and then analyzed by HPLC. HypBA1 consisted of 658 amino acid residues exhibiting 98.9% identity with that of BL0422, and coincided with that of BLLJ_0211 from B. longum JCM 1217, for which the complete genome sequence is available (15Fukuda S. Toh H. Hase K. Oshima K. Nakanishi Y. Yoshimura K. Tobe T. Clarke J.M. Topping D.L. Suzuki T. Taylor T.D. Itoh K. Kikuchi J. Morita H. Hattori M. Ohno H. Nature. 2011; 469: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The recombinant HypBA1 protein was expressed at 20 °C as a soluble protein. SDS-PAGE showed that the purified recombinant HypBA1 protein migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 74 kDa (supplemental Fig. S2), which was in agreement with its calculated molecular mass of 74,329 Da. The final yield of the purified enzyme was 140 mg/liter of culture. The enzymatic activity for dansylated cis-Ara3-Hyp-DNS was detected in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, or TCEP, but not in the absence of reducing agents (supplemental Fig. S3). Several β-l-arabinooligosaccharides and synthetic pNP substrates were used to identify the substrate specificities for HypBA1 in the presence of TCEP. The enzyme released l-arabinose from Ara-Hyp, Ara2-Hyp, Ara3-Hyp, and Ara2-Me, but did not act on pNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside, pNP-α-l-arabinofuranoside, pNP-β-l-arabinopyranoside, or Ara4-Hyp (Fig. 1). HypBA1 also released l-arabinose from β-Ara2 (Fig. 2B). The suitable temperature and pH for cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS were determined at 35 °C-40 °C and 4.5, respectively (supplemental Fig. S4). The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 2.1 units·mg−1 protein. The kinetic parameters for β-Ara2, cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS and cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS are summarized in Table 1. The Km and kcat values for β-Ara2 and cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS were within the same range, but the kcat value for cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS was 480-fold lower than that of cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS. Consequently, the kcat/Km ratio of cis-Ara-Hyp-DNS was 670-fold lower than that of cis-Ara2-Hyp-DNS. HPAEC-PAD analysis showed that l-arabinose was released from Ara2-Hyp, and then the liberated Ara-Hyp gradually hydrolyzed to l-arabinose and Hyp (Fig. 2A). Likewise, both cis- and trans-Ara2-Hyp-DNS also hydrolyzed to Ara-Hyp-DNS, which then hydrolyzed to Hyp-DNS (Fig. 3). Under the conditions in which Ara3-Hyp could be degraded by HypBA2 and HypBA1 (supplemental Fig. S5A, lane 4), the reactivities for the glycoproteins were tested. Liberated sugars were detected from carrot extensin and potato lectin by HypBA2 but not by HypBA1 (supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, HypBA1 did not act on pNP-galacto-, gluco-, and xylo-pyranosides. The substrate specificity is summarized in supplemental Table S2. These results suggested that HypBA1 reacts with the liberated β-l-arabinooligosaccharides. Consequently, we classified the enzyme as an exo-acting β-l-arabinofuranosidase. The cleavage sites for HypBA1 are shown in supplemental Fig. S1.FIGURE 2HPAEC-PAD analysis of HypBA1 reaction products. Ara2-Hyp (A) and β-Ara2 (B) were incubated with HypBA1 at 37 °C for up to 16 h.

The purified transglycosylation product (methyl l-arabinofuranoside) was hydrolyzed to l-arabinose by the HypBA1 treatment (Fig. 4B), which indicates that the methanol was linked by the β-anomeric form. The structure of this product was determined by 1H and 13C NMR (supplemental Fig. S6 and Table S3). The 1H NMR spectrum showed the anomeric proton as a doublet at 4.74 ppm with coupling constant J1,2 = 4.8 Hz. Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectra revealed that the transglycosylation product was found to be consistent with a methyl β-l-arabinofuranoside (Ara-Me) (16Joseleau J.-P. Chambat G. Vignon M. Barnoud F. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 165-175Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These data indicated that HypBA1 is a retaining enzyme. HypBA1 consisted of 658 amino acids that included DUF1680 without other sequence motifs (supplemental Fig. S7). HypBA1 was 38–98% identical to other DUF1680 members from bifidobacteria (supplemental Figs. S7 and S8). Duplicated DUF1680 members were found in the sequences of almost all Bifidobacterium species. HypBA1 (BLLJ_0211) constitutes a gene cluster with HypBA2 (BLLJ_0212) and a GH43 family member (BLLJ_0213) (supplemental Fig. S7). The gene cluster was conserved in B. longum NCC2705, B. longum subsp. infantis 157F, and B. pseudocatenulatum DSM 20438. In addition, the gene cluster without the GH43 family member was conserved in B. catenulatum DSM 16992 and B. dentium ATCC 27678. The candidate acidic amino acid residues were selected for site-directed mutagenesis studies based on multiple alignments and the HMM logo of the DUF1680 family in the Pfam data base (17Schuster-Böckler B. Schultz J. Rahmann S. BMC Bioinf. 2004; 5: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions were introduced at the positions of Glu-322, Glu-338, and Glu-366, which are highly conserved among the HypBA1 homologues (indicated as asterisks in supplemental Fig. S8). The mutant enzymes were purified for the determination of specific activities. The E322A and E366A mutant enzymes were recovered in the soluble fractions with BugBuster. The E366A mutant enzyme exhibited a significant decrease in activity (0.0013%), and the E322A mutant showed 1.5% of the activity relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). The E338A mutant enzyme was insoluble, and only a small amount of protein was recovered. Nonetheless, it exhibited 16% relative activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. The effect of external nucleophile on the activity of the E366A mutant was further investigated by using different concentrations of sodium azide. The activity of the mutant was rescued by the addition of azide (Fig. 5). In the presence of 200 mm sodium azide, the enzymatic activity was 33-fold greater than in the absence of external nucleophile. We also confirmed azide rescue by β-Ara2 as a substrate, whereas the glycosyl azide product was not observed on HPAEC-PAD and TLC (data not shown).TABLE 2The specific activities of HypBA1 mutantsMutant enzymesSpecific activityaEnzymatic activities were determined using the cis isomer of Ara2-Hyp-DNS.Percentage of specific activitymilliunits mg−1%Wild type2100100E322A321.5E338A34016E366A0.0280.0013a Enzymatic activities were determined using the cis isomer of Ara2-Hyp-DNS. Open table in a new tab First, lysates of bifidobacterial cells grown in GAM medium were used as the enzyme source. β-l-Arabinofuranosidase activity was found in the cell lysate of B. longum JCM 1217 and B. longum JCM 7054 but not in that of B. adolescentis JCM 1275, B. breve JCM 1192, B. bifidum JCM 1254, B. pseudolongum JCM 1205, or B. longum subsp. infantis JCM 1222 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, enzymatic activity was not observed in the culture medium or in the bacterial cell suspensions for all Bifidobacterium strains described above (data not shown). The PYF medium containing 0.25% β-Ara2 was utilized as a carbohydrate source by B. longum JCM 1217 but not by B. adolescentis JCM 1275 (supplemental Table S4). In addition, β-Ara2 in the PYF medium was utilized by the fermentation of B. longum JCM 1217 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, β-l-arabinofuranosidase activity was found in the cell lysate of B. longum JCM 1217 grown on β-Ara2 but not in the lysate of cultures grown in media containing glucose and l-arabinose (Fig. 6C). These data suggested that β-Ara2 is metabolized by β-l-arabinofuranosidase in B. longum. The DUF1680 family has 597 members distributed among 315 species of enteric bacteria (i.e. Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Salmonella, Clostridium, and Esherichia), plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas, actinomycetes, fungi, and plants, as shown in the Pfam data base. The members of this family are hypothetical proteins of unknown function and have no sequence similarity with other glycoside hydrolase families. In this study, we cloned the gene encoding a member of the DUF1680 family and characterized its product as a novel β-l-arabinofuranosidase. Therefore, we propose that the enzyme be assigned to a new family of glycoside hydrolases, the GH family 127. β-Ara2 was a suitable substrate for HypBA1 as well as Ara3-Hyp and Ara2-Hyp, which contain the Araf-β1,2-Araf structure at the nonreducing terminal. In extensins, β-l-arabinooligosaccharides are in close existence on repetitive Ser-Hyp4 motifs and contribute to protease resistance. It is thought that Hyp-linked β-l-arabinooligosaccharides do not occur naturally in the normal environment. Furthermore, HypBA1 did not directly release l-arabinose from extensin or potato lectin (supplemental Fig. S5). In addition, we showed that β-Ara2 was used as a carbohydrate source for B. longum, with enzymatic activity detected in the cell lysate (supplemental Table S4 and Fig. 6). Interestingly, the enzymatic activity was not detected in cells grown in the presence of l-arabinose or glucose. The amino acid sequence of HypBA1 lacks both a secretory signal and a transmembrane domain. Collectively, these results indicate that HypBA1 is an intracellular enzyme that degrades HypBA2-released β-Ara2, as schematically summarized in Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S9. Previously, we characterized an endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (BLLJ_0168) from B. longum JCM 1217, which releases Gal-β1,3-GalNAc (GNB) disaccharide from core-1 mucin-type O-glycans (18Fujita K.

As shown in supplemental Fig. S9, the contiguous genes of the hypBA1 gene (BLLJ_0211) have also been annotated as encoding subunits of a putative ABC-type sugar transport system (23Parche S. Amon J. Jankovic I. Rezzonico E. Beleut M. Barutçu H. Schendel I. Eddy M.P. Burkovski A. Arigoni F. Titgemeyer F. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 12: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar): a solute-binding protein (BLLJ_0208) and 2 transmembrane subunits (BLLJ_0209 and BLLJ_0210). BLLJ_0208 exhibits 28% identity with the GNB/LNB-binding protein, and BLLJ_0209 and BLLJ_0210 also have >27% identity with the GNB/LNB transmembrane subunits (BLLJ_1624 and BLLJ_1625). Furthermore, the neighboring gene (BLLJ_0207) is predicted to be a LacI-type transcriptional regulator. Thus, we expect that BLLJ_0207 will regulate the gene cluster containing the β-Ara2 transport system (BLLJ_0208-BLLJ_0210) and the β-l-arabinooligosaccharides degradation enzymes (BLLJ_0211-BLLJ_0213) by internalizing β-Ara2. The β-l-arabinooligosaccharides metabolic pathway in B. longum is predicted as shown in supplemental Fig. S9. First, a GH43 family member (BLLJ_0213) releases l-arabinose from extensin (Ara4-Hyp to Ara3-Hyp), and then HypBA2 (BLLJ_0212) releases β-Ara2 (Ara3-Hyp to Ara-Hyp) on the bifidobacterial cell surface. Next, the released l-arabinose and β-Ara2 are internalized into the bifidobacterial cell by uncharacterized transport system and predicted β-Ara2 transport system (BLLJ_0208-BLLJ_0210), respectively. Then, HypBA1 (BLLJ_0211) degrades β-Ara2 to l-arabinose. Furthermore, the l-arabinose metabolic enzymes for the conversion to d-xylulose-5-phosphate, which have been characterized in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 31831 (24Kawaguchi H. Sasaki M. Vertès A.A. Inui M. Yukawa H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 3419-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), exhibit 50–59% identity with those of B. longum JCM 1217: l-arabinose isomerase (BLLJ_0342), l-ribulokinase (BLLJ_0340), and l-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase (BLLJ_0341). As a result, HypBA1 plays a key role in B. longum for β-l-arabinooligosaccharides usage as a carbohydrate and energy source. Recently, Fukuda et al. (15Fukuda S. Toh H. Hase K. Oshima K. Nakanishi Y. Yoshimura K. Tobe T. Clarke J.M. Topping D.L. Suzuki T. Taylor T.D. Itoh K. Kikuchi J. Morita H. Hattori M. Ohno H. Nature. 2011; 469: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) reported that B. longum has an advanced ability for fructose uptake and acetate production, with the released acetate improving the intestinal defense mediated by epithelial cells. In addition to fructose, l-arabinose is a naturally found common carbohydrate and is found as a component of biopolymers such as hemicellulose and pectin. B. longum JCM 1217 encodes a number of candidates for the α-l-arabinofuranosidase gene, 11 members of the GH43 gene family, and 4 members of the GH51 gene family. Several reports indicate that B. longum has the ability to grow on l-arabinose and α-l-arabinooligosaccharides (14Suzuki Y. Tanaka K. Amano T. Asakura T. Muramatsu N. J. Jpn. Soc. Hort. Sci. 2004; 73: 574-579Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Parche S. Amon J. Jankovic I. Rezzonico E. Beleut M. Barutçu H. Schendel I. Eddy M.P. Burkovski A. Arigoni F. Titgemeyer F. J. Mol.

We showed that B. longum also uses β-Ara2 as a carbohydrate source (supplemental Table S4). Several α- and β-l-arabinooligosaccharides degradation enzymes in B. longum might be involved in l-arabinose acquisition from plant polymers in the large intestine. HypBA1 was identified as a retaining glycoside hydrolase, as described above. Hydrolysis by retaining glycoside hydrolases proceeds through a double-displacement mechanism with 2 catalytic residues. The catalytic residues typically utilized are either aspartate or glutamate residues. In the chemical rescue study, E366A mutant was rescued by the addition of azide, which suggests that Glu-366 is a catalytic residue for HypBA1. However, no glycosyl azide product was formed in the reaction mixture. A water molecule activated by azide ion might be reactivated E366A mutant without glycosyl azide production, as shown in GH43 β-xylosidase and GH14 β-amylase (28Miyake H. Otsuka C. Nishimura S.

B. longum JCM 1217 encodes 4 members of the DUF1680 family (BLLJ_0211, BLLJ_1826, BLLJ_1848, and BLLJ_0089), whereas B. longum NCC2705 encodes 2 members (BL0422 and BL0174) (supplemental Fig. S7). BL0422 constitutes a conserved gene cluster with the GH121 β-l-arabinobiosidase gene and the GH43-encoding gene as well as BLLJ_0211. BL0174 (98.8% identity with BLLJ_1826) is flanked by a gene cluster with 5 GH43 members and 1 α-galactosidase (BL0176-BL0190), whereas BLLJ_1826 is flanked by a small gene cluster without GH43 members (BLLJ_1824-BLLJ_1820). Interestingly, BLLJ_1848 constitutes a gene cluster with 5 duplicated GH43 members (BLLJ_1850-BLLJ_1854), in which the cluster is replaced by insertion sequences in B. longum NCC2705. HRGPs that contain β-l-arabinooligosaccharides are widely distributed in land plants, mosses, ferns, and green algae (30Lamport D.T. Miller D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2018651977,"The canonical mitochondrial death pathway was first discovered for its role in signaling apoptosis. It has since been found to have a requisite function in differentiation initiation in many cell types including the lens through low level activation of the caspase-3 protease. The ability of this pathway to function as a molecular switch in lens differentiation depends on the concurrent induction of survival molecules in the Bcl-2 and IAP families, induced downstream of an IGF-1R/NFκB coordinate survival signal, to regulate caspase-3 activity. Here we investigated whether α6 integrin signals upstream to this IGF-1R-mediated survival-linked differentiation signal. Our findings show that IGF-1R is recruited to and activated specifically in α6 integrin receptor signaling complexes in the lens equatorial region, where lens epithelial cells initiate their differentiation program. In studies with both α6 integrin knock-out mice lenses and primary lens cell cultures following α6 integrin siRNA knockdown, we show that IGF-1R activation is dependent on α6 integrin and that this transactivation requires Src kinase activity. In addition, without α6 integrin, activation and expression of NFκB was diminished, and expression of Bcl-2 and IAP family members were down-regulated, resulting in high levels of caspase-3 activation. As a result, a number of hallmarks of lens differentiation failed to be induced; including nuclear translocation of Prox1 in the differentiation initiation zone and apoptosis was promoted. We conclude that α6 integrin is an essential upstream regulator of the IGF-1R survival pathway that regulates the activity level of caspase-3 for it to signal differentiation initiation of lens epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020864942,"Collagens are a group of extracellular matrix proteins with essential functions for skin integrity. Anchoring fibrils are made of type VII collagen (Col7) and link different skin layers together: the basal lamina and the underlying connective tissue. Col7 has a central collagenous domain and two noncollagenous domains located at the N and C terminus (NC1 and NC2), respectively. A cysteine-rich region of hitherto unknown function is located at the transition of the NC1 domain to the collagenous domain. A synthetic model peptide of this region was investigated by CD and NMR spectroscopy. The peptide folds into a collagen triple helix, and the cysteine residues form disulfide bridges between the different strands. The eight cystine knot topologies that are characterized by exclusively intermolecular disulfide bridges have been analyzed by molecular modeling. Two cystine knots are energetically preferred; however, all eight disulfide bridge arrangements are essentially possible. This novel cystine knot is present in type IX collagen, too. The conserved motif of the cystine knot is CX3CP. The cystine knot is N-terminal to the collagen triple helix in both collagens and therefore probably impedes unfolding of the collagen triple helix from the N terminus."

https://openalex.org/W2102325505,"Background Although the genetic basis of androgenic alopecia has been clearly established, little is known about its non-genetic causes, such as environmental and lifestyle factors. Objective This study investigated blood and urine heavy metals concentrations, environmental exposure factors, personal behaviors, dietary intakes and the genotypes of related susceptibility genes in patients with androgenic alopecia (AGA). Design Age, AGA level, residence area, work hours, sleep patterns, cigarette usage, alcohol consumption, betel nut usage, hair treatments, eating habits, body heavy metals concentrations and rs1998076, rs913063, rs1160312 and rs201571 SNP genotype data were collected from 354 men. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine whether any of the factors displayed odds ratios (ORs) indicating association with moderate to severe AGA (≧IV). Subsequently, Hosmer-Lemeshow, Nagelkerke R2 and accuracy tests were conducted to help establish an optimal model. Results Moderate to severe AGA was associated with the AA genotype of rs1160312 (22.50, 95% CI 3.99–126.83), blood vanadium concentration (0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.04), and regular consumption of soy bean drinks (0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.85), after adjustment for age. The results were corroborated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.73), Nagelkerke R2 (0.59), accuracy test (0.816) and area under the curve (AUC; 0.90, 0.847–0.951) analysis. Conclusions Blood vanadium and frequent soy bean drink consumption may provide protect effects against AGA. Accordingly, blood vanadium concentrations, the AA genotype of rs1160312 and frequent consumption of soy bean drinks are associated with AGA."
https://openalex.org/W2043155828,"The Dok proteins are a family of adaptor molecules that have a well defined role in regulating cellular migration, immune responses, and tumor progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that Doks-1 to 3 are expressed in platelets and that Dok-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of integrin αIIbβ3, raising the possibility that it participates in integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. We demonstrate that Dok-2 in platelets is primarily phosphorylated by Lyn kinase. Moreover, deficiency of Dok-2 leads to dysregulated integrin αIIbβ3-dependent cytosolic calcium flux and phosphatidylinositol(3,4)P2 accumulation. Although agonist-induced integrin αIIbβ3 affinity regulation was unaltered in Dok-2(-/-) platelets, Dok-2 deficiency was associated with a shear-dependent increase in integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function, resulting in enhanced platelet-fibrinogen and platelet-platelet adhesive interactions under flow. This increase in adhesion was restricted to discoid platelets and involved the shear-dependent regulation of membrane tethers. Dok-2 deficiency was associated with an increased rate of platelet aggregate formation on thrombogenic surfaces, leading to accelerated thrombus growth in vivo. Overall, this study defines an important role for Dok-2 in regulating biomechanical adhesive function of discoid platelets. Moreover, they define a previously unrecognized prothrombotic mechanism that is not detected by conventional platelet function assays."
https://openalex.org/W1974604100,"The quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) family of enzymes generates disulfide bonds in peptides and proteins with the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Determination of the potentials of the redox centers in Trypanosoma brucei QSOX provides a context for understanding catalysis by this facile oxidant of protein thiols. The CXXC motif of the thioredoxin domain is comparatively oxidizing (E'0 of -144 mV), consistent with an ability to transfer disulfide bonds to a broad range of thiol substrates. In contrast, the proximal CXXC disulfide in the ERV (essential for respiration and vegetative growth) domain of TbQSOX is strongly reducing (E'0 of -273 mV), representing a major apparent thermodynamic barrier to overall catalysis. Reduction of the oxidizing FAD cofactor (E'0 of -153 mV) is followed by the strongly favorable reduction of molecular oxygen. The role of a mixed disulfide intermediate between thioredoxin and ERV domains was highlighted by rapid reaction studies in which the wild-type CGAC motif in the thioredoxin domain of TbQSOX was replaced by the more oxidizing CPHC or more reducing CGPC sequence. Mixed disulfide bond formation is accompanied by the generation of a charge transfer complex with the flavin cofactor. This provides thermodynamic coupling among the three redox centers of QSOX and avoids the strongly uphill mismatch between the formal potentials of the thioredoxin and ERV disulfides. This work identifies intriguing mechanistic parallels between the eukaryotic QSOX enzymes and the DsbA/B system catalyzing disulfide bond generation in the bacterial periplasm and suggests that the strategy of linked disulfide exchanges may be exploited in other catalysts of oxidative protein folding."

Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) employs a cap-independent mechanism of translation initiation that is mediated by a structural BYDV translation element (BTE) located in the 3′-UTR of its mRNA. eIF4F bound the BTE and a translationally inactive mutant with high affinity, thus questioning the role of eIF4F in translation of BYDV. To examine the effects of eIF4F in BYDV translation initiation, BTE mutants with widely different in vitro translation efficiencies ranging from 5 to 164% compared with WT were studied. Using fluorescence anisotropy to obtain quantitative data, we show 1) the equilibrium binding affinity (complex stability) correlated well with translation efficiency, whereas the “on” rate of binding did not; 2) other unidentified proteins or small molecules in wheat germ extract prevented eIF4F binding to mutant BTE but not WT BTE; 3) BTE mutant-eIF4F interactions were found to be both enthalpically and entropically favorable with an enthalpic contribution of 52–90% to ΔG° at 25 °C, suggesting that hydrogen bonding contributes to stability; and 4) in contrast to cap-dependent and tobacco etch virus internal ribosome entry site interaction with eIF4F, poly(A)-binding protein did not increase eIF4F binding. Further, the eIF4F bound to the 3′ BTE with higher affinity than for either m7G cap or tobacco etch virus internal ribosome entry site, suggesting that the 3′ BTE may play a role in sequestering host cell initiation factors and possibly regulating the switch from replication to translation.

BYDV affects cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats, and grasses and is spread by several aphid species severely limiting food grain production and causing yield losses resulting in food scarcity (1.Miller W.A. Rasochová L. Barley yellow dwarf viruses.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1997; 35: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). BYDV belongs to the Luteoviridae family, has a genome which is a positive sense RNA ≈5700 nucleotides long, and is lacking both a 5′ cap (m7GpppX) and a poly(A) tail (2.Rakotondrafara A.M. Polacek C.

Oscillating kissing stem-loop interactions mediate 5′ scanning-dependent translation by a viral 3′-cap-independent translation element.RNA. 2006; 12: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the 5′ cap is the binding site for eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) eIF4F and eIFiso4F (isozyme form of eIF4F present in higher plants). The poly(A) tail works synergistically with the cap for stability of the message and efficient translation (3.Sonenberg N. Cap-binding proteins of eukaryotic messenger RNA.

In contrast, BYDV must employ an alternate means of cap-independent translation. Host translation machinery recruitment to the viral mRNA is aided by structures present in 5′- and/or 3′-UTRs of the mRNAs instead of a 5′ cap/poly(A) tail (15.Kneller E.L. Rakotondrafara A.M. Miller W.A. Cap-independent translation of plant viral RNAs.Virus. Res. 2006; 119: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For cap-dependent translation initiation, a significant, central role is played by eIF4F. eIF4F interacts with PABP via the scaffolding protein eIF4G, the larger subunit of eIF4F (16.Jackson R.J. Standart N. Do the poly(A) tail and 3′ untranslated region control mRNA translation?.Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 17.Munroe D. Jacobson A. mRNA poly(A) tail, a 3′ enhancer of translational initiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). eIF4F, together with the factors eIF4A and eIF4B, is recruited to the 5′ end of the mRNA by eIF4F to generate the cap-binding complex. The efficient unwinding of secondary structure of mRNA is presumed to be catalyzed by binding of eIF4F, eIF4B, and eIF4A and hydrolysis of ATP (18.Merrick W.C. Mechanism and regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis.Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this stage, the 43S preinitiation complex (composed of eIFs 2 and 3, MettRNAi, GTP, and 40S subunit), along with other associated eIFs and the 60S ribosomal subunit, forms 80S ribosomes, and protein synthesis commences (19.Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Molecular mechanisms of translation initiation in eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The role of eIF4F in BYDV translation initiation is not clear. barley yellow dwarf virus BYDV translation element mutant of BTE with a CUAG insert at position 4873 wheat germ extract depleted WGE poly(A)-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor pseudoknot 1. Instead of a cap and poly(A) tail interacting synergistically, BYDV has a BYDV translation element (BTE) located in the 3′-UTR that interacts with a stem loop in the 5′-UTR of its mRNA (20.Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The 3′ BTE comprises nucleotides 4814–4918, has a cruciform/tRNA-like secondary structure with three major stem-loops (SL-I, SL-II, and SL-III) with stem loop IV forming the base, and is the minimum requirement for successful in vitro translation (see Fig. 1) (20.Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A. Structure and function of a cap-independent translation element that functions in either the 3′ or the 5′ untranslated region.RNA. 2000; 6: 1808-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cap-independent translation initiation at the upstream AUG is stimulated by 3′ BTE via base pairing (kissing stem loop interaction) of the 3′ SL-III to the 5′ SL-D loop of the viral genomic RNA (see Fig. 1) (21.Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Base-pairing between untranslated regions facilitates translation of uncapped, nonpolyadenylated viral RNA.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Translation was vitiated by single point mutations in any of the five bases of either of the kissing loops because of disrupted interactions both in in vivo and in vitro experiments, whereas base pairing restored by compensatory double mutations restored translation (21.Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Base-pairing between untranslated regions facilitates translation of uncapped, nonpolyadenylated viral RNA.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The sequence and structural elements in the 3′-UTR of the mRNA control the efficiency of translation (22.Dreher T.W. Miller W.A. Translational control in positive strand RNA plant viruses.Virology. 2006; 344: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23.Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). The 3′ BTE is the binding site of eIF4F (24.Kraft J.J. Treder K. Peterson M.S. Miller W.A. Cation-dependent folding of 3′ cap-independent translation elements facilitates interaction of a 17-nucleotide conserved sequence with eIF4G.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3398-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The role of eIF4F is unclear because eIF4F binds to the 3′ BTE and the nonfunctional mutant BTEBF with similar affinity in in vitro studies (25.Treder K. Kneller E.L. Allen E.M. Wang Z. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. The 3′ cap-independent translation element of Barley yellow dwarf virus binds eIF4F via the eIF4G subunit to initiate translation.RNA. 2008; 14: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine the role of eIF4F and other purified eIFs in the 3′ BTE-mediated translation, biophysical studies were used. The 3′ BTE functionally mimics the 5′ cap and is able to translate efficiently when placed in the 5′-UTR. In this study, WT 3′ BTE and four other mutants BTEBF, SII-m1, SL-III-3, and SL-III SWAP (the mutations/changes in bases are shown in Fig. 1) with in vitro translation efficiencies from 5 to 164% compared with WT BTE (2.Rakotondrafara A.M. Polacek C. Harris E. Miller W.A.

Structure and function of a cap-independent translation element that functions in either the 3′ or the 5′ untranslated region.RNA. 2000; 6: 1808-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were used. Binding of eIF4F and other initiation factors (eIF4B, 4A, and PABP) to the WT 3′ BTE and mutants (BTEBF, SII-m1, SL-III-3, and SL-III SWAP) was characterized using fluorescence anisotropy and stopped flow kinetics, which gave equilibrium binding constant values (Kd), a measure of relative complex stability, and kinetic constants. We show 1) translation efficiencies correlated well with eIF4F binding; 2) as yet unidentified proteins or small molecules in WGE prevented binding of eIF4F to BTEBF mutant but not WT BTE; 3) kinetics experiments showed that the association rate constants were similar for WT and mutants, indicating stability rather than kinetics correlates with translation; and 4) eIF4F interactions with 3′ BTE and mutants were both enthalpically and entropically favorable. The enthalpic contribution to ΔG° was 52–90% at 25 °C. This quantitative information, together with the stability measurements and kinetics, determined the nature of interactions and yielded information on the role of eIF4F in the sequential assembly of the initiation complex and its ability to facilitate translation initiation. GSTrap 4B columns and m7GTP-Sepharose 4B were purchased from GE Healthcare. HisPur Cobalt chromatography cartridges were purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce Protein Biology Products (Rockford, IL). Phosphocellulose P11 cation exchange media was purchased from Whatman (part of GE Healthcare). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Millipore Amicon Ultra-15, 10-kDa cutoff centrifugal filter units, Millex (PVDF) 0.22- and 0.45-μm syringe filters, Stericup 250 ml (PVDF 0.22) μm were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. RNAseOUT was purchased from Invitrogen. DNA templates for in vitro transcription were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). A dicistronic plasmid construct (vector pET3d) harboring encoding regions for both eIF4G and eIF4E for the expression of the recombinant WT eIF4F complex was a generous gift from Dr. K. S. Browning (University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX), and protein was purified as described elsewhere (26.Mayberry L.K. Dennis M.D. Leah Allen M. Ruud Nitka K. Murphy P.A. Campbell L. Browning K.S.

The modifications to the protocol are described below. BL21(DE3) cells were transformed using standard methods and selected with ampicillin antibiotic. A single colony was used for a 50-ml overnight culture and was transferred to 0.8 liter of medium in four 4-liter flasks the next day. All the cultures were incubated at 30 °C and grown to A600 = ≈0.8. Induction of eIF4F expression was accomplished using 0.5 mm IPTG (final concentration). Cells were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation (6000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. The composition of Buffer B-0 used in purification was as follows: 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT with KCl added as required). The cell pellet was suspended in 50 ml of Buffer B-150 (150 mm KCl) containing one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets), 5 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 500 μl of 10 mg/ml polymethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated three times for 30 s at 70% power followed by two times for 30 s at 90% power with intermittent cooling on ice for 2–3 min between sonication bursts. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted to KCl = ≈100 mm and was loaded on to a 10-ml phosphocellulose column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B-100. eIF4F was washed with buffer B-100 and eluted with Buffer B-300. The fractions containing the highest concentration of eIF4F were pooled and diluted to 100 mm KCl by the addition of Buffer B-0 and loaded on to a 4-ml m7GTP Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer B-100 and washed with the same buffer. eIF4F was eluted with Buffer B-100 containing 100 μm m7GTP. The pooled fractions with highest purity and concentration were applied to a 1-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated in Buffer B-100 and washed with the same buffer. eIF4F was eluted with Buffer B-300. The protein was diluted using B-0 to 100 mm KCl and concentrated using Millipore Amicon Ultra 15-ml, 10-kDa cutoff. The purity of eIF4F was confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined using the Bradford method with BSA as a standard (27.Bradford M.M.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). His-tagged PABP and eIF4A protein were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli strain using pET19b and pET23d vector (a generous gift from Dr. D. R. Gallie, University of California, Riverside, CA), respectively, and were purified as described elsewhere (28.Khan M.A. Yumak H. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J.

Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS, selected using ampicillin, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Pelleted cells were resuspended in binding buffer (PBS, pH 7.4 along with 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) sonicated and ultracentrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml GSTrap 4B column and purified according to manufacturer's specifications. All buffers used in protein purification were passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). Purified protein was dialyzed against titration buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT) and filtered using a 0.22-μm PVDF Millex (Millipore) filter before the anisotropy/stopped flow measurements were performed. The RNA oligomers (BTE, BTEBF, SII-m1, SL-III-3 and SL-III SWAP) were transcribed using dsDNA templates by using T7 RNA polymerase. The transcription reaction was: 1× transcription buffer (stock 10×: 0.4 m Tris, pH 8, 100 mm DTT, Triton X-100 0.1%, 10 mm spermidine, filtered using 0.22-μm Millipore sterile PVDF filters); ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, and GMP (final concentration, 5 mm); 25 mm MgCl2; dsDNA (final concentration, 200 nm); and T7 polymerase (1:200 of final volume. RNAseOUT (Invitrogen) was added to reduce RNA degradation. The volume was made up to the desired transcription volume using diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Pyrophosphatase was added for increased yields. The transcription mix was incubated overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, EDTA (50 mm final) was added to stop the reaction by chelating MgCl2. The transcription mix, along with the loading dye (Life Technologies gel loading buffer II AM8547) in 1:1 ratio was applied onto a 10% denaturing poly acrylamide gel made with TBE and 7 m urea. The gel was prerun for an hour, and then RNA was loaded, and the gel was run for 2 h at 200V. The RNA band was visualized using UV shadowing and cut out. The RNA was eluted from the gel and precipitated using three volumes of absolute ethanol and 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, at −20 °C. After spinning the precipitate down, the pellet was washed with chilled 70% ethanol and air-dried. RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water and was fluorescein-labeled at the 5′ end using Vector Labs (Burlingame, CA) 5′ end tag labeling kit and purified according to the kit manufacturer's recommendations. Before titration, the RNAs were refolded by heating to their melting temperature and slow cooling to room temperature in titration buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2. A Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 FluorEssenceTM spectrofluorimeter was used for fluorescence anisotropy experiments using an L-format detection configuration and a 1-cm-path-length quartz cuvette. Vertically polarized light with wavelength of 490 nm was used for excitation (slit width, 4 nm), and the emission (slit width, 5 nm) was measured at 520 nm in the horizontal and vertical directions. Fluorescein-labeled 3′ BTE (FlBTE) of BYDV mRNA or BTE mutants (50 nm) were titrated in the titration buffer with increasing concentrations of eIF4F, eIF4A, eIF4B, PABP, eIF4F·4B, eIF4F·PABP, and eIF4F·4A complexes. An increase in FlBTE/mutants RNA anisotropy was used to measure the interaction of initiation factors (eIFs) with 3′ BTE RNA. Temperature was 25 °C for all experiments unless otherwise noted (temperature dependence studies). The dissociation equilibrium constant was determined by fitting the anisotropy data to Equation 1 (30.Kohler J.J. Schepartz A. Kinetic studies of Fos·Jun·DNA complex formation. DNA binding prior to dimerization.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 130-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). robs=rmin+{(rmax−rmin)/(2×[FIBTE/mutants])}{b−(b2 −4[FIBTE/mutants][elFs])0.5}(Eq. 1) where b = Kd + [FlBTE/mutants] + [eIFs], robs is the observed anisotropy for any point in the titration curve, rmin is the minimum observed anisotropy in the absence of protein, and rmax is the maximum anisotropy at saturation and is fit as a parameter. [FlBTE/mutants] and [eIFs] are the 3′ BTE RNA and its mutants and protein concentrations (eIFs = eIF4F, PABP, eIF4A, eIF4F·PABP, and eIF4F·4A complex), respectively. Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant assuming one protein-binding site/RNA. KaleidaGraphTM software was used to perform nonlinear least squares fitting of the titration data. Uncertainties in Kd values are reported for one sigma as determined from data fitting. Data values from three independent titration experiments were averaged and used for calculations. The concentrations of protein and RNA were measured using an OLIS HP diode array (8452A) UV-visible spectrophotometer. Previously reported equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values (7.Le H.

The samples were incubated for 10 min to ensure protein complex formation prior to data collection. Temperature dependence of the association equilibrium constants was used to determine the thermodynamic parameters of enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and free energy (ΔG) of eIF4F binding to 3′ BTE RNA using van't Hoff plots of −ln Keq versus 1/T, according to Equations 2 and 3, − RT In Keq=ΔH−TΔS(Eq. 2) ΔG=−RT In Keq(Eq. 3) where R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Keq, the association equilibrium constant, was determined at different temperatures. ΔH and ΔS were determined from the slope and intercept, respectively, of the plot of ln Keq versus 1/T, and ΔG was determined from Equation 3. The samples were thermostatted at 5, 15, 25, 30, and 35 ± 0.5 °C. Titrations as described previously were performed in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT. A thermocouple was used inside the cuvette to monitor temperature. The temperature dependence studies for SL-III-3 and eIF4F were done in the range of 25–35 °C because the tight binding constants made measurement at lower temperatures impractical. An OLIS RSM 1000 stopped flow system with a 1-ms dead time was used to perform stopped flow fluorescence experiments. The sample was excited at a wavelength of 280 nm, and the cut-on filter of 300 nm was used to investigate RNA-eIF4F interactions. Flow cell and solution reservoir temperatures were maintained using a temperature-controlled circulating water bath. After rapid mixing of 0.75 μm (0.375 μm after mixing) eIF4F with 3–5 μm (1.5–2.5 μm after mixing) 3′ BTE or mutant RNA in titration buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm DTT), the time course of the fluorescence intensity change was recorded. BTE or mutant RNA binding induced a decrease in eIF4F fluorescence. A reference photomultiplier was used to monitor fluctuations in the lamp intensity. 1000 pairs of data were recorded with 5–7 shots averaged in each experiment. Stopped flow data from three separate experiment sets were averaged and then fitted to nonlinear analytical equations using Global analysis software provided by OLIS. Single and double exponential functions were used for data fitting (32.Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B.

The single exponential equation fitted curves correspond to Equation 4, Ft=ΔF exp(kobst)+F∞(Eq. 4) where Ft is fluorescence observed at any time, t, ΔF is the amplitude, F∞ is the final value of fluorescence, and kobs is the observed first-order rate constant. For double exponential fits, Ft=ΔF1 exp(kobs1 t)+ΔF2 exp(kobs2 t)+F∞(Eq. 5) where ΔF1 and ΔF2 are the amplitudes of two exponentials with rate constants kobs1 and kobs2, respectively. The reaction was consistent with a single exponential process, as would be expected under the pseudo-first order conditions used in the experiment.

To further examine what, if any, role binding of eIF4F had on translation, a variety of 3′ BTE mutants with widely different translational efficiencies were selected for binding studies. 3′ BTE and mutants with in vitro translation efficiencies from 5 to 164% (WT = 100%) were studied (2.Rakotondrafara A.M.

The current studies do exactly that and show that women do indeed make better gift selections for others, regardless of the gender of the receiver and the type of relationship between the giver and receiver. We investigate the mediating role of different aspects of interpersonal sensitivity and reveal that differences in interpersonal interest (measured with an autism questionnaire), but not differences in interpersonal reactivity, explain gender differences in gift selection quality. The current studies thus present the first objective evidence for the claim that women are better in selecting gifts for others and also give an indication of why this is the case."

Recently, some of the POK (POZ-domain Krüppel-like zinc finger) family proteins have been shown to play roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and oncogenesis. We investigated whether HKR3, an inhibitor of cell proliferation and an uncharacterized POK family protein, could regulate the cell cycle by controlling expression of genes within the p53 pathway (ARF-MDM2-TP53-p21WAF/CDKN1A). HKR3 potently activated the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene ARF by acting on the proximal promoter region (bp, −149∼+53), which contains Sp1 and FBI-1 binding elements (FREs). HKR3 interacted with the co-activator p300 to activate ARF transcription, which increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 within the proximal promoter. Oligonucleotide pull-down assays and ChIP assays revealed that HKR3 interferes with the binding of the proto-oncogenic transcription repressor FBI-1 to proximal FREs, thus derepressing ARF transcription.

(POZ-domain Krüppel-like zinc finger) family proteins have been shown to play roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, oncogenesis, or tumor suppression by acting either as oncoproteins or tumor suppressors. POK family proteins, such as ZBTB2, ZBTB5, ZBTB7A(FBI-1), ZBTB7C(KR-POK), and ZBTB8A(BOZF1), were shown to regulate cell cycle and proliferation through the regulation of CDKN1A, a gene member of the p53 pathway (ARF-MDM2-TP53-CDKN1A).

In particular, interactions between certain POK family proteins and co-regulators (e.g. BCoR, NCoR, SMRT, p300, and p120) are important for the transcriptional regulation of target genes (6.Lin R.J.

While the biological functions of ZBTB4, ZBTB7C(FBI-1), ZBTB16(PLZF), ZBTB27(BCL6), and ZBTB33(KAISO) are relatively well studied, the other POK family proteins remain little investigated. POZ-domain Krüppel-like zinc finger FBI-1 binding element human Krüppel-related 3 alternate reading frame fluorescence-activated cell sorting. ARF (alternative open reading frame) is a tumor suppressor protein that is encoded by an alternate reading frame of the INK4a/ARF locus (CDKN2A) (8.Kim W.Y. Sharpless N.E.

Regulation of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a tumour suppressor locus: all for one or one for all.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Expression of ARF is up-regulated during replicative senescence and also by oncogenes. Animals lacking ARF function are highly tumor-prone. The Ink4a/Arf locus is frequently mutated in various human cancers (8.Kim W.Y. Sharpless N.E. The regulation of INK4/ARF in cancer and aging.Cell. 2006; 127: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 9.Gil J. Peters G. Regulation of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a tumour suppressor locus: all for one or one for all.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). ARF, which mostly accumulates in the nucleolus, forms a complex with Mdm2, a multifaceted protein that opposes the function of p53 by blocking its transcriptional activation domain, facilitating its nuclear export, and catalyzing its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (10.Moll U.M. Petrenko O. The MDM2-p53 interaction.Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 1001-1008PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D.

Med. 1999; 5: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic ARF stabilizes p53 and causes cells to arrest in G1 and G2 phases, accompanied by increased expression of p53 target genes such as p21 and MDM2, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (13.Silva J. Silva J.M. Domínguez G. García J.M. Cantos B. Rodríguez R. Larrondo F.J. Provencio M. España P. Bonilla F.

A loss of ARF or p53 promotes cell proliferation (15.Sherr C.J. Divorcing ARF and p53: an unsettled case.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). ARF has also been reported to arrest cell cycles in S-phase in a p53-independent manner (16.Yarbrough W.G. Bessho M. Zanation A. Bisi J.E. Xiong Y.

ARF induces cell-cycle arrest in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p21 or p53, probably by inducing additional downstream effectors (18.Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. p53-independent functions of the p19(ARF) tumor suppressor.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19.Modestou M.

Arf induces p53-dependent and -independent antiproliferative genes.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1046-1053PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which ARF transcription is regulated is quite complex and involves a cascade of molecular events that vary, depending on the cell types and species (9.Gil J. Peters G. Regulation of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a tumour suppressor locus: all for one or one for all.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). ARF expression is induced by activation of oncogenes like Ras or c-Myc (21.Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. p19ARF links the tumour suppressor p53 to Ras.Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 22.Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L.

Ras activates Arf expression in MEFs by increasing DMP1 (cyclin d-binding Myb-like protein) binding to the Arf promoter (23.Sreeramaneni R. Chaudhry A. McMahon M. Sherr C.J. Inoue K. Ras-Raf-Arf signaling critically depends on the Dmp1 transcription factor.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AP1 (e.g. c-Jun and Fra-1) also cooperates with Ras in the transcriptional activation of the ARF promoter (24.Ameyar-Zazoua M. Wisniewska M.B. Bakiri L. Wagner E.F. Yaniv M. Weitzman J.B. AP-1 dimers regulate transcription of the p14/p19ARF tumor suppressor gene.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2298-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However regulation of human ARF expression in response to oncogenic signals is different from that of murine Arf. Oncogenic Ras cannot induce ARF expression in human cells (25.Brookes S. Rowe J. Ruas M. Llanos S. Clark P.A. Lomax M. James M.C. Vatcheva R. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Parry D. Gruis N. Smit N. Bergman W. Peters G. INK4a-deficient human diploid fibroblasts are resistant to RAS-induced senescence.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Other oncogenes like E2F-1 and c-Myc can induce ARF expression, but each trigger expression other genes that promote G1 phase progression and apoptosis (26.Inoue K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Induction of ARF tumor suppressor gene expression and cell cycle arrest by transcription factor DMP1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Myc activates ARF by direct binding to its promoter, but its effects on ARF are complicated by the fact that it can also activate Bmi1, a repressor of ARF (27.Guney I. Wu S. Sedivy J.M. Reduced c-Myc signaling triggers telomereindependent senescence by regulating Bmi-1 and p16(INK4a).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The proliferative effects of Myc are usually countered by apoptosis (28.Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Induction of apoptosis in fibroblasts by c-myc protein.Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). For example, E2F-1 activates transcription of ARF and induces apoptosis (29.Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. E2F-1 potentiates cell death by blocking antiapoptotic signaling pathways.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). ARF is negatively regulated by various factors like Bmi1, TBX3, p53, and FBI-1. These factors can bind directly to the Arf promoter and repress its transcription (30.Bracken A.P.

FBI-1 (Factor Binding to IST, ZBTB7A), recently defined as a proto-oncoprotein, also represses ARF expression, which aids in cellular transformation by oncoproteins, such as c-MYC, RAS, and E2F-1 (33.Maeda T.

HKR3 is a relatively uncharacterized POK family protein with a POZ-domain and 11 zinc finger domains. HKR3 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (36.Maris J.M. Jensen J. Sulman E.P. Beltinger C.P. Allen C. Biegel J.A. Brodeur G.M. White P.S. Human Krüppel-related 3 (HKR3): a candidate for the 1p36 neuroblastoma tumour suppressor gene?.Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1991-1996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The HKR3 gene is mapped to human chromosome 1p36, which is commonly rearranged (leiomyoma and leukemias) or deleted in various cancers (neuroblastoma, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinomas, pheochromocytoma and breast and colon carcinomas) (36.Maris J.M.

A correlation between deletions or rearrangements of HKR3 and human cancer suggest a role for HKR3 as a potential tumor suppressor (36.Maris J.M. Jensen J. Sulman E.P. Beltinger C.P. Allen C. Biegel J.A. Brodeur G.M. White P.S. Human Krüppel-related 3 (HKR3): a candidate for the 1p36 neuroblastoma tumour suppressor gene?.Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1991-1996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, a more fine deletion of the 1p36 region (1 Mbp), which is observed in human neuroblastoma, does not contain HKR3. Based on this observation, authors suggested that HKR3 may not be a tumor suppressor (37.Bauer A. Savelyeva L. Claas A. Praml C. Berthold F. Schwab M. Smallest region of overlapping deletion in 1p36 in human neuroblastoma: a 1 Mbp cosmid and PAC contig.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 31: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Little is known about the functions of the HKR protein at the molecular, cellular, or genetic levels. It is not certain whether HKR3 can play a role as a tumor suppressor or not. By bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays of protein-protein interactions among POK family proteins, we found that HKR3 interacts with FBI-1, a potent repressor of ARF transcription (38.Kim M.H. Roh H.E. Lee M.N. Hur M.W. New fast BiFC plasmid assay system for in vivo protein-protein interactions.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We then further investigated functions of HKR3 in the regulation of ARF expression. We found that HKR3, by acting on the proximal ARF promoter, activates ARF transcription, which is reversed by the proto-oncoprotein FBI-1. pcDNA3.1-HKR3-His, pcDNA3.0-FLAG-FBI-1, and the expression plasmids of various p300 polypeptide fragments were prepared by cloning cDNA fragments into pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Various promoter-luciferase gene fusion constructs, such as pGL2-TP53-Luc, pGL2-ARF-Luc, pGL2-MDM2-Luc and pGL2-CDKN1A-Luc, were reported elsewhere (1.Jeon B.N. Choi W.I. Yu M.Y. Yoon A.R. Kim M.H.

A series of pGL2-ARF-Luc plasmids were prepared by cloning the human ARF promoter DNA fragments (bp, −500∼+28; bp, −309∼+28; bp, −164∼+28; bp, −106∼+28; bp, −82∼+28; bp, −52∼+28; bp, +5∼+28) into a pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pGL2-ARF-Luc −500 bp construct, with a mutation at FRE #4 (bp, −41∼-37, GGGGG to AAAAA), was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. The pGL2-CDKN1A-Luc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Sowa of the Kyoto Perpetual University of Medicine (Kyoto, Japan). Dr. Kyung-Sup Kim of Yonsei University provided the pcDNA3.0-HA-p300 expression plasmid. To prepare recombinant GST-POZHKR3, GST-ZFHKR3, GST-POZFBI-1, and GST-ZFFBI-1 proteins, cDNA fragments encoding the HKR3 POZ domain (a.a. 1∼140), HKR3 zinc fingers (a.a. 291∼600), FBI-1 POZ domain (a.a. 1∼120), and FBI-1 zinc fingers (a.a. 376∼489) were cloned into pGEX4T3 or pGEX4T1. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies against GAPDH, ARF, p300, His-tag, FLAG-tag, acetylated Ac-H3, and Ac-H4 were purchased from Millipore, Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher Scientific or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To obtain a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the HKR3 protein, a white rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with recombinant GST-ZFHKR3 (a.a. 291∼600) polypeptides 6 times at 2-week intervals. Blood was collected, incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, and centrifuged. IgG was purified from the serum (10 ml) using an Econo-Pac serum IgG purification Kit (Santa Cruz, CA), and was further incubated with Affi-Gel 10 beads conjugated with GST- GST-ZFHKR3. The beads were then collected and washed, and the column was eluted to obtain the affinity-purified antibody. Most of the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen. HEK293 embryonic kidney and HCT116 colon cancer, and A459 lung cancer cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. HDFn (Human Dermal Fibroblast, neonatal) cells (Invitrogen) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in Medium 106 supplemented with low serum growth supplement (LSGS) and 100 units/ml penicillin. Reporter plasmids (pGL2-MDM2-Luc, pGL2-TP53-Luc, pGL2-CDKN1A-Luc, and various pGL2-ARF-Luc plasmids) and pcDNA3.1-HKR3-His, pcDNA3.1-HKR3-ΔPOZ-His, pcDNA3-HA-p300, pcDNA3-FLAG-FBI-1, or pcDNA3 control vector in various combinations were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine with Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 36 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity using a Microplate LB 96V luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Reporter activity was normalized to co-transfected β-galactosidase activities or protein concentration to normalize the transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a SpectraMAX 250 ELISA reader (Molecular Device Co., Sunnyvale, CA) at 420 nm. The assays were repeated three times. Four siRNA constructs against HKR3 mRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and synthesized from Bioneer (Bioneer, Daejon, South Korea). The siRNA sequences were as follows. siHKR3–1, 5′-GAUCUUUGGCCUCUUGUUG-3′, 5′-CAACAAGAGGCCAAAGAUC-3′, siHKR3–2, 5′-GCUACAAGUUUACCCGACA-3′, 5′-UGUCGGGUAAACUUGUAGC-3′. Each siRNA (100 pmoles) was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were harvested, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, and the samples were analyzed for knockdown by RT-qPCR. Cells were treated with formaldehyde (final 1%) to cross-link proteins to the ARF promoter. The remaining ChIP procedures have been reported elsewhere (1.Jeon B.N. Choi W.I. Yu M.Y. Yoon A.R.

As a negative control for the ChIP-qRT-PCR assays, IgG was used. qRT-PCR of chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify the proximal promoter region (bp, −149∼+53; forward, 5′-ATCTTGGAGGTCCGGGTGGGAGTGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGCTCGGCAGCCGCTGCGCCGCCC-3′) and distal promoter region of the ARF gene (bp, −540∼-300, forward, 5′-ATTTTTAAATAATCTAGTTTGAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-ATCTTCCCACCCTCAGCGCGGGCGC-3′). Also, in some ChIP-qRT-PCR assays, the 3′-UTR of the ARF promoter was used as a negative control for protein-DNA interaction. Forward, 5′-ACGCCCTAAGCGCACATTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCTAGTTCACAAAATGCTTGTCATG-3′ were used. For ChIP-reChIP assays of HKR3 and p300 binding at the ARF proximal promoter, the first ChIP samples using anti-HKR3 antibody or anti-p300 antibody were diluted 10 times with dilution buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated using anti-HKR3 or anti-p300 antibodies. Negative control ChIP assays were carried out using a rabbit IgG antibody. HEK293 cells (transfected with expression vector, if necessary) were washed, pelleted, and resuspended in a lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were precleared, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with anti-HKR3, FBI-1, His or FLAG antibody on a rotating platform at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Santa Cruz). The beads were collected, washed, and resuspended in equal volumes of 5× SDS loading buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10∼15% SDS-PAGE. Cellular extracts or recombinant protein (GST-fusion protein) were incubated with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides for 12 h. The mixtures were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 4 h, washed with HKMG buffer five times, and precipitated by centrifugation. The precipitated protein-biotin-streptavidin oligonucleotide complexes were then analyzed by Western blot. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are the following (note that only the top strands are shown): ARF promoter FRE#1, 5′- GATCAGATGGTGGTGGGGGTGGGGGCGCACACAGG-3′; FRE#2, 5′-GATCGAGTGGGGGTGGGGTGGGGGTGGGGGT-3′; FRE#3, 5′-GATCGAAGGTGGGGGGCGGGCGCGCTCAGGGA-3′; FRE#4, 5′-GATCCGGAGATGGGCAGGGGGCGGTGCGTGGG-3′. Recombinant GST, GST-POZHKR3, GST-ZFHKR3, GST-POZFBI-1, and GST-ZFFBI-1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose-4 beads (Peptron, Daejeon, South Korea). p300, four polypeptide fragments of p300, FBI-1 or HKR3 were prepared using TNT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Extract (Promega). GST-fusion protein-agarose bead complexes were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled p300, four p300 polypeptide fragments, FBI-1, or HKR3 at 4 °C overnight in HEMG buffer. The reaction mixtures were precipitated, the pellets were washed, and the bound proteins were separated by 10∼15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then exposed to x-ray film using an image-intensifying screen (Kodak). Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed with PBS, and cellular DNA was then stained with propidium iodide (100 μg/ml) for cell cycle analysis. A cell cycle profile and forward scatter were determined using a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur, and the data were analyzed using ModFit LT 2.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). To investigate the effect of HKR3 on cell viability, cells were plated onto 6-well dishes at 30–50% confluency and incubated. The cell viability of each sample was determined by measuring the conversion of the tetrazolium salt MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) to formazan (absorbance at 570 nm). An Annexin-V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) was used to detect apoptosis by flow cytometry. All cells were harvested (including detached cells) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed and resuspended with 1× binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 100 ml of the solution (1 × 105 cells) was transferred to a 5-ml culture tube. In all, 5 μl of annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 5 μl of propidium iodide were added to the solution, followed by gentle vortexing of the cells and incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. In total, 400 μl of 1× binding buffer was added to each tube. Cell apoptosis was determined using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) instrument within 1 h. Data were analyzed using BD CellQuest Prosoftware (BD Biosciences). The nuclear extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used to separate cellular cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Cells were resuspended in 1× hypotonic buffer and incubated for 15 min on ice, followed by adding detergent and vortexing. The cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was collected following centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in complete lysis buffer, and the nuclear fraction (supernant) then recovered by centrifugation. Student's t test was used for the statistical analyses. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. HKR3 has a POZ domain at the N terminus (a.a. 4∼119) and eleven C2H2 type Krüppel-like zinc finger motifs in the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 1A). HKR3 was detected in the nucleus by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). We then investigated whether HKR3 could regulate cell cycle progression using flow cytometry and MTT assays in HKR3- or siRNA-transfected HEK293 cells. MTT assays revealed that HKR3 significantly decreased cell proliferation, while siRNA knockdown of HKR3 mRNA increased cell proliferation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry indicated that HKR3 induced cell cycle arrest and substantially decreased the number of HEK293 cells in S-phase (49.7% versus 30.2%). The knockdown of endogenous HKR3 mRNA by two HKR3 siRNAs resulted in an increased number of cells in S-phase (49.7 versus 67.4, a 69.6% increase), and a concomitant decrease in the number of cells in G0 and G1 phases (Fig. 1C). Ectopic expression or knockdown of HKR3 did not induce apoptosis in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that HKR3 inhibits cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest, but not by apoptosis. Recently, we found that some POK proteins regulate the cell cycle by controlling the p53 pathway (1.Jeon B.N. Choi W.I. Yu M.Y. Yoon A.R. Kim M.H. Yun C.O. Hur M.W.

https://openalex.org/W2014693614,"Background Recent landmark studies have profiled cancer cell lines for molecular features, along with measuring the corresponding growth inhibitory effects for specific drug compounds. These data present a tool for determining which subsets of human cancer might be more responsive to particular drugs. To this end, the NCI-DREAM-sponsored DREAM7: Drug Sensitivity Prediction Challenge (sub-challenge 1) set out to predict the sensitivities of 18 breast cancer cell lines to 31 previously untested compounds, on the basis of molecular profiling data and a training subset of cell lines. Methods and Results With 47 teams submitting blinded predictions, team Creighton scored third in terms of overall accuracy. Team Creighton's method was simple and straightforward, incorporated multiple expression data types (RNA-seq, gene array, RPPA), and incorporated all profiled features (not only the “best” predictive ones). As an extension of the approach, cell line data, from public datasets of expression profiling coupled with drug sensitivities (Barretina, Garnett, Heiser) were used to “predict” the drug sensitivities in human breast tumors (using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas). Drug sensitivity correlations within human breast tumors showed differences by expression-based subtype, with many associations in line with the expected (e.g. Lapatinib sensitivity in HER2-enriched cancers) and others inviting further study (e.g. relative resistance to PI3K inhibitors in basal-like cancers). Conclusions Molecular patterns associated with drug sensitivity are widespread, with potentially hundreds of genes that could be incorporated into making predictions, as well as offering biological clues as to the mechanisms involved. Applying the cell line patterns to human tumor data may help generate hypotheses on what tumor subsets might be more responsive to therapies, where multiple cell line datasets representing various drugs may be used, in order to assess consistency of patterns."
