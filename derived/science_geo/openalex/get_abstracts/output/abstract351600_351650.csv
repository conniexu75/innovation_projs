https://openalex.org/W2113903666,"Effective conservation requires rigorous baselines of pristine conditions to assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming."

ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p<0.001 and fold-change >1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p<0.001) and TTK (p = 0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers.Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2050599075,"Postnatal bone marrow houses mesenchymal progenitor cells that are osteoblast precursors. These cells have established therapeutic potential, but they are difficult to maintain and expand in vitro, presumably because little is known about the mechanisms controlling their fate decisions. To investigate the potential role of Notch signaling in osteoblastogenesis, we used conditional alleles to genetically remove components of the Notch signaling system during skeletal development. We found that disruption of Notch signaling in the limb skeletogenic mesenchyme markedly increased trabecular bone mass in adolescent mice. Notably, mesenchymal progenitors were undetectable in the bone marrow of mice with high bone mass. As a result, these mice developed severe osteopenia as they aged. Moreover, Notch signaling seemed to inhibit osteoblast differentiation through Hes or Hey proteins, which diminished Runx2 transcriptional activity via physical interaction. These results support a model wherein Notch signaling in bone marrow normally acts to maintain a pool of mesenchymal progenitors by suppressing osteoblast differentiation. Thus, mesenchymal progenitors may be expanded in vitro by activating the Notch pathway, whereas bone formation in vivo may be enhanced by transiently suppressing this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2004439203,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of proliferation and progression in human cancers. Five EGFR inhibitors, two monoclonal antibodies and three TKIs, have recently gained FDA approval in oncology (cetuximab, panitumumab, erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib). These strategies of EGFR inhibition demonstrate major tumor regressions in approximately 10–20% of advanced cancer patients. However, many tumors eventually manifest acquired resistance to treatment. In this study we established and characterized a model to study molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Using high-throughput screening we examined the activity of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases in resistant tumor cells following chronic exposure to cetuximab. Cells developing acquired resistance to cetuximab exhibited increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in trafficking and degradation. In addition, cetuximab-resistant cells manifested strong activation of HER2, HER3 and cMET. EGFR upregulation promoted increased dimerization with HER2 and HER3 leading to their transactivation. Blockade of EGFR and HER2 led to loss of HER3 and PI(3)K/Akt activity. These data suggest that acquired resistance to cetuximab is accompanied by dysregulation of EGFR internalization/degradation and subsequent EGFR-dependent activation of HER3. Taken together these findings suggest a rationale for the clinical evaluation of combinatorial anti-HER targeting approaches in tumors manifesting acquired resistance to cetuximab."

https://openalex.org/W2118040479,"Microbes are key players in both healthy and degraded coral reefs. A combination of metagenomics, microscopy, culturing, and water chemistry were used to characterize microbial communities on four coral atolls in the Northern Line Islands, central Pacific. Kingman, a small uninhabited atoll which lies most northerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of an open ocean ecosystem. On this atoll the microbial community was equally divided between autotrophs (mostly Prochlorococcus spp.) and heterotrophs. In contrast, Kiritimati, a large and populated (∼5500 people) atoll, which is most southerly in the chain, had microbial and water chemistry characteristic of a near-shore environment. On Kiritimati, there were 10 times more microbial cells and virus-like particles in the water column and these microbes were dominated by heterotrophs, including a large percentage of potential pathogens. Culturable Vibrios were common only on Kiritimati. The benthic community on Kiritimati had the highest prevalence of coral disease and lowest coral cover. The middle atolls, Palmyra and Tabuaeran, had intermediate densities of microbes and viruses and higher percentages of autotrophic microbes than either Kingman or Kiritimati. The differences in microbial communities across atolls could reflect variation in 1) oceaonographic and/or hydrographic conditions or 2) human impacts associated with land-use and fishing. The fact that historically Kingman and Kiritimati did not differ strongly in their fish or benthic communities (both had large numbers of sharks and high coral cover) suggest an anthropogenic component in the differences in the microbial communities. Kingman is one of the world's most pristine coral reefs, and this dataset should serve as a baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes. Obtaining the microbial data set, from atolls is particularly important given the association of microbes in the ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2009951097,"Notch signaling is a key mechanism in the control of embryogenesis. However, its in vivo function during mesenchymal cell differentiation, and, specifically, in bone homeostasis, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that osteoblast-specific gain of Notch function causes severe osteosclerosis owing to increased proliferation of immature osteoblasts. Under these pathological conditions, Notch stimulates early osteoblastic proliferation by upregulating the genes encoding cyclin D, cyclin E and Sp7 (osterix). The intracellular domain of Notch1 also regulates terminal osteoblastic differentiation by directly binding Runx2 and repressing its transactivation function. In contrast, loss of all Notch signaling in osteoblasts, generated by deletion of the genes encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 in bone, is associated with late-onset, age-related osteoporosis, which in turn results from increased osteoblast-dependent osteoclastic activity due to decreased osteoprotegerin mRNA expression in these cells. Together, these findings highlight the potential dimorphic effects of Notch signaling in bone homeostasis and may provide direction for novel therapeutic applications."

https://openalex.org/W2123848474,"Darwin originally pointed out that there is something about infants which prompts adults to respond to and care for them, in order to increase individual fitness, i.e. reproductive success, via increased survivorship of one's own offspring. Lorenz proposed that it is the specific structure of the infant face that serves to elicit these parental responses, but the biological basis for this remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether adults show specific brain responses to unfamiliar infant faces compared to adult faces, where the infant and adult faces had been carefully matched across the two groups for emotional valence and arousal, as well as size and luminosity. The faces also matched closely in terms of attractiveness. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in adults, we found that highly specific brain activity occurred within a seventh of a second in response to unfamiliar infant faces but not to adult faces. This activity occurred in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), an area implicated in reward behaviour, suggesting for the first time a neural basis for this vital evolutionary process. We found a peak in activity first in mOFC and then in the right fusiform face area (FFA). In mOFC the first significant peak (p<0.001) in differences in power between infant and adult faces was found at around 130 ms in the 10–15 Hz band. These early differences were not found in the FFA. In contrast, differences in power were found later, at around 165 ms, in a different band (20–25 Hz) in the right FFA, suggesting a feedback effect from mOFC. These findings provide evidence in humans of a potential brain basis for the “innate releasing mechanisms” described by Lorenz for affection and nurturing of young infants. This has potentially important clinical applications in relation to postnatal depression, and could provide opportunities for early identification of families at risk."

https://openalex.org/W2090677095,"The dynamic regulation of actin polymerization plays crucial roles in cell morphology and endocytosis. The mechanistic details of these processes and the proteins involved are not fully understood, especially in neurons. PICK1 is a PDZ-BAR-domain protein involved in regulated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis in neurons. Here, we demonstrate that PICK1 binds filamentous (F)-actin and the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex, and potently inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of PICK1 in neurons induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in aberrant cell morphology. Wild-type PICK1 rescues this phenotype, but a mutant PICK1, PICK1(W413A), that does not bind or inhibit Arp2/3 has no effect. Furthermore, this mutant also blocks NMDA-induced AMPAR internalization. This study identifies PICK1 as a negative regulator of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization that is critical for a specific form of vesicle trafficking, and also for the development of neuronal architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2054146568,"Controlling the number of its centrioles is vital for the cell, as supernumerary centrioles cause multipolar mitosis and genomic instability1,2. Normally, one daughter centriole forms on each mature (mother) centriole3,4; however, a mother centriole can produce multiple daughters within a single cell cycle5,6. The mechanisms that prevent centriole 'overduplication' are poorly understood. Here we use laser microsurgery to test the hypothesis that attachment of the daughter centriole to the wall of the mother inhibits formation of additional daughters7,8. We show that physical removal of the daughter induces reduplication of the mother in S-phase-arrested cells. Under conditions when multiple daughters form simultaneously on a single mother, all of these daughters must be removed to induce reduplication. The number of daughter centrioles that form during reduplication does not always match the number of ablated daughter centrioles. We also find that exaggeration of the pericentriolar material (PCM) by overexpression of the PCM protein pericentrin9 in S-phase-arrested CHO cells induces formation of numerous daughter centrioles. We propose that that the size of the PCM cloud associated with the mother centriole restricts the number of daughters that can form simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2161900438,"Some members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation channels mediate sensory responses to irritant substances. Although it is well known that TRPA1 channels are activated by pungent compounds found in garlic, onion, mustard and cinnamon extracts, activation of TRPV1 by these extracts remains controversial. Here we establish that TRPV1 is activated by pungent extracts from onion and garlic, as well as by allicin, the active compound in these preparations, and participates together with TRPA1 in the pain-related behavior induced by this compound. We found that in TRPV1 these agents act by covalent modification of cysteine residues. In contrast to TRPA1 channels, modification of a single cysteine located in the N-terminal region of TRPV1 was necessary and sufficient for all the effects we observed. Our findings point to a conserved mechanism of activation in TRP channels, which provides new insights into the molecular basis of noxious stimuli detection."
https://openalex.org/W2159189543,"Hsp27 inhibits mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in both normal and cancer cells by an unknown mechanism. To test the hypothesis that Hsp27 decreases apoptosis by inhibiting Bax, Hsp27 expression was manipulated in renal epithelial cells before transient metabolic stress, an insult that activates Bax, induces mitochondrial injury, and causes apoptosis. Compared with control, enhanced Hsp27 expression inhibited conformational Bax activation, oligomerization, and translocation to mitochondria, reduced the leakage of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, and significantly improved cell survival by >50% after stress. In contrast, Hsp27 down-regulation using RNA-mediated interference promoted Bax activation, increased Bax translocation, and reduced cell survival after stress. Immunoprecipitation did not detect Hsp27-Bax interaction before, during, or after stress, suggesting that Hsp27 indirectly inhibits Bax. During stress, Hsp27 expression prevented the inactivation of Akt, a pro-survival kinase, and increased the interaction between Akt and Bax, an Akt substrate. In contrast, Hsp27 RNA-mediated interference promoted Akt inactivation during stress. Hsp27 up- or down-regulation markedly altered the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), a major regulator of Akt. Furthermore, distinct PI3-kinase inhibitors completely abrogated the protective effect of Hsp27 expression on Akt activation, Bax inactivation, and cell survival. These data show that Hsp27 antagonizes Bax-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis by promoting Akt activation via a PI3-kinase-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2159805387,"IL-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cells. In the current study, we examined the role of IL-17A in sepsis induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). IL-17A levels, which rose time-dependently in plasma after CLP, were not affected in the absence of alphabeta T cells or neutrophils. In sharp contrast, gammadelta T cell-knockout or gammadelta T cell-depleted mice displayed baseline IL-17A plasma levels after CLP. Neutralization of IL-17A by two different antibodies improved sepsis (survival from approximately 10% to nearly 60%). Unexpectedly, antibody treatment was protective, even when administration of anti-IL-17A was delayed for up to 12 h after CLP. These protective effects of IL-17A blockade were associated with substantially reduced levels of bacteremia together with significant reductions of systemic proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in plasma. In vitro incubation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the copresence of IL-17A substantially increased the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 by these cells. These data suggest that, during experimental sepsis, gammadelta T cell-derived IL-17A promotes high levels of proinflammatory mediators and bacteremia, resulting in enhanced lethality. IL-17A may be a potential therapeutic target in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2069699462,"Background The availability of H5N1 vaccines that can elicit a broad cross-protective immunity against different currently circulating clade 2 H5N1 viruses is a pre-requisite for the development of a successful pre-pandemic vaccination strategy. In this regard, it has recently been shown that adjuvantation of a recombinant clade 1 H5N1 inactivated split-virion vaccine with an oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant system also promoted cross-immunity against a recent clade 2 H5N1 isolate (A/Indonesia/5/2005, subclade 2.1). Here we further analyse the cross-protective potential of the vaccine against two other recent clade 2 isolates (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and A/Anhui/1/2005 which are, as defined by WHO, representatives of subclades 2.2 and 2.3 respectively). Methods and Findings Two doses of the recombinant A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1, clade 1) vaccine were administered 21 days apart to volunteers aged 18–60 years. We studied the cross-clade immunogenicity of the lowest antigen dose (3.8 µg haemagglutinin) given with (N = 20) or without adjuvant (N = 20). Immune responses were assessed at 21 days following the first and second vaccine doses and at 6 months following first vaccination. Vaccination with two doses of 3.8 µg of the adjuvanted vaccine induced four-fold neutralising seroconversion rates in 85% of subjects against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (subclade 2.2) and 75% of subjects against A/Anhui/1/2005 (subclade 2.3) recombinant strains. There was no response induced against these strains in the non-adjuvanted group. At 6 months following vaccination, 70% and 60% of subjects retained neutralising antibodies against the recombinant subclade 2.2 and 2.3 strains, respectively and 40% of subjects retained antibodies against the recombinant subclade 2.1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain. Conclusions In addition to antigen dose-sparing, adjuvantation of inactivated split H5N1 vaccine promotes broad and persistent cross-clade immunity which is a pre-requisite for a pre-pandemic vaccine.

https://openalex.org/W2051114542,"Background In the U.S., tomatoes have become the most implicated vehicle for produce-associated Salmonellosis with 12 outbreaks since 1998. Although unconfirmed, trace backs suggest pre-harvest contamination with Salmonella enterica. Routes of tomato crop contamination by S. enterica in the absence of direct artificial inoculation have not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings This work examined the role of contaminated soil, the potential for crop debris to act as inoculum from one crop to the next, and any interaction between the seedbourne plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and S. enterica on tomato plants. Our results show S. enterica can survive for up to six weeks in fallow soil with the ability to contaminate tomato plants. We found S. enterica can contaminate a subsequent crop via crop debris; however a fallow period between crop incorporation and subsequent seeding can affect contamination patterns. Throughout these studies, populations of S. enterica declined over time and there was no bacterial growth in either the phyllosphere or rhizoplane. The presence of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria on co-colonized tomato plants had no effect on the incidence of S. enterica tomato phyllosphere contamination. However, growth of S. enterica in the tomato phyllosphere occurred on co-colonized plants in the absence of plant disease. Conclusions/Significance S. enterica contaminated soil can lead to contamination of the tomato phyllosphere. A six week lag period between soil contamination and tomato seeding did not deter subsequent crop contamination. In the absence of plant disease, presence of the bacterial plant pathogen, X. campestris pv. vesicatoria was beneficial to S. enterica allowing multiplication of the human pathogen population. Any event leading to soil contamination with S. enterica could pose a public health risk with subsequent tomato production, especially in areas prone to bacterial spot disease."

https://openalex.org/W2167782755,"The human genome encodes seven APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases with potential antiretroviral activity: A3A, A3B, A3C, A3DE, A3F, A3G, and A3H. A3G was the first identified to block replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and many other retroviruses. A3F, A3B, and A3DE were shown later to have similar activities. HIV-1 produces a protein called Vif that is able to neutralize the antiretroviral activities of A3DE, A3F, and A3G, but not A3B. Only the antiretroviral activity of A3H remains to be defined due to its poor expression in cell culture. Here, we studied the mechanism impairing A3H expression. When primate A3H sequences were compared, a premature termination codon was identified on the fifth exon of the human and chimpanzee A3H genes, which significantly decreased their protein expression. It causes a 29-residue deletion from the C terminus, and this truncation did not reduce human A3H protein stability. However, the mRNA levels of the truncated gene were significantly decreased. Human A3H protein expression could be restored to a normal level either by repairing this truncation or through expression from a vector containing an intron from human cytomegalovirus. Once expression was optimized, human A3H could reduce HIV-1 infectivity up to 150-fold. Importantly, HIV-1 Vif failed to neutralize A3H activity. Nevertheless, extensive sequence analysis could not detect any significant levels of G-to-A mutation in the HIV-1 genome by human A3H. Thus, A3H inhibits HIV-1 replication potently by a cytidine deamination-independent mechanism, and optimizing A3H expression in vivo should represent a novel therapeutic strategy for HIV-1 treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2088990875,"Local edema, a cardinal sign of inflammation associates closely with neutrophil emigration. Neutrophil emigration has been described to occur primarily through endothelial junctions (paracellular) and more rarely directly through endothelial cells (transcellular). Recently, we reported that unlike in wild-type (wt) mice, Mac-1-/- (CD11b) neutrophils predominantly emigrated transcellularly and was significantly delayed taking 20–30 min longer than the paracellular emigration (wt). In the present study we noted significant anatomical disruption of the endothelium and hypothesized that transcellular emigration would greatly increase vascular permeability. Surprisingly, despite profound disruption of the endothelial barrier as the neutrophils moved through the cells, the changes in vascular permeability during transcellular emigration (Mac-1-/-) were not increased more than in wt mice. Instead increased vascular permeability completely tracked the number of emigrated cells and as such, permeability changes were delayed in Mac-1-/- mice. However, by 60 min neutrophils from both sets of mice were emigrating in large numbers. Electron-microscopy and spinning disk multichannel fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed endothelial docking structures that progressed to dome-like structures completely covering wt and Mac-1-/- neutrophils. These domes completely enveloped the emigrating neutrophils in both wt and Mac-1-/- mice making the mode of emigration underneath these structures extraneous to barrier function. In conclusion, predominantly paracellular versus predominantly transcellular emigration does not affect vascular barrier integrity as endothelial dome-like structures retain barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2014294890,"BI-1 (Bax inhibitor-1) is an evolutionarily conserved multitransmembrane protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that has documented cytoprotective functions in both animals and plants. Recent studies indicate that BI-1 shares in common with Bcl-2/Bax family proteins the ability to regulate the amounts of Ca2+ that can be released from the ER by agents, such as the ER-Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG). Using an ER-targeted, Ca2+ indicator (cameleon), with characteristics optimized for measuring ER Ca2+ ([Ca2+]er), we studied the effects of BI-1 on [Ca2+]er in resting and TG-treated cells. Similar to cells overexpressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, overexpression of BI-1 resulted in lower resting [Ca2+]er, with concomitantly less Ca2+ released into the cytosol upon stimulation by TG and with a higher rate of Ca2+ leakage from the ER. Co-expression of SERCA restored levels of [Ca2+]er to normal, showing opposing actions of the ER-Ca2+ATPase and BI-1 on ER Ca2+ homeostasis. Conversely, cells with deficient BI-1 have increased [Ca2+]er, and release more Ca2+ into the cytosol when challenged with TG. In BI-1-deficient cells, Bcl-XL fails to reduce [Ca2+]er, indicating that BI-1 functions downstream of Bcl-XL. In bax-/-bak-/- double knock-out cells, both BI-1 and Bcl-XL retained their ability to reduce [Ca2+]er, suggesting that BI-1 and Bcl-XL operate downstream of or parallel to Bax/Bak.

Cell death is essential for development of most multicellular organisms, and its dysregulation contributes to many diseases characterized by inappropriate cell loss or cell accumulation. Bcl-2/Bax family proteins are central regulators of cell death in animals. Many Bcl-2/Bax family members reside in the membranes of mitochondria, where they play well defined roles in controlling release of apoptosis-inducing proteins from these organelles and regulating other aspects of mitochondrial function (1Reed J.C. Jürgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Besides mitochondria, some members of the Bcl-2/Bax family also localize to membranes of the ER, where their functions are less clear at present. Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL or ablation of proapoptotic Bax and Bak has been variably reported to result in lower basal concentrations of free Ca2+ in the ER ([Ca2+]er) and to reduce the amount of Ca2+ released from this organelle in response to SERCA inhibitors or agonists of inositol triphosphate-regulated Ca2+ channels (IP3Rs) 4The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol triphosphate-regulated Ca2+ channel; TG, thapsigargin; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; CFP, cyan-emitting fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow-emitting fluorescent protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; [Ca2+]er, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition. 4The abbreviations used are: IP3R, inositol triphosphate-regulated Ca2+ channel; TG, thapsigargin; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; CFP, cyan-emitting fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow-emitting fluorescent protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; [Ca2+]er, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition.

Similar to Bcl-2/Bax family proteins, a role for BI-1 in regulating the amounts of Ca2+ released from ER by SERCA inhibitors, such as TG, was recently demonstrated using BI-1-overexpressing and bi-1-/- cells (32Chae H.J.

To generate retroviral expression construct pCLXSN/BI-1-HA, pcDNA3-BI-1-HA was digested with XhoI to release the BI-1-HA fragment, which was then filled in with Klenow, digested with EcoRI, and inserted into the pCLXSN vector (Imgenex, 10041P), using standard molecular cloning methods. Cell Culture—Early passage HeLa cells (P5-P15) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose (1 g/liter; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. HeLa cells were transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (4.5 g/liter) (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Immortalized bax-/-bak-/- double knock-out MEFs were provided by S. J. Korsmeyer (6Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J.

The infected cells were then split at 1:20 and selected for single colonies in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for 10 days. The MEF cells were then transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) or infected with protein-encoding retroviruses (see below) for imaging studies. Stable HeLa cell lines with BI-1 knockdown (by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)) were generated using retrovirus infection. 293T cells were first transfected (using Lipofectamine 2000) with 2 μg of VSVG, 4 μg of cytomegalovirus-gag polymerase, and 5 μg of either BI-1 shRNA (Open Biosystems, V2SH_153887) or a control shRNA to produce viruses that can express the corresponding shRNA. Virus-containing medium was collected, filtered, and used to infect early passage HeLa cells. The infected cells were then diluted and selected for single colonies in medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin for 15 days. BI-1 knockdown was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Retroviruses were generated by the same method as for infecting MEFs. Ca2+ Imaging—HeLa cells (4 × 105) were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected the next day using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 0.08 μg of ER-cameleon-encoding plasmid and either 1 μg of pcDNA3 control (“neo”), 1 μg of pcDNA3-BI-1-HA, or 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-BI-1-HA and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-SERCA2b. To obtain mitochondrial Ca2+, HeLa cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of Mito-YC2-encoding plasmid and 1.7 μg of pcDNA3 control (“vector”) or 1.7 μg of pcDNA3-BI-1-HA. MEF cells (8 × 104 to 1.6 × 105) were plated and transfected with 0.4 μg of ER-cameleon-encoding plasmid and 1.6 μg of pcDNA3 control (“vector”), 1.6 μg of pcDNA3-BI-1-HA or pcDNA3-myc-Bcl-XL. Cells were imaged 2-3 days after transfection using either a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a cooled CCD camera, controlled by MetaFluor version 6.1 software (Universal Imaging, Downington, PA), or an inverted Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope equipped with a thermo-controlled stage (Warner Instruments Inc., Hamden, CT) with oil immersion objective UAPO ×40/340, numerical aperture 1.35-0.65, fitted with a cooled Cascade 512B camera (Photometrics, Inc., Tucson, AZ) and employing MetaFluor software, version 7.1.4 (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). The cells were imaged either in Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen), containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1-2 g/liter d-glucose (osmolarity ∼300). Dual emission ratio imaging of the cameleons was accomplished with the Zeiss system using a 436DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (475DF30 for ECFP, 535DF25 for EYFP) controlled by a Lambda 10-2 filter wheel (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). With the Olympus system, we used ultra-high speed wavelength switcher DG4 (Sutter Instrument Co.) with the D436/20× excitation filter, with 455 long pass dichroic mirror, and D480/40m and D535/30m emission filters for cyan-emitting fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow-emitting fluorescent protein (YFP), respectively, installed in a Sutter Lambda 10B filter wheel. All filters were obtained from Chroma Technology Co. (Rockingham, VT). For cameleon imaging, the yellow and cyan intensities were measured 5-7 times every 15 s, and the average ratios were calculated after background subtraction for each individual cell. Mito-YC2 cells were imaged using the same parameters as the ER-cameleon cells. The ER-cameleon calibration was performed as described (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To deduce [Ca2+]er, Rmin was obtained by treating the cells with 3 mm EGTA and 2 μm ionomycin, and Rmax was determined by treating the cells with 25 μm digitonin, followed by 5-10 mm Ca2+, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm Mg2+. The Rmin and Rmax values were then used to convert cell data to [Ca2+]er as described previously (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Fura-2-based imaging of cytosolic Ca2+ was performed as described previously (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were incubated in HBSS containing 4 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) with 0.04% Pluronic F-127 for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed with HBSS and incubated for 15 min before changing to fresh HBSS for imaging. Excitation ratio imaging for Fura-2 was accomplished by using 350- and 380-nm excitation filters (both 10-nm bandwidths), and (for the Zeiss system) a 450-nm dichroic mirror with a 535/45 emission filter or (for the Olympus system) a 400 long pass dichroic mirror with a D340X filter. To calibrate Fura-2, Rmin was obtained by treating the cells with 8 μm ionomycin and 10 mm EGTA in Ca2+-deficient HBSS, and Rmax was obtained by treating the cells with 2 μm ionomycin and 20 mm Ca2+. The 350/380 nm ratio was then converted to [Ca2+]i, as described (39Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Total protein was isolated from HeLa cells homogenized in detergent-containing buffer, normalized for protein content (50 μg/sample), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8-16% gels) and immunoblotting using the following primary antibodies: anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science), anti-Bax (40Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Miyashita T. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL (41Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Wang H.-G. Irie S. Fong L. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5501-5507PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Grp94 (SPA-851; Stressgen Biotechnologies), anti-tubulin (catalog number 317; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-calreticulin (GTX20004; GeneTex), anti-SERCA2 (GTX30342; GeneTex), and anti-IP3R1, -2, and -3 (sc-6093/7277/7278; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody detection was accomplished by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG; Amersham Biosciences) and an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (74104; Qiagen), reverse-transcribed using the Superscript RT-PCR kit (10928-034; Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were then used as template for PCR amplification using a BI-1-specific primer pair as well as a CPH-specific primer pair as control. Cell Death Assay—HeLa and MEF cell lines were treated with 2 μm TG or 1.0 μg/ml TRAIL in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose (1 g/liter; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics for 12 h to induce apoptosis. Both floating and attached cells were then collected and labeled using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide apoptosis detection kit (catalog number K101-100; BioVision), following a protocol provided by the manufacturer. 104 cells from each condition were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to identify cells into four groups: annexin-negative/PI-negative, annexin-negative/PI-positive, annexin-positive/PI-negative, and annexin-positive/PI-positive. Aliquots of the collected cells were also suspended at 106 cells/ml in PBS with 2 μg/ml Hoechst dye, and the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology was determined by UV microscopy. BI-1 Alters Steady-state ER Ca2+ Levels—Our previous investigations showed that mammalian BI-1 regulates a cell death pathway linked to ER stress and modulates the levels of releasable Ca2+ from ER, as measured by a Ca2+-sensitive ratiometric dye (Fura-2) that reports cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations, in experiments where cells were treated with SERCA inhibitor, TG, to release Ca2+ into cytosol (32Chae H.J. Kim H.R. Bailly-Maitre B. Zhu X. Ke N. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Cui J. Digicaylioglu M. Thomas M. Kress C.L. Babendure J. Tsien R.Y. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) also measured ER [Ca2+] in BI-1-overexpressing cells using first generation ER-targeted Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent proteins that report [Ca2+] via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. To lay a foundation for our studies on the relation of BI-1 to ER [Ca2+], we compared the effects of BI-1 overexpression and BI-1 knockdown, achieved with shRNAs on steady-state Ca2+ concentrations in the ER ([Ca2+]er). To directly measure [Ca2+]er, we utilized an improved ER-targeted, Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent protein, termed D1ER-cameleon, that consists of tandem fusions of CFP and YFP, separated by Ca2+-responsive elements (mutant calmodulin and a complementary mutant version of the calmodulin-binding peptide M13) (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to the calmodulin moiety induces binding to M13, bringing CFP and YFP into a new orientation that enhances fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The characteristics of the ER-targeted cameleon used here have been reported in detail (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The cameleon was targeted to ER by the addition of an N-terminal calreticulin signal sequence and C-terminal ER retention sequence (KDEL), and its localization to ER was confirmed by microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). This improved ER-targeted cameleon has been used to study the effects of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL on ER Ca2+ dynamics (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), confirming and extending prior studies. We first tested the effects of BI-1 overexpression on [Ca2+]er using a gene transfer approach, where HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding ER-targeted cameleon and either control vector or BI-1-encoding plasmid, measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer and [Ca2+]er in individual cells by previously established ratiometric methods that normalize for differences in levels of protein production (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 42Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting confirmed expression of the epitope-tagged BI-1 protein in cells transfected with BI-1-HA but not in control-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Although individual cells varied, on average, BI-1-overexpressing cells contained significantly lower resting [Ca2+]er, as represented by the YFP/CFP ratio (Fig. 1B) (BI-1-HA = 1.85 ± 0.02, n = 24; vector = 2.05 ± 0.02, n = 24, p < 0.01 by Student's t test). For some experiments, we also converted the YFP/CFP ratio to an estimated [Ca2+]er by a calibration method, as described previously (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Recognizing that accurate calibrations of the maximum YFP/CFP ratio (Rmax) are difficult to obtain due to the toxic effects of permeabilizing cells in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 44Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), our values of resting ER [Ca2+] in control HeLa cells nevertheless agree well with prior reports (supplemental Fig. S2), based on methods using ER-targeted green fluorescent protein-based cameleons or aequorin (8Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 35Westphalen B.C. Wessig J. Leypoldt F. Arnold S. Methner A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Also, it bears noting that whereas the absolute YFP/CFP ratio values varied, depending on which Ca2+ imaging system (microscope) was used, the relative differences in ER-targeted cameleon fluorescence seen for these genetically engineered cells were reproducible. Next, we knocked down BI-1 expression in HeLa cells using shRNA targeting BI-1 mRNA and confirmed reduced BI-1 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1C). (Note that antibodies that detect endogenous BI-1 have not been attainable to date, despite considerable effort, thus precluding analysis of endogenous BI-1 protein.) We used three different shRNA sequences to target BI-1, all three of which were comparably effective (not shown). Comparison of resting [Ca2+]er in control- and shRNA-transfected HeLa cells revealed that average resting [Ca2+]er was significantly higher in BI-1-deficient cells, with BI-1 knockdown cells having an average YFP/CFP ratio of 2.16 ± 0.02 (n = 24) compared with control-transfected cells with an average YFP/CFP ratio of 2.04 ± 0.02 (n = 24) (p < 0.01 by unpaired t test) (Fig. 1D). Additional immunoblotting studies demonstrated that BI-1 overexpression and BI-1 knockdown do not alter the levels of proteins known to modulate [Ca2+]er, including SERCA2, Bax,"
https://openalex.org/W2148069495,"Background We demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells-derived vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) positive cells could differentiate into both endothelial cells (EC) and mural cells (MC), and termed them as vascular progenitor cells (VPC). Recently, we have established a method to expand monkey and human ES cells-derived VPC with the proper differentiation stage in a large quantity. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of human VPC-derived EC and MC for vascular regeneration. Methods and Results After the expansion of human VPC-derived vascular cells, we transplanted these cells to nude mice with hindlimb ischemia. The blood flow recovery and capillary density in ischemic hindlimbs were significantly improved in human VPC-derived EC-transplanted mice, compared to human peripheral and umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (pEPC and uEPC) transplanted mice. The combined transplantation of human VPC-derived EC and MC synergistically improved blood flow of ischemic hindlimbs remarkably, compared to the single cell transplantations. Transplanted VPC-derived vascular cells were effectively incorporated into host circulating vessels as EC and MC to maintain long-term vascular integrity. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the combined transplantation of human ES cells-derived EC and MC can be used as a new promising strategy for therapeutic vascular regeneration in patients with tissue ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2046889363,"Well over six decades since its first description, the Rheumatoid Factor (RF)-autoantibodies recognizing Fc (constant) portion of IgG through their own Fab (antigen binding variable segments)-is believed to have come of age. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a unique form of pancreatitis, biologically characterized by an elevated serum IgG4 concentration. Given the fact that IgG4 myeloma proteins can act as RF, we initially hypothesized that IgG4 in autoimmune pancreatitis might do likewise, hence potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. Indeed Western blotting clearly showed that IgG4 binds to IgG1 kappa, IgG2 kappa, IgG3 kappa myeloma proteins, as well as to IgG Fc, in line with a typical RF activity. Further experiments however unraveled the unexpected fact that unlike hitherto known RF, IgG4 does not engage IgG Fc through its Fab, but its very own Fc. These data therefore collectively describe a Novel RF (NRF) in autoimmune pancreatitis. In the future, the relevance of NRF, beyond autoimmune pancreatitis, in both diagnosis/prognosis as well as pathophysiology of autoimmune and other systemic diseases where IgG4's role seems paramount, needs to be systematically assessed."

https://openalex.org/W1967280059,"The heme protein indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) initiates oxidative metabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway, and this requires reductive activation of Fe3+-IDO. The current dogma is that superoxide anion radical ( O2.¯) is responsible for this activation, based largely on previous work employing purified rabbit IDO and rabbit enterocytes. We have re-investigated this role of O2.¯ using purified recombinant human IDO (rhIDO), rabbit enterocytes that constitutively express IDO, human endothelial cells, and monocyte-derived macrophages treated with interferon-γ to induce IDO expression, and two cell lines transfected with the human IDO gene. Both potassium superoxide and O2.¯ generated by xanthine oxidase modestly activated rhIDO, in reactions that were prevented completely by superoxide dismutase (SOD). In contrast, SOD mimetics had no effect on IDO activity in enterocytes and interferon-γ-treated human cells, despite significantly decreasing cellular O2.¯ Similarly, cellular IDO activity was unaffected by increasing SOD activity via co-expression of Cu,Zn-SOD or by increasing cellular O2.¯ via treatment of cells with menadione. Other reductants, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, ascorbate, and cytochrome P450 reductase, were ineffective in activating cellular IDO. However, recombinant human cytochrome b5 plus cytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH reduced Fe3+-IDO to Fe2+-IDO and activated rhIDO in a reconstituted system, a reaction inhibited marginally by SOD. Additionally, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of microsomal cytochrome b5 significantly decreased IDO activity in IDO-transfected cells.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). IDO cleaves the pyrrole ring of l-Trp to N-formyl-kynurenine by incorporating molecular oxygen. Although l-Trp is preferred, the enzyme can use other indoleamines such as tryptamine and serotonin as substrates. IDO is expressed constitutively in a limited number of human tissues (3Yamazaki F. Kuroiwa T. Takikawa O. Kido R. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and also in rabbit enterocytes (4Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5260-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in most tissues and cells, expression of the enzyme requires induction, with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFNγ) playing a major role (2Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The true physiological function of IDO is becoming clearer, with its induction and the formation of kynurenine pathway metabolites implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, such as in the defense against microbes and tumors, immune regulation, neuropathology, and antioxidant activity (2Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Redox Rep. 1999; 4: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). IDO is a monomeric protein of 42-kDa molecular mass and contains protoporphyrin IX as its sole prosthetic group (4Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5260-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IDO requires reduction of its ferric (Fe3+) heme to ferrous (Fe2+) heme; Fe2+-IDO rapidly autoxidizes to the inactive Fe3+-IDO (5Taniguchi T. Sono M. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. Tamura M. Hayasi K. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3288-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over the last 30 years, a number of electron donors have been suggested as biological reductants for IDO. Of those, superoxide anion radical ( O2.¯) has been the most widely studied. In a series of pioneering studies employing purified rabbit enzyme and tissue, Hayaishi and co-workers (6Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5960-5966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hayaishi O. Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Henry J.P. Rosenthal I. Katoh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3548-3550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4637-4642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that IDO requires O2.¯ and O2 for activity, which was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, they reported O2.¯ to reductively activate purified rabbit IDO such that l-Trp and O2 can bind tightly (9Sono M. Taniguchi T. Watanabe Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using 18O2-labeled potassium superoxide, these authors showed O2.¯ to be incorporated into l-Trp during its metabolism to kynurenine by isolated rabbit IDO in vitro (7Hayaishi O. Hirata F. Ohnishi T. Henry J.P. Rosenthal I. Katoh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3548-3550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as O2.¯ acting as co-factor and substrate for IDO, a view that remains commonly accepted. Notwithstanding this, however, later studies by Sono (10Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1616-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have questioned the ability of O2.¯ to maintain maximal steady-state activity of IDO. Indeed, the redox dye methylene blue is required and commonly used for in vitro IDO activity assays, together with ascorbate. Also, tissue and cellular levels of O2.¯ may not reach the levels required to activate ferric IDO, especially because cellular SOD effectively competes for O2.¯ as it reacts with O2.¯ with a rate constant of ∼2 × 109 m–1 s–1, whereas the corresponding rate constant for IDO is ∼1 × 106 m–1 s–1 (10Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1616-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced flavin mononucleotide and biopterin (l-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin) have also been suggested as possible reductants for IDO. Indeed, these electron donors can activate purified murine IDO (11Ozaki Y. Reinhard Jr., J.F. Nichol C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Ozaki Y. Nichol C.A. Duch D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 257: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although such a role has not been confirmed for cellular IDO. A recent study using a yeast growth model suggested a role for cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase in maintaining human IDO activity (13Vottero E. Mitchell D.A. Page M.J. MacGillivray R.T. Sadowski I.J. Roberge M. Mauk A.G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2265-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we re-examined the importance of O2.¯ in the activation of IDO, using recombinant human enzyme and different human cells as models. Our results show that in the absence of methylene blue, O2.¯ is a poor activator of IDO and that, instead, cytochrome b5 acts as the likely electron donor for human IDO. Materials—Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and endothelial cell growth media were purchased from Cell Applications, Inc. Recombinant human IFNγ (rhIFNγ) was from R & D Systems, Inc. Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (Mn-TBAP) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Hydroethidine (HE), dispase (from Bacillus polymyxa), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, FMN:NADPH oxidoreductase from Photobacterium fischeri, and human NADPH-P450 reductase were purchased from Invitrogen. PD10 (Sephadex G-25) gel filtration columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 carrying the full-length human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase cDNA was donated generously by Professor Larry Oberley (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Iowa). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Recombinant Human IDO—rhIDO encoded by the pQE9-IDO plasmid vector was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein to a hexahistidyl tag and purified as described in detail (14Littlejohn T.K. Takikawa O. Skylas D. Jamie J.F. Walker M.J. Truscott R.J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Terentis A.C. Thomas S.R. Takikawa O.

Different batches of purified rhIDO used for the present studies appeared as a single major protein band at ∼42 kDa following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (not shown) and exhibited 404 to 280 nm absorption ratios of 1.5–1.8. Before use rhIDO was gel-filtered through a Sephadex G-25 column eluted with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cell Culture Studies—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and low glucose DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HAEC were maintained in endothelial growth media containing antibiotics (as above), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), bovine fibroblast growth factor (6 ng/ml), heparin (6 μg/ml), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% FBS. HAEC were used from passage 5 to 11 and seeded at 50% confluence before stimulation with rhIFNγ. All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and the medium was replaced every 3–4 days. At 90% confluence, cells were disrupted with 0.15% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA for 5 min, washed, and plated in new culture plates and flasks for experiments. Monocytes were isolated from human blood buffy coat (Australian Red Cross Blood Bank) and matured into monocyte-derived macrophages by 8–12 days of culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% pooled human serum (16Thomas S.R. Salahifar H. Mashima R. Hunt N.H. Richardson D.R. Stocker R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6332-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Upon maturation, cells were treated with rhIFNγ (500 units/ml) to induce IDO expression and activity. Isolation of Enterocytes—Rabbit enterocytes were isolated from the small intestine of New Zealand White rabbits as described (17Taniguchi T. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2774-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distal one-sixth part of the small intestine was removed and the luminal content flushed with 0.9% NaCl. The inner surface was rinsed with Tyrode's balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml streptomycin. One end of the intestine was tied, and Tyrode's solution containing 1,000 protease units/ml dispase was poured into the intestinal lumen. After tying the other end, the intestine was immersed into 0.9% NaCl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with constant shaking (80 rpm). The resulting cell suspension was collected and passed through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), and the cells were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with Tyrode's solution and resuspended uniformly in the same solution. Any remaining clustered cells were removed by filtration through 70-μm cell strainers, and the resulting filtrate was used immediately for experiments. Overexpression of Human IDO and Cu,Zn-SOD—For transient overexpression of human IDO, CHO cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates and grown to 50% confluence. Cells were then transfected with pcDNA3 encoding full-length human IDO cDNA (1 μg/well) or pcDNA3 (empty vector control, 1 μg/well) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight transfection, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 μm l-Trp and then used for experiments. For co-expression of IDO and human Cu,Zn-SOD, HEK 293 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates and grown to 40% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS but no antibiotics. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (empty vector control, 1 μg/well), pcDNA3 encoding human IDO cDNA (1 μg/well), pcDNA3 encoding full-length human Cu,Zn-SOD cDNA (1 μg/well), or both IDO and Cu,Zn-SOD vectors together using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 μm l-Trp and then used for experiments. Knockdown of Cytochrome b5 by Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)—HEK 293 cells cultured to 25% confluence in 12-well plates were co-transfected with pcDNA3 encoding human IDO cDNA (0.5 μg/well) and 60 pmol of siRNA targeted against the microsomal form of human cytochrome b5 (DNA sequence, 5′-TCGCCTTGATGTATCGCCTATACAT-3′, siRNA sense 5′-UCGCCUUGAUGUAUCGCUAUACAU-3′), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 72 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and the medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 200 μm l-Trp, and cells were then incubated for the time indicated. As a control, cells were co-transfected with human IDO vector as before but using 60 pmol of scrambled siRNA with similar GC content (44%) to the cytochrome b5-targeted siRNA. The scrambled siRNA (sense 5′-CCAAACAAUAGCUUGCCCUCAGAUA-3′) was not a match to any sequence in the human BLAST data base. IDO Activity Assay—IDO activity was measured as the amount of kynurenine formed from l-Trp, as described previously (18Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with modifications. For studies with rhIDO, the standard assay mixture consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 or 500 nm rhIDO, 150 units of catalase, and 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The reaction was started by the addition of 400 μm l-Trp in the presence of 25 μm methylene blue and 0–10 mm ascorbic acid, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before cold trichloroacetic acid (4% final concentration, w/v) was added to stop the reaction. Mixtures were then stored at 4 °C overnight to ensure complete conversion of N-formyl-kynurenine to kynurenine before analysis by HPLC of l-Trp and kynurenine in the supernatant. For isolated rabbit enterocytes, trichloroacetic acid was added to cells and media to 4% final concentration, w/v. For other cellular studies, medium (∼200 μl) from cultures previously supplemented with 100–200 μm l-Trp and incubated for the time indicated was deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid (4% w/v). Prior to HPLC analyses, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to HPLC (Agilent 1100 HPLC Systems, Agilent) equipped with a Hypersil 3-μm ODS C18 (1Takikawa O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) column (Phenomenex) eluted with 100 mm chloroacetic acid, 9% acetonitrile, pH 2.4, at 0.6 ml/min. Tryptophan and kynurenine were detected by UV absorbance at 280 and 364 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity was estimated according to the amount of kynurenine detected and adjusted for total cellular protein. For rhIDO experiments, IDO activity was estimated as the amounts of kynurenine produced. Reduction of rhIDO by Cytochrome b5—The reduction of rhIDO by recombinant human cytochrome b5 was investigated by adding 8 μm Fe3+-rhIDO to a reaction mixture purged with argon gas and containing 0.2 μm human recombinant cytochrome b5, 2 μm purified human NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase, 56 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 375 units of bovine catalase, 20 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 4 mm NAPD+, and 200 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C in a septum sealed cuvette thoroughly purged with argon gas. Difference spectra were recorded every 30 s from 380 to 680 nm against a reference sample containing the reaction mixture without rhIDO, using a Beckman-Coulter DU800A spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed in the absence and presence of CO (∼1 mm), by thoroughly purging the reaction mixture and the cuvette with CO gas. Solutions of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase were gel-filtered prior to use to remove any interfering substances such as ammonium sulfate and dithiothreitol. Determination of Intracellular O2.¯—Intracellular concentrations of O2.¯ were assessed by the ratio of 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) to hydroethidine (HE), determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection, as described recently (19Maghzal G.J. Stocker R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with SOD mimetics, HAEC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 ml of endothelial growth media supplemented with 10 μm HE. The medium was removed, and cells washed twice with PBS before being stored at –80 °C. On the day of analysis, cells were thawed to ambient temperature; any remaining adherent cells were scraped and then lysed in 250 μl of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and a 10-μl sample was used for protein determination. 1-Butanol (0.5 ml) was added to the remaining cell lysate, the suspension mixed vigorously for 1 min, and then centrifuged. The butanol phase was removed, dried under vacuum, and the dried sample dissolved in 100 μl of 1 mm HCl and subjected immediately to HPLC. HE and 2-OH-E+ were separated on an ether-linked phenol column (250 × 4.6 mm, 4 μm, Synergy Polar-RP®, Phenomenex) and detected by electrochemistry (19Maghzal G.J. Stocker R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Standards of 2-OH-E+ were prepared by reacting HE with Fremy's salt as reported previously (20Zielonka J. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with minor modification. After purification, the silica gel column was replaced by the SPE cartridge C18 Prevail (Alltech). The cartridge was first conditioned with 5 ml of methanol before loading of the extracted reaction mixture. The cartridge was then rinsed with 5 ml of water followed by 5 ml of 50% methanol, before 2-OH-E+ was eluted with 80% methanol. The eluate was dried, and the purity of 2-OH-E+ was verified by mass spectrometry and HPLC electrochemical detection, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors or by subjecting cells in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors to three cycles of freezing and thawing. Western blotting was performed as described (16Thomas S.R. Salahifar H. Mashima R. Hunt N.H. Richardson D.R. Stocker R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6332-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, equal amounts of protein (8–15 μg) were loaded onto 4–12% poly-acrylamide gels (NU-PAGE, Invitrogen) using SeeBlue® Plus2 (Invitrogen) as molecular mass standards. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 1 h using a MiniProtean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad), and separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 V for 90 min using a mini-blot module (NOVEX, San Diego). The blotted membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk powder with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 3–4 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies at 1:1000 to 1:2000 dilutions in 5% (w/v) skim milk and Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline: sheep polyclonal antibody against human IDO (Invitrogen); rabbit polyclonal antibody against human Cu,Zn-SOD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibody against human cytochrome b5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (Sigma). Membranes were then probed for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate anti-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:10,000 dilution) in 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). SOD Activity and Measurement of O2.¯—Cellular SOD activity was determined using the oxidation of pyrogallol by superoxide (21Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). Briefly, solutions containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 units of catalase, 25 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and various amounts of cell lysates were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Reactions were started by adding 200 μm pyrogallol and followed as the increase in absorbance at 420 nm every 10 s for 30 min. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the rate of pyrogallol autoxidation by 50%. The rate of O2.¯ generation by xanthine oxidase was determined by the rate of reduction of ferric cytochrome c (22Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 240 μg of horse heart cytochrome c was mixed with 615 units of bovine catalase, 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and varying concentrations of xanthine oxidase in the absence or presence of 250 units of SOD. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before addition of 100 μm hypoxanthine, and A550 nm was then monitored for 5 min at 37 °C. The rate of O2.¯ production was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 × 103 m–1 cm–1. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between treatments and controls were examined using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Where appropriate, data were analyzed using a two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Role of O2.¯ in Activation of rhIDO—To date, studies examining the ability of O2.¯ to activate isolated IDO protein have been limited to the rabbit and mouse enzyme. We therefore first investigated the role of O2.¯ in the activation of rhIDO, incubating the purified enzyme (500 nm) with l-Trp in the presence of methylene blue and ascorbate, a system commonly used for in vitro activation of IDO. IDO activity, measured by the accumulation of kynurenine, increased with increasing concentrations of ascorbate (Fig. 1A). Activity was not affected by the presence of SOD (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous findings demonstrating that ascorbate reduces methylene blue, and reduced methylene blue, rather than O2.¯, then activates IDO (10Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1616-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next replaced ascorbate/methylene blue with hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, a well established enzymatic system to generate O2.¯. We chose the concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase such that the amounts of O2.¯ generated (see Fig. 1B) were comparable with the concentrations of ascorbate employed in Fig. 1A. Similar to the situation with purified rabbit IDO (6Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5960-5966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1616-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase activated purified rhIDO in a reaction that was prevented completely by SOD (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that under these conditions O2.¯ activated rhIDO. However, the extent of this activation was substantially less than that seen with ascorbate and methylene blue (compare Fig. 1, A with C), indicating that O2.¯ was less efficient than ascorbate/methylene blue in activating rhIDO. Consistent with this interpretation, reagent O2.¯, added to rhIDO in the form of potassium superoxide, activated the enzyme only modestly; this activation again was prevented completely by SOD (Fig. 1D). Previous studies with rabbit IDO reported SOD to inhibit O2.¯ -mediated activity by 70–95% (6Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5960-5966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohnishi T. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4643-4647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using rhIDO at 10 times lower concentration yielded measurable enzyme activity with ascorbate and methylene blue but not with enzymatically generated O2.¯ or potassium superoxide (data not shown). These data show that although O2.¯ can activate isolated rhIDO, the extent of this activation is modest, at least when compared with the ascorbate/methylene blue system. Role of O2.¯ in Activation of Cellular IDO Activity—The present dogma that O2.¯ is the biological activator of cellular IDO is based in part on previous work carried out in rabbit enterocytes, which constitutively express IDO activity (17Taniguchi T. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2774-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hayaishi and co-workers (17Taniguchi T. Hirata F. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2774-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that, by providing O2.¯, cellular xanthine oxidase contributes to IDO activation, because addition of the xanthine oxidase substrate inosine increased, whereas xanthine oxidase inhibitors abolished, IDO activity. Indeed, we confirmed that inosine increased IDO activity 4-fold compared with untreated rabbit enterocytes (Fig. 2A). However, this enhancement was entirely dependent on the presence of methylene blue, and it was not affected by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol (Fig. 2A). These results are inconsistent with the notion that xanthine oxidase-derived O2.¯ is involved in the activation of IDO in rabbit enterocytes. We next investigated the effect of modulating cellular SOD on IDO activ"
https://openalex.org/W2066585661,"The Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells is composed of flattened cisternae that are densely packed to form stacks. We have used the Golgi stacking protein GRASP65 as a tool to modify the stacking state of Golgi cisternae. We established an assay to measure protein transport to the cell surface in post-mitotic cells in which the Golgi was unstacked. Cells with an unstacked Golgi showed a higher transport rate compared to cells with stacked Golgi membranes. Vesicle budding from unstacked cisternae in vitro was significantly increased compared to stacked membranes. These results suggest that Golgi cisternal stacking can directly regulate vesicle formation and thus the rate of protein transport through the Golgi. The results further suggest that at the onset of mitosis, unstacking of cisternae allows extensive and rapid vesiculation of the Golgi in preparation for its subsequent partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W2069200157,"Loss or gain of whole chromosome, the form of chromosome instability commonly associated with cancers is thought to arise from aberrant chromosome segregation during cell division. Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by the interaction of kinetochores with spindle microtubules. Our studies show that NEK2A is a kinetochore-associated protein kinase essential for faithful chromosome segregation. However, it was unclear how NEK2A ensures accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show that NEK2A-mediated Hec1 (highly expressed in cancer) phosphorylation is essential for faithful kinetochore microtubule attachments in mitosis. Using phospho-specific antibody, our studies show that NEK2A phosphorylates Hec1 at Ser165 during mitosis. Although such phosphorylation is not required for assembly of Hec1 to the kinetochore, expression of non-phosphorylatable mutant Hec1S165 perturbed chromosome congression and resulted in a dramatic increase in microtubule attachment errors, including syntelic and monotelic attachments. Our in vitro reconstitution experiment demonstrated that Hec1 binds to microtubule in low affinity and phosphorylation by NEK2A, which prevents aberrant kinetochore-microtubule connections in vivo, increases the affinity of the Ndc80 complex for microtubules in vitro. Thus, our studies illustrate a novel regulatory mechanism in which NEK2A kinase operates a faithful chromosome attachment to spindle microtubule, which prevents chromosome instability during cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2011756343,"A mixture of three homologous bioactive hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides (HypSys peptides) of 18 amino acids in length, differing only at two residues, was isolated from leaves of Ipomoea batatas, the common sweet potato. One of the peptides represented over 95% of the isolated isopeptides, which, at 2.5 nm concentration, induced the expression of sporamin, a major defense protein of I. batatas. The sequence of the major isoform was used to synthesize a primer that identified a cDNA encoding a precursor protein. The protein contained six proline-rich regions whose sequences suggested that they might be HypSys defense signals. One of the encoded peptides, called IbHypSys IV, was identical to one of two minor components of the isolated isopeptides, but neither the major isopeptide nor the other minor isoform was found within the precursor. The six peptides encoded by the precursor gene were synthesized but with hydroxyproline residues at positions found in the native isoforms and lacking carbohydrate moieties. All of the peptides were biologically active when supplied to leaves of sweet potato plants. The gene is the first ortholog of the preproHypSys gene family to be found outside of the Solanaceae family, and its encoded peptide precursor is the first example in plants of a precursor protein with six potential peptide defense signals, a scenario only found previously in animals.

Here we report the isolation of three 18-amino-acid HypSys isopeptides from leaves of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) of the Convolvulaceae family that potently induce expression of the defense gene sporamin. A cDNA was isolated that encoded the precursor of one of the isopeptides, as well as sequences of five other homologous peptides that are potential HypSys defense signals. The research is the initial demonstration of the presence of a HypSys precursor gene outside of the Solanaceae family whose multiple HypSys peptides may have signaling roles in amplifying the defense responses of sweet potato plants against attacking herbivores.

Three ml of 7-day-old cell cultures was transferred into 35 ml of medium in 125-ml flasks and used for assay 3-6 days after transferring. One-ml aliquots of cell culture were delivered into each well of 24-well cell culture cluster plates and equilibrated on an orbital shaker at 160 rpm for 1 h. One- to 10-μl aliquots of fractions eluted from HPLC columns were added to the cells, and the pH of the medium was recorded after 30 min. Of the six peptide sequences identified in the sweet potato precursor protein, only that of IbHypSys IV (cf.

Georgia Jet) plants were grown under green house conditions and collected for peptide isolation 6 weeks after planting. The aerial parts of the plants were sprayed with a 1.25 mm methyl jasmonate solution (Bedoukian Research, Danbury, CT) in 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 15 h, and peptide extraction from leaves was performed as previously reported (3Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Stage I Purification, Crude Extract Preparation—Sweet potato leaves (1.2 kg of wet weight) were frozen in liquid N2 and homogenized in a 4-liter blender for 5 min in 2.5 liters of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.3 by slowly adding 10 n NaOH with stirring, and the precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The clear supernatant liquid was collected and readjusted to pH 2.2 with 1 n HCl and recentrifuged at 10,000 × g to clarify. The clear supernatant solution was passed through a 40-μm 3 × 25-cm C18 reversed-phase flash column (Bondesil, Varian Analytical Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O. The column was washed with 100 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O, and the bound material was eluted with 250 ml of 40% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 8 p.s.i. compressed nitrogen gas. The eluate was dried by lyophilization. The procedure was repeated 10 times to yield a total of 12 g of dry powder. Stage II Purification, Sephadex Chromatography—The dry powder was dissolved in 30 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to clarify. The supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (5.5 × 35 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O, and the collected fractions (8 ml) were assayed for alkalinization activities with tomato suspension cells as described above using 10 μl of each fraction with 1 ml of cells. Activity was located at or near the column void, and these fractions were pooled and lyophilized, yielding about 1 gram of dry weight. Stage III Purification, Initial HPLC Chromatography—The dry powder was dissolved in 4 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through a Millex-HV PVDF membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and 1-ml aliquots were applied to a preparative reversed-phase C18-HPLC column (218TP1022, 10-μm, 2.2 cm ID × 25 cm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. After 5 min, an elution program from 0 to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied over 90 min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Ten-μl aliquots from each fraction were added to 1 ml of tomato suspension cells to determine the alkalinizing activity. The active fraction at 37-39 min was lyophilized. The yield from four duplicate runs was 62 mg, dry weight. Stage IV Purification, Cation Exchange Chromatography—One-third of the dry material was dissolved in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile buffer and applied to a polySULFOETHYL Aspartamide™ strong cation exchange column (5-μm, 4.6 mm ID × 200 mm, The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). The column was equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile. Two min after adding the sample, a 90-min gradient from 0 to 100% elution buffer consisting of 5 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm potassium chloride, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile was applied to the column. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. Biological activities from each fraction were determined in the alkalinization assay using 10-μl aliquots. The activity was identified in fractions eluting at 33-35 min. The active fractions from three consecutive separations were combined and lyophilized. The dry material containing salt was not weighed. Stage V Purification, Sequential HPLC Separations—The dried material was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O and applied to an analytical reversed-phase C18 HPLC column (218TP54, 5-μm 4.6 mm ID × 250 mm, Vydac) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A gradient was performed from 0 to 40% methanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid 2 min after sample injection. The absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and 10-μl aliquots from each fraction were assayed using 1 ml of tomato suspension cells. Active fractions eluting at 44-46 min were pooled, and methanol was removed by vacuum evaporation. The combined fractions were loaded onto a narrow bore reversed-phase C18 HPLC column (218TP52, 5-μm, 2.1 mm ID × 250 mm, Vydac) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. After 2 min, an elution program from 0 to 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was performed over 90 min, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Aliquots (2 μl) were added to 1 ml of tomato suspension cells to determine the alkalinizing activity from each fraction. Active fractions eluted at 50-53 min and were pooled (1 ml total). The pooled sample was rechromatographed on a polySULFOETHYL Aspartamide™ column as described above. The purification conditions were the same as described above, only the 90-min gradient was from 0 to 45% elution buffer. Alkalinization activities in each fraction were determined using 10-μl aliquots. Lyophilization of the active fractions (55-56 min) yielded a dry salty powder that was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O. To further purify the active fraction, a narrow bore reversed-phase C18 HPLC column was utilized as described previously but with a gradient from 0 to 30% methanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 90 min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Two-μl aliquots were used to determine the alkalinizing activity from each fraction. The active fraction was found at 73-75 min. Methanol was removed by vacuum evaporation, and the peptide sample was loaded on the narrow bore reversed-phase C18 HPLC column again. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. A 90-min gradient was performed from 0 to 40% with an elution buffer consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate in 50% acetonitrile, pH 6. The alkalinization assay revealed active fractions eluting at 45-47 min. These fractions were pooled and further purified and desalted on a narrow bore reversed-phase C18 HPLC column with a 0-40% acetonitrile elution gradient for 90 min. The purified peptides were quantified by the peak areas relative to areas measured with known quantities of synthetic NtHypSys I and II. The total yield was 125 pmol. Peptide Sequence Analysis and Synthesis—Peptide sequence was analyzed by Edman chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Procise model 492 protein sequencer. Peptides were synthesized by N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl chemistry by solid-phase techniques using an Applied Biosystems model 431 synthesizer and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. MALDI spectra were obtained on an Applied Biosystems 4800 tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer with 200-Hz neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser. Concentrated samples in aqueous solution were mixed 1:1 with matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 6 mg/ml in 50:50 acetonitrile:0.25% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and air-dried. Calibrated MS spectra (±0.02 Da) were obtained as the summations of 1000-2000 laser shots, whereas MS/MS spectra (±0.1 Da) were summations of 10,000-20,000 laser shots. The MS/MS spectra of the glycosylated and proline- and hydroxyproline-rich peptides show nearly complete series of b and y ions. Cloning of IbpreproHypSys cDNA—Total RNA was prepared from sweet potato leaves by extraction with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE reactions were performed by using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Based on the amino acid sequence of IbHypSys isopeptide 2, a degenerate primer, 26-mer oligonucleotides 5′-GA(A/G)GA(A/G)AA(A/G)(A/T)(G/C)(A/T/C/G)CC(A/T/C/G)CC(A/T/C/G)CC(A/T/C/G)GC(A/T/C/G)CC-3′ (sense) encoding EEKSPPPAP, was synthesized and used for the 3′-RACE reaction. The 25-mer oligonucleotide antisense primer, 5′-GCTCAGGCTGATGCCAGGAAATCAC-3′, in the C-terminal was used for the 5′-RACE reaction. The cDNA was subcloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by using the M13 primers (forward, 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). RT-PCR Analyses of Relative Gene Expression Levels—Sweet potato leaves were either wounded with a hemostat or sprayed with a 1.25 mm methyl jasmonate solution (Bedoukian Research, Danbury, CT) in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. Young excised plants were supplied with peptides in distilled water through their cut stems and incubated in light for 2 h. Leaf RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript™ III RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR reactions were carried out with ExTaq Hot Start polymerase (Fisher Scientific). PCR conditions were the following: an initial step of 3 min, 94 °C; 30 cycles of the following three steps, 30 s, 94 °C; 30 s, 58 °C; 1 min, 72 °C; and a terminal step of 7 min, 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized on a Chemi Genius™ system using GeneSnap version 6.00.256 software (Syngene, Fredrick, MD). Analyses of gel images were performed with GeneTools software version 3.02.00 (Syngene). Relative abundance of transcripts was estimated from the expression of actin gene as the standard to give a numerical ratio. An IbpreproHypSys forward primer (5′-TGC TAC CGG TGA TTT CCT CT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GTC CGC CAT TGA AAT CAC TT-3′) were employed to amplify a 676-bp product. A sporamin (U17333) forward primer (5′-CAA TCC CAT CCG CCT CCC CAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTG TTA CAT TAC ACA TCG GTA GGT TTG ATG AC-3′) were used to generate a 580-bp product. Actin mRNA was used as an internal control for each PCR reaction, with a forward primer (5′-ATG GCA GAC GGT GAG GAT ATT CA-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GCC TTT GCA ATC CAC ATC TGT TG-3′). Isolation and Characterization of an Isopeptide Mixture from Sweet Potato Leaves—Systemin and HypSys peptides are defense signals that have been identified in several species of the Solanaceae family but not in species of any other plant family. A search was initiated to seek the presence of defense-signaling peptides in leaves of sweet potato (I. batatas), a species of the Convolvulaceae family, which is phytogenetically near the Solanaceae family. Alkalinization assays using plant suspension cultured cells have been the basis for detecting and isolating peptide signals originating from both plants and microorganisms (2Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Felix G. Duran J.D.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar), and a soluble extract from sweet potato leaves enriched in peptides was assayed for its ability to cause the alkalinization of the medium of suspension cultures of sweet potato. The extract did not cause an alkalinization of sweet potato suspension cultures. In the past, we have noted that some suspension cultures do not respond to endogenous peptide signals but that peptide signals are often recognized by cultures from other species. Assaying the sweet potato extract for alkalinization of suspension cultured tomato, tobacco, and petunia cells gave a positive response, with tomato giving the strongest response (Fig. 1A). The tomato culture was therefore utilized to assay the extract components following an initial HPLC separation. Ten μl from each of the eluting fractions was added to 1 ml of tomato suspension cultured cells, and a weak but reproducible increase in alkalinizing activity was detected in some of the fractions eluting from the column. Only the fractions eluting at about 40 min, labeled in Fig. 1B with a star, when pooled and further purified using HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielded a component with strong alkalinization activity (Fig. 1C). The active fraction was quantified by comparing the peak area with that of known synthetic peptides and found to be half-maximally active in the alkalinization assay at about 2.5 nm (Fig. 1D), the same half-maximal activity found with HypSys peptides from tobacco, tomato, and petunia (2Pearce G.

MALDI-MS/MS and amino acid sequence analyses of the peak component(s) revealed that it contained a major species having a backbone sequence of REEKSOOOAOEADDPNRP. MALDI-MS analyses also revealed two minor peptides in addition to the major peptide with substitutions at residue 5 (Ser to Pro) and residue 12 (Ala to Thr) (Fig. 2A). The major peptide (peptide 2) was identical to the peptide sequenced by Edman degradation and represented over 95% of the three peptides. All three peptides were decorated with from 6 to 12 pentose units each (Δ132 mass units/residue) (Fig. 2B), characteristic of hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptide signals isolated previously. Isolation of an IbpreproHypSys cDNA—Primers constructed from the sequence of the major isopeptide in the isolated mixture of three homologous peptides from sweet potato leaves (Fig. 2A, Peptide 2) were used to isolate a cDNA (Fig. 3) from sweet potato leaves that encoded a protein of 291 amino acids containing an 18-amino-acid sequence (underlined with a double line in the figure) that was identical to peptide 1 in the peptide mixture from Fig. 2. The deduced precursor protein contained five other peptide regions of 18 amino acids each that were rich in proline residues and were suspected to be homologs of the isolated HypSys peptides. The six putative peptides were named IbHypSys I through VI in the order they occurred in the precursor protein, counting from the N terminus (Fig. 3), with peptide 1 from Fig. 2 being IbHypSys IV. The other two isolated peptides were not found among the peptide sequences within the precursor protein, suggesting that they were derived from alleles. Attempts to isolate cDNAs containing peptides 2 and 3 were unsuccessful. The primary amino acid sequences of the six peptides encoded in the precursor have sequences typical of HypSys peptides and were considered potential peptide signals. Post-translational hydroxylations and glycosylation of some of the prolines of the primary transcript of the precursor are reflected in the isolated HypSys peptides. In Fig. 4, the sequences of the six peptides are compared with sequences of HypSys peptides previously isolated from several Solanaceae species. Wound and Methyl Jasmonate Induction of IbpreproHypSys Transcripts—In the Solanaceae family, the defense-signaling peptides systemin (1Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A.

Ryan, unpublished results. are derived from precursor proteins that are wound-inducible and jasmonate-inducible in leaves, jasmonates being mobile signals that activate defense genes in response to both herbivore and pathogen attacks (16Wasternack C. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2007; 100: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). To determine whether IbpreproHypSys was wound-inducible and/or methyl jasmonate-inducible, lower leaves of young sweet potato plants were either wounded using a hemostat or exposed to methyl jasmonate vapors, and the transcript levels of the gene were assayed with time using semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses. The levels of IbpreproHypSys mRNA increased over basal levels within 2-4 h after wounding and then decreased at 6 h (Fig. 5). Methyl jasmonate treatment caused the levels to increase within 2 h, but the levels remained elevated through 6 h. The time course of expression of IbpreproHypSys in response to wounding and methyl jasmonate is similar to those of HypSys precursor genes in leaves of tobacco, tomato, and petunia (2Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol.

Activities of Synthetic IbHypSys Peptides—A hydroxyproline-rich peptide was synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of the isolated IbHypSys 1 isopeptide sequence (Fig. 2A) that was found in the precursor protein (Fig. 3) but lacking carbohydrate adducts. The alkalinization activity of the synthetic peptide exhibited a half-maximal alkalinizing activity at concentrations between 10 and 25 μm (Fig. 6A), which is much weaker than the activity of the isolated peptides (∼2.5 nm). The low activity of the synthetic peptide was totally abolished in a synthetic analog in which the N-terminal Arg was substituted with an Ala (data not shown). Sporamin is the major storage protein in sweet potato tuberous roots and is a trypsin inhibitor that can also play a defensive role in leaves against herbivores (17Shewry P.R. Ann. Bot. 2003; 91: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Sporamin is known to be wound- and methyl jasmonate-inducible in sweet potato leaves (18Wang S.-J. Lan Y.-C. Chen S.-F. Yeh K.-W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 48: 223-231Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synthetic IbHypSys IV supplied to excised sweet potato leaves at 25 nmol/leaf for 2 h induced the expression of sporamin similar to levels induced by 2.5 pmol of native peptide, quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 6B). These results paralleled the results found in the alkalinization assays. The other five putative IbHypSys peptides in the precursor (Fig. 3, underlined) were synthesized with hydroxyproline residues substituted for prolines in the central core regions at residues where hydroxyprolines are present in the native HypSys peptides (cf. Fig. 4). All six synthetic peptides were active in inducing sporamin expression in excised leaves, assayed by RT-PCR (Fig. 6D). This report describes for the first time the isolation of a HypSys peptide and its precursor cDNA from a species outside of the Solanaceae family, i.e. sweet potato (I. batatas) of the Convolvulaceae family. The isolation was made possible by using an alkalinization assay with tomato cell suspension cultures since we were unsuccessful in developing a sweet potato suspension culture in which the sweet potato leaf extracts would alkalinize the culture medium. In our previous studies, 5G. Pearce and C. A. Ryan, unpublished results. we had found that suspension cultures of some Solanaceae species could detect HypSys peptide signals derived from other Solanaceae species, whereas some cultures could not. We therefore assayed the sweet potato leaf extract with suspension cultures of tobacco, tomato, petunia, and Arabidopsis for their alkalinizing activity. The extract caused alkalinization of the medium of all of the cultures (Fig. 1A), with the tomato culture being most responsive. Using the tomato suspension culture to assay bioactive components eluting from HPLC columns, an isopeptide mixture from sweet potato leaves was obtained (Fig. 1, B and C). The half-maximal activity of the peptides in the alkalinization assay was about 2.5 nm (Fig. 1D), which was similar to the half-maximal activities of HypSys peptides that have been isolated previously from tobacco, tomato, and petunia (2Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17777-17784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis and MALDI MS/MS indicated that the peptides contained four hydroxyproline residues in a central core consisting of -(S/P)OOOAO- and were glycosylated with varying numbers of pentose units, as evidenced by the pentose ladders (Fig. 2). These analyses revealed the presence of two minor peptides (less than 5%, Fig. 2, Peptides 1 and 3) that were homologs of the major peptide. Synthesis of degenerate primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the major peptide led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein containing a leader sequence and an internal 18 amino acid sequence that was identical to isolated peptide 1 and not peptide 2. The cDNA that was isolated encoded a protein containing five other 18-amino-acid sequences that were proline-rich. None of the five sequences matched the sequences of the two other isolated peptides. This indicated that at least one other precursor gene is present in sweet potato plants that encode HypSys peptides. Several attempts to isolate cDNAs with coding regions for peptides 2 and 3 were unsuccessful. The reasons for not finding the cDNAs coding for peptides 2 and 3 may be a consequence of developmental or environmental factors. The isolated peptides were from large sweet potato plants consisting mainly of mature leaves, with some young developing leaves. The cDNA was isolated from small developing leaves that may have been preferentially expressing the gene from which the cDNA was isolated, a possibility that is currently under investigation. All HypSys peptide precursor proteins identified to date, including IbpreproHypSys (cf. Fig. 2), exhibit signature motifs. One motif is within a 10-amino-acid sequence overlapping the signal peptidase splice site of -AR-. In the sweet potato precursor, the sequence at this site is -AQARRL-, and in the tomato, tobacco, and two petunia precursors, the sequences are -AQARTL-, -AEARTL-, AEARSL-, and -AEARTL-, respectively. This motif appears to be part of the substrate specificity site for recognition by the leader peptidase. Another highly conserved motif in each peptide is a -YGR- or -FGR-sequence at the N terminus of 10 of the 14 peptides in Fig. 3. These motifs appear to be part of the recognition sites for a processing enzyme(s) that accommodate large hydrophobic amino acids at the active site in which Tyr and Phe are favored, with less affinity toward other amino acids. This is the first indication in plants of a specificity site for an enzyme that processes peptides from precursor proteins and provides an opportunity to fashion synthetic peptides as substrates to seek such an enzyme. Finally, the sequence of LASA found at the C terminus of the sweet potato precursor peptide is similar to sequences in tobacco and tomato, i.e. -LASY and -QHSY, respectively, and in the two petunia HypSys precursors, -LASY and -LAST. The significance of these motifs is not known but may have a role in localizing the protein in the cell wall (11Narváez-Vásquez J. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12974-12977Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or anchoring the precursor to cell wall components. The six proline-rich peptide regions encoded within the cDNA were named IbHypSys I through VI, beginning from the N terminus of the encoded precursor protein (cf. Fig. 3). The IbHypSys IV sequence is identical with Fig. 2A, Peptide 1. The proline-rich regions present in all six peptides exhibit similarities to HypSys peptides previously isolated from various species of the Solanaceae family (Fig. 4), suggesting that the encoded protein might be a polyprotein precursor of six HypSys defense signaling peptides. The precursor is reminiscent of the animal polyprotein proenkephalin (19McLaughlin, P. J. (2006) in Handbook of Bioactive Peptides (Kasten, A. J., ed) pp, 1313-1318, Elsevier Inc., Burlington, MAGoogle Scholar) that harbors six copies of (Met5)-enkephalin and a copy of (Leu5)-enkephalin, apparently to produce large amounts of signal in response to a variety of cues. The six HypSys peptides encoded within the HypSys precursor cDNA were synthesized to assess their biological activities. Proline residues were replaced with hydroxyprolines at four positions where hydroxyprolines were located in the core regions of isolated IbHypSys peptides (cf. Fig. 3). However, the synthetic peptides were lacking carbohydrate adducts that are found in the native HypSys peptides. Synthetic IbHypSys IV induced the expression of its precursor, IbpreproHypSys and sporamin (Fig. 6B), but at concentrations several magnitudes higher than native IbHypSys IV, emphasizing the importance of the carbohydrate for maximal activity and similar to the activity of synthetic HypSys peptides from tobacco and tomato (2Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Pearce G. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30044-30050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Elevated sporamin expression levels of sweet potato leaves fed synthetic IbHypSys IV were abolished by the substitution of alanine for arginine at the N terminus of the peptide (Fig. 6C), consistent with previous activity data for synthetic NtHypSys I and II (20Ryan C.A. Pearce G. Scheer J. Moura D.S. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S251-S264Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The other five synthetic peptides also activated the expression of sporamin when supplied at μm concentrations (Fig. 6D). The presence of pentose adducts in the HypSys peptides is clearly important for activity, and their composition, linkages, and attachment sites to the peptides are being investigated. The biological properties of the HypSys peptides indicate that they interact with specific cell surface receptors. Peptide signals derived either from plant pathogens (e.g. flagellin fragments and elongation factor Tu fragments) or from plants (e.g. systemin and AtPep1) are known to interact with cell surface receptors and to cause alkalinization of the medium of plant cultured cells (13Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The lack of an alkalinization response of the sweet potato suspension culture to IbHypSys peptides may be due to the absence of a component of the receptor system in our sweet potato suspension cultures that is present in tomato cell suspension cultures. A receptor for HypSys peptides has not been identified but is currently being sought in tomato cells. If present, a HypSys receptor would provide a useful tool to further understand the early steps of HypSys defense signaling. The tomato suspension cultures were unable to identify other IbHypSys peptides present in the precursor protein. To determine whether the sweet potato precursor produces all six of the putative hydroxyproline-rich peptides, a sweet potato suspension culture assay must be developed that can be used in an alkalinization assay to isolate additional peptides from sweet potato leaf extracts. Expression of the IbHypSys peptide precursor in leaves, like other HypSys peptide precursors, is inducible by wounding and methyl jasmonate (Fig. 5). The increase in levels of the precursor protein in response to wounding (herbivore attacks) may contribute to a rapid amplification of defense signaling peptides as found with other endogenous peptide signals (7Ryan C.A. Huffaker A. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1902-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The HypSys peptides, when supplied to young sweet potato leaves, induced sporamin, an herbivore-inducible defense gene of I. batatas (17Shewry P.R. Ann. Bot. 2003; 91: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Cai D.G. Thurau T. Tian Y.Y. Lange T. Yeh K.-W. Jung C. Plant Mol.

Plant Cell Rep. 1997; 16: 696-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism of release of HypSys peptides from cell wall-associated precursors in response to wounding is not known, but wounding causes a rapid release of linolenic acid from membranes and the subsequent production of jasmonate (24Conconi A. Miquel M. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). One scenario is that jasmonate may trigger the synthesis and transport of a protease(s) to the apoplast to process the HypSys precursor and release the HypSys peptides. On the other hand, the protease(s) may already be in the cell wall as a proenzyme(s) or in an inactive state that can be activated in response to ion fluxes or other physiological changes. In any event, peptides produced in the apoplast appear to interact with a cell surface receptor to initiate HypSys defense peptide signaling.

We derive temporal receptive fields from the responses of neurons in the inferior colliculus to vocalization stimuli with and without additional ambient noise. We find that the onset of ambient noise evokes a change in receptive field dynamics that corresponds to a change from bandpass to lowpass temporal filtering. We show that these changes occur within a few hundred milliseconds of the onset of the noise and are evident across a range of overall stimulus intensities. Using a simple model, we illustrate how these changes in temporal processing exploit differences in the statistical properties of vocalizations and ambient noises to increase the information in the neural response in a manner consistent with the principles of efficient coding."
https://openalex.org/W2036946960,"The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, responds to various environmental cues by invoking specific adaptive mechanisms for their survival. Under nitrogen limitation, S. cerevisiae undergoes a dimorphic filamentous transition called pseudohyphae, which helps the cell to forage for nutrients and reach an environment conducive for growth. This transition is governed by a complex network of signaling pathways, namely cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR, which controls the transcriptional activation of FLO11, a flocculin gene that encodes a cell wall protein. However, little is known about how these pathways co-ordinate to govern the conversion of nutritional availability into gene expression. Here, we have analyzed an integrative network comprised of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways with respect to the availability of nitrogen source using experimental and steady state modeling approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the steady state expression of FLO11 was bistable over a range of inducing ammonium sulphate concentration based on the preculturing condition. We also show that yeast switched from FLO11 expression to accumulation of trehalose, a STRE response controlled by a transcriptional activator Msn2/4, with decrease in the inducing concentration to complete starvation. Steady state analysis of the integrative network revealed the relationship between the environment, signaling cascades and the expression of FLO11. We demonstrate that the double negative feedback loop in TOR pathway can elicit a bistable response, to differentiate between vegetative growth, filamentous growth and STRE response. Negative feedback on TOR pathway function to restrict the expression of FLO11 under nitrogen starved condition and also with re-addition of nitrogen to starved cells. In general, we show that these global signaling pathways respond with specific sensitivity to regulate the expression of FLO11 under nitrogen limitation. The holistic steady state modeling approach of the integrative network revealed how the global signaling pathways could differentiate between multiple phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1964849051,"The uncleaved, pro-form of nerve growth factor (proNGF) functions as a pro-apoptotic ligand for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). However, some reports have indicated that proneurotrophins bind and activate Trk receptors. In this study, we have examined proneurotrophin receptor binding and activation properties in an attempt to reconcile these findings. We show that proNGF readily binds p75NTR expressed in HEK293T cells but does not interact with TrkA expressed under similar circumstances. Importantly, proNGF activates TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation, induces Erk and Akt activation, and causes PC12 cell differentiation. We show that inhibiting endocytosis or furin activity reduced TrkA activation induced by proNGF but not that induced by mature NGF and that proNGF123, a mutant form of NGF lacking dibasic cleavage sites in the prodomain, does not induce TrkA phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Therefore, endocytosis and cleavage appear to be prerequisites for proNGF-induced TrkA activity. We also found that proBDNF induces activation of TrkB in cerebellar granule neurons and that proBDNF cleavage by furin and metalloproteases facilitates this effect. Taken together, these data indicate that under physiological conditions, proneurotrophins do not directly bind or activate Trk receptors. However, endocytosis and cleavage of proneurotrophins produce processed forms of neurotrophins that are capable of inducing Trk activation."

Two basic models have been proposed, namely “sorting-for-entry” and “sorting-by-retention,” and suggest that multimerization/aggregation of a cargo of secretory proteins in a mildly acidic, cation-rich environment is a nexus to both processes (3Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar). Sorting-for-entry proposes that a structural/conformational motif within an aggregate of secretory proteins mediates subsequent association to a protein receptor or a lipid component of the membrane of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The quest for identifying a consensus sorting signal has proven elusive, and it now appears that such process may rather depend on a variety of motifs (5Dikeakos J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. J.

In the sorting-by-retention model, selective aggregation/condensation occurs in post-TGN immature secretory granules (ISGs), resulting in retention of regulated secretory proteins, whereas nonaggregated proteins are removed into constitutive-like secretory vesicles (3Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These two models might not be mutually exclusive. Indeed, sorting-by-retention may perhaps be viewed as an auxiliary condensation mechanism refining the segregation process in a more distal compartment of the secretory pathway, which is the maturing ISG.The chromogranins/secretogranins (granins) family of regulated secretory proteins are widely distributed in the core of DCGs throughout the neuroendocrine and neuronal systems (17Taupenot L.

Whether one or many discrete regions in primary structure mediate the vesicular targeting of SgII in the primary sequence of the protein remains undetermined and might not merely be inferred from studies of CgA or CgB trafficking. Indeed, SgII shows little homology with CgA and CgB, with respect to primary structure and genomic organization (17Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1134-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Most notably, SgII lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic disulfide-bonded loop structure found in CgA and CgB.We report a strategy in which the expression of novel chimeric forms of SgII fused to GFP or embryonic alkaline phosphatase (EAP) is used to investigate the mechanism by which SgII is targeted to the regulated secretory pathway of sympathoadrenal PC12 cells. We provide evidence that sorting of SgII into DCGs depends on a saturable sorting machinery at the trans-Golgi/TGN, and we find that information necessary for such a process is contained within both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of SgII, with the α-helix-containing amino acid sequences 25-41 (SgII-(25-41)) and 334-348 (SgII-(334-348)) of the mature protein acting as sufficient, independent sorting signals for trafficking of SgII into the regulated pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CulturePheochromocytoma PC12 cells and primary chromaffin cells isolated from fresh bovine medulla were cultured as described previously (22Taupenot L. Mahata M. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1152-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23O'Connor D.T. Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Jiang Q. Hook V.Y. Taupenot L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In some experiments, PC12 cells were treated with nerve growth factor (NGF; 2.5 S, 100 ng/ml; Invitrogen) 48 h prior to transfection and further differentiated by NGF for an additional 48 h.DNA TransfectionSupercoiled plasmid DNA for transfection was grown in Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and purified on columns (Qiagen). In nucleofection experiments (Amaxa), plasmid DNA was further purified using the MiraCLEAN endotoxin removal kit (MirusBio). Two days before transfection, PC12 cells were split onto either poly-l-lysine (Sigma) plus collagen (Upstate)-coated 15-mm round glass coverslips (Fisher number 1) in 12-well Costar plates or onto poly-l-lysine plus collagen-coated 6- or 12-well Costar plates. Cells were transfected with 1 μg (12-well plate) or 2 μg (6-well plate) of DNA per well using the cationic lipid transfection reagent GenePorter 2 (Genlantis). Five hours after the beginning of the transfection, the culture medium was replaced, and cells were further cultured for 48 h. Nucleofection was performed using 2 × 106 bovine chromaffin cells resuspended in 100 μl of Basic Nucleofector solution for primary neurons, 3 μg of DNA, and program A-33. Immediately after transfection, 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium was added to the cells, which were allowed to recover 20 min (37 °C, 5% CO2), before plating (6 × 105 cells per well) onto coated glass coverslips in 12-well Costar plates.Construction of Expression VectorspGEM4-hSgII (24Gerdes H.H.

The amplified fragment was purified, digested with XhoI and KpnI, and subcloned in-frame into the same sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech), to produce pCMV-SgII-EGFP. SgII domains SIG-SgII-(1-24), SIG-SgII-(1-41), SIG-SgII-(1-76), SIG-SgII-(1-145), and SIG-SgII-(1-301) were obtained by PCR using pCMV-SgII-EGFP as a template and specific primers incorporating a KpnI restriction site at the 3′ end of each domain. After digestion with XhoI and KpnI, each fragment was subcloned in-frame into the same sites of the pEGFP-N2 to create pCMV-SgII181-EGFP, pCMV-SgII253-EGFP, pCMV-SgII304-EGFP, pCMV-SgII409-EGFP, pCMV-SgII616-EGFP, and pCMV-SgII1084-EGFP. pCMV-SgII-EGFP was used to amplify SIG domain flanked by an AgeI site at its 3′ end, and a SgII-(302-587) domain flanked with an AgeI site at its 5′ end. Resulting PCR fragments were digested with either XhoI and AgeI (SIG) or AgeI and KpnI (SgII-(302-587)) and ligated together. The resulting fragment was subcloned in-frame into the XhoI and KpnI sites of pEGFP-N2 to create pCMV-SgIIΔN-EGFP. The C-terminal domains SIG-SgII-(302-333), SIG-SgII-(302-348), SIG-SgII-(302-371), SIG-SgII-(302-402), and SIG-SgII-(302-505) were obtained by PCR using pCMV-SgIIΔN-EGFP as a template and specific primers incorporating KpnI at the 3′ end of each domain. Each fragment was digested with XhoI and KpnI and subcloned in-frame into the same sites of pEGFP-N2 to create pCMV-SgII-(1085-1180)-EGFP, pCMV-SgII-(1085-1225)-EGFP, pCMV-SgII-(1085-1294)-EGFP, pCMV-SgII-(1085-1387)-EGFP, pCMV-SgII-(1085-1588)-EGFP, and pCMV-SgII-(1085-1696)-EGFP. To construct pCMV-SgII-(254-304)-EGFP and pCMV-SgII-(1181-1225)-EGFP, complementary synthetic oligonucleotides of the corresponding sequences, including a KpnI restriction site at the 5′ end and a BamHI at the 3′ end, were annealed and digested with KpnI and BamHI. Each fragment was subcloned into the same sites of pCMV-SgII181-EGFP.A truncated domain (EAP) of the full-length human secreted EAP (SEAP) gene devoid of 17-amino acid signal peptide of SEAP was obtained as described previously (25Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3885-3897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To design SgII domain-EAP fusion chimeras, EGFP was substituted by EAP at the KpnI and NotI cloning sites of each of the SgII domain/EGFP plasmids described above. pCMV-SgII-(254-304)-EAP and pCMV-SgII-(1181-1225)-EAP were obtained by inserting EAP into the BamHI and NotI cloning sites of EGFP. pECFP-Golgi (Clontech) encoding the membrane-anchoring region of glycoprotein β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT-CFP) was used to design pECFP-Golgi-SgII. The ochre codon of enhanced CFP (TAA at position 1581-1583) was mutated to a serine codon (TCA) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) to produce mutated pECFP-Golgi. Next, a human SgII domain lacking SIG was amplified from pCMV-SgII-EGFP using specific primers incorporating a NotI restriction site at the 5′ end and a TAA ochre codon followed by a NotI restriction site at the 3′ end. The amplified fragment was purified, digested with NotI, and subcloned in-frame into the same site of mutated pECFP-Golgi to produce pECFP-Golgi-SgII encoding GalT-CFP-SgII. All the constructs were verified by restriction and nucleotide sequence analysis.Chimeric Photoprotein Fluorescence and ImmunocytochemistryTransfected cells cultured on poly-l-lysine- and collagen-coated glass coverslips were fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and exposed to 1 μg/ml nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for nuclei visualization. Prior to fixation, NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 12.5 μm CellTracker Orange CMRA (Molecular Probes) in serum-free medium to visualize cell bodies and neurites and washed for 30 min at 37 °C in complete medium. For immunocytochemistry, fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, incubated for 5 min with 150 mm glycine in PBS, and exposed for 30 min to 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with goat polyclonal anti-CgB (C19, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-human SgII (1:2000) (26Eskeland N.L. Zhou A. Dinh T.Q. Wu H. Parmer R.J. Mains R.E. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or rabbit polyclonal anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase antibody (1:50; Biomeda) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated for 30 min with a Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:350; Molecular Probes) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (F(ab′)2 at 1:250; Molecular Probes) together with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted in buffered Celvol (Celanese), and processed for three-dimensional imaging by deconvolution fluorescence microscopy.Three-dimensional Imaging by Deconvolution Fluorescence MicroscopyImages were captured on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscopy system operated by SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision), using oil immersion objectives (60 or 100×, N.A. 1.4). The system included a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera mounted on a Nikon TE2000 fitted with a mercury arc lamp light source. Pixel intensities were kept in the linear response range of the digital camera (≤4095). Optical xy sections along the z axis were acquired with increments of 0.2 μm. The fluorescent data sets were deconvolved to generate optical sections and three-dimensional images of the data sets. Adobe Photoshop 7.0 or ImageJ were used for additional processing of the images.Analyses of the Images Data SetsQuantification of Fluorescence Colocalization—To assess quantitatively the extent of colocalization between SgII fragment/GFP fusion proteins, DCG marker CgB, or CFP chimeras, 9-25 optical xy sections along the z axis of 3-6 cells were analyzed using the pixel-per-pixel colocalization algorithm of ImageMaster 5.0 imaging software (Photon Technology International). A scatter plot was generated for each xy section and represented the intensity of the green channel (x coordinate, GFP signal) versus the intensity of the red or blue channel (y coordinate, Alexa Fluor 594 or CFP signal) for each pixel of the section. Based on the two-dimensional histogram, the software calculates the Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rp), which is mathematically related to Pearson's χ2 test, and the overlap coefficient (Ro). Rp and Ro are quantitative of the degree of overlap between two signals S1 and S2. Rp is calculated according to Equation 1, RP=∑i(S1i−S1avg)×(S2i−S2avg)∑i(S1i−S2avg)2×(S2i−S2avg)2(Eq. 1) Ro is calculated according to Equation 2, Ro=∑iS1i×S2i∑i(S1i)2×∑i(S2i)2(Eq. 2) where -1 ≤ Rp ≤1 and 0 ≤ Ro ≤1. A value of 1 stands for complete positive correlation between the S1 and S2. Ro is not sensitive to the differences in pixel intensity between S1 and S2. S1i is signal intensity in the first channel; S1avg is average intensity in the first channel; S2i is signal intensity in the second channel; S2avg is average intensity in the second channel. The averaged Rp and Ro values of each cell were used for statistical analysis of variance by ANOVA with Dunnett's post test. Differences between correlation within each data group of Table 1 were also analyzed by χ2 for a row by column contingency table using pixel counts from a representative xy optical section taken in the mid-cell region. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.TABLE 1Quantitative analysis of the colocalization between SgII domain chimeric proteins and markers of the secretory pathway in PC12 cellsPearson's coefficient (Rp)Overlap coefficient (Ro)xy optical sections (n)Cells (n)A.

Open table in a new tab Quantification of Fluorescence DistributionTo assess quantitatively the distribution of SIG-SgII-GFP puncta in PC12 cells coexpressing GalT-CFP-SgII chimera, we analyzed the abundance and size of green fluorescent particles using ImageJ. For each xy section, green puncta that contained above-threshold green pixel values within a specified area range of 0-1.15 μm2 (i.e. a diameter range of 0-600 nm) were outlined and counted, and their diameter was measured. The average diameter was calculated over the total number of identified particles for each condition as follows: SIG-SgII-GFP and GalT-CFP, 2814 counts; SIG-SgII-GFP and GalT-CFP-SgII, 997 counts. A statistical analysis of variance was done by t test.Chemiluminescence Detection of EAP Secretion AssayPC12 cells grown onto poly-l-lysine-coated plus collagen-coated 6- or 12-well plates were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for SgII domain/EAP chimeras or SEAP. Cells were washed twice with calcium saline buffer (CaSB: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and subsequently exposed for 15 min to CaSB or barium secretion buffer (BaSB: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Supernatants were collected, and cells lysates were prepared by quick freeze/thaw in CaSB containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Detection of EAP enzymatic activity in the culture supernatant and cell lysate was achieved with a high sensitivity chemiluminescence assay (Phospha-Light, Applied Biosystems). The secretion rate of EAP chimeras was calculated as a percentage of the total EAP activity present in the cells before stimulation. Total EAP activity is the sum of the amount released plus the amount remaining in the cells. In the figures, the release of EAP chimeras is expressed as percent EAP activity secretion, or relative to EAP secretion rate in nonstimulating condition (CaSB, mock control).Secondary Structure PredictionThe secondary structure of mature human SgII was predicted with NNPREDICT (27Kneller D.G.

Statistical analysis was performed by t test, or ANOVA with Dunnett's or Bonferroni post test, or by χ2 for a row by column contingency table. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.FIGURE 3Effect of NGF differentiation on the distribution of SgII domain-GFP chimeras in PC12 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2022011603,"TAK1 (transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is rapidly activated by TGF-β1 and plays a vital function in its signal transduction. Once TAK1 is activated, efficient down-regulation of TAK1 activity is important to prevent excessive TGF-β1 responses. The regulatory mechanism of TAK1 inactivation following TGF-β1 stimulation has not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) plays a pivotal role as a negative regulator of TAK1 activation in response to TGF-β1 in mesangial cells. Treatment with okadaic acid (OA) induces autophosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1. In vitro dephosphorylation assay suggests that Thr-187 in TAK1 is a major dephosphorylation target of PP2A. TGF-β1 stimulation rapidly activates TAK1 in a biphasic manner, indicating that TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation is tightly regulated. The association of PP2AC with TAK1 is enhanced in response to TGF-β1 stimulation and closely parallels TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activity. Attenuation of PP2A activity by OA treatment or targeted knockdown of PP2AC with small interfering RNA enhances TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 and MKK3 (MAPK kinase 3). Endogenous TAK1 co-precipitates with PP2AC but not PP6C, another OA-sensitive protein phosphatase, and knockdown of PP6C by small interfering RNA does not affect TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 and MKK3. Moreover, ectopic expression of phosphatase-deficient PP2AC enhances TAK1-mediated MKK3 phosphorylation by TGF-β1 stimulation, whereas the expression of wild-type PP2AC suppresses the MKK3 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data indicate that PP2A functions as a negative regulator in TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation.

Among TGF-β family members, TGF-β1, the prototype of the TGF-β family, is well established as a potent inducer of extracellular matrix synthesis and regarded as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis, including renal fibrosis (3Border W.A.

During the past decade, important advances in our understanding of TGF-β1-induced signaling have been made, and the Smad signaling pathway is well documented as a canonical pathway induced by TGF-β1 (5Massague J.

TAK1, initially identified as a kinase activated by TGF-β and BMP family members, consists of ∼600 amino acids (14Yamaguchi, K., Shirakabe, K., Shibuya, H., Irie, K., Oishi, I., Ueno, N., Taniguchi, T., Nishida, E., and Matsumoto, K.

The N-terminal half, containing about 300 amino acids, bears the kinase domain and shares ∼30% identity with the catalytic domain of other mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs) (e.g. Raf-1 and MEKK-1). TAK1 also mediates distinct signaling pathways induced by various stimuli, including environmental stress (23Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K.

(1995) Science, 270, 2008-2011Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TAK1 might be the point of convergence in various signaling pathways activated by a variety of stimuli. For its activation, phosphorylation of a threonine residue (Thr-187) and serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop of TAK1 protein is required (27Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7359-7368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Ser-412 of TAK1 can be phosphorylated in a protein kinase A-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells (30Kobayashi Y. Mizoguchi T. Take I. Kurihara S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11395-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unlike other mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs), however, TAK1 also requires a specific binding partner known as TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein 1) for its autophosphorylation, and coexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 strongly induces TAK1 activation through autophosphorylation (27Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

Besides TAB1, TAB2 and TAB3 interact with the C-terminal region of TAK1 and serve as adaptor molecules linking TAK1 to TNF-α receptor-associated factor 2 and 6 in TNF-α and IL-1 signaling pathways, respectively (31Takaesu G.

However, it is not yet known whether TAB2 and TAB3 are required for TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation. Once TAK1 is activated, it has the capability to trigger the activation of several downstream cell signaling cascades, including the MKK4/7 (MAPK kinase kinase 4/7)-JNK cascade, MKK3/6-p38 MAPK cascade, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase-IκB kinase cascade, which regulates NF-κB activation (24Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in a cell type-specific and context-dependent manner. TAK1 has been shown to mediate TGF-β-induced expression of type I and IV collagens and fibronectin in SV40 transformed mouse mesangial cells (36Ono K. Ohtomo T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that TGF-β1-induced activation of downstream MKK3-p38 MAPK cascade leads to type I collagen expression (22Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that TAK1 is a major upstream signaling molecule mediating TGF-β1-induced MKK3 activation in primary mouse mesangial cells (MMC) (37Kim S.I. Kwak J.H. Zachariah M. He Y. Wang L. Choi M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F1471-F1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression is mediated by TAK1 through MKK4-JNK signaling cascade (38Hocevar B.A. Prunier C. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25920-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased expression and activation of TAK1 enhance p38 phosphorylation as well as interstitial fibrosis in myocardium from 9-day-old TAK1 transgenic mice (39Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), indicating that TAK1 plays a crucial role in tissue fibrosis and elaboration of extracellular matrix in vivo and in vitro. Additional functions of TAK1 in the TGF-β signaling pathway have also been described. For instance, TAK1 is implicated in TGF-β1-induced cell cycle regulation through the regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A in LLC-PK1 cells (40Terada Y. Nakashima O. Inoshita S. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1378-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TAK1 can also regulate TGF-β-induced activation of Smad signaling. The TAK1-p38 MAPK cascade induces Smad7 expression by regulation of the transcription factor ER81, a member of the ETS family (41Dowdy S.C. Mariani A. Janknecht R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44377-44384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TAK1 directly interacts with the Mad homolog domain 2 of Smad family proteins, and the interaction of TAK1 with R-Smad results in interference with the nuclear localization and transactivation of R-smad in murine mesenchymal progenitors (42Hoffmann A. Preobrazhenska O. Wodarczyk C. Medler Y. Winkel A. Shahab S. Huylebroeck D. Gross G. Verschueren K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27271-27283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, TAK1 may function as an important regulator of the TGF-β-induced Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signaling pathway as well as an activator of JNK and p38 MAPK. However, the regulatory mechanism of TAK1 activation by TGF-β1 and its rapid inactivation remains incompletely understood. In general, cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of kinases represent the major mechanism responsible for control of intracellular signaling cascades. TAK1 requires phosphorylation at Ser and Thr residues for its activation and is rapidly down-regulated. In this context, Ser/Thr protein phosphatases may play a crucial role in inactivation of TAK1. In mammalian cells, four major groups of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) exist. Two isoforms of PP2C (PP2Cβ1 and PP2Cϵ) have been shown to be capable of binding with and dephosphorylating TAK1 in 293 cells under nonstimulated conditions (43Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 44Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12013-12021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that a new Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family member, PP6, also interacts with and negatively regulates IL-1-induced TAK1 in 293 cells (45Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39891-39896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to examine the role of another Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family member, PP2A, in TAK1 activation by TGF-β1. We reasoned that PP2A is a likely candidate, since it can associate with type I TGF-β receptor and Raf-1 whose kinase domain shares about 30% identity with TAK1 is consistently associated with PP2A (46Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ory S. Zhou M. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Morrison D.K. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1356-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PP2A is an abundant and ubiquitous enzyme with pleiotropic functions (48Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A in cells contains a heterotrimeric subunit structure, consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit (PP2AC), a 65-kDa structural A subunit (PP2AA), and one of a variety of structurally distinct regulatory B subunits (PP2AB). In addition to the heterotrimeric form of PP2A, a core dimeric form of PP2A consisting of A and C subunits also exists in cells. The different B subunits are believed to change substrate specificity and subcellular localization of PP2A (49Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D961-D972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). PP2AC undergoes at least three different post-translational modifications: phosphorylation of Tyr-307, carboxymethylation of Leu-309, and phosphorylation of unidentified threonine residues. By either mutation at Tyr-307 or Leu-309, PP2AAC core dimer loses the ability to interact with a regulatory B subunit (51Tolstykh T. Lee J. Vafai S. Stock J.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5682-5691Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 52Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-307 reduces its phosphatase activity (52Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 53Chen J.

A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas the carboxymethylation at Leu-309 does not cause a large change in phosphatase activity (55Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2ABα specifically interacts with activated TβRI through the WD-40 repeat domain and is phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation (46Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PP2A associates with and dephosphorylates p70S6 kinase in response to TGF-β stimulation, which in turn induces G1 arrest of polarized EpH4 mammary epithelial cells (56Petritsch C. Beug H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that PP2A associates with TAK1 and TAB1 and functions as a negative regulator in TGF-β1-induced TAK1 activation in mouse mesangial cells.

Primary MMC established in culture were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of expression vectors was performed using Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, cells grown to ∼60% confluence on either a 100- or 60-mm dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transfected with 1 μg (for a 100-mm dish) or 0.3 μg (for a 60-mm dish) of plasmid for 4 h under serum-free conditions. Total amount of DNA was adjusted with empty vector, pcDNA3.1. Following transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in medium supplemented with 15% FBS for 18 h prior to each experiment. Expression Constructs—Mammalian expression constructs for wild-type TAK1 (HA-TAK1), kinase-deficient mutant of TAK1 (HA-TAK1DN, a K63W mutant of TAK1), FLAG-TAB1, Myc-TAB1, and bacterial expression vector for His-MKK6 (pQE-31-MKK6) were kindly provided by K.

First strand cDNA of mouse MKK3b was synthesized by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with oligonucleotide dT12 according to the manufacturer's instructions and then amplified by PCR using a mouse MKK3b-specific PCR primer set (forward primer, 5′-GGGGTCCTGGGATCTGAATCCTCTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCCATGGCTTTGGATCCGTCCCCAAGTAT-3′) synthesized according to the sequence from GenBank™ (accession number NM_008928). PCR products were then ligated with pcDNA3.1/TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Correct clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the inserted MKK3b cDNA and its surrounding region and named pcDNA-V5-MKK3. Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged wild-type TAK1 (FLAG-TAK1) and C-terminal deleted TAK1 (FLAG-TAK1ΔC) harboring the N-terminal 300 amino acids of TAK1 were kindly provided by G. Gross (42Hoffmann A. Preobrazhenska O. Wodarczyk C. Medler Y. Winkel A. Shahab S. Huylebroeck D. Gross G. Verschueren K. J. Biol.

HA-tagged wild type PP2AC (HA-PP2AC) and its mutant variants, (HA-PP2AC (H118N), HA-PP2AC (Y307F), and HA-PP2AC (L309Q)) were gifts from D. L. Brautigan (University of Virginia) (52Chung H.

Signal. 1999; 11: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The His-118 mutant (H118N) is a phosphatase-deficient mutant of PP2AC, whereas the Tyr-307 mutant (Y307F) and Leu-309 mutant (L309Q) are the phosphorylation site mutant and methylation site mutant of PP2AC, respectively. Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—siGENOME SMARTpool targeted against mouse PP2AC (L-040657), PP6C (L-062583), and siCONTROL nontargeting pool (D-001206-13) were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. Transfection of siRNA using DharmaFECT™ reagent was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were grown to 50% confluence on a 60-mm dish in 3 ml of medium supplemented with 15% FBS. Two hundred microliters of siRNA transfection solution containing respective siRNA and 4 μl of DhamarFECT™ in serum-free medium were added to the cell culture, resulting in 100 nm siRNA for each transfection. Following transfection, cells were incubated in medium containing 15% FBS for 24 h and then rendered quiescent in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 16 h prior to each experiment. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm aprotinin. Cell lysates were passed through 21-gauge needles several times and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). For Western blotting, protein samples (100 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight on a rocker at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times (15 min/each) with TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The target proteins were detected with LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technologies). In the case of immunoprecipitation experiments, 200-500 μg of cell lysates were reacted with 1-2 μg of primary antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by precipitation with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h (for proteins expressed by transiently transfected cDNA) or overnight (for endogenous proteins) at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with the lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Endogenous expression levels of phosphorylated Thr-187 in TAK1 activation loop (p187-TAK1) and phosphorylated MKK3 (p-MKK3) were quantitated using Image J software (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health). Statistical significance of the experimental data from three independent experiments was determined by Student's t test for paired data. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylated TAK1 was obtained by coexpression of HA-TAK1 and FLAG-TAB1 in MMC followed by immunoprecipitation of TAK1 with anti-HA antibodies. An appropriate amount of phosphorylated TAK1 was incubated with varying amounts of purified PP2A (A and C complex) in the reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min at 30 °C. Following the reaction, TAK1 dephosphorylation target sites of PP2A were evaluated by Western blotting with anti-p187-TAK1 and anti-p412-TAK1 antibodies. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—At the indicated time points following TGF-β1 treatment, endogenous TAK1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in the same kinase buffer containing 1 μg of the specific substrate His-MKK6. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). After 2 min of incubation at 25 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. OA-sensitive Ser/Thr Protein Phosphatase(s) Negatively Regulates TAK1 Phosphorylation—TAK1 activation is induced by autophosphorylation and is rapidly inactivated. We hypothesized that a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family member, PP2A, plays a crucial role in regulating TAK1 activation by TGF-β1 through dephosphorylation of TAK1. We initially examined the effects of OA, a specific inhibitor of PP2A, on endogenous TAK1 phosphorylation. OA treatment with levels up to 1 μm in various cell cultures has been shown to specifically inhibit PP2A"
https://openalex.org/W2060138087,"The adult cerebellar cortex is comprised of reproducible arrays of transverse zones and parasagittal stripes of Purkinje cells. Adult stripes are created through the perinatal rostrocaudal dispersion of embryonic Purkinje cell clusters, triggered by signaling through the Reelin pathway. Reelin is secreted by neurons in the external granular layer and deep cerebellar nuclei and binds to two high affinity extracellular receptors on Purkinje cells-the Very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2). In mice null for either Reelin or double null for Vldlr and Apoer2, Purkinje cell clusters fail to disperse. Here we report that animals null for either Vldlr or Apoer2 individually, exhibit specific and parasagittally-restricted Purkinje cell ectopias. For example, in mice lacking Apoer2 function immunostaining reveals ectopic Purkinje cells that are largely restricted to the zebrin II-immunonegative population of the anterior vermis. In contrast, mice null for Vldlr have a much larger population of ectopic Purkinje cells that includes members from both the zebrin II-immunonegative and -immunopositive phenotypes. HSP25 immunoreactivity reveals that in Vldlr null animals a large portion of zebrin II-immunopositive ectopic cells are probably destined to become stripes in the central zone (lobules VI-VII). A small population of ectopic zebrin II-immunonegative Purkinje cells is also observed in animals heterozygous for both receptors (Apoer2(+/-): Vldlr(+/-)), but no ectopia is present in mice heterozygous for either receptor alone. These results indicate that Apoer2 and Vldlr coordinate the dispersal of distinct, but overlapping subsets of Purkinje cells in the developing cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2088045673,"We previously reported that polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) depletion by lentivirus-based RNA interference led to mitotic arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, whereas normal diploid cell lines, hTERT-RPE1 and MCF10A, survived a similar level of depletion. To study homogeneous cell lines, we generated several Plk1-depleted hTERT-RPE1 and MCF10A clones that were derived from single cells depleted of Plk1. We found that in the long term, Plk1 depletion slowed proliferation of hTERT-RPE1 cells, apparently due to attenuated progression through S phase. These cells had altered morphology and were elongated compared with control. In contrast, MCF10A clones with mild levels of depletion showed no obvious phenotype. They appeared to have normal proliferation rates with no cell-cycle arrest. However, one MCF10A clone, which was severely depleted of Plk1, although viable, showed sporadic G2/M arrest and apoptosis. This MCF10A clone and all the hTERT-RPE1 clones displayed evidence of DNA-damage checkpoint activation. These data further support the interpretation that cancer cell lines have a much greater requirement for Plk1 than normal nontransformed diploid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991614835,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing α3 and β2 subunits are found in autonomic ganglia and mediate ganglionic transmission. The closely related α6 nAChR subtype is found in the central nervous system where changes in its level of expression are observed in Parkinson's disease. To obtain a ligand that discriminates between these two receptors, we designed and synthesized a novel analog ofα-conotoxin MII, MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], and tested it on nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide blocked chimeric α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs with an IC50 of 1.2 nm; in contrast, its IC50 on the closely related α3β2 as well as non-α6 nAChRs was three orders of magnitude higher. We identified the residues in the receptors that are responsible for their differential sensitivity to the peptide. We constructed chimeras with increasingly longer fragments of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the α3 subunit inserted into the homologous positions of the α6 subunit, and these were used to determine that the region downstream of the first 140 amino acids was involved. Further mutagenesis of this region revealed that the α6 subunit residues Glu-152, Asp-184, and Thr-195 were critical, and replacement of these three residues with their homologs from the α3 subunit increased the IC50 of the peptide by >1000-fold. Conversely, when these key residues inα3 were replaced with those fromα6, the IC50 decreased by almost 150-fold. Similar effects were seen with other α6-selective conotoxins, suggesting the general importance of theseα6 residues in conferring selective binding.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 2The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; CTX, conotoxin; NTR, N-terminal binding region; CI, confidence interval. are members of the large family of Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels (1Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). They are pentameric proteins composed of α subunits alone (homopentamers) or α in combination with β subunits (heteropentamers). In the case of the heteromeric receptors, different combinations of α and β subunits yield receptors with different pharmacological and electrophysiological properties (2Dani J.A. Bertrand D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 47: 699-729Crossref Scopus (954) Google Scholar). To date, nine α and three β subunits have been discovered and cloned from mammalian nervous tissue. Of these, α2 through α6 can form receptors in combination with β2 through β4, leading to a large assortment of different receptor subtypes. The α6 subunit has a limited distribution within the brain, largely being expressed by catecholaminergic neurons (3Le Novere N. Zoli M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J.

Chronic exposure to nicotine has been shown to selectively affect the expression and function of nAChRs on striatal dopaminergic terminals containing this subunit (8Perry D.C. Mao D. Gold A.B.

Furthermore, α6 nAChRs appear to play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, a disease involving the loss of dopaminergic neurons. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced injury of dopaminergic neurons is associated with a selective loss of α6* 3Asterisk indicates presence of additional subunits. nAChRs in both rodents and monkeys (10Lai A.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5494-5500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there is selective loss ofα6 nAChRs in human Parkinson's disease. Thus, ligands that selectively target α6β2* nAChRs potentially represent a novel class of therapeutic agents (13Quik M. McIntosh J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 316: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to pharmacologically distinguish α3β2 from α6β2* nAChRs due to the close structural similarities of the α subunits. α3β2* nAChRs are found on peripheral autonomic ganglia where they modulate cardiac and enteric functions (14De Biasi M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15De Biasi M. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therapeutic agents targeting CNS α6β2* nAChRs would need to be devoid of activity on α3β2 nAChRs to avoid cardiovascular and intestinal side effects. α-Conotoxin (CTX) MII, a 16-amino acid peptide, is the signature ligand for α6β2* nAChRs; however, α-CTX MII also blocks α3β2 nAChRs with high affinity (16Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, given the overall high sequence homology between α6 and α3 subunits and the conservation of residues responsible for interaction with α-CTX MII (17Harvey S.C. McIntosh J.M. Cartier G.E. Maddox F.N. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, we created a novel ligand, based on α-CTX MII, that discriminates between α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 nAChRs by a factor of 1000 (α6/α3 is a chimera that contains the N-terminal binding region of the α6 subunit and the remaining fragment of the α3 subunit, see “Experimental Procedures”). We constructed receptor chimeras and mutants and determined the non-homologous residues near the ligand binding sites of α6 and α3 that are responsible for this selectivity. The results of the present study provide insight into the nAChR-ligand interaction and may aid in development of α6* nAChR-selective therapeutics. Materials—Acetylcholine chloride, atropine, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. α-CTXs were synthesized as described previously (16Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S.

Heinemann (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Clones of β2 and β3 subunits in the high expressing pGEMHE vector were kindly provided by Chuck Luetje (University of Miami, Miami, FL). cDNA clones encoding rat α9 and α10 were provided by Belen Elgoyhen (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina). Construction of Chimeras—Chimeras were made by PCR using the primer sequences shown in Table 1. Because the α6 subunit does not form functional receptors, we used a functional surrogate formed by splicing the N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding region of the α6 subunit with the remaining fragment of the α3 subunit as previously described (19McIntosh J.M. Azam L. Staheli S. Dowell C. Lindstrom J.M. Kuryatov A. Garrett J.E. Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Hence, all chimeras of α6 used in this study had portions of the N-terminal ligand-binding region of the α6 subunit replaced with the corresponding region of the α3 subunit. The notation for these chimeras is the length of the α3 sequence at the N-terminal portion, followed by the remaining α6/α3 sequence, which makes up the C-terminal portion. Primers were designed to amplify each length of the extracellular region of the α3 subunit plus a 25-bp 3′-overhang homologous to the remaining extracellular region of the α6 subunit. Similarly, each α6/α3 subunit fragment was amplified that contained a 25-bp 5′-overhang homologous to the α3 subunit. Amplifications of the α3 and α6/α3 fragments were carried out by using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Each corresponding α3 and α6/α3 PCR fragment (containing the overhangs) was first hybridized and subsequently extended by PCR, using primers specific for a 5′-segment of the α3 sequence (containing an NotI site: 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGACATGGGTGTTGTGCTGCTC-3′) and a 3′-segment of the α6/α3 sequence (containing an XbaI site: 5′-GTCCATCTAGACACAGGTGAGCCTCGATG-3′), using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplifiedα31-xα6/α3 PCR products were cloned into pT7TS plasmid (a modified pGEM4Z plasmid containing a 5′ anda3′ Xenopus globin untranslated region), using the NotI and SpeI sites. The ligated products were transformed into either DH10B or HB101 competent cells and grown overnight, and the cDNA was isolated using a miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subsequently sequenced.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used to construct chimeras and point mutantsChimeramutantPrimerα31-140α6/α35′-TTCCCATTCGACTACCAAAACTGCACCCTGAAATTTGGGTCCTGGACTTACGAC-3′α31-160α6/α35′-AAGATCGACCTGGTCCTCATCGGCTCCAAAGTGGACATGAACGACTTTTGGGAA-3′α31-170α6/α35′-ATGAACCTCAAGGACTACTGGGAGAGTAGTGAGTGGGAAATTGTCGATGCCTCT-3′α31-180α6/α35′-AAACATGAAATCAAGTACAACTGCTGTGAAGAGATTTACACAGATATCACCTAC-3′α6E152K/α35′-GGACTTACGACAAGGCTAAGATCGACCTTCTCATC-3′α6D184E/α35′-TCTGGCTACAAGCATGAAATCAAGTACAACTGC-3′α6T195Q/α35′-TGTGAAGAGATTTACCAAGATATCACCTACTCC-3′α3K152E5′-CGACAAGGCAGAAATCGACCTGGTCCTCATCGGCTC-3′α3E184D5′-GGCTACAAACATGACATCAAGTACAAC-3′α3Q195T5′-TGTGAGGAGATCTACACAGACATCACGTACTCG-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of Point Mutations—Point mutants were made by PCR using primers shown in Table 1. Primers containing the desired point mutation flanked by 15 bases on either side were synthesized. Using the non-strand displacing action of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, the mutagenic primers were extended and incorporated by PCR. The methylated, non-mutated parental cDNA was digested with DpnI. The mutated DNA was transformed into DH10B or DH5α competent cells and isolated using the Qiagen miniprep kit and sequenced to ascertain the incorporation of the desired mutation. cRNA Preparation and Injection—Capped cRNA for the various subunits were made using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following linearization of the plasmid. The chimeras/point mutants made from the original α6/α3 chimera were linearized with SalI, and point mutants originally made from the α3 subunit were linearized with EcoRI, and transcribed with T7 and SP6, respectively. The cRNA was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The concentration of cRNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. cRNA of each chimera and point mutant were combined with cRNA of high expressing β2 and β3 subunits (in the pGEMHE vector) to give 167-500 ng/μl of each subunit cRNA. 100 nl of this mixture was injected into each Xenopus oocyte with a Drummond microdispenser (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), as described previously (16Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and incubated at 17 °C. Oocytes were injected within 1 day of harvesting, and recordings were made 2-4 days post-injection. Voltage Clamp Recording—Oocytes were voltage-clamped and exposed to ACh and peptide as described previously (16Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocyte chamber consisting of a cylindrical well (∼30 μl in volume) was gravity-perfused at a rate of ∼2 ml/min with ND-96 buffer (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1-7.5) containing 1 μm atropine and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In the case of the α9α10 subtype, the ND96 contained no Mg2+ and no atropine, and the oocytes were incubated in 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) for 3-4 h prior to recording. The oocyte was subjected once a minute to a 1-s pulse of 100 μm ACh. For screening of receptor chimeras and mutants, for toxin concentrations of 1 μm and lower, once a stable baseline was achieved, either ND-96 alone or ND-96 containing varying concentrations of the α-conotoxins was perfusion-applied, during which 1-s pulses of 100 μm ACh were applied every minute until a constant level of block was achieved. For toxin concentrations of 10 μm and higher, the buffer flow was stopped and the toxin was bath-applied and allowed to incubate with the oocyte for 5 min, after which the ACh pulse was resumed. ACh Dose Response—To acquire ACh dose-response data, the conventional oocyte chamber was replaced by a chamber constructed from a disposable 200-μl polypropylene pipette tip with a length of 50 mm and an internal diameter of 0.5 mm at the upstream or intake end and 5 mm at the downstream or exhaust end. The chamber was mounted horizontally with its intake end connected to the perfusion supply, while its exhaust end had a vertical meniscus whose location was dictated by the tip of a sipper made from a 27-gauge hypodermic needle connected to a vacuum line. The chamber had two apertures in its dorsal wall: 1) a 1.5-mm circular hole centered 13 mm downstream from the intake, and 2) a 2.5 × 5 mm (longitudinal) oval centered 14 mm downstream from the hole (i.e. a total of 27 mm from the intake end). The oocyte was introduced into the chamber through the oval aperture and secured against the chamber floor by the two voltage clamp glass microelectrodes that impaled the oocyte. The chamber was perfused at a rate of ∼2 ml/min. To introduce ACh into the chamber, the perfusion was halted and 20 μl of ACh was manually applied to the chamber via the small circular hole upstream from the oocyte. This volume was too small for ACh to reach the oocyte unless the perfusion was resumed. Upon resumption of perfusion (which was started immediately following the introduction of ACh into the chamber), the bolus of ACh rapidly engulfed the oocyte and washed past it in a matter of seconds, as judged by the time course of ACh response. This process was repeated with different concentrations of ACh with a time interval between applications long enough to avoid desensitization. Data Analysis—For the baseline response, at least three ACh responses were averaged. To determine the percent block induced by toxin, two to three ACh responses, obtained after a steady-state block had been achieved, were averaged, and the value was divided by the pre-toxin baseline value to yield a % response. The dose-response data were fit to the equation, Y = 100/(1 + 10^((log EC50 - log [Toxin]) × nH where nH is the Hill coefficient, by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Each data point is mean ± S.E.M. from at least three oocytes. For ACh dose-response curves, the response to a given ACh concentration was normalized to the response to 100 μm ACh, which served as an internal control. α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] Is a Selective Antagonist of α6* nAChRs—α-CTX MII is a two-disulfide bridge peptide with the sequence, GCCSNPVCHLEHSNLC-amide. It has high, but similar, potency in blocking both α6β2- and α3β2-containing nAChRs (IC50 values of 0.39 and 2.2 nm, respectively (19McIntosh J.M. Azam L. Staheli S. Dowell C. Lindstrom J.M. Kuryatov A. Garrett J.E. Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)). Structure-function studies of α-conotoxin MII indicate that several of the non-Cys residues are less important for activity against α6 versus α3 nAChRs (19McIntosh J.M. Azam L. Staheli S. Dowell C. Lindstrom J.M. Kuryatov A. Garrett J.E. Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We replaced three of these residues, Ser-4, Glu-11, and Leu-15, with Ala and tested them against heterologously expressed α3β2 and α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs. Because the α6 subunit does not form functional receptors, we used a functional surrogate formed by splicing the N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding region of the α6 subunit with the remaining fragment of the α3 subunit. The pharmacology of this chimera has previously been shown to match that of native α6β2* nAChRs for α-CTX MII binding (19McIntosh J.M. Azam L. Staheli S. Dowell C. Lindstrom J.M. Kuryatov A. Garrett J.E. Marks M.J. Whiteaker P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The combined Ala substitutions resulted in a peptide with >600-fold lower activity against α3β2 nAChRs but only 3-fold lower activity against α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs compared with native α-CTX MII (Table 2). Thus, the resulting analog has >1000-fold preference for α6/α3β2β3 over α3β2 nAChRs (Table 2). The rate of recovery from block was slower for α6/α3β2β3 than for α3β2 nAChRs (Fig. 1). A 1-min wash was sufficient for recovery of α3β2 nAChRs, whereas full recovery of α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs required a 5-min wash. Table 2 also shows the effect of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] on other subtypes of rat nAChRs.TABLE 2IC50 values for block of various rat nAChR subtypes by α-CTX MII[S4A, E11A, L15A]nAChRIC5095% CInHnmα6/α3β2β31.21.1-1.41.1 ± 0.06α3β21001,100-1,9000.8 ± 0.07α3β4380300-4901.1 ± 0.09α4β2>10,000α2β2>10,000α4β4>10,000α2β4>10,000α7~10,000α9α10>10,000 Open table in a new tab Amino Acids Downstream of the First 140 Residues of the N-terminal Region of the α6 Subunit Confer the High Preference of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for α6/α3β2β3 versus α3β2 nAChR—The N-terminal binding region (NTR) of α6 and α3 nAChR subunits displays ∼80% homology (Fig. 2). To determine the residues responsible for the differential interaction with the peptide, a series of chimeras were constructed, each with a progressively longer fragment of the NTR of the α6 subunit replaced by the corresponding region of the α3 subunit. Replacing the first 140 amino acids of the α6 subunit with the α3 subunit (α31-140α6/α3) did not affect the IC50 (Table 3). However, replacing the first 160 residues (α31-160α6/α3) decreased the potency of the toxin by ∼50-fold (Table 3), suggesting interaction of the toxin with amino acids located between residues 140 and 160 of the α6 NTR. Replacing an additional 10 amino acids of the α6 subunit with the α3 subunit (α31-170α6/α3) changed the susceptibility to the peptide only slightly. However, exchanging the first 180 amino acids (α31-180α6/α3; 24 amino acids shy of the entire NTR) further shifted the IC50 of the toxin toward that of the WT α3β2 nAChR (Table 3). These results suggest that amino acids downstream of the first 140 residues of the α6 subunit confer the high selectivity of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs.TABLE 3IC50 values for α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] on different chimerasChimeraIC5095% CInHnmα6/α3β2β31.21.1-1.41.1 ± 0.06α3β214001100-18800.8 ± 0.07α31-140α6/α3b2b31.51.2-1.90.75 ± 0.05α31-160α6/α3b2b35850-670.91 ± 0.05α31-170α6/α3b2b36761-740.93 ± 0.03α31-180α6/α3b2b3300200-4600.57 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab Glu-152, Asp-184, and Thr-195 of α6 Subunit Interact with α-CTX MII [S4A,E11A,L15A]—Spanning the region between residues 140 and 160 of the NTR are 5 amino acids that differ between the α6 and the α3 subunits (Fig. 2). To determine which residues of the α3 subunit should be substituted into the α6 subunit, the NTR of both α3 and α6 subunits were aligned with that of the α4 subunit, which does not show affinity for the α-CTX MII analog (Fig. 2). Of the five residues that differ between the α6 and α3 subunits in the first 140-160 amino acids, three are shared by both α3 and α4 subunits (Met-141, Lys-152, and Val-156) and one is different in all three (Leu-157 in α3, which is a Ser in α4 and an Ile in α6). When each of these α3 residues was systematically substituted for the corresponding residue in α6, the α6Glu-152 substitution with Lys created the most substantial rightward shift in the dose-response curve, decreasing the potency of the α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for the α6/α3β2β3 mutant receptor by 8-fold relative to that of the WT receptor (Table 4).TABLE 4IC50 values for α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] on mutant nAChRsMutant nAChRIC5095% CInHnMα6/α3β2β31.21.1-1.41.1 ± 0.06α3β214001100-19000.8 ± 0.07α6L141M/α3β2β32.81.9-4.10.86 ± 0.12α6E152K/α3β2β39.96.7-150.83 ± 0.13α6L155V/α3β2β32.01.8-2.11.1 ± 0.04α6I156L/α3β2β33.12.9-3.41.1 ± 0.03α6S171G/α3β2β32.32.0-2.71.3 ± 0.09α6E174A/α3β2β31.71.4-2.10.98 ± 0.09α6S179P/α3β2β32.42.2-2.61.1 ± 0.04α6D184E/α3β2β3108.8-111.1 ± 0.07α6T195Q/α3β2β3119.0-141.0 ± 0.1α6E152KD184ET195Q/α3β2β321001200-36000.53 ± 0.09α3K152EE184DQ195Tβ29.77.6-130.96 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab The next stretch of amino acids that affected potency of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] was located in the region downstream of the first 170 amino acids (Table 3). Once again, residues that differed between the α6 and the α3 subunits, but were common to the α3 and the α4 subunits, were exchanged. There are 8 amino acids that differ between the α6 and α3 subunits in the region between residues 170 and 204 (Fig. 2). Although α6Val-176 (Ile in α3), α6Asp-177 (Lys in α3) and α6Phe-201 (Leu in α3) differ in the two subunits, they are shared by the α6 and α4 subunits and therefore were not examined. Of the eight different residues, only one is shared by α3 and α4 subunits (Gly-171). However, substituting this residue for Ser found in the α6 NTR did not markedly affect the susceptibility of the receptor to toxin. As for the remaining residues, only substitutions of α6Asp-184 to Glu and α6Thr-195 to Gln decreased the receptor's susceptibility to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], by 8-fold and 9-fold, respectively (Table 4). When the three residues that markedly affected the potency of the α-CTX MII analog were simultaneously changed (α6E152KD184ET195Q/α3), the IC50 of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for the triple receptor mutant was approximately equal to the IC50 obtained for the WT α3β2 receptor (Table 4 and Fig. 3A). To ascertain whether the decreased toxin susceptibility of the α6E152KD184ET195Q/α3 mutant involved changes in ACh affinity, ACh dose-response curves were obtained for the WT and mutant receptors. ACh activated the WT and mutant receptors with similar potencies, with an EC50 of 7.7 μm (95% CI: 5-12 μm) and 14 μm (95% CI: 12-16 μm) for the WT and mutant receptor, respectively (Fig. 4). Next, the critical residues identified in the α6 subunit were substituted into α3 to assess for gain of function with respect to toxin susceptibility. Residues Glu-152, Asp-184, and Thr-195 of α6 were substituted for the homologous residues in the α3 subunit NTR. The resulting α3 mutant, designated as α3K152EE184DQ195T, was co-expressed with β2 subunit in oocytes. The α3K152EE184DQ195Tβ2 nAChR was ∼150-fold more sensitive to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] compared with WT α3β2 nAChR (Table 4 and Fig. 3B), with no change in ACh sensitivity (EC50 on α3β2, 87 μm (CI: 62-121 μm); EC50 on α3K152EE184DQ195Tβ2, 64 μm (CI: 30-137 μm)) (Fig. 4). α6 Residues Glu-152, Asp-184, and Thr-195 Interact with Other α6-Selective α-Conotoxins—We next investigated whether the identified residues were critical for the interaction with other α6*-selective conotoxins, specifically α-CTX PIA and α-CTX MII analogs α-CTX MII[H9A,L15A] and α-CTX MII[E11A]. When tested on α6E152KD184ET195Q/α3β2β3, all three peptides were less potent against the mutant than the WT α6/α3β2β3 nAChR (Table 5 and Fig. 5). Similarly, when tested on the mutant α3K152EE184DQ195Tβ2 nAChR, all three α-conotoxins were more potent in blocking the mutant than the WT α3β2 nAChR, although the gain in sensitivity was much less for α-CTX PIA than for the α-CTX MII analogs (Table 5 and Fig. 5).TABLE 5IC50 values for block by α-CTX PIA, α-CTX MII[H9A,L15A] and α-CTX MII[E11A] of WT and mutant nAChRsnACRIC50 (95% CI)α-CTX PIAα-CTX MII[H9A,L15A]α-CTX MII[E11A]nmα6/α3β2β30.95 (0.71-1.3)aValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 18.2.4 (1.7-3.4)bValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 19.0.16 (0.13-0.19)bValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 19.α3β274 (49-110)aValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 18.4900 (3500-6600)bValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 19.8.7 (6.8-11)bValues for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 19.α6/α3E152KD184ET195Qβ2β333 (28-40)1500 (840-2700)9.1 (6.9-12)α3 K152EE184DQ195Tβ222 (19-25)36 (30-43)0.53 (0.40-0.71)a Values for WT α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 are from Ref. 18Dowell C.

Open table in a new tab Positive Charge at Position 152 Disfavors Interaction of the α3 Subunit with α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A]—Among the residues that affected the potency of α-CTX MII [S4A,E11A,L15A], there is a charge reversal, from Glu-152 in α6 to a Lys-152 in α3; the residue exchange caused an ∼8-fold reduction in the potency of the peptide for the α6/α3 subunit. To determine whether this change in potency was due to a charge reversal or to a change in the side-chain length, α6Glu-152 was systematically replaced with an Arg, Gln, or Met. The Arg mutation retains the charge reversal, but has a longer side chain, whereas Gln replacement retains the side-chain length of Glu, but eliminates the negative charge. Met has a straight side chain, similar to Lys, but is not charged. As with the α6E152K/α3 mutant, the α6E152R/α3 mutant had a lower sensitivity to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] (IC50:23nm (95% CI: 19-29 nm)) (Fig. 6). Both α6E152Q/α3 and α6E152M/α3 mutations only slightly changed the IC50 of the analog relative to the WT receptor, with IC50 values of 5.9 nm (95% CI: 5.0-7.0 nm) and 4.3 nm (95% CI: 3.5-5.5 nm), respectively (Fig. 6). We have designed and synthesized a novel, high affinity ligand that discriminates between the closely related α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 nAChRs. The new peptide is a triple mutation of α-CTX MII, with Ala substituted at positions 4, 11, and 15. The parent peptide, α-CTX MII, does not distinguish well between α3β2 and α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs. Conversely, the Ala-substituted peptide retained activity against α6/α3β2β3 nAChR, but dramatically lost activity against α3β2 nAChR, i.e. compared with α-CTX MII, the new peptide is only 3-fold less active against α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs but ∼1700-fold less active against α3β2 nAChRs. These changes shift the selectivity ratio (IC50 α3β2:IC50 α6/α3β2β3) of 5.6 for the parent peptide to >1000 for the mutant, clearly indicating that the receptors can be well differentiated (Table 1). Amino acid residues that determine the high potency of α-CTX MII for the α3 subunit were previously characterized and are Lys-185 and Ile-188 (17Harvey S.C. McIntosh J.M. Cartier G.E. Maddox F.N. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, both of these residues are conserved between the α3 and the α6 subunits, which helps explain the similar high affinity of α-CTX MII for α6/α3β2β3 and α3β2 nAChRs. In this study, receptor mutagenesis was used to assess the residues in the extracellular region of the α6 versus the α3 subunit that confer selectivity of the new peptide α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for the α6 subunit. These amino acids include Glu-152, Asp-184, and Thr-195. Receptors with α6 subunits in which all three residues were simultaneously exchanged with analogous residues of the α3 subunit had a >1000-fold higher IC50 for α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A]. Conversely, replacing residues in α3 with the three key α6 residues increased sensitivity for α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] by ∼150-fold. Recent crystallographic structures of ACh binding proteins (AChBP) from Lymnea stagnalis, Aplysia californica, and Bulinus truncatus, which are used to model the nAChR in its ligand-bound state, as well as the high resolution structure of the Torpedo nAChR in the closed state, have aided greatly in understanding the ligand binding domain of nAChRs, and the structural changes that follow agonist and/or antagonist binding (20Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

The structures consist of an N-terminal α-helix, two-short 310 helices, and a core of 10 β-sheets, β1-β10. An “aromatic cage” that forms the ACh binding pocket consists of loops A-F, with loops A-C belonging to the principal part (or the α subunit in case of muscle and neuronal nAChRs) and loops D-F belonging to the complementary part (the β subunit, in neuronal heteromeric nAChRs) (20Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

It has been proposed that upon agonist (e.g. ACh) binding, loop C moves in a counterclockwise motion, closing on the agonist like a “hinge,” thus capping and trapping the agonist (23Unwin N. J. Mol.

However, binding of an antagonist would lock the C-loop in an open (i.e. resting) conformation and prevent opening of the channel. The change in the C-loop conformation has been confirmed in high resolution crystal structures of α-CTX PnIA[A10L,D14K] and α-CTX ImI bound to AChBP from A. californica (21Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E.

Maddox F.N. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), both reside in the β9 strand that precedes the C-loop, as determined from sequence comparison with both the Lymnea and Aplysia AChBPs (22Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 27Ulens C. Hogg R.C. Celie P.H. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similarly, two of the residues that confer high selectivity of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] for the α6 subunit, Asp-184 and Thr-195, are in the β9 and β10 strands, respectively, the former precedes and the latter follows the C-loop (Fig. 7). Therefore, subtle differences in the geometry of the C-loop may affect toxin binding. α3Gln-195 has previously been shown to interact with α-CTX PnIA and κ-bungarotoxin, which block α3β2 nAChRs (28Luetje C.W. Maddox F.N. Harvey S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1112-1119PubMed Google Scholar, 29Everhart D. Reiller E. Mirzoian A. McIntosh J.M. Malhotra A. Luetje C.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, an Ile at this position in the Aplysia AChBP is involved in interaction with α-CTX ImI (27Ulens C. Hogg R.C. Celie P.H. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The present study, however, indicates that α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] prefers a Thr at this position, as found in the α6 ligand binding domain. Gln and Thr both have polar, but uncharged side chains. However, the side chain of Gln is longer than that of Thr. Therefore, it is possible that the slightly longer side chain of Gln-195 sterically hinders the binding of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] to the α3β2 nAChR. Similarly, Glu at position 184 of the α3 subunit may sterically hinder binding of the α-CTX MII analog, because the shorter Asp at this position, as found in the α6 subunit, favors the binding of the toxin. The other residue in the α6 subunit that was found to influence the binding of α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], Glu-152, although not directly in the β9-β10 sheets, lies in close proximity (Fig. 7). Additionally, this residue, which is in a homologous position to that of Glu-151 in the A. californica AChBP, has been shown to be critical for binding of the PnIA variant α-CTX PnIA[A10L,D14K] (21Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E. Mordvintsev D.Y. Hogg R.C. van Nierop P. van Elk R. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Zhmak M.N. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Both the α3 and the α4 subunits, which are not sensitive to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], have a Lys at the homologous position. When the negatively charged α6Glu-152 is replaced with positively charged Lys or Arg, the resulting mutant is ∼8 and 19-fold, respectively, less sensitive to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], suggesting that either the negative charge might be important for conferring high selectivity to the toxin, or that introduction of a positive charge might be unfavorable to binding of the toxin. To address the former possibility, α6Glu-152 was replaced with the isosteric, but uncharged Gln. This substitution caused an ∼5-fold decrease in sensitivity to α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A], thus suggesting that the negative charge may have a role in conferring the high affinity of the toxin to the α6 subunit. To address the possibility that the introduction of a positive charge may be unfavorable, α6Glu-152 was replaced with Met, which is structurally similar to Lys but lacks the positive charge. This substitution caused a 3.5-fold decrease in the potency of the analog, as opposed to 8- and 19-fold decrease when either a Lys or Arg is present (see above), thus suggesting that the positive charge may contribute to the unfavorable interaction with the α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A]. In conclusion, we have created a high affinity MII analog that, unlike the parent peptide, is highly selective for α6/α3β2β3 over α3β2 nAChRs. Through receptor mutagenesis we have identified amino acid residues in the α6 subunit that are responsible for the differences in toxin affinity between these receptors. Considering the location of these residues with respect to residues that interact with ACh (Fig. 7B), it is likely that α-CTX MII[S4A,E11A,L15A] acts competitively to antagonize ACh binding. These residues are distinct from those previously determined as important to α-CTX MII interaction with the α3 subunit (17Harvey S.C. McIntosh J.M. Cartier G.E. Maddox F.N. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29Everhart D. Reiller E. Mirzoian A. McIntosh J.M. Malhotra A. Luetje C.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2021096849,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is a potent inducer of apoptosis of malignant cells in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms by which it mediates such effects are not well defined. We provide evidence that As(2)O(3) induces phosphorylation/activation of the MAPK signal-integrating kinases (Mnks) 1 and 2 in leukemia cell lines. Such activation is defective in cells with targeted disruption of the p38alpha MAPK gene, indicating that it requires upstream engagement of the p38 MAPK pathway. Studies using Mnk1(-/-) or Mnk2(-/-), or double Mnk1(-/-)Mnk2(-/-) knock-out cells, establish that activation of Mnk1 and Mnk2 by arsenic trioxide regulates downstream phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E at Ser-209. Importantly, arsenic-induced apoptosis is enhanced in cells with targeted disruption of the Mnk1 and/or Mnk2 genes, suggesting that these kinases are activated in a negative-feedback regulatory manner, to control generation of arsenic trioxide responses. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of Mnk activity enhances the suppressive effects of arsenic trioxide on primary leukemic progenitors from patients with acute leukemias. Taken together, these findings indicate an important role for Mnk kinases, acting as negative regulators for signals that control generation of arsenic trioxide-dependent apoptosis and antileukemic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2075939495,"Background Bullying and violence are problems of aggression in schools among adolescents. Basic daily healthy practices including nutritious diet, hygiene and physical activity are common approaches in comprehensive health promotion programs in school settings, however thier relationship to these aggressive behaviours is vague. We attempted to show the advantages of these healthy lifestyle behaviours in 9 developing countries by examining the association with being frequently bullied, violence and injury. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional cross-national survey of 9 countries using the WHO Global School Based Student Health Survey dataset was used. Measurements included experiences of “being frequently bullied” in the preceding 30 days and violence/injury in the past 12 months. Association of risk behaviours (smoking, alcohol, sexual behaviour) and healthy lifestyle (nutrition, hygiene practices, physical activity) to being bullied, and violence/injury were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Hygiene behaviour showed lower risks of being frequently bullied [male: RR = 0.7 (97.5CI: 0.5, 0.9); female: RR = 0.6 (0.5, 0.8)], and lower risk of experiences of violence/injury [RR = 0.7 (0.5, 0.9) for males], after controlling for risk behaviours, age, education, poverty, and country. Conclusion/Significance Healthy lifestyle showed an association to decreased relative risk of being frequently bullied and violence/injury in developing countries. A comprehensive approach to risk and health promoting behaviours reducing bullying and violence is encouraged at school settings."

https://openalex.org/W1966822425,"To establish latent infections in B-cells, gammaherpesviruses express proteins in the infected B-cells of the host that spuriously activate signalling pathways located downstream of the B-cell receptor. One such protein is M2, a murine gammaherpesvirus 68-encoded molecule that activates the Vav1/Rac1 pathway via the formation of trimolecular complexes with Scr family members. Previous reports have shown that the formation of this heteromolecular complex involves interactions between a proline rich region of M2 and the Vav1 and Fyn SH3 domains. Here, we show that the optimal association of these proteins requires a second structural motif encompassing two tyrosine residues (Tyr120 and 129). These residues are inducibly phosphorylated by Fyn in non-hematopoietic cells and constitutively phosphorylated in B-cells. We also demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Tyr120 creates specific docking sites for the SH2 domains of both Vav1 and Fyn, a condition sine qua non for the optimal association of these two signalling proteins in vivo. Interestingly, signaling experiments indicate that the expression of M2 in B-cells promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and additional signaling proteins, a biological process that requires the integrity of both the M2 phosphotyrosine and proline rich region motifs. By infecting mice with viruses mutated in the m2 locus, we show that the integrity of each of these two M2 docking motifs is essential for the early steps of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 latency. Taken together, these results indicate that the M2 phosphotyrosine motif and the previously described M2 proline rich region work in a concerted manner to manipulate the signaling machinery of the host B-cell."
https://openalex.org/W2077691336,"Factor VIII circulates as a heterodimer composed of heavy (A1A2B domains) and light (A3C1C2 domains) chains, whereas the contiguous A1A2 domains are separate subunits in the active cofactor, factor VIIIa. Whereas the A1 subunit maintains a stable interaction with the A3C1C2 subunit, the A2 subunit is weakly associated in factor VIIIa and its dissociation accounts for the labile activity of the cofactor. In examining the ceruloplasmin-based factor VIII A domain model, potential hydrogen bonding based upon spatial separations of <2.8A were found between side chains of 14 A2 domain residues and 7 and 9 residues in the A1 and A3 domains, respectively. These residues were individually replaced with Ala, except Tyr residues were replaced with Phe, and proteins stably expressed to examine the contribution of each residue to protein stability. Factor VIII stability at 55 degrees C and factor VIIIa activity were monitored using factor Xa generation assays. Fourteen of 30 factor VIII mutants showed >2-fold increases in either or both decay rates compared with wild type; whereas, 7 mutants showed >2-fold increased rates in factor VIIIa decay compared with factor VIII decay. These results suggested that multiple residues at the A1-A2 and A2-A3 domain interfaces contribute to stabilizing the protein. Furthermore, these data discriminate residues that stabilize interactions in the procofactor from those in the cofactor, where hydrogen bonding in the latter appears to contribute more significantly to stability. This observation is consistent with an altered conformation involving new inter-subunit interactions involving A2 domain following procofactor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2003853159,"We demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations in the osmotic environment rheostatically regulate a gatekeeping function for the nucleolus that controls the spatial dynamics and functions of nucleolin. HeLa cells and U2-OS osteosarcoma cells were osmotically challenged with 100-200 mm sorbitol, and the intranuclear distribution of nucleolin was monitored by confocal microscopy. Nucleolin that normally resides in the innermost fibrillar core of the nucleolus, where it assists rDNA transcription and replication, was expelled within 30 min of sorbitol addition. The nucleolin was transferred into the nucleoplasm, but it distributed there non-uniformly; locally high levels accumulated in 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-negative zones containing euchromatic (transcriptionally active) DNA. Inositol pyrophosphates also responded within 30 min of hyperosmotic stress: levels of bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate increased 6-fold, and this was matched by decreased levels of its precursor, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate. Such fluctuations in inositol pyrophosphate levels are of considerable interest, because, according to previously published in vitro data, they regulate the degree of phosphorylation of nucleolin through a novel kinase-independent phosphotransferase reaction ( Saiardi, A., Bhandari, A., Resnick, R., Cain, A., Snowman, A. M., and Snyder, S. H. (2004) Science 306, 2101-2105 ). However, by pharmacologically intervening in inositol pyrophosphate metabolism, we found that it did not supervise the osmotically driven switch in the biological activities of nucleolin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2019150306,"In the past decade, several transcription factors critical for pancreas organogenesis have been identified. Despite this success, many of the factors necessary for proper islet morphogenesis and function remain uncharacterized. Previous studies have shown that transgenic over-expression of the transcription factor Hnf6 specifically in the pancreatic endocrine cell lineage resulted in disruptions in islet morphogenesis, including dysfunctional endocrine cell sorting, increased individual islet size, increased number of peripheral endocrine cell types, and failure of islets to migrate away from the ductal epithelium. The mechanisms whereby maintained Hnf6 causes defects in islet morphogenesis have yet to be elucidated.We exploited the dysmorphic islets in Hnf6 transgenic animals as a tool to identify factors important for islet morphogenesis. Genome-wide microarray analysis was used to identify differences in the gene expression profiles of late gestation and early postnatal total pancreas tissue from wild type and Hnf6 transgenic animals. Here we report the identification of genes with an altered expression in Hnf6 transgenic animals and highlight factors with potential importance in islet morphogenesis. Importantly, gene products involved in cell adhesion, cell migration, ECM remodeling and proliferation were found to be altered in Hnf6 transgenic pancreata, revealing specific candidates that can now be analyzed directly for their role in these processes during islet development.This study provides a unique dataset that can act as a starting point for other investigators to explore the role of the identified genes in pancreatogenesis, islet morphogenesis and mature beta cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1997195198,"It has been hypothesized that the net expression of a gene is determined by the combined effects of various transcriptional system regulators (TSRs). However, characterizing the complexity of regulation of the transcriptome is a major challenge. Principal component analysis on 17,550 heterogeneous human microarray experiments revealed that 50 orthogonal factors (hereafter called TSRs) are able to capture 64% of the variability in expression in a wide range of experimental conditions and tissues. We identified gene clusters controlled in the same direction and show that gene expression can be conceptualized as a process influenced by a fairly limited set of TSRs. Furthermore, TSRs can be linked to biological functions, as we demonstrate a strong relation between TSR-related gene clusters and biological functionality as well as cellular localization, i.e. gene products of similarly regulated genes by a specific TSR are located in identical parts of a cell. Using 3,934 diverse mouse microarray experiments we found striking similarities in transcriptional system regulation between human and mouse. Our results give biological insights into regulation of the cellular transcriptome and provide a tool to characterize expression profiles with highly reliable TSRs instead of thousands of individual genes, leading to a >500-fold reduction of complexity with just 50 TSRs. This might open new avenues for those performing gene expression profiling studies."
https://openalex.org/W1983773833,"The adenine nucleotide carrier (Ancp) catalyzes the transport of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus playing an essential role in the cellular energy metabolism. Two regions of Anc2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are specifically photolabeled using a photoactivable ADP derivative; they are the central matrix loop, m2, and the C-terminal end. To get more insights into the structure-function relationships of the C-terminal region during nucleotide transport, we have developed two independent approaches. In the first we have deleted the last eight amino acids of Anc2p (Anc2pΔCter) and demonstrated that the C-terminal end of Anc2p plays an essential role in yeast growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. This resulted from impaired nucleotide binding properties of the Anc2pΔCter variant in line with conversion of ADP binding sites from high to low affinity. In the second we probed the ligand-induced conformational changes of Anc2p C-terminal end (i) by assessing its accessibility to anti-C-terminal antibodies and (ii) by measuring intrinsic fluorescence changes of an Anc2p mutant containing only one tryptophan residue located at its C-terminal end (Anc2p3Y-u). We show that the C-terminal region is no further accessible to antibodies when Anc2p binds non-transportable analogues of ADP. Besides, Trp-316 fluorescence is highly increased upon ligand binding, suggesting large conformational changes.

Besides, Trp-316 fluorescence is highly increased upon ligand binding, suggesting large conformational changes. Taken together, our results highlight the involvement of the Anc2p C-terminal region in nucleotide recognition, binding, and transport. The adenine nucleotide carrier (Ancp) is a nuclear-encoded protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of ADP and ATP between the cytosolic and the matrix compartments (1Dahout-Gonzalez C. Nury H. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Brandolin G. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ADP/ATP transport is achieved by interconversion of Ancp between two conformational states that are fixed by the specific transport inhibitors carboxyatractyloside (CATR) 4The abbreviations used are: CATR, C-carboxyatractyloside; ATR, atractyloside; BA, bongkrekic acid; N-ADP, 3′-O-naphthoyl-ADP; VDAC, voltage dependent anion channel; BAnc1p, beef Anc1p; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: CATR, C-carboxyatractyloside; ATR, atractyloside; BA, bongkrekic acid; N-ADP, 3′-O-naphthoyl-ADP; VDAC, voltage dependent anion channel; BAnc1p, beef Anc1p; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and bongkrekic acid (BA). These conformations, referred to as CATR and BA conformations, respectively, are characterized by different reactivities of well defined regions of the protein to chemical, enzymatic, and immunochemical reagents (1Dahout-Gonzalez C. Nury H. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Brandolin G. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transition between the two conformations is very slow in the absence of transportable nucleotides but is markedly accelerated in the presence of ATP and ADP. Substrate- and inhibitor-dependent conformational changes have been observed not only with the membrane-bound ADP/ATP carrier but also with the detergent-isolated carrier (1Dahout-Gonzalez C. Nury H. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Brandolin G. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nucleotide-induced conformational changes of the isolated Ancp are similar to those occurring in the membrane-bound carrier during ADP/ATP transport (1Dahout-Gonzalez C. Nury H. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Brandolin G. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The beef Anc1p (BAnc1p) crystallized as the CATR-carrier complex is the only mitochondrial carrier for which high resolution structural data have been obtained (2Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The 2.2-Å resolution model of the CATR conformation described six tilted transmembrane α-helices that form a wide cavity opening toward the intermembrane space. The CATR molecule is located in the cavity and strongly interacts with the peptidic chain of the carrier. At the bottom of the cavity a cationic cluster of arginines and lysines residues would contribute to the nucleotide translocation mechanism (2Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Photolabeling of the ADP/ATP carrier substrate binding sites has been carried out with azido derivatives of ADP/ATP, and similar results were reported using different photoprobes and mitochondria from different sources (3Dalbon P. Brandolin G. Boulay F. Hoppe J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5141-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Two distinct peptidic regions of BAnc1p were specifically labeled by 2-azido-[α-32P]ADP (3Dalbon P. Brandolin G. Boulay F. Hoppe J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5141-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first corresponded to a central domain (peptide Phe-153—Met-200) comprising residues from matrix loop m2 to helix H4. The second was located in the C-terminal region of the carrier (peptide Tyr-250—Met-281) including residues from matrix loop m3 to helix H6. Two shortest distinct segments of the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier were also labeled by 2-azido-3′-O-naphthoyl-[β-32P]ADP and identified (Fig. 1A), with peptide Ser-182—Arg-190 and peptide Ile-310—Lys-317 belonging to the central part of the ADP/ATP carrier (matrix loop m2) and its C-terminal end, respectively (4Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plausible models in which the two distinct regions would be involved in organization of the nucleotide binding site(s) were proposed assuming the carrier is a dimer (3Dalbon P. Brandolin G. Boulay F. Hoppe J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5141-5149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that the yeast Ancp might be organized as a monomer in mitochondrial membranes and in detergent solution (5Bamber L. Harding M. Butler P.J. Kunji E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16224-16229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Bamber L. Harding M. Monne M. Slotboom D.J. Kunji E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2007; 371: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two photolabeled regions would belong to the same monomer. Nevertheless, this hypothesis cannot accommodate the previous findings that one molecule of CATR or BA binds with high affinity to a carrier dimer, consistent with a multimeric organization of the carrier (8Block M.R. Pougeois R. Vignais P.V. FEBS Lett. 1980; 117: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Klingenberg M. Riccio P. Aquila H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 503: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The experiments described in this paper were carried out with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Anc2p isoform of the ADP/ATP carrier. We have investigated the functional role of Anc2p C-terminal end using two different approaches. The first one was based on expression and biochemical characterization of a mutant of Anc2p of which we deleted the last eight amino acids (Anc2pΔCter) (Fig. 1A). In the second approach we probed the ligand-induced conformational changes of the C-terminal end of Anc2p by ELISA and measurements of intrinsic fluorescence changes of an Anc2p variant containing only one tryptophan residue at its C-terminal end (Fig. 1A). Taken together, our results highlight for the first time the involvement of the Anc2p C-terminal region in nucleotide recognition, binding, and transport. Our results are discussed in terms of participation of the C-terminal region in the nucleotide transport process and in the putative oligomerization state of the carrier. Chemicals—BA and [3H]atractyloside ([3H]ATR) were prepared as previously described (10Brandolin G. Meyer C. Defaye G. Vignais P.M. Vignais P.V. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Lauquin G.J.-M. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 3′-O-naphthoyl-ADP (N-ADP), 3′-O-naphthoyl-AMP, and 2′(3′)-O-(2,3,6-trinitrophenyl)-ADP were synthesized as described in Block et al. (12Block M.R. Lauquin G.J.-M. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5451-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Schlimme et al. (13Schlimme E. Boos K.S. Onur G. Ponse G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and Mayer et al. (14Mayer I. Dahms A.S. Riezler W. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2436-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), respectively. The 8-Br-ADP was from Sigma. [8-14C]ADP (60 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The polyclonal antibodies used in this work were generated in rabbits against yeast SDS-treated voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) or against a 14-residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end sequence of Anc2p (YDQLQMILFGKKFK) or against hydroxylapatite-purified Anc2p treated with SDS. Bacterial and Yeast Strains and Media—The Escherichia coli strain used in this work was JM109: recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi, hsdR17 (rK-, mK+), relA1, supE44, D(lac-proAB), [F′, traD36, proAB, lacIqZΔM15] (Promega). The bacterial strain was grown on LB medium (Difco) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when necessary. Bacteria were transformed according to standard classic methods using CaCl2 (15Cohen S.N. Chang A.C. Hsu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). The following S. cerevisiae strains were used in this study: W303-1B (Matα leu2-3,112 his3-11 ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1) and its derivative JL-1-3 (W303-1B anc1::LEU2 anc2::HIS3 anc3::URA3) (16Drgon T. Sabova L. Nelson N. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and JL-1Δ2Δ3u– (JL-1–3 Δanc2::HIS3 Δ[269–975]anc3) (33De Marcos Lousa, C. (2002) The Human Mitochondrial ADP/ATP Carriers: Kinetic Properties and Biogenesis of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins in the Yeast S. cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis, Université de Bordeaux 2Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C on media containing 2% (w/v) bactopeptone (Difco), 1% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco) supplemented with 2% (w/v) lactic acid and 1% (w/v) K2HPO4, pH5.5 (YPL). A selective synthetic minimal medium lacking Trp (Bio 101) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose (YNB Glc W–) was used when indicated. Construction of the Mutated anc2 Genes—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the ANC2 gene was performed using the standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene to delete the 3′ end of the gene or to introduce a Trp residue at position 316. The pMD101 plasmid (TRP1/CEN6/ARSH4)-containing ANC2 gene, coding for Anc2p, and its 3′- and 5′-flanking regions (between PstI and SalI restriction sites) was derived from pRS314 and was previously described (17Le Saux A. Roux P. Trézéguet V. Fiore C. Schwimmer C. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16116-16124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Deletion of the last eight codons (from position +931 to +954, position +1 corresponding to A from the ATG codon) corresponding to the C-terminal end of Anc2p was obtained by PCR using the pMD101 plasmid as a template and the primers 5′-CAATGTACGACCAACTGCAAATGTAAGTCTAATCTGGCTTGATTC-3′ and 5′-GAATCAAGCCAGATTAGACTTACATTTGCAGTTGGTCGTACATTG-3′. The corresponding plasmid obtained was called pMD-ANC2ΔCter. Two mutations at position +950 and +951 (Phe codon replaced with Trp codon) were introduced by PCR using the recombinant plasmid pMDANC2--ΔW (derived from pMD101) coding for a Trp-less variant of Anc2p (17Le Saux A. Roux P. Trézéguet V. Fiore C. Schwimmer C. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16116-16124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as a template and the primers 5′-GATCTTGTTTGGTAAGAAGTGGAAATAAGACTAATCTGGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGATTAGTCTTATTTCCACTTCTTACCAAACAAGATC-3′. The resulting plasmid was named pMDANC2–3Y-W316. ANC2 open reading frame (ORF), mutated or not, were controlled by DNA sequencing (Genome Express) of plasmids pMD101 (wild type) pMDANC2-ΔCter, pMDANC2-ΔW, and pMDANC2–3Y-W316 (mutated ORF), which were then used to transform the JL1Δ2Δ3u– strain according to the LiCl procedure (18Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected, and yeast strains were named K317 (wild-type ANC2), M309, K317-ΔW, and W316, respectively. Isolation of Mitochondria—Yeast cells grown on YPL were harvested in the late log phase (A600 nm near 5). Mitochondria were prepared as previously described (19Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16310-16320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—Specific binding of [14C]ADP or [3H]ATR to the ADP/ATP carrier in mitochondria was assessed by the CATR chase procedures (20Weidemann M.J. Erdelt H. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Incubation was 30 min for [3H]ATR to 2 h for [14C]ADP at 4 °C. The Kd values and the total number of ligand-binding sites were calculated from Scatchard plot of the data. When Scatchard plot were curvilinear, they were arbitrarily fitted using Kaleidagraph 4.0 according to a model with two classes of an equal number of interacting binding sites (21Block M.R. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with high affinity (Kd1) and low affinity constants (Kd2). The number of bound ligands (NB) is related to the total number of sites (S), NF (the number of free ligands), Kd1, and Kd2 by the Adair equation, NB=S2(NF/Kd1+2NF2/Kd1×Kd21+NF/Kd1+2NF2/Kd1×Kd2)(Eq. 1) ADP/ATP Transport Assay in Isolated Mitochondria—ADP/ATP transport was measured by means of a luminescence assay as described in Passarella et al. (22Passarella S. Ostuni A. Atlante A. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared mitochondria were incubated at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 m mannitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm Ap5A (an inhibitor of adenylate kinase), and 1 mm α-ketoglutarate (as respiratory substrate) in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) luciferin and 0.1% (w/v) luciferase (19Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16310-16320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Isolation of the ADP/ATP Carriers—The ADP/ATP carrier protein from yeast mitochondria was isolated by chromatography on hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) following the method described in Brandolin et al. (23Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The final carrier protein concentration in the purified fraction ranged between 0.03 and 0.05 mg/ml. Fluorescence Assays—Fluorescence assays were carried out with a high sensitivity spectrofluorometer (Biologic, Grenoble, France). Samples were introduced in a 1 × 1-cm fluorescence quartz cuvette inserted in a temperature-controlled cell holder with continuous stirring. Routinely, the carrier preparation in 0.5 ml was diluted with 1.5 ml of 136 mm glycerol. Reagents were injected with Hamilton automatic syringes in small volumes (2–10 μl). Fluorescence of the tryptophan residues was excited at 300 nm (1-nm band-pass) with a 150-watt xenon lamp. The emitted light was measured at right angles through a 0-54 Corning filter, the band-pass being centered at 297 nm. The temperature was set at 10 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Sigma) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. For SDS-PAGE, samples were prepared as described in (19Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16310-16320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-C-terminal peptide of Anc2p, 1/3000; anti-SDS-treated Anc2p, 1/5000; anti-SDS-treated VDAC, 1/2000. Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A and the ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactivity Assays—The ability of anti-C-terminal antiserum to react with the membrane-bound carrier incubated with or without ligands was tested by ELISA, as previously described (24Brandolin G. Boulay F. Dalbon P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Freeze-thawed mitochondria were suspended in 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 0.12 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and Complete mini-EDTA-free anti-proteases (according to supplier instructions). Because of the lower affinity of the carrier for nucleotides as compared with that for inhibitors, N-ADP and ADP were present at 50 or 100 μm final concentration, respectively, during all steps of the assay. Deletion of the Last Eight Amino Acids of Anc2p Severely Impairs Growth of Yeast Cells on Non-fermentable Carbon Source—Photolabeling of Anc2p in mitochondria with 2-azido-3′-O-naphthoyl-[β-32P]ADP resulted in the identification of two specifically photolabeled sites located in the central matrix loop m2 and in the C-terminal end of the carrier, respectively (4Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To assess the functional role of the C-terminal region, it was deleted from Anc2p by a genetic approach. The resulting carrier protein (ANC2ΔCter) is 309-amino acids long and lacks its last eight amino acids at the C-terminal end. It has a predicted molecular weight of 33.3 kDa and is referred to as Anc2pΔCter in the following. The construct was cloned into the yeast pRS314 centromeric vector under the control of the native promoter and terminator of ANC2 (17Le Saux A. Roux P. Trézéguet V. Fiore C. Schwimmer C.

The ADP/ATP transport activity of Anc2pΔCter and Anc2p expressed from the two strains was first assessed by their ability to rescue growth of JL-1Δ2Δ3u– on a non-fermentable carbon source (YPL) (Fig. 2). All of the strains developed similarly when plated onto a solid synthetic glucose medium lacking Trp (Fig. 2A). However, the M309 strain grew much more slowly on solid medium than K317 with lactate as the sole carbon source (Fig. 2A). This behavior was confirmed by examining cell growth at 28 °C in liquid YPL medium (Fig. 2B). Indeed, M309, exhibited a doubling time of 16 h with A600 nm = 6 for the saturation phase, whereas that of K317 was 2.5 h with A600 nm = 11 for the saturation phase (Table 1). We, thus, concluded that the poor growth of M309 on the non-fermentable carbon source reflects a severe impairment of the carrier functioning.TABLE 1Yeast growth properties, ligand binding data to the carriers, and kinetic parameters for ADP/ATP transport activity of mitochondria isolated from the strains K317 and M309StrainsK317 (Anc2p)M309 (Anc2pΔCter)Cell culture in YPLaGrowth yields and doubling times were determined from liquid cultures at 28 °C in YPL-rich medium.

Open table in a new tab Deletion of Anc2p C-terminal End Does Not Modify the Carrier Content in Yeast Mitochondria—The ADP/ATP carrier contents of K317 and M309 mitochondrial lysates were evaluated by Western blot analyses after SDS-PAGE to check out if impairment of M309 growth could be related to a lower Anc2p mitochondria content. VDAC was used as a control for the amount of mitochondrial proteins loaded on the gel. Both strains exhibited similar Anc2p content (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). As one could expect, Anc2pΔCter was not immunodetected by the anti-C-terminal peptide antiserum (Fig. 3A, lane 2). A more accurate determination of the carrier content was performed by binding experiments of [3H]ATR, a specific inhibitor of Ancp. As shown in Fig. 3B, binding of [3H]ATR increased as a function of added ligand and reached a plateau, with no significant difference between Anc2p and Anc2pΔCter. Kd values and maximum number of binding sites were calculated from the Scatchard plots (not shown) and were similar for both the variant and the wild-type carriers (Table 1). Similar results were obtained from binding experiments of [3H]BA (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal end is not involved in the inhibitor binding sites. Consequently, the poor M309 growth on YPL may be explained by a lower ADP/ATP exchange activity of Anc2pΔCter. Anc2p-ΔCter Mitochondria Are Deficient in ADP/ATP Transport Activity—Measurements of the ADP/ATP transport of Anc2p and Anc2pΔCter were carried out on mitochondria isolated from the corresponding strains by the luciferase/luciferin system (cf.“Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Table 1, Anc2p and Anc2pΔCter exhibit very similar apparent Vmax and kcat values. In contrast, the apparent Km of external free ADP for Anc2pΔCter was ∼10 times higher than for Anc2p (Table 1). This result suggests that the C-terminal end of Anc2p could be involved in ADP binding step as already hypothesized (4Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). C-terminal End Deletion Dramatically Modifies the Affinity of Anc2p for ADP—Specific binding of [14C]ADP to Anc2p and Anc2pΔCter in mitochondria was assessed by a differential method based on the use of CATR (20Weidemann M.J. Erdelt H. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Scatchard representation of data exhibits a curvilinear plot for Anc2p, indicating the presence of high and low affinity binding sites (Fig. 4A). The total number of binding sites for ADP (SADP) determined by extrapolation of the Scatchard plot was about 600 pmol/mg of protein, a value similar from the number of ATR binding sites (500 pmol/mg of protein, Table 1). The curvilinear Scatchard plot was fitted with a two interactive binding site model according to the Adair equation (cf.“Experimental Procedures”), leading for Anc2p to the ADP binding parameters summarized in Table 1: SADP = 631 pmol/mg of protein, Kd1 = 0.6 μm, and Kd2 = 32 μm. Interestingly, a linear Scatchard plot was obtained for Anc2pΔCter, leading to SADP = 539 pmol/mg of protein and a different apparent Kd value, Kd3 = 21 μm (Table 1). As in the case of Anc2p, the SADP value was in the same range as the ATR maximum number of binding sites. This indicates that the C-terminal end of the carrier does not constitute a whole binding site but participates in it. Unlike inhibitors and ADP, non-transportable nucleotide analogues modify C-terminal end reactivity toward anti-C-terminal antibodies. There are evidences that the accessibilities of different regions of Ancp depend on its conformational state (19Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G.

https://openalex.org/W1972793436,"Protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) are scale-free networks with a small-world property. In a small-world network, the average cluster coefficient (<C>) is much higher than in a random network, but the average shortest path length (<L>) is similar between the two networks. To understand the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the structure of PINs, simulation studies using various network growth models have been performed. It has been reported that the heterodimerization (HD) model, in which a new link is added between duplicated nodes with a uniform probability, could reproduce scale-freeness and a high <C>. In this paper, however, we show that the HD model is unsatisfactory, because (i) to reproduce the high <C> in the yeast PIN, a much larger number (n(HI)) of HD links (links between duplicated nodes) are required than the estimated number of n(HI) in the yeast PIN and (ii) the spatial distribution of triangles in the yeast PIN is highly skewed but the HD model cannot reproduce the skewed distribution. To resolve these discrepancies, we here propose a new model named the non-uniform heterodimerization (NHD) model. In this model, an HD link is preferentially attached between duplicated nodes when they share many common neighbors. Simulation studies demonstrated that the NHD model can successfully reproduce the high <C>, the low n(HI), and the skewed distribution of triangles in the yeast PIN. These results suggest that the survival rate of HD links is not uniform in the evolution of PINs, and that an HD link between high-degree nodes tends to be evolutionarily conservative. The non-uniform survival rate of HD links can be explained by assuming a low mutation rate for a high-degree node, and thus this model appears to be biologically plausible."
https://openalex.org/W2165601322,"The lungs are continuously exposed to a broad array of microbes through inhalation, and microorganisms that escape clearance by the upper airway mucociliary motion will deposit in the alveolar compartment of the lower airways. The pulmonary epithelium in the alveolar compartment is covered by a thin aqueous layer that contains surfactant proteins but also microbicidal components. We have here identified the epithelial cell surface-expressed heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP/RPL29) by high-performance liquid chromatography-fractionation, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry analysis as a major antimicrobial component in extracts of mouse lung tissue. HIP/RPL29 was also detected in extracts of mouse small intestinal tissue. HIP/RPL29 exhibited broad antibacterial activity, notably against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Human recombinant HIP/RPL29 exhibited killing activity in the same order of magnitude. The HIP/RPL29 protein was demonstrated to be localized to the epithelial cells and cell surface of the lungs and intestines by immunohistochemistry. We suggest that HIP/RPL29 fulfills a function as an abundant antibacterial factor of the epithelial innate defense shield against invading bacteria in both the lungs and the small intestine."
