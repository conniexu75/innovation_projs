https://openalex.org/W1963562121,Electronic averaging of potentials recorded from the human scalp reveals the presence of small average responses following the presentation of click stimuli. These responses are first detectable near the subject's psychophysical threshold and vary in amplitude with click intensity. It is suggested that the short-latency components of these responses are cortical in origin.

https://openalex.org/W2045869355,"An experiment is described suggesting that the glia cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex are capable of developing electric responses to direct stimuli. When hyperfine microelectrodes were pushed into the cortex of a cat, slow, reversible potential variations were recorded which resembled the ""electric responses"" from the glia cells in tissue culture."

https://openalex.org/W1972244511,"Pretreatment with two doses of reserpine (each 0.1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) sensitizes the heart to the positive chronotropic action of norepinephrine and reduces the response to stimulation of the accelerans nerve. Ganglionic transmission remains unaffected. The results indicate that the presence of certain stores of peripheral sympathetic transmitter is essential for the production of tachycardia by stimulation of the accelerans nerve."
https://openalex.org/W155596679,"On the basis of information about carbon-14 given by Libby, calculations are made of the predicted genetic and somatic effects of the carbon-14 produced by the testing of nuclear weapons. It is concluded that 1 year of testing (30 megatons of fission plus fusion) is expected to cause in the world (stimated future number of births per year 5 times the present number) an estimated total of about 55,000 children with gross physical or mental defects, 170,000 stillbirths and childhood deaths, and 425,000 embryonic and neonatal deaths. (There is an unknown amount of overlap of these three categories.) These numbers are about 17 times the numbers usually estimated as the probable effects of the fallout fission products from 1 year of testing. In addition, the somatic effects of bomb-test carbon-14 are expected to be about equal to those of fission products, including strontium-90, with respect to leukemia and bone cancer and greater than those of fission products with respect to diseases resulting from radiation damage to tissues other than bone tissue and bone marrow. All of the estimated numbers are subject to great uncertainty; they may be as much as 5 times too high or 5 times too low. The uncertainty in the estimation of the relative effects of carbon-14 and fission products in world-wide fallout is not so great."
https://openalex.org/W2072648136,Aldosterone in adrenal venous blood of dogs is increased by constriction and decreased by release of constriction of the inferior vena cava. Section of the cervical vagi did not affect the rise of aldosterone but prevented its fall. The receptors for stimuli to increases of aldosterone secretion may not be the same as those for stimuli to decreases.

https://openalex.org/W2082950040,A catheter-type PO2 electrode has been developed which permits the polarographic continuous recording of the blood oxygen tension in vivo. The electrode has been tested in model experiments in vitro and applied in animal experiments lasting several hours. It yielded a continuous tracing of PO2 with good reproducibility.

https://openalex.org/W2017378582,"The routine determination of cesium-137 and potassium-40 content of over 2200 samples was accomplished through utilization of one-fifth of the potential capacity of the Los Alamos human counter. Little change in the cesium-137 concentration in people was observed from 1956 to 1957, in spite of the increase in both the rate and the integrated levels of fallout. The correlation of levels in human beings with cesium levels in milk indicates a discrimination factor of 1.8 in this step of the ecological transfer. Precipitation is shown to be an important factor determining the cesium content of milk, but the lack of complete correlation indicates that a more detailed analysis is necessary. Contamination of the troposphere during periods of weapon testing complicates the interpretation, as do seasonal variations."
https://openalex.org/W2091577203,"Cerebrospinal fluid was assayed for the capacity to contract smooth muscle and for the capacity to develop such activity when incubated with globulin. Activity was observed in fluid collected from patients with inflammatory or degenerative disease of the central nervous system, sustained intracranial vasodilatation, sustained noxious stimulation, or chronic schizophrenia. Control specimens lacked measurable activity."

https://openalex.org/W1543038287,"Pavlov's experiments, begun long before the revolution, have always been generously supported by the Soviet state. However, their far-reaching ontological and methodological implication gained an official and commanding position to Soviet biomedical and psychosocial (as distinct from socioeconomic) sciences only in 1950 with the Resolution of the 28 June-4 July Joint Pavlovian Session of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Academy of Medical Sciences. In the biomedical sciences, present-day Soviet Pavlovianism may best be conceived of as (i) a doctrine of nervism (a Russian term)-the ubiquity of neural control of bodily reactions (neural, neurosomatic, neurovisceral, and neurohumoral) and (ii) a doctrine of what might be called concomitantism (my term )-the ready and radical modification of these reactions by concomitant reactions; or, viewed more generally and somewhat differently, as (iii) a far-reaching physicalistic psychosomaticism or, rather, a neuroviscerosomaticism. Psychophysiology-or higher nervous activity-is the key discipline here. With scores of research institutes, it is indeed a very well-established, wide-scoped, and faradvanced faradvanced science that, in both present achievements and future capabilities, is a challenge to American and Western equivalents. On the other hand, in the psychosocial sciences and the key discipline of psychology proper, unmitigated Pavlovian physicalism and objectivism is met head on by (i) the unbending postulate of dialectical materialism of ""the specific emergent efficacy of consciousness and subjective conscious categories"" as well as by (ii) the simple consideration that a consistent Pavlovianism is a fully autarchic psychology and needs no other science of psychology on top of it. A large portion of current Soviet psychological theory in psychology proper is thus primarily a textual and exegetic collation and conciliation of the views of Pavlov with those of Marx, Engels, and Lenin (until recently and, to some extent even now, also of Stalin), just as most current Soviet psychological experimentation in psychology proper is primarily a duplication of what Soviet psychophysiology could do as well, if not better. Moreover, there is the longstanding drastic ban on intelligence testing, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, and other to-be-shunned ""bourgeois-psychological"" thought-and-practice systems, so that, in all, psychology proper is a much constricted and, per se, more ancilliary than basic discipline of Soviet empirical research-a state of affairs plainly reflected in the fact that the number of its research institutes and publications (as well as the number of psychologists proper) is but a small fraction of the number in psychophysiology. Yet, in evaluating our efforts in the area vis-à-vis those of the Soviets, we must, obviously, take full account of both disciplines, Soviet psychophysiology being in all respects a psychology in American terms (60). Indeed, it is Soviet psychophysiology, and not Soviet psychology proper, that is the homolog not only of American behavioristics but also, to a large extent, of all American experimental psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2053187549,This report describes a method for the stimulation of the ventricular myocardium by transmitting the stimulus over a radio-frequency carrier which is demodulated by a radio receiver enclosed within the animal9s chest. The method can be applied in conjunction with experimental heart block.

https://openalex.org/W2090483142,The lethal effect of x-rays on dividing yeast cells can be decreased by small ultraviolet exposures delivered before or after x-ray exposure. This mitigating action can be decreased by exposure to visible light concomitant with photoreactivation of ultraviolet lethality. The results suggest considerable overlap between x-ray and ultraviolet lethality sites in dividing cells.

https://openalex.org/W2071580011,"Human urinary mucoprotein precipitated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and suspended in distilled water has a light-scattering molecular weight of 2.8 × 106, an intrinsic viscosity of 225, a refractive index increment of 1.73 × 10-4, and an absorption coefficient (E1% 1 cm) of 11.4. The molecule is therefore smaller than that of the mucoprotein isolated by Tamm and Horsfall but retains its biological activity."

The bulk of the radioactivity is shown to be due to radon and its decay products, which result from radioactive decay of radium in the soil and the consequent diffusion of the gaseous radon daughter into the air. Radioactivity due to fission productu amounted to only 1.2 per cent of the radon concentration. (C.H.)"
