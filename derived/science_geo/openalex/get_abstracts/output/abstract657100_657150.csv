https://openalex.org/W3046999841,"Accurate segmentation of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential step in quantifying the changes in brain structure. Deep learning in recent years has been extensively used for brain image segmentation with highly promising performance. In particular, the U-net architecture has been widely used for segmentation in various biomedical related fields. In this paper, we propose a patch-wise U-net architecture for the automatic segmentation of brain structures in structural MRI. In the proposed brain segmentation method, the non-overlapping patch-wise U-net is used to overcome the drawbacks of conventional U-net with more retention of local information. In our proposed method, the slices from an MRI scan are divided into non-overlapping patches that are fed into the U-net model along with their corresponding patches of ground truth so as to train the network. The experimental results show that the proposed patch-wise U-net model achieves a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of 0.93 in average and outperforms the conventional U-net and the SegNet-based methods by 3% and 10%, respectively, for on Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3047234827,"Background Twenty-seven villages were selected in southwest Burkina Faso to implement new vector control strategies in addition to long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). We conducted entomological surveys in the villages during the dry cold season (January 2017), dry hot season (March 2017) and rainy season (June 2017) to describe malaria vectors bionomics, insecticide resistance and transmission prior to this trial. Methods We carried out hourly catches (from 17:00 to 09:00) inside and outside 4 houses in each village using the Human Landing Catch technique. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group were identified using molecular techniques as well as detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection and insecticide resistance target-site mutations. Results Eight Anopheles species were detected in the area. Anopheles funestus s.s was the main vector during the dry cold season. It was replaced by Anopheles coluzzii during the dry hot season whereas An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the dominant species during the rainy season. Species composition of the Anopheles population varied significantly among seasons. All insecticide resistance mechanisms (kdr-w, kdr-e and ace-1 target site mutations) investigated were found in each members of the An. gambiae complex but at different frequencies. We observed early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species. Entomological inoculation rates were 2.61, 2.67 and 11.25 infected bites per human per month during dry cold season, dry hot season and rainy season, respectively. Conclusion The entomological indicators of malaria transmission were high despite the universal coverage with LLINs. We detected early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species as well as physiological insecticide resistance mechanisms. These data will be used to evaluate the impact of complementary tools to LLINs in an upcoming RCT."

We used a patient-centered weighted composite outcome to globally evaluate aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prevention in fracture patients.We conducted an open-label randomized clinical trial of adult patients admitted to an academic trauma center with an operative extremity fracture, or a pelvis or acetabular fracture. Patients were randomized to receive LMWH (enoxaparin 30-mg) twice daily (n = 164) or aspirin 81-mg twice daily (n = 165). The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of bleeding complications, deep surgical site infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death within 90 days of injury. A Global Rank test and weighted time to event analysis were used to determine the probability of treatment superiority for LMWH, given a 9% patient preference margin for oral administration over skin injections.Overall, 18 different combinations of outcomes were experienced by patients in the study. Ninety-nine patients in the aspirin group (59.9%) and 98 patients in the LMWH group (59.4%) were event-free within 90 days of injury. Using a Global Rank test, the LMWH had a 50.4% (95% CI, 47.7-53.2%, p = 0.73) probability of treatment superiority over aspirin. In the time to event analysis, LMWH had a 60.5% probability of treatment superiority over aspirin with considerable uncertainty (95% CI, 24.3-88.0%, p = 0.59).The findings of the Global Rank test suggest no evidence of superiority between LMWH or aspirin for VTE prevention in fracture patients. LMWH demonstrated a 60.5% VTE prevention benefit in the weighted time to event analysis. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance and was similar to the elicited patient preferences for aspirin."
https://openalex.org/W3047607456,"Stem rot, a devastating fungal disease of peanut, is caused by Sclerotium rolfsii. RNA-sequencing approaches have been used to unravel the mechanisms of resistance to stem rot in peanut over the course of fungal infection in resistant (NRCG-CS85) and susceptible (TG37A) genotypes under control conditions and during the course of infection. Out of about 290 million reads, nearly 251 million (92.22%) high-quality reads were obtained and aligned to the Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis genomes with the average mapping of 78.91% and 78.61%, respectively. In total, about 48.6% of genes were commonly regulated, while approximately 21.8% and 29.6% of uniquely regulated genes from A. duranensis and A. ipaensis genomes, respectively, were identified. Several annotated transcripts, such as receptor-like kinases, jasmonic acid pathway enzymes, and transcription factors (TFs), including WRKY, Zinc finger protein, and C2-H2 zinc finger, showed higher expression in resistant genotypes upon infection. These transcripts have a known role in channelizing the downstream of pathogen perception. The higher expression of WRKY transcripts might have induced the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) by the activation of the jasmonic acid defense signaling pathway. Furthermore, a set of 30 transcripts involved in the defense mechanisms were validated with quantitative real-time PCR. This study suggested PAMP-triggered immunity as a probable mechanism of resistance, while the jasmonic acid signaling pathway was identified as a possible defense mechanism in peanut. The information generated is of immense importance in developing more effective ways to combat the stem rot disease in peanut."
https://openalex.org/W3047078790,"Background Diagnostic errors are prevalent and associated with increased economic burden; however, little is known about their characteristics at the national level in Japan. This study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes and indemnity payment in cases of diagnostic errors using Japan’s largest database of national claims. Methods We analyzed characteristics of diagnostic error cases closed between 1961 and 2017, accessed through the national Japanese malpractice claims database. We compared diagnostic error-related claims (DERC) with non-diagnostic error-related claims (non-DERC) in terms of indemnity, clinical outcomes, and factors underlying physicians’ diagnostic errors. Results All 1,802 malpractice claims were included in the analysis. The median patient age was 33 years (interquartile range = 10–54), and 54.2% were men. Deaths were the most common outcome of claims (939/1747; 53.8%). In total, 709 (39.3%, 95% CI: 37.0%–41.6%) DERC cases were observed. The adjusted total billing amount, acceptance rate, adjusted median claims payments, and proportion of deaths were significantly higher in DERC than non-DERC cases. Departments of internal medicine and surgery were 1.42 and 1.55 times more likely, respectively, to have DERC cases than others. Claims involving the emergency room (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.88) and outpatient office (adjusted OR = 2.87) were more likely to be DERC than other cases. The initial diagnoses most likely to lead to diagnostic error were upper respiratory tract infection, non-bleeding digestive tract disease, and “no abnormality.” Conclusions Cases of diagnostic errors produced severe patient outcomes and were associated with high indemnity. These cases were frequently noted in general exam and emergency rooms as well as internal medicine and surgery departments and were initially considered to be common, mild diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3047133221,"Methyl bromide (MB) is a fumigant that has been widely used for killing pests on plants in trade, soils, and structures worldwide due to its excellent permeability and insecticidal effect; however, MB should be replaced because it is an ozone-depleting substance. It is well-known that MB is highly toxic and hazardous to workers, but the effects of exposure in asymptomatic workers have not been explored. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of MB fumigation on the health of fumigators at a sensitive level. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and urinary bromide ion levels of 44 fumigators (the study group) and 20 inspectors (the control) were measured before and after fumigation work from February to August 2019 in Busan, Korea. The mean post-work concentration of bromide ion (18.311 μg/mg CRE) in the fumigators was significantly increased from the pre-work level (7.390 μg/mg CRE) (P<0.001). The fumigator post-work median frequencies (MDF) and alpha-to-theta ratios (ATR) of EEG index were significantly decreased compared to the pre-work values (P<0.05 for all indices). In contrast, there were no significant differences in inspector EEG indices and urinary bromide ion. The urinary bromide ion levels in all the subjects were negatively correlated with MDF (P = 0.032). In conclusion, fumigators’ EEG indices and urinary bromide ion suggested that occupational exposure to MB negatively affected the health of workers, although the workers were asymptomatic."
https://openalex.org/W3047293991,"Work-related stress causes poor quality of nursing care and increases the risk of medical errors. Research evidence is so limited to nurses' work-related stress in eastern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess work-related stress and associated factors among nurses working in governmental hospitals in Harar, Eastern Ethiopia.Institution-based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among 367 nurses from 15th to 30th March, 2015. Simple random sampling technique was applied to recruit study participants. Data were collected using structured self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out. The statistical association was declared using adjusted odds ratio at 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value of less than 0.05.A total of 398 study participants were involved in the study, and the response rate was 92.2% (367/398). More than half of 202(55%) of the participants were males. One third (33.8%, n = 124) of study participants' age ranged between 26 to 34 years. The prevalence of work-related stress in the current study was 66.2%. Nurses, who reared child (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.7), working in intensive care units (AOR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 17.7), work on rotation (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.4), and nurses who had a chronic medical illness (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.7) were significantly associated with nurses' work-related stress.Two-thirds of nurses who were working at government hospitals had work-related stress. Work-related stress was associated with child-rearing, working units, work on rotation, and chronic medical illness. We suggested the hospital's administration, and other concerned stakeholders should design a strategy to undertake necessary measures such as hiring more nurses to minimize workload and rescheduling work shift to alleviate work-related stress among nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3047362025,"Background Access to affordable and good quality medicines is a key to meeting Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 by the year 2030. Prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines have been studied in many developing countries, but no such information has been published about Rwanda yet. This study aimed at providing data on prices, availability and affordability of medicines in different health facilities of Rwanda. Methods A survey was carried out on availability, prices and affordability of 18 medicines in Kigali City and five districts of Rwanda. 44 health facilities were surveyed, including public and faith-based hospitals, public and faith-based health centers and private pharmacies. The standardized methodology developed by WHO and Health Action International (HAI) was used to collect and analyze the data. Findings Prices for generic medicines in public and faith-based health facilities were remarkably low, with median price ratios (MPRs) of 1.0 in comparison to the international procurement prices published by Management Sciences for Health. In private pharmacies, prices were twice as high (MPR = 1.99 for generics). Availability of medicines fell short of the of 80% target set by WHO, but was better than reported from many other developing countries. Availability of medicines was highest in the private sector (71.3%) and slightly lower in the faith-based (62.8%) and public (59.6%) sectors. The government procurement agency was found to work efficiently, achieving prices 30% below the international procurement price given in the International Medical Product Price Guide. Affordability of medicines was better in the public and faith-based sectors than in the private sector. Conclusion In Rwanda, medicines are affordable but poorly available in both the public and the faith-based sectors. Further improvements of the availability of medicines in the public and the faith-based health facilities represent the most important key to increase accessibility and affordability of medicines in Rwanda."
https://openalex.org/W3045260928,"Deep prosthetic hip infection is a devastating complication of hip replacement surgery, and treatment often involves multiple revision surgeries with antibiotic chemotherapy to control the infection. The aim of this study was to explore patients’ experiences of early and longer-term recovery after one-stage or two-stage revision with an excised hip, a temporary cement spacer or a custom-made articulating spacer. We interviewed 32 participants taking part in a surgical trial at two time points (2–4 months and 18 months) following one- or two-stage revision surgery. The analytic approach was inductive using the constant comparative method to generate themes from the data. Participants’ early recovery after revision was characterised by a long hospital stay with burdensome antibiotics and limited physiotherapy provision. Participants undergoing two-stage revision with an excised hip or a cement spacer described severe mobility restrictions which affected all aspects of their lives, while those undergoing one-stage revision, or two-stage revision with an articulating spacer were more mobile and independent, with some limitations. Participants with a cement spacer also reported more pain than other treatment groups, while those with an articulating spacer appeared to perceive that their recovery was slow. At 18 months, participants in all groups described both improvements and losses in mobility and functional ability. Participants in all treatment groups expressed considerable emotional resilience during recovery from revision, which may be linked to opportunities to talk with the trial personnel. Participants identified the need for better information and psychological and physical support. Experience of recovery differs after one- and two-stage revision, and further in relation to the use of spacers. Mobility, function, independence and pain are important aspects of recovery which affect all aspects of day-to-day life. Increased information and more opportunities to talk and share experiences may provide psychological support during recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3046930782,"Open Science is an umbrella term encompassing multiple concepts as open access to publications, open data, open education and citizen science that aim to make science more open and transparent. Citizen science, an important facet of Open Science, actively involves non-scientists in the research process, and can potentially be beneficial for multiple actors, such as scientists, citizens, policymakers and society in general. However, the reasons that motivate different segments of the public to participate in research are still understudied. Therefore, based on data gathered from a survey conducted in Czechia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK (N = 5,870), this study explores five types of incentives that can motivate individuals to become involved in life sciences research. The results demonstrate that men and younger individuals are more persuaded by extrinsic motives (external benefits or rewards), as compared with women and older people, who are driven by intrinsic motives (that originates from within an individual). This paper shows that specific strata of the population are differentially motivated to engage in research, thereby providing relevant knowledge for effectively designing public involvement activities that target various groups of the public in research projects."
https://openalex.org/W3047227150,"To address concerns over plastics in the global environment, this project produced three wood plastics composites (WPCs) which could divert plastics from the waste stream into new materials. The three materials made had a ratio of 85%:15%, 90%:10%, and 95%:5% low density polyethylene (LDPE) to wood powder and were produced using the dissolution method. Physical and mechanical properties of each WPC were evaluated according to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) A 5908:2003. Their degradation in nature was evaluated through a graveyard test and assay test conducted in Coptotermes curvignathus termites. Results showed that density, moisture content, thickness swelling and water absorption of the WPCs fulfilled the JIS standard. The mechanical properties of these composites also met the JIS standard, particularly their modulus of elasticity (MOE). Modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bonding (IB) showed in lower values, depending on the proportion of wood filler they contained. Discoloration of the WPCs was observed after burial in the soil with spectra alteration of attenuated transmission reflectance (ATR) in the band of 500–1000 cm-1 which could be assigned to detach the interphase between wood and plastics. As termite bait, the WPCs decreased in weight, even though the mass loss was comparatively small. Micro Confocal Raman Imaging Spectrometer revealed that termite guts from insects feeding on WPCs contained small amounts of LDPE. This indicated termite can consume plastics in the form of WPCs. Thus WPCs made predominantly of plastics can be degraded in nature. While producing WPCs can assist in decreasing plastics litter in the environment, the eventual fate of the LDPE in termites is still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3047513318,"Objective To describe fatigue in relation to disease-specific and socioeconomic factors and to test possible correlations between fatigue and work impairment, quality of life, pain, sleep, depression, and physical functioning in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Methods A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey collecting patient characteristics such as disease characteristics, socioeconomic factors and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from patients with RA, PsA and axSpA in Denmark. PRO scales included the FACIT-Fatigue sub-scale, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale (WPAI), EuroQol (EQ-5D), Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Respondents were recruited via routine visits to the outpatient rheumatology clinic; information on diagnosis, treatment and disease activity was collected from medical journals by trained nurses. Results 487 patients participated in the study. Fatigue was more present in women, experienced patients, and patients who changed medication in the past 12 months, who were unemployed, who had less education, and who had lower household income. There was no statistically significant difference between mean fatigue in the three diagnostic groups (p = 0.08). Fatigue correlated with all included PROs (Pearson correlation coefficients, p<0.0001). Stratifying for diagnosis and adjusting for socioeconomic factors did not change the conclusion. Conclusion In a stable, representative group of patients with RA, PsA and axSpA, we found significant correlations between fatigue and work impairment, quality of life, pain, sleep, depression and physical functioning. Fatigue cannot be perceived as a single problem, but rather as a symptom that affects broadly."
https://openalex.org/W3047548724,"Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) is a severe disease of increasing incidence. The objective was to analyze whether the outcome of patients with native valve EFIE (NVEFIE) treated with a short course of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone (4wAC) was similar to patients treated according to international guidelines (6wAC). Between January 2008 and June 2018, 1,978 consecutive patients with definite native valve IE were prospectively included in a national registry. Outcomes of patients with NVEFIE treated with 4wAC were compared to those of patients who received 6wAC. Three hundred and twenty-two patients (16.3%) had NVEFIE. One hundred and eighty-three (56.8%) received AC. Thirty-nine patients (21.3%) were treated with 4wAC for four weeks and 70 patients (38.3%) with 6wAC. There were no differences in age or comorbidity. Patients treated 6wAC presented a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis (21 days, IQR 7–60 days vs. 7 days, IQR 1–22 days; p = 0.002). Six patients presented perivalvular abscess and all of these received 6wAC. Surgery was performed on 14 patients (35.9%) 4wAC and 34 patients (48.6%) 6wAC (p = 0.201). In-hospital mortality, one-year mortality and relapses among 4wAC and 6wAC patients were 10.3% vs. 11.4% (p = 0.851); 17.9% vs. 21.4% (p = 0.682) and 5.1% vs. 4.3% (p = 0.833), respectively. In conclusion, a four-week course of AC may be considered as an alternative regimen in NVEFIE, notably in patients with shorter duration of symptoms and those without perivalvular abscess. These results support the performance of a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of this short regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3047181161,"Background Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a significant morbidity in preterm babies. Multiple risk factors for severe ROP have been extensively studied, however, only a few studies have included maternal diabetes mellitus (MDM) in their assessment. ROP and diabetic retinopathy are both retinal vascular diseases in which there is leakage and/or neovascularization from damaged retinal vessels. Diabetes may affect ROP development; however, there are conflicting results on the association between MDM and ROP. Objective To determine if MDM is an independent risk factor for clinically significant ROP (ROP > Stage II) in neonates weighing less than 1500g. Design/Method We conducted a retrospective cohort study of neonates weighing <1500g who were delivered or transferred into our institution from 2007 through 2017. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between severe ROP and MDM. The risks for the different stages of ROP from MDM were compared using chi-square linear trend test. Results We extracted 883 paired maternal-neonatal data. The mean (standard deviation) gestational age and birthweight were 28.5 (2.9) weeks and 1052.7 (300.9) grams, respectively. Of the 883 mothers, 72 (8.2%) had DM. The incidence of ROP and severe ROP was 42.4% (374/883) and 6.5% (57/883) respectively. The odds ratio comparing MDM and severe ROP was 3.47 [95% CI: 1.51–7.96]; p<0.01). Compared to Stage I, the risk of MDM in infants with ROP increased from 1.49 in Stage II ROP to 2.59 in Stages III&IV. Severe ROP was associated with infant steroid use (OR: 5.92 [95% CI: 2.83–12.38]; p <0.01), sepsis (OR: 2.13 [95% CI: 1.09–4.14]; p = 0.03) chorioamnionitis (OR: 1.90 [95% CI: 1.03–3.50]; p = 0.04), and maternal steroid use (OR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.32–0.79]; p<0.01). Conclusion Maternal diabetes is associated with ROP and the strength of association increased with increasing severity of ROP."
https://openalex.org/W3047528901,"Introduction Treatment adherence has been evaluated as a major predictor of long-term outcome, and education has been suggested to improve adherence. Considering the characteristics of adult learners, it is necessary to implement educational programs that meet the needs of transplant patients. Multimedia education may be well-suited for this. This study aims to develop video education materials in accordance with transplant patients’ self-care needs. Methods This study includes a literature review and patient interviews aimed at developing video education materials for the self-care needs of patients who underwent renal transplant surgery at a university hospital in Seoul. Ten patients were interviewed about the desired educational content, accessibility, and other preferences. After verifying the validity of the data, the video scenarios were produced and satisfaction surveys were conducted. Results Eleven self-care education items were identified through interviews with 10 kidney transplant patients. The expert validation of video-based educational content result was high (mean CVI = 0.94). The mean score of the patients’ satisfaction evaluation of the completed 7-minute video instructional materials was also high (4.55 on a 5-point Likert scale). Conclusion Findings indicate that the video education materials will meet the needs of adult learners and mitigate the limitations of the existing education programs by increasing interest and motivation and may contribute to increased treatment adherence and ultimately, positively effect self-care for new transplant patients."
https://openalex.org/W3047303743,"In line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the target for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), state level initiatives to promote health with “no-one left behind” are underway in India. In Kerala, reforms under the flagship Aardram mission include upgradation of Primary Health Centres (PHCs) to Family Health Centres (FHCs, similar to the national model of health and wellness centres (HWCs)), with the proactive provision of a package of primary care services for the population in an administrative area. We report on a component of Aardram’s monitoring and evaluation framework for primary health care, where tracer input, output, and outcome indicators were selected using a modified Delphi process and field tested. A conceptual framework and indicator inventory were developed drawing upon literature review and stakeholder consultations, followed by mapping of manual registers currently used in PHCs to identify sources of data and processes of monitoring. The indicator inventory was reduced to a list using a modified Delphi method, followed by facility-level field testing across three districts. The modified Delphi comprised 25 participants in two rounds, who brought the list down to 23 approved and 12 recommended indicators. Three types of challenges in monitoring indicators were identified: appropriateness of indicators relative to local use, lack of clarity or procedural differences among those doing the reporting, and validity of data. Further field-testing of indicators, as well as the revision or removal of some may be required to support ongoing health systems reform, learning, monitoring and evaluation."

https://openalex.org/W3047004207,"Background Premarital HIV testing is the key entry point in prevention, care, treatment, and support services, in which people learn their HIV status and its implications to make informed decisions about their health. This study was, therefore, conducted to identify factors associated with premarital HIV testing among married women in Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used, and secondary data analysis was done using 2016 Ethiopian demographic health survey (EDHS). Two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was used. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 20. Frequencies and weighted percentage of the variables, and second-order Rao-Scott statistic were computed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to control confounders and to identify predictors of premarital HIV testing. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was considered to declare statistically significant associations. Result The total sample comprised 9602 married women. In this study, the odds of premarital HIV testing were associated with being urban residents (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 2.74–5.20), attended primary education (AOR:1.54; 95%:1.27–1.87), secondary education (AOR:2.34; 95% CI:1.70–3.23), higher education (AOR:2.92; 95% CI:1.90–4.50), access to media (AOR: 1.44; 95% CI:1.20–1.76), being rich (AOR: 1.52; 95%CI:1.12–2.07), andrichest (AOR: 1.67;95%CI:1.15–2.44), known the place of HIV testing (AOR: 4.95; 95% CI:3.44–7.11), discriminatory attitude to PLHIV (AOR: 1.47; 95%CI:1.23–1.76), being khat chewer(AOR: 1.60;95%CI:1.11–2.31), and alcohol drinker (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI:1.27–1.90). Conclusion It is possible to conclude that being urban resident, attending education (primary, secondary, higher), media access, improved wealth index, knowing the places for HIV testing, chewing khat, drinking alcohol, and having discriminatory attitude towards PLHIV were positively associated with premarital HIV testing. The Ethiopian government needs to step up efforts to expand education for all Women. Advancing access to HIV testing for rural women may also increase premarital HIV testing services uptake. Further qualitative researches need to be done to assess the relationship between discriminatory attitude towards PLHIV and premarital HIV testing."
https://openalex.org/W3047144169,"Many factors influence the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we investigated the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and familial history with the 5-year incidence of T2DM in a family-based study conducted in Brazil. T2DM was defined as baseline fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or the use of any hypoglycaemic drug. We excluded individuals with T2DM at baseline or if they did not attend two examination cycles. After exclusions, we evaluated a sample of 1,125 participants, part of the Baependi Heart Study (BHS). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to assess T2DM incident given different characteristics. At the 5-year follow-up, the incidence of T2DM was 6.7% (7.2% men and 6.3% women). After adjusting for age, sex, and education status, the model that combined marital and occupation status, skin color, and familial history of T2DM provided the best prediction for T2DM incidence. Only marital status was independently associated with T2DM incidence. Individuals that remained married, despite having significantly increased their weight, were significantly less likely to develop diabetes than their divorced counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W3047383755,"Gut dysbiosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a growing number of non-communicable diseases. High through-put sequencing technologies and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiling enables surveying of the composition and function of the gut microbiota and provide key insights into host-microbiome interactions. However, a methodological problem with analyzing stool samples is that samples are treated and stored differently prior to submission for analysis potentially influencing the composition of the microbiota and its metabolites. In the present study, we simulated the sample acquisition of a large-scale study, in which stool samples were stored for up to two days in the fridge or at room temperature before being handed over to the hospital. To assess the influence of time and temperature on the microbial community and on SCFA composition in a controlled experimental setting, the stool samples of 10 individuals were exposed to room and fridge temperatures for 24 and 48 hours, respectively, and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, qPCR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the influence of storage time and temperature on the absolute abundance of methanogens, and of Lactobacillus reuteri. The results indicate that values obtained for methanogens, L. reuteri and total bacteria are still representative even after storage for up to 48 hours at RT (20°C) or 4°C. The overall microbial composition and structure appeared to be influenced more by laboratory errors introduced during sample processing than by the actual effects of temperature and time. Although microbial activity was demonstrated by elevated SCFA at both 4°C and RT, SCFAs ratios were more stable over the different conditions and may be considered as long as samples are come from similar storage conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3046525451,"Humanity’s reliance on clean water and the ecosystem services provided makes identifying efficient and effective ways to assess the ecological condition of streams ever more important. We used high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA region to explore relationships between stream microbial communities, environmental attributes, and assessments of stream ecological condition. Bacteria and archaea in microbial community samples collected from the water column and from stream sediments during spring and summer were used to replicate standard assessments of ecological condition performed with benthic macroinvertebrate collections via the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI). Microbe-based condition assessments were generated at different levels of taxonomic resolution from phylum to OTU (Operational Taxonomic Units) in order to understand appropriate levels of taxonomic aggregation. Stream sediment microbial communities from both spring and summer were much better than the water column at replicating BIBI condition assessment results. Accuracies were as high as 100% on training data used to build the models and up to 80% on validation data used to assess predictions. Assessments using all OTUs usually had the highest accuracy on training data, but were lower on validation data due to overfitting. In contrast, assessments at the order-level had similar performance accuracy for validation data, and a reduced subset of orders also performed well, suggesting the method could be generalized to other watersheds. Subsets of the important orders responded similarly to environmental gradients compared to the entire community, where strong shifts in community structure occurred for known aquatic stressors such as pH, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate nitrogen. The results suggest the stream microbes may be useful for assessing the ecological condition of streams and especially useful for stream restorations where many eukaryotic taxa have been eliminated due to prior degradation and are unable to recolonize."
https://openalex.org/W3047009222,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular biomarkers that are pivotal for the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). We analyzed clinical specimens using RNA sequencing to identify the target genes. We found that the expression of HOXC6 mRNA was upregulated with the progression of cancer, which was validated by quantitative real time PCR and RNA in-situ hybridization. To compare the protein expression of HOXC6, we evaluated GC and normal gastric tissue samples using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. We detected significantly higher levels of HOXC6 in the GC tissues than in the normal controls at both mRNA and protein levels. The expression levels of HOXC6 mRNA in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) were significantly higher than those in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high expression of HOXC6 mRNA is significantly associated with poor clinical prognosis. Our findings suggest that HOXC6 mRNA may be a novel biomarker and can be potentially valuable in predicting the prognosis of GC patients. Especially, HOXC6 mRNA in-situ hybridization may be a diagnostic tool for predicting prognosis of individual GC patients."

https://openalex.org/W3047570120,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk which may start even before diagnosis. To explore this CVD risk prior to RA, we determined multiple risk factors and two 10-year clinical risk scores in a cohort of individuals at-risk of RA. We also analyzed associations with arthritis development and autoantibody status and compared a subset of at-risk individuals to an age and sex matched seronegative control group.In a cohort of 555 consecutive arthralgia patients positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) and / or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) we retrospectively identified patients with preclinical arthritis (i.e. those who developed arthritis), and non-arthritis patients (those without arthritis development during maximum 5 years follow up). Demographics, CVD risk factors and the 10-year cardiovascular risk according to the SCORE and QRISK3 system were determined at baseline.Preclinical arthritis patients (n = 188) had a higher heart rate (68 vs 63 bpm, p = 0.048) and lower cholesterol (5.2 mmol/l vs 5.5, p = 0.006), HDL (1.0 mmol/l vs 1.1, p0.003) and ApoB (0.85 g/l vs 0.91, p = 0.011) compared to non-arthritis patients (n = 367). Lipid levels were associated with ACPA status in both the preclinical arthritis and non-arthritis group. Ten-year CVD risk scores did not differ between preclinical arthritis and non-arthritis patients, in total, 7% (SCORE) and 8% (QRISK3) of seropositive arthralgia patients were classified as high risk. Seropositive at-risk patients (n = 71) had higher total cholesterol (5.4 vs 4.9, p<0.001), TC/HDL ratio (4.0 vs 3.0, p<0.001), triglycerides (1.4 vs 1.0, p = 0.001), ApoB (1.0 vs 0.9, p = 0.019) and 10-year risk scores (median SCORE 1.0 vs 0.0, p = 0.030 and median QRISK3 4.4 vs 3.1, p<0.001) compared to seronegative controls.Our results suggest that lipid changes commence prior to RA diagnosis and that ACPAs might play a role."

However, deviations from the original assumptions allow quantum hackers to compromise the system. We present a side channel attack that takes advantage of ventilation holes in optical devices to inject additional photons that can leak information about the secret key. We experimentally demonstrate light injection on an ID~Quantique Clavis2 quantum key distribution platform and show that this may help an attacker to learn information about the secret key. We then apply the same technique to a prototype quantum random number generator and show that its output is biased by injected light. This shows that light injection is a potential security risk that should be addressed during the design of quantum information processing devices."
https://openalex.org/W3046996447,"Introduction Increased level of serum uric acid (SUA) is often considered a risk factor for ischemic stroke. This study was conducted to examine the association of SUA level with ischemic stroke and assessed gender-based differences, if any. Methods In this case-control study, neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke patients were recruited as cases within three days of an incident from neurology in-patient department, and as controls, patients without stroke history were recruited from neurology out-patient department. Blood was collected from the respondents of both groups to assess SUA level, lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test. Binary logistic regression was done for estimating the risks of ischemic stroke. Results A total of 338 participants were recruited, where 169 were cases and 169 were controls. Around 60 percent respondents of both case and control groups were male. Mean SUA levels for cases and controls were 6.03 (SD 1.84) mg/dl and 4.04 (SD 1.46) mg/dl, respectively. After adjustment for age, tobacco consumption status, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and dyslipidemia, elevated SUA level was found to be significantly associated with ischemic stroke only in females (OR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.01–2.19; p<0.05). Overall, each unit increase in SUA level exhibits 25 percent increment in odds of having ischemic stroke (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.02–1.5372; p<0.05). Conclusion This study concluded that elevated SUA level is significantly associated with the acute phase of an ischemic stroke and gender-specific analysis demonstrates this association only in females."
https://openalex.org/W3047131100,"The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a moth pest native to the Western Hemisphere that has recently become a global problem, invading Africa, Asia, and Australia. The species has a broad host range, long-distance migration capability, and a propensity for the generation of pesticide resistance traits that make it a formidable invasive threat and a difficult pest to control. While fall armyworm migration has been extensively studied in North America, where annual migrations of thousands of kilometers are the norm, migration patterns in South America are less understood. As a first step to address this issue we have been genetically characterizing fall armyworm populations in Ecuador, a country in the northern portion of South America that has not been extensively surveyed for this pest. These studies confirm and extend past findings indicating similarities in the fall armyworm populations from Ecuador, Trinidad-Tobago, Peru, and Bolivia that suggest substantial migratory interactions. Specifically, we found that populations throughout Ecuador are genetically homogeneous, indicating that the Andes mountain range is not a long-term barrier to fall armyworm migration. Quantification of genetic variation in an intron sequence describe patterns of similarity between fall armyworm from different locations in South America with implications for how migration might be occurring. In addition, we unexpectedly found these observations only apply to one subset of fall armyworm (the C-strain), as the other group (R-strain) was not present in Ecuador. The results suggest differences in migration behavior between fall armyworm groups in South America that appear to be related to differences in host plant preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3047171195,"The susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in offspring could be reduced prior to birth through maternal intervention, before and during pregnancy. We evaluated whether the initiation periods of maternal exercise in preconception and pregnancy periods induce beneficial effects in the adult male offspring. Thirty-two female rats were divided into control and exercise groups. The exercise groups involve exercise before pregnancy or the preconception periods, exercise during pregnancy, and exercise before and during pregnancy. The mothers in the exercise groups were run on the treadmill in different periods. Then the birth weight and weekly weight gain of male offspring were measured, and the blood and left ventricle tissue of samples were collected for analysis of the Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) and insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-2) gene expression, serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol (Cho), and triglycerides (TG). There was no significant difference in the birth weight of offspring groups (P = 0.246) while maternal HIIT only during pregnancy leads to reduce weekly weight gain of offspring. Our data showed that Sirt6 and IGF-2 gene expression was increased (P = 0.017) and decreased (P = 0.047) by maternal exercise prior to and during pregnancy, respectively. Also, the serum level of LDL (p = 0.002) and Cho (P = 0.007) were significantly decreased and maternal exercise leads to improves the running speed of the adult male offspring (p = 0.0176). This study suggests that maternal HIIT prior to and during pregnancy have positive intergenerational consequence in the health and physical readiness of offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3047448393,"CD154 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition to CD40, soluble CD154 (sCD154) binds to other receptors namely αIIbβ3, αMβ2, α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins. We have previously reported that binding of sCD154 to α5β1 integrin expressed on several human T cell lines is capable of inhibiting Fas-induced cell death. In the current study, we show that such effect of the sCD154/α5β1 interaction is not restricted to the cell death response induced by Fas but could also be exhibited toward other death signals such as TRAIL and TNF- α. We also demonstrate that sCD154 is capable of inhibiting Fas-mediated death of human activated T cells, more importantly of CD4+ than CD8+ T ones. Our data also show that membrane-bound CD154 and α5β1 integrin expressed on the surface of distinct cells failed to influence cell death responses. However, when membrane-bound CD154 and α5β1 are expressed on the surface of same cell, their interaction was capable of down regulating cell death. CD154 was shown to co-localize with the α5β1 integrin on the surface of these cells. These data strongly suggest a cis-type of interaction between CD154 and α5β1 when both are expressed on the same cell surface, rather than a trans-interaction which usually implicates the ligand and its receptor each expressed on the surface of a distinct cell. Taken together, these findings add to the list of roles through which CD154 is contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune-inflammatory diseases, i.e. by protecting T cells from death and enhancing their survival."
https://openalex.org/W3047508809,"The existing literature fails to identify to which extent the utilization of social media could be relevant for increasing the effectiveness of knowledge management, in respect to overall business operations. In order to shed some light on this area we define three goals. Firstly, we investigate to what extent the different activities of clients on social media (SM), are important to the processes of knowledge management (KM) in companies. Secondly, we examine to what extent KM functions can be relevant in attaining the quality of IT services. Thirdly, we analyze to what extent KM mediates between SM and the quality of IT services, that is, which client activities on SM should be formalised in the form of KM processes so as to influence the quality of IT services. In order to asses these goals, the decision tree method was used at the sample of B2B companies, more specifically at the sample of those companies offering Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS). The study has shown that: (i) SM client activities have the largest importance for building efficient KM; (ii) KM functions are relevante to the overall quality of IT services, and (iii) those SM options and activities have been identified, whose importance for the assessment of the quality of IT services is indirectly transmitted through KM. This paper offers new empirical evidence which can lead to a better understanding of the role of KM in KIBS. Thanks to the obtained findings, managers will be able to define the goals of their companies in relation to the utilization of SM, more specifically: their presentation on SM, monitoring the outcomes of the SM, usage improving their KM practices and, thus, define strategies to increase the quality of the IT services they offer."
https://openalex.org/W3046380902,"The EGFR-targeting cancer therapies are commonly facing drug resistance, mostly due to mutations. Gene therapy with artificial microRNA targeting EGFR conserved sequence may avoid such problem. In this study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus expressing EGFR-targeting artificial microRNA and active revCASP3 (Ad-EC), under the control of tumor-specific SLPI promoter, and evaluated its inhibitory effect on HEP-2 cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. MTT assay showed that cell growth inhibition rate at 72h was 44.0% in Ad-EC group at MOI 50, while the rate was 7.7% in the control virus Ad-GFP group and 3.6% in Cetuximab (500 μg/ml) group respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the late apoptotic cells rate was 36.1% in Ad-EC group, significantly higher than 6.5% of Ad-GFP group (p < 0.001). When Ad-EC (MOI 50) was combined with CDDP (0.25 μg/ml), late apoptotic cells rate increased to 61.2%, significantly higher than each monotherapy group (P < 0.001). The real-time xCELLigence system recorded an effective cell growth inhibition in Ad-EC and CDDP groups, and more enhanced effect in Ad-EC plus CDDP group. Western blot revealed that Ad-EC could inhibit the activation of AKT pathway and ERK1/2 pathway, while Cetuximab had the AKT pathway over-activated. In vivo experiments with HEP-2 xenograft in nude mice confirmed the tumor inhibition in Ad-EC, CDDP and Ad-EC plus CDDP groups compared with PBS group (P < 0.01). Collectively, these data support the effective inhibition of cancer cells by this novel gene therapy strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3047066898,"Spectral ripple discrimination (SRD) has been widely used to evaluate the spectral resolution in cochlear implant (CI) recipients based on its strong correlation with speech perception performance. However, despite its usefulness for predicting speech perception outcomes, SRD performance exhibits large across-subject variabilities even among subjects implanted with the same CIs and sound processors. The potential factors of this observation include current spread, nerve survival, and CI mapping. Previous studies have found that the spectral resolution reduces with increasing distance of the stimulation electrode from the auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), attributable to increasing current spread. However, it remains unclear whether the spread of excitation is the only cause of the observation, or whether other factors such as temporal interaction also contribute to it. In this study, we used a computational model to investigate channel interaction upon non-simultaneous stimulation with respect to the electrode–ANF distance, and evaluated the SRD performance for five electrode–ANF distances. The SRD performance was determined based on the similarity between two neurograms in response to standard and inverted stimuli and used to evaluate the spectral resolution in the computational model. The spread of excitation was observed to increase with increasing electrode–ANF distance, consistent with previous findings. Additionally, the preceding pulses delivered from neighboring channels induced a channel interaction that either inhibited or facilitated the neural responses to subsequent pulses depending on the electrode–ANF distance. The SRD performance was also found to decrease with increasing electrode–ANF distance. The findings of this study suggest that variation of the neural responses (inhibition or facilitation) with the electrode–ANF distance in CI users may cause spectral smearing, and hence poor spectral resolution. A computational model such as that used in this study is a useful tool for understanding the neural factors related to CI outcomes, such as cannot be accomplished by behavioral studies alone."

Study outcomes were death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, assessed using national registers until 2012. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of outcomes according to diabetes status, educational level, and income.During follow-up, 13,231 individuals died, 9981 were diagnosed with diabetes, 4431 with myocardial infarction, and 4433 with ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for diabetes versus no diabetes: mortality 1.57 (1.50-1.65), myocardial infarction 1.24 (1.14-1.34), and ischemic stroke 1.17 (1.07-1.27).

https://openalex.org/W3047434319,"The purpose of this study was to quantify training loads (TL) of high intensity sessions through original methods (TRIMP; session-RPE; Work-Endurance-Recovery) and their updated alternatives (TRIMPcumulative; RPEalone; New-WER). Ten endurance athletes were requested to perform five sessions until exhaustion. Session 1 composed by a 800m maximal performance and four intermittent sessions performed at the 800m velocity, three sessions with 400m of interval length and work:recovery ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 and one with 200m intervals and 1:1. Total TL were quantified from the sessions’ beginning to the cool-down period and an intermediate TL (TL800) was calculated when 800m running was accumulated within the sessions. At the end of the sessions high and similar RPE were reported (effect size, η2 = 0.12), while, at the intermediate 800m distance, the higher interval distances and work:recovery ratios the higher the RPE (η2 = 0.88). Our results show marked differences in sessions’ total TL between original (e.g., lowest TL for the 800m and highest for the 200m-1:1 sessions) and alternative methods (RPEalone and New-WER; similar TL for each session). Differences appear in TL800 notably between TRIMP and other methods which are negatively correlated. All TL report light to moderate correlations between original methods and their alternatives, original methods are strongly correlated together, as observed for alternative methods. Differences in TL quantification between original and alternative methods underline that they are not interchangeable. Because of high exercise volume influence, original methods markedly enhance TL of sessions with higher exercise volumes although these presented the easiest interval distances and work-recovery ratios. Alternative methods based on exhaustion level (New-WER) and exertion (RPEalone) provided a new and promising point of view of TL quantification where exhaustion determines the highest TL whatever the exercise. This remains to be tested with more extended populations submitted to wider ranges of exercises."
https://openalex.org/W3047553468,"Background Continuous intrapartum fetal monitoring is challenging and its clinical benefits are debated. The project evaluated whether short-term-variation (STV) and other computerised fetal heart rate (FHR) parameters (baseline FHR, long-term-variation, accelerations and decelerations) predicted acidaemia at birth. The aims of the study were to assess the changes in FHR pattern during labour and determine the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial by reporting the practicalities of using the monitoring device, participant recruitment, data collection and staff training. Methods 200 high-risk women carrying a term singleton, non-anomalous fetus, requiring continuous FHR monitoring in labour were consented to participate from the Jessop Wing maternity unit, Sheffield, UK. The trans-abdominal fetal ECG monitor was placed as per clinical protocol. During the monitoring session, clinicians were blinded to the computerised FHR parameters. We analysed the last hour of the FHR and its ability to predict umbilical arterial blood pH <7.20 using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves. Results Of 200 women, 137 cases were excluded as either the monitor did not work from the onset of labour (n = 30), clinical staff did not return or used the monitor on another patient (n = 37), umbilical cord blood not obtained (n = 25), FHR data not recorded within an hour of birth (n = 34) and other reasons (n = 11). In 63 cases included in the final analysis, the computer-derived FHR parameters did not show significant correlation with umbilical artery cord pH <7.20. Labour was associated with a significant increase in short and long term variation of FHR and number of deceleration (P<0.001). However, baseline FHR decreased significantly before delivery (P<0.001). Conclusions The project encountered a number of challenges, with learning points crucial to informing the design of a large study to evaluate the potential place of intrapartum computerised FHR parameters, using abdominal fetal ECG monitor before its clinical utility and more widespread adoption can be ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W3047596157,"Objective The aim of this study is to assess network-based weight loss interventions in the Chinese setting using agent-based simulation. Methods An agent-based model incorporating social, environmental and personal influence is developed to simulate the obesity epidemic through an interconnected social network among a population of 2197 individuals from the nationally representative survey. Model parameters are collected from literature and existing database. To ensure the robustness of our findings, the model is validated against empirical observations and sensitivity analyses are performed on calibrated parameters. Results When compared with the baseline model, significant weight difference is detected using paired samples t tests for network-based intervention strategies (p<0.05) but no difference is observed for the two conventional intervention strategies including choosing random or high-risk individuals (p>0.05). Targeting the most connected individuals minimizes the average population weight, average BMI, and generates a reduction of 2.70% and 1.38% in overweight and obesity prevalence. Conclusions The simulations shows that targeting individuals on the basis of their social network attributes outperforms conventional targeting strategies. Future work needs to focus on how to further leverage social networks to curb obesity prevalence and enhance interventions for other chronic conditions using agent-based simulation."
https://openalex.org/W3046969704,"Some monocotyledonous plants, including liliaceous, amaryllidaceous and iridaceous ones, produce flowers with petaloid tepals in whorls 1 and 2 organs. For explaining the molecular mechanism of two-layered petaloid tepal development, the modified ABC model has been proposed, in which B class genes are expressed in whorl 1 organs as well as in whorls 2 and 3 organs. We have previously obtained results strongly support the modified ABC model by chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T)-mediated suppression of B function in the liliaceous plant Tricyrtis sp. In the present study, we introduced a CRES-T construct derived from the B class gene of Tricyrtis sp. (TrihDEFa-SRDX) into Lilium sp. in order to examine the effect of suppressing B function on the floral organ identity. Flowers of transgenic plants did not open fully and had pale pink-colored tepals with decreased numbers of papillae on the adaxial side in whorls 1 and 2 compared with those of non-transgenic plants. No apparent morphological alterations were observed in whorls 3 and 4 organs. Both the amount of total anthocyanins and the expression levels of endogenous flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes (LhMYB12, LhbHLH2, LhCHS, LhF3H, LhF3'H, LhDFR and LhANS) decreased in whorls 1 and 2 organs of transgenic plants compared with non-transgenic plants. In addition, the expression levels of endogenous B class genes (LFDEF, LFGLOA and LFGLOB) decreased in transgenic plants and the level was negatively correlated with the degree of morphological alteration. Thus suppression of B function may reduce the identity of petaloid tepals in whorls 1 and 2 of transgenic Lilium sp."

Given the interest in imaging biomarkers for short- to medium-term studies, we aimed to assess which imaging metrics might best represent functional impairment for monitoring in clinical trials. Given the complexity of functional impairment in MS, however, it is useful to isolate a particular functionally relevant pathway to understand the relationship between imaging and neurological function. We therefore analyzed existing data, combining multiparametric MRI and OCT to describe MS associated visual impairment. We assessed baseline data from fifty MS patients enrolled in ReBUILD, a prospective trial assessing the effect of a remyelinating drug (clemastine). Subjects underwent 3T MRI imaging, including Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), myelin content quantification, and retinal imaging, using OCT. Visual function was assessed, using low-contrast letter acuity. MRI and OCT data were studied to model visual function in MS, using a partial, least-squares, regression analysis. Measures of neurodegeneration along the entire visual pathway, described most of the observed variance in visual disability, measured by low contrast letter acuity. In those patients with an identified history of ON, however, putative myelin measures also showed correlation with visual performance. In the absence of clinically identifiable inflammatory episodes, residual disability correlates with neurodegeneration, whereas after an identifiable exacerbation, putative measures of myelin content are additionally informative."
https://openalex.org/W3047438577,"The sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis, Fabricius, 1794) is a devastating pest that causes millions of dollars of losses each year to sugarcane producers by reducing sugar and ethanol yields. The control of this pest is difficult due to its endophytic behavior and rapid development. Pest management through biotechnological approaches has emerged in recent years as an alternative to currently applied methods. Genetic information about the target pests is often required to perform biotechnology-based management. The genomic and transcriptomic data for D. saccharalis are very limited. Herein, we report a tissue-specific transcriptome of D. saccharalis larvae and a differential expression analysis highlighting the physiological characteristics of this pest in response to two different diets: sugarcane and an artificial diet. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and a de novo assembly was generated. A total of 27,626 protein-coding unigenes were identified, among which 1,934 sequences were differentially expressed between treatments. Processes such as defence, digestion, detoxification, signaling, and transport were highly represented among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Furthermore, seven aminopeptidase genes were identified as candidates to encode receptors of Cry proteins, which are toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis used to control lepidopteran pests. Since plant-insect interactions have produced a considerable number of adaptive responses in hosts and herbivorous insects, the success of phytophagous insects relies on their ability to overcome challenges such as the response to plant defences and the intake of nutrients. In this study, we identified metabolic pathways and specific genes involved in these processes. Thus, our data strongly contribute to the knowledge advancement of insect transcripts, which can be a source of target genes for pest management."

We defined the stages of follow-up difficulty based on four follow-up surveys on non-respondents of longitudinal mail surveys in community-dwelling older adults to examine the main factors associated with the stages of follow-up difficulty. We conducted a follow-up mail survey (FL1) with respondents of a baseline survey, and three more follow-up surveys with the non-respondents of each previous survey: simplified mail (FL2), postcard (FL3), and home visit surveys (FL4). The respondents of each follow-up survey were defined as a stage of follow-up difficulty; their characteristics concerning social participation and interaction at baseline in each stage were analyzed. The number of respondents in the FL1, FL2, FL3, and FL4 stages and non-respondents (NR) were as follows: 2,361; 462; 234; 84; and 101, respectively. Participation in hobby groups in FL2 and FL3, sports groups in FL4, and neighborhood association and social isolation in NR were significantly associated with the stage of follow-up difficulty. Based on these results, we conclude that the following factors are associated with each stage of follow-up difficulty: 1) a decline in instrumental activities of daily living in the FL2 and FL3 stages, 2) dislike for participating in physical activity such as sports in the FL4 stage, and 3) social isolation, not even belonging to a neighborhood association due to low social interaction in the NR group."
https://openalex.org/W3046952294,"Element bioaccessibility consists of the fraction of the element that is mobilized from food matrices into digestive extractants. The degree of bioaccessibility of a toxic metal is a fundamental consideration in estimating its bioavailability. In addition, gaining a better understanding of the essential elements released into the gastro intestinal fluids allows a more thorough assessment of the health benefits of food matrices in the field of nutrition science. In the present study, an in vitro digestion model simulating gastro-intestinal digestion (GID) was used to investigate the bioaccessibility of stable elements in mixed leaf salad and 210Po in various foods (meat, seafood, vegetables). The simulation was carried out over three phases: after a pre-treatment with a saliva solution, raw and cooked seafood samples were subjected to a complete simulated gastrointestinal digestion (gastric digestion followed by bile-pancreas digestion). The 210Po bioaccessibility was found to range from 16.2±9.39% to 62.8±17.7% and from 6.26±2.15% to 67.5±13.1% for raw and cooked food respectively. Moreover, bioaccessibility could not be determined for As, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Hg, La, Pb, Sb, Sn, Te, Th, Tl, Ti, U. It proved to be poor (1–16%) for Al, Fe and S; fair (40–50%) for Cu, P, and Si; and high (>50%) for Ba, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Rb, Sr, Zn. The results show that bioaccessibility varies according to the chemical form of the element in the food as well as the matrix composition."
https://openalex.org/W3047129140,"The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) assesses Thwarted Belongingness (TB) and Perceived Burdensomeness (PB), two predictors of suicidal thoughts. Up to now, the use of item response theory (IRT) for the evaluation of the INQ has been restricted to a single study with clinically depressed and suicidal youth. Therefore, the psychometric properties of the two INQ-15-subscales TB and PB were now evaluated in a general population sample (N = 2508) and a clinical adult population sample (N = 185) using IRT, specifically the Rasch model (RM) and the graphical log-linear Rasch model (GLLRM). Of special interest was whether the INQ-subscales displayed differential item functioning (DIF) across the two different samples and how well the subscales were targeted to the two sample populations. For the clinical sample, fit to a GLLRM could be established for the PB-subscale and fit to a RM was established for a five-item version of the TB-subscale. In contrast, for the general population sample fit to a GLLRM could only be achieved for the PB-subscale. Overall, there was strong evidence of local dependence (LD) across items and of some age- and gender-related DIF. Both subscales exhibited massive DIF related to the sample, indicating that they don't work the same across the general population and clinical sample. As expected, targeting of both INQ-subscales was much better for the clinical population. Further investigations of the INQ-15 under the Rasch approach in a large clinical population are recommended to determine and optimize the scale performance."
https://openalex.org/W3047375566,"Background Until 2011, stockouts of family planning commodities were common in Senegalese public health facilities. Recognizing the importance of addressing this problem, the Government of Senegal implemented the Informed Push Model (IPM) supply system, which involves logisticians to collect facility-level stock turnover data once a month and provide contraceptive supplies accordingly. The aims of this paper were to evaluate the impact of IPM on contraceptive availability and on stockout duration. Methods and findings To estimate the impact of the IPM on contraceptive availability, stock card data were obtained from health facilities selected through multistage sampling. A total number of 103 health facilities pertaining to 27 districts and nine regions across the country participated in this project. We compared the odds of contraceptive stockouts within the health facilities on the 23 months after the intervention with the 18 months before. The analysis was performed with a logistic model of the monthly time-series. The odds of stockout for any of the five contraceptive products decreased during the 23 months post-intervention compared to the 18 months pre-intervention (odds ratio, 95%CI: 0.34, 0.22–0.51). To evaluate the impact of the IPM on duration of stockouts, a mixed negative binomial zero-truncated regression analysis was performed. The IPM was not effective in reducing the duration of contraceptive stockouts (incidence rate ratio, 95%CI: 0.81, 0.24–2.7), except for the two long-acting contraceptives (intrauterine devices and implants). Our model predicted a decrease in stockout median duration from 23 pre- to 4 days post-intervention for intrauterine devices; and from 19 to 14 days for implants. Conclusions We conclude that the IPM has resulted in greater efficiency in contraceptive stock management, increasing the availability of contraceptive methods in health facilities in Senegal. The IPM also resulted in decreased duration of stockouts for intrauterine devices and implants, but not for any of the short-acting contraception (pills and injectables)."
https://openalex.org/W3047411375,"The relationship between mood states and state creativity has long been investigated. Exploring individual differences may provide additional important information to further our understanding of the complex mood-creativity relationship. The present study explored the state-level mood-creativity relationship from the perspective of trait creativity. We employed the experience sampling method (ESM) in a cohort of 56 college students over five consecutive days. The participants reported their state creativity on originality and usefulness dimensions at six random points between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., along with a 10-item concurrent mood state report. Their trait creativity was measured by the Guildford Alternative Uses Test (AUT) and the Remote Associates Test (RAT). We found moderating effects of the participants' trait creativity on their state-level mood-creativity relationship. Specifically, whereas the positive correlation between positive mood state and originality of state creativity was stronger for the participants with higher AUT flexibility scores, stronger positive correlations between negative mood state and originality of state creativity were observed for individuals with higher AUT originality scores. Our findings provide evidence in support of introducing individual differences to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the mood-creativity link. The results could be of practical value, in developing individualized mood state regulation strategies for promoting state creativity."
https://openalex.org/W3047468606,"Production of IFN-γ is a key innate immune mechanism that limits replication of intracellular bacteria such as Francisella tularensis (Ft) until adaptive immune responses develop. Previously, we demonstrated that the host cell types responsible for IFN-γ production in response to murine Francisella infection include not only natural killer (NK) and T cells, but also a variety of myeloid cells. However, production of IFN-γ by mouse dendritic cells (DC) is controversial. Here, we directly demonstrated substantial production of IFN-γ by DC, as well as hybrid NK-DC, from LVS-infected wild type C57BL/6 or Rag1 knockout mice. We demonstrated that the numbers of conventional DC producing IFN-γ increased progressively over the course of 8 days of LVS infection. In contrast, the numbers of conventional NK cells producing IFN-γ, which represented about 40% of non-B/T IFN-γ-producing cells, peaked at day 4 after LVS infection and declined thereafter. This pattern was similar to that of hybrid NK-DC. To further confirm IFN-γ production by infected cells, DC and neutrophils were sorted from naïve and LVS-infected mice and analyzed for gene expression. Quantification of LVS by PCR revealed the presence of Ft DNA not only in macrophages, but also in highly purified, IFN-γ producing DC and neutrophils. Finally, production of IFN-γ by infected DC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Notably, IFN-γ production patterns similar to those in wild type mice were observed in cells derived from LVS-infected TLR2, TLR4, and TLR2xTLR9 knockout (KO) mice, but not from MyD88 KO mice. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the pivotal roles of DC and MyD88 in IFN-γ production and in initiating innate immune responses to this intracellular bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W3046809865,"Single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 (SSBP2) is ubiquitously expressed, with several studies reporting it to be a tumor suppressor. We investigated SSBP2 expression and its clinicopathological significance in gastric cancer. SSBP2 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 539 gastric cancer sections. The cases were divided into three subtypes, namely, Epstein–Barr virus-associated (EBV), microsatellite unstable, and others (microsatellite stable and EBV negative), based on the molecular classification of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cases were also divided into two subgroups according to the amplification status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Most cases showed SSBP2 positivity, and only 24 (4.5%) cases displayed negative nuclear expression. Loss of nuclear expression correlated significantly with high pT category (P = 0.001), nodal metastasis (P = 0.002), and stage of progression (P = 0.005), with no correlation between molecular characteristics and SSBP2 expression. All HER2 amplification cases displayed positive SSBP2 expression. Negative SSBP2 cases showed significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to positive SSBP2 cases (P = 0.008). Loss of nuclear expression of SSBP2 was significantly associated with shorter RFS in the microsatellite stable and EBV negative groups (P = 0.002), as well as the HER2 negative group (P = 0.007). However, there were no statistically significant differences in multivariate analyses. Loss of nuclear expression of SSBP2 was a poor prognostic factor, associated with stage of progression and recurrence, and showed no significant difference in molecular characteristics, including TCGA subtype and HER2 status."
https://openalex.org/W3047066849,"Many circumstantial evidences from human and animal studies suggest that complement cascade dysregulation may play an important role in pregnancy associated complications including preeclampsia. Deletion of rodent specific complement inhibitor gene, Complement Receptor 1-related Gene/Protein y (Crry) produces embryonic lethal phenotype due to complement activation. It is not clear if decreased expression of Crry during pregnancy produces hypertensive phenotype. We downregulated Crry in placenta by injecting inducible lentivialshRNA vectors into uterine horn of pregnant C57BL/6 mice at the time of blastocyst hatching. Placenta specific downregulation of Crry without significant loss of embryos was achieved upon induction of shRNA using an optimal doxycycline dose at mid gestation. Crry downregulation resulted in placental complement deposition. Late-gestation measurements showed that fetal weights were reduced and blood pressure increased in pregnant mice upon downregulation of Crry suggesting a critical role for Crry in fetal growth and blood pressure regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3047381714,"The aim of this study was to compare underwater fin swimming performance using dolphin, flutter and breaststroke kicks with and without diving gear. Performance was evaluated in terms of average swimming velocity. The parameters of spatiotemporal structure of the stroke reflecting to the swimming economy were employed. Conscious modifications in propulsion technique were considered here with the aim of controlling swimming performance. A total of ten professional scuba divers swam at maximal speed underwater for 50m using each of three techniques: dolphin, flutter, or breaststroke kicks. Swimmers' performance was compared between holding their breath and using breathing apparatus. Two cameras recorded their movements in sagittal and transverse planes. The average swimming velocity (vav), stroke length (SL), stroke rate (SR), index of variation of intracycle velocity (VIVIndex) and stroke index (SI) were estimated. Relative to the other techniques, the dolphin kick without a diving gear demonstrated the highest vav and low SI and VIVIndex values, which reflects the most advantageous economy of propulsion at given velocity. Given the lack of statistical differences, using the breaststroke kick and flutter kick when swimming with a diving gear seems to be comparable to dolphin-kick in terms of average velocity and parameters reflecting the economy of propulsion. Thus, a search for fin swimming techniques with the aim of achieving specific goals seemed reasonable. The results suggest, that performance achieved while using various fin swimming techniques was probably controlled by different strategies of leg movements. These strategies revealed differences in a spatiotemporal (SR-SL) structure of the stroke and they were closely associated in terms of the velocity variation decrease."
https://openalex.org/W3047463240,"Modeling real-life transportation problems usually require the simultaneous incorporation of different variants of the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP). The periodic VRP (PVRP) is a classical extension in which routes are determined for a planning period of several days and each customer has an associated set of allowable visit schedules. This work proposes a unified model framework for PVRP that consists of multiple attributes or variants not previously addressed simultaneously, such as time-windows, time-dependence, and consistency -which guarantees the visits to customer by the same vehicle-, together with three objective functions that respond to the needs of practical problems. The numerical experimentation is focused on the effects of three factors: frequency, depot centrality, and the objective function on the performance of a general-purpose MILP solver, through the analysis of the achieved relative gaps. Results show higher sensitivity to the objective functions and to the problem sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3046900792,"PIERCE1, p53 induced expression 1 in Rb null cells, is a novel p53 target involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle in mice. These facts prompted us to study the function of PIERCE1 with respect to p53-associated pathophysiology of cancer in humans. Unexpectedly, PIERCE1 did not respond to overexpression and activation of p53 in humans. In this study, we swapped p53 protein expression in human and mouse cells to find the clue of this difference between species. Human p53 expression in mouse cells upregulated PIERCE1 expression, suggesting that p53-responsive elements on the PIERCE1 promoter are crucial, but not the p53 protein itself. Indeed, in silico analyses of PIERCE1 promoters revealed that p53-responsive elements identified in mice are not conserved in humans. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses confirmed p53 enrichment against the PIERCE1 promoter region in mice, not in human cells. To complement the p53 study in mice, further promoter analyses suggested that the human PIERCE1 promoter is more similar to guinea pigs, lemurs, and dogs than to rodents. Taken together, our results confirm the differential responsiveness of PIERCE1 expression to p53 due to species differences in PIERCE1 promoters. The results also show partial dissimilarity after p53 induction between mice and humans."
