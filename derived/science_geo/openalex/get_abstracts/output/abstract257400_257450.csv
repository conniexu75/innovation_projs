https://openalex.org/W2068973408,"Histone lysine methylation has been linked to the recruitment of mammalian DNA repair factor 53BP1 and putative fission yeast homolog Crb2 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but how histone recognition is achieved has not been established. Here we demonstrate that this link occurs through direct binding of 53BP1 and Crb2 to histone H4. Using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that, despite low amino acid sequence conservation, both 53BP1 and Crb2 contain tandem tudor domains that interact with histone H4 specifically dimethylated at Lys20 (H4-K20me2). The structure of 53BP1/H4-K20me2 complex uncovers a unique five-residue 53BP1 binding cage, remarkably conserved in the structure of Crb2, that best accommodates a dimethyllysine but excludes a trimethyllysine, thus explaining the methylation state-specific recognition of H4-K20. This study reveals an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism of targeting DNA repair proteins to DSBs by direct recognition of H4-K20me2."
https://openalex.org/W1966735041,"Pre-mRNAs undergo splicing to remove introns, and the spliced mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Here we investigated the mechanism for recruitment of the conserved mRNA export machinery (TREX complex) to mRNA. We show that the human TREX complex is recruited to a region near the 5′ end of mRNA, with the TREX component Aly bound closest to the 5′ cap. Both TREX recruitment and mRNA export require the cap, and these roles for the cap are splicing dependent. CBP80, which is bound to the cap, associates efficiently with TREX, and Aly mediates this interaction. Together, these data indicate that the CBP80-Aly interaction results in recruitment of TREX to the 5′ end of mRNA, where it functions in mRNA export. As a consequence, the mRNA would be exported in a 5′ to 3′ direction through the nuclear pore, as observed in early electron micrographs of giant Balbiani ring mRNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1966963462,"The Drosophila immune system discriminates between various types of infections and activates appropriate signal transduction pathways to combat the invading microorganisms. The Toll pathway is required for the host response against fungal and most Gram-positive bacterial infections. The sensing of Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by the pattern recognition receptors PGRP-SA and GNBP1 that cooperate to detect the presence of infections in the host. Here, we report that GNBP3 is a pattern recognition receptor that is required for the detection of fungal cell wall components. Strikingly, we find that there is a second, parallel pathway acting jointly with GNBP3. The Drosophila Persephone protease activates the Toll pathway when proteolytically matured by the secreted fungal virulence factor PR1. Thus, the detection of fungal infections in Drosophila relies both on the recognition of invariant microbial patterns and on monitoring the effects of virulence factors on the host."
https://openalex.org/W1996984611,"Helicases use the energy derived from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to unwind double helices in essentially every metabolic pathway involving nucleic acids. Earlier crystal structures have suggested that DNA helicases translocate along a single-stranded DNA in an inchworm fashion. We report here a series of crystal structures of the UvrD helicase complexed with DNA and ATP hydrolysis intermediates. These structures reveal that ATP binding alone leads to unwinding of 1 base pair by directional rotation and translation of the DNA duplex, and ADP and Pi release leads to translocation of the developing single strand. Thus DNA unwinding is achieved by a two-part power stroke in a combined wrench-and-inchworm mechanism. The rotational angle and translational distance of DNA define the unwinding step to be 1 base pair per ATP hydrolyzed. Finally, a gateway for ssDNA translocation and an alternative strand-displacement mode may explain the varying step sizes reported previously.

Finally, a gateway for ssDNA translocation and an alternative strand-displacement mode may explain the varying step sizes reported previously. The discovery of DNA double helix immediately presented the challenge of separating the intertwined strands for replication. DNA helicases were first isolated and characterized in the 1970s as DNA-dependent ATPases (Abdel-Monem et al., 1977Abdel-Monem M. Chanal M.C. Hoffmann-Berling H.

They are implicated in processes ranging from replication to translation (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

Horz W. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In a broad sense, helicases can be viewed as motor proteins that translocate along double- or single-stranded nucleic acids. Based on sequence analysis, helicases have been grouped into six families: three superfamilies (SF1 to 3), two small families (Rho and DnaB-like), and a branch in the AAA+ family (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E.

UvrD, originally known as DNA helicase II in E. coli (Hickson et al., 1983Hickson I.D. Arthur H.M. Bramhill D. Emmerson P.T. The E. coli uvrD gene product is DNA helicase II.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is the founding member of SF1 and unwinds DNA in the 3′→ 5′ direction (Matson and George, 1987Matson S.W. George J.W.

UvrD plays a critical role in replication, recombination, and repair of ultraviolet (UV) damage and mismatched base pairs (Arthur and Lloyd, 1980Arthur H.M. Lloyd R.G.

SF1 and SF2 members are distinct from other helicases by sharing seven conserved sequence motifs (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

A new superfamily of replicative proteins.Nature. 1988; 333: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These motifs are involved in nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding and are located at the interface between two RecA-like domains in the structures of PcrA, Rep, and RecBCD of SF1 and RecG, RecQ, UvrB, eIF4A, Swi2/SNF2, and viral NS3 helicases of SF2 (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein D.A.

The crystal structures of a UvrD homolog, PcrA, complexed with DNA-SO42− or DNA-AMPPNP (an ATP analog) (Velankar et al., 1999Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Crystal structures of complexes of PcrA DNA helicase with a DNA substrate indicate an inchworm mechanism.Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) showed that (1) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binds across the surface of the two RecA-like domains (1A and 2A), (2) 1A and 2A rotate toward each other when bound to ATP and open up after ATP hydrolysis, and (3) with the domain movement PcrA translocates along the ssDNA like an inchworm with alternating tight and loose interactions at two contact point. Structures of the Rep and NS3 helicases reveal a similar arrangement of the ATP-binding domains and single-stranded nucleic acid (Kim et al., 1998Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R.

Major domain swiveling revealed by the crystal structures of complexes of E. coli Rep helicase bound to single-stranded DNA and ADP.Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of PcrA (Dillingham et al., 2000Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Demonstration of unidirectional single-stranded DNA translocation by PcrA helicase: measurement of step size and translocation speed.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) support the structural finding that the step size of ssDNA translocation is one nucleotide advanced per ATP hydrolyzed. Despite extensive biochemical and structural characterization of SF1 and other helicases, the mechanism for unwinding a DNA or RNA duplex remains highly controversial. To unwind a double helix, contacts between the helicase and the duplex region of DNA and a rotational movement are likely required in addition to ssDNA translocation, but no DNA rotation has yet been detected. PcrA and Rep helicases contain domains 1B and 2B in addition to 1A and 2A. Domain 2B of PcrA, which undergoes an ∼150° rotation upon binding to a double- and single-stranded (ds-ss) DNA junction and transforms the helicase from an “open” to “closed” state (Movie S1), has been shown to be essential for duplex binding and unwinding in solution (Soultanas et al., 2000Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Uncoupling DNA translocation and helicase activity in PcrA: direct evidence for an active mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3799-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the PcrA-DNA-AMPPNP cocrystal structure, the dsDNA is contacted by domains 1B and 2B, but the base pairs adjacent to the ds-ss junction are disrupted, and in the PcrA-DNA-SO42− structure this portion of the dsDNA is disordered (Velankar et al., 1999Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Crystal structures of complexes of PcrA DNA helicase with a DNA substrate indicate an inchworm mechanism.Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The protein-dsDNA contact was therefore proposed to melt duplex and facilitate ssDNA translocation (Soultanas et al., 2000Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Uncoupling DNA translocation and helicase activity in PcrA: direct evidence for an active mechanism.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3799-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, when domain 2B is deleted in the homologous Rep helicase, the mutant Rep retains helicase activity both in vitro and in vivo (Cheng et al., 2002Cheng W. Brendza K.M. Gauss G.H. Korolev S. Waksman G. Lohman T.M. The 2B domain of the Escherichia coli Rep protein is not required for DNA helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16006-16011Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Structurally, the 2B domain can assume open or closed conformations when Rep is bound to a ssDNA (Korolev et al., 1997Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Major domain swiveling revealed by the crystal structures of complexes of E. coli Rep helicase bound to single-stranded DNA and ADP.Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These differences highlight not only the puzzling role of the 2B domain but also the absence of a complete model of how DNA duplex is unwound. Furthermore, although PcrA is functional as a monomer, single-turnover kinetic studies of UvrD suggest that a dimeric form is required for DNA unwinding (Maluf et al., 2003Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. A Dimer of Escherichia coli UvrD is the active form of the helicase in vitro.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 913-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Finally, with different types of kinetic assay and data analysis, different values of step size (defined as the number of base pairs unwound and translocated per ATP hydrolyzed) have emerged, varying from 1 to 6 bp for a given helicase (Ali and Lohman, 1997Ali J.A.

Even with the simplified ssDNA translocation analyses of monomeric UvrD, step sizes of 2 and 4 were reported by a single group (Fischer et al., 2004Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M.

Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego2003: 304-364Google Scholar). We have determined at atomic resolution ten crystal structures of UvrD-DNA complexes, which represent three distinct ATP hydrolysis states: (1) binary complexes with or without a bound SO42−, (2) ternary complexes with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMPPNP), and (3) ternary complexes with an ATP hydrolysis intermediate (ADP·MgF3). Each ds-ss DNA junction is bound by one UvrD monomer, and each structural state presents different interactions between UvrD and the single- and double-stranded regions of DNA. Together they reveal a previously unknown unidirectional rotation and translation of dsDNA and a gateway for ssDNA translocation. The structures and accompanying functional studies lead to the proposal of a combined wrench-and-inchworm mechanism for DNA unwinding by UvrD at the step size of 1 base pair. E. coli UvrD was crystallized with multiple self-complementary oligonucleotides that form 18 to 28 base pair (bp) duplexes flanked by 3′, 7 nucleotide (nt) overhangs and, in some instances, 5′, 1 nt overhangs (Figure S1). In each case, the crystallographic asymmetric units were composed of one such DNA and two bound UvrD monomers, one at each ds-ss junction. Crystals of UvrD-DNA binary complexes (28 bp + 7 nt), UvrD-DNA-AMPPNP (1 nt + 18 bp + 7 nt), and the UvrD-DNA-ADP·MgF3 ternary complexes (18 bp + 7 nt) diffracted X-rays to 3.0, 2.6, and 2.2 Å, respectively, the highest resolution structures determined thus far for helicase-DNA complexes (Figure 1 and Table 1). Residues 1–646 of UvrD, the entire duplex region of DNA, and the first 5 or 6 nt from the ds-ss junction are modeled in each structure. Residues 647–662 of UvrD form random coils but are often traceable in the ternary complex structures. In all UvrD-DNA cocrystal structures, the two UvrD molecules in an asymmetric unit are essentially identical, with rmsd's of all Cα atoms varying between 0.3 and 0.5 Å. In addition, each reaction state was observed in multiple crystal lattices to verify that a particular conformation is independent of crystal packing (Figure S1). The differences between the binary and two ternary complexes are substantial (Figure 1).Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsSulfate-Bound FormNt-FreeAMPPNPADP·MgF3Data CollectionSpace groupP21212P212121P21P21Resolution (Å)aValues for the highest resolution shell are indicated in parentheses.50–2.9 (3.00–2.90)50–3.0 (3.11–3.00)50–2.6 (2.69–2.6)50–2.2 (2.28–2.2)Completeness (%)aValues for the highest resolution shell are indicated in parentheses.99.2 (92.5)87.0 (57.9)89.7 (51.5)93.5 (63.0)RmergeaValues for the highest resolution shell are indicated in parentheses., bRmerge = ∑h∑i|I(h)i − <I(h)>|/ ∑h∑iI(h)i, where I(h) is the intensity of reflection h, ∑h is the sum over all reflections, and ∑i is the sum over i measurements of reflection h.8.8 (58.4)7.7 (46.9)6.1 (20.6)6.8 (29.3)I / σ(I)aValues for the highest resolution shell are indicated in parentheses.21.7 (2.17)22.8 (2.56)23.3 (4.1)30.1 (2.67)RefinementUnique reflections48,03737,49461,012102,202Protein + DNA atoms10,81511,48410,96911,214Metal + Solvent atoms8723182577R-factor (Rfree) (%)aValues for the highest resolution shell are indicated in parentheses., cR factor = ∑||Fo| − |Fc||/∑|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes.

Open table in a new tab UvrD shares 42% sequence identity with PcrA and 37% with Rep. Like these two SF1 helicases, UvrD contains four structural domains 1A (1–89, 215–280 aa), 1B (90–214 aa), 2A (281–377, 551–647 aa), and 2B (378–550 aa) and adopts the closed conformation observed for the PcrA-DNA complexes (Velankar et al., 1999Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Crystal structures of complexes of PcrA DNA helicase with a DNA substrate indicate an inchworm mechanism.Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Domains 1A and 2A form the core of the helicase responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Figure 1). The ds-ss DNA junction associated with each UvrD molecule assumes the “L” shape, and the duplex and single-stranded portions are roughly orthogonal to each other. The 3′-ssDNA tail is bound across domains 1A and 2A at their interface with 1B and 2B. Domains 1B and 2B interact with the DNA duplex along one side, covering 14 bp in the ternary complexes or 16 bp in the binary complexes (Figure 1). When the duplex is only 18 bp in length as in the AMPPNP ternary complexes, the central 10 bp are sandwiched between two noncontacting UvrD molecules (Figure S1A). Surprisingly, all DNA duplexes bound to UvrD are fully base paired and in regular B form with no sign of melting or distortion. The seven sequence motifs (I, Ia, II–VI) (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Helicases: amino acid sequence comparisons and structure—function relationships.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Motifs Ia, III, and V are also involved in ssDNA binding. In addition to these eight motifs and motif IVa reported to be unique in SF1 (Korolev et al., 1998Korolev S. Yao N. Lohman T.M. Weber P.C.

Comparisons between the structures of HCV and Rep helicases reveal structural similarities between SF1 and SF2 super-families of helicases.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we have identified seven new sequence motifs conserved among UvrD homologs including yeast Srs2. They are Ib, Ic, Id, IVb, IVc, Va, and VIa (Figure 2A). These conserved residues participate in DNA binding or domain 1B and 2B interactions (Figure 2B). The unprecedented high resolution of the UvrD structures allows examination of the atomic details of ATP binding- and hydrolysis-induced protein and DNA movement. The ATP analog, AMPPNP, is bound in the cleft between domains 1A and 2A (Figure 2). The adenine base is sandwiched between Y283 (motif IV) and R37 (motif I) and is specifically selected by Q14 (Q motif) through bifurcated hydrogen bonds. GTP does not support helicase activity (Figure S2) (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. DNA helicases.Annu. Rev.

The 3′ OH of the ribose is hydrogen bonded to E566 (motif V), but the 2′ OH is only weakly hydrogen bonded to R37, which explains why UvrD can use both ATP and dATP (Figure S2) (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers, 1990Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. DNA helicases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Four basic residues, K35 (motif I or Walker A), R73 (Ia), R284 (IV), and R605 (VI), coordinate the triphosphate moiety, in particular the γ phosphate (Figure 2C). A single Mg2+ ion essential for ATP hydrolysis is coordinated directly by the β and γ phosphates and T36 (I), and by D220 and E221 (motif II or Walker B) through water. E221 is also well positioned to serve as a general base to deprotonate the water molecule that is oriented by Q251 (III) for the in-line nucleophilic attack (Figure 2C). Substitutions of the equivalent of Q251 in PcrA resulted in reduced ATPase activity (Dillingham et al., 1999Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Site-directed mutagenesis of motif III in PcrA helicase reveals a role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to strand separation.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the attempt to crystallize UvrD-DNA-ADP complexes, we fortuitously made ADP·MgF3 complexes after NaF was added to improve the crystal growth. NaF reacted with MgCl2 and ADP in the crystallization solution and formed ADP·MgF3, which produced the best diffracting crystals of UvrD-DNA complexes (Table 1; Figure S1). MgF3 mimics the planar structure of the pentacovalent phosphate in the transition state, and the distances between the Mg (P mimic) and the apical oxygen atoms (attacking and leaving groups) are 1.9–2.0 Å (Figure 2D). MgF3 is believed to form a more authentic transition state analog than AlF(x) or BeF(x), of which x is either 3 or 4 (Graham et al., 2002Graham D.L. Lowe P.N. Grime G.W. Marsh M. Rittinger K.

The arrangement of UvrD and DNA in the AMPPNP versus the ADP·MgF3 bound state is almost identical except for the linkers between domains 2A and 2B and the 3′ end of ssDNA (see details later). AMPPNP binding induces an ∼20° rotation between domain 2A and the remaining three domains (1A, 1B, and 2B), and the distance between the respective centers of mass is reduced by 3.3 Å (Figure 3). Domains 1A and 1B are linked by a shared hydrophobic core, and domains 1B and 2B by salt bridges (K389 to D115 and R396 to D118). These three domains of UvrD move as one unit (Figure S3). In contrast, the movement of domain 2B in PcrA is uncoupled from that of domains 1A and 1B (Velankar et al., 1999Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Crystal structures of complexes of PcrA DNA helicase with a DNA substrate indicate an inchworm mechanism.Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The fully ordered dsDNA in the UvrD structures likely stabilizes the 2B domain and 2B-1B interactions (Figure 1). Local structural changes between the binary and ternary complexes also occur in the ATP-binding loops and the loops that contact DNA. After ATP hydrolysis, the domain rotation is presumably reversed during release of ADP and Pi. The domain rotation axis passes through the Cα of W256 (motif III, located at the 1A and 2A interface) and is 15 Å from the helical axis of dsDNA at an ∼25° angle (Figure 3). The domain movement in UvrD is coupled with the directional movement of the DNA duplex. Three helix-loop-helix (HLH) structures emanating from domain 2B (α2-α3, α4-α5, and α7-α8) alternately contact each DNA strand in the duplex, and the N terminus of the second helix of each HLH is in close contact with the DNA backbone (Figure 4A). The first HLH (2B-α2-α3), which contains the PxxGIGxxT sequence (motif IVc or GIG), is conserved among UvrD homologs (Figure 2A). The backbone amide groups of the two Gly's form tight hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the first Gly of GIG is replaced by Glu in Rep (Figure 2A), and Rep binds duplex DNA poorly (Myong et al., 2005Myong S. Rasnik I. Joo C. Lohman T.M. Ha T. Repetitive shuttling of a motor protein on DNA.Nature. 2005; 437: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Near the ds-ss junction, a fourth HLH from domain 1B (α2-α3) is in van der Waals contact with both DNA strands in the minor groove (Figure 4A). Upon AMPPNP binding, the duplex moves with domains 1A/1B/2B toward 2A. The movement includes a 3.3 Å translation and an ∼20° left-handed rotation that untwists the double helix (Figure 1, Figure 3). At the ds-ss junction, a β hairpin (614–626 aa, motif VIa) in the 2A domain, which we call the separation pin, buttresses the end of the duplex. Y621 on its tip forms a π ring stack with the first base pair (−1) of the DNA duplex in the binary complex (Figure 4C). When pressed against the separation pin in the AMPPNP or ADP·MgF3 ternary complexes, the −1 base pair becomes unpaired (Movie S2), and the side chain of Y621 rotates to a vertical position as if to facilitate the newly unpaired base to flip out (Figure 4D). As the −1 bp is unpaired, the number of base pairs between the GIG motif and separation pin is reduced from 10 to 9 in the ternary complexes (Figure 1, Figure 4). Upon binding of AMPPNP, the first three nucleotides of the existing 3′ ssDNA (numbered +1 onward from the ds-ss junction) retain the same positions as in the binary complexes, so the newly unpaired base (−1) on this strand bulges out (Figure 1, Figure 5). The −1 nt on the partner strand is disordered. The +1 to +3 nt interact extensively with domains 2A (M584, R355, H560) and 1A (Y254 and W256 of motif III) (Figure 5A). Since W256 intersects the domain rotation axis, it remains immobile throughout the ATPase cycle. W256 stacks with the bases of the +1 and +2 nt and buttresses the +3 base (Figure 5A). Motif III, which is essential for the helicase activity (Dillingham et al., 1999Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wigley D.B.

We propose that through dynamic remodeling of ubiquitin chains, proteasomes actively regulate substrate commitment to degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system mediates the breakdown of most short-lived regulatory proteins, and in this way it controls many aspects of cell physiology. A central element of this system, the proteasome, is also its most complex, with over 30 distinct integral subunits (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The proteasome degrades substrates within its core particle (CP or 20S particle), which is a barrel-shaped assembly of 670 kDa whose hollow interior houses multiple proteolytic sites. Protein substrates reach this interior chamber through a gated channel, guided by the regulatory particle (RP, 19S, or PA700), which is a complex of ∼1 MDa. The RP recognizes the substrate-bound ubiquitin chain, unfolds the substrate, and directs its translocation into the CP. The need for an unfolding step owes to the narrow cross-section of the channel leading to the CP (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Critical components of the RP include ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes, and six ATPases that have been implicated in substrate unfolding and translocation. Recent work has shown that factors associated with the proteasome via loose, often salt-labile interactions play important roles in regulating its function (Schmidt et al., 2005Schmidt M. Hanna J.

UBL-UBA proteins, for example, help to deliver specific ubiquitin conjugates to the proteasome (Verma et al., 2004Verma R. Oania R. Graumann J. Deshaies R.J.

Among the most abundant proteasome-associated proteins of S. cerevisiae are two enzymatic factors: Ubp6, a deubiquitinating enzyme, and Hul5, a ubiquitin-protein ligase (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S.

Ubp6 is one of two deubiquitinating enzymes within the proteasome; in contrast, a much larger number of ubiquitin ligases (nine) have been suggested to interact with the proteasome, including Ubr1, Ufd4, the APC, and the SCF (Xie and Varshavsky, 2000Xie Y.

Proteasome-associated proteins: regulation of a proteolytic machine.Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, Hul5 is the only ligase observed on proteasomes in amounts high enough to be visible by conventional protein staining (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B.

Hul5 is evolutionarily conserved, and its likely mammalian ortholog, KIAA10, also associates with proteasomes (You and Pickart, 2001You J. Pickart C.M.

Different HECT domain ubiquitin ligases employ distinct mechanism of polyubiquitin chain synthesis.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study we report genetic and biochemical characterization of Hul5. hul5 null mutants are deficient in protein degradation, but, unlike typical ubiquitin ligase mutants, they do not show highly substrate-specific defects in degradation. Rather, the hul5 phenotype more closely resembles that of a partial proteasome loss-of-function mutant. In vitro, Hul5 endows proteasomes with a potent ubiquitin-ligase activity, which can extend unanchored multiubiquitin chains or ubiquitin chains bound to a proteolytic substrate such as cyclin B. Ubiquitin chain extension by Hul5 is strongly stimulated by proteasomes, suggesting that proteasomes are a principal site of ubiquitination by Hul5. Ubiquitin groups added to proteasome-bound target proteins by Hul5 can be efficiently removed by Ubp6. These and other observations imply that Hul5 and Ubp6 function in opposition with one another. We suggest that by maintaining and extending ubiquitin chains on proteasome-bound substrates, Hul5 stabilizes proteasome-substrate interactions and promotes protein breakdown. To test for a role of Hul5 in proteasome function, we examined the effects of deleting the HUL5 gene on the rates of turnover of several short-lived proteins. Substantial stabilization of the transcriptional activator Gcn4 was observed in hul5Δ mutants (Figure 1A). This effect could be complemented by a HUL5 gene carried on a low copy-number CEN plasmid. The HECT-domain ligases, of which Hul5 is a member, form covalent thiolester adducts with ubiquitin as a required step in conjugation. When the adduct-forming cysteine 878 of Hul5 was substituted with alanine, complementation was no longer observed in the Gcn4 degradation assay (Figure 1A). In contrast to Gcn4, the transcriptional repressor α2 was not noticeably stabilized in the hul5Δ mutant (data not shown). However, defects in protein degradation can be compensated for by upregulation of proteasome levels (London et al., 2004London M.K. Keck B.I. Ramos P.C. Dohmen J.R.

Rpn4 is a transcription factor that is degraded by the proteasome and that activates transcription of proteasome subunit genes (Xie and Varshavsky, 2001Xie Y. Varshavsky A. RPN4 is a ligand, substrate, and transcriptional regulator of the 26S proteasome: a negative feedback circuit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Commun. 2004; 321: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). rpn4Δ mutants show reduced proteasome levels and an inability to upregulate proteasome subunit synthesis when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is challenged. In strains lacking Rpn4, we found that turnover of α2 was significantly affected by deletion of HUL5 (Figure 1B). It is possible that for α2, ubiquitin conjugation is normally rate limiting for degradation; by deleting RPN4, proteasome function is attenuated and becomes partially rate limiting, so that underlying defects in proteasome function become more apparent. Targets of the N-end rule pathway are well-studied model substrates of the proteasome (Varshavsky, 1996Varshavsky A. The N-end rule: functions, mysteries, uses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The Trp1 protein was converted into an N-end rule substrate by fusing it to ubiquitin, with a lysine placed adjacent to the ubiquitin C terminus to allow recognition by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A strain bearing this construct grew slowly in the absence of exogenous tryptophan but was Trp+ when UBR1 was deleted (Figure 1C). Hul5 appeared to promote degradation of the Ub-K-Trp1 fusion protein, because deletion of the HUL5 gene conferred a growth advantage to this strain in the absence of tryptophan (Figure 1C). As seen with Gcn4, this function of Hul5 required its active site cysteine (Figure 1C). Cycloheximide chase analysis confirmed that Ub-K-Trp1 and a comparable reporter, Ub-K-Ura3, were stabilized by deletion of HUL5 (Figure 1D). In summary, the stabilization of a range of substrates in hul5Δ mutants implies that Hul5 serves a general function at the proteasome. The defects in protein degradation in hul5Δ mutants appear to be more general than expected for a ubiquitin-protein ligase since ubiquitin ligases tend to be highly substrate specific. The results above, taken together with our earlier finding that Hul5 associates with proteasomes (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), suggested that Hul5 may stimulate the breakdown of multiple proteins by promoting their ubiquitination at the proteasome. To test whether Hul5 can mediate ubiquitination of proteasome-bound proteins, we incubated affinity-purified proteasomes with biotinylated ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and ATP. Proteasomes converted free ubiquitin into conjugates with surprising efficiency (Figure 2A). When purified from hul5Δ mutants, however, proteasomes were virtually devoid of this activity. Thus, although previous studies have indicated that other ligases can bind proteasomes with some affinity, this simple assay for ligase activity is specific for Hul5. Furthermore, the role of Hul5 in the proteasome's ubiquitin ligase activity is direct since proteasomes bearing a catalytically inactive form of Hul5, Hul5-C878A, were comparable to those of hul5Δ in their conjugation deficiency (Figure 2A). The selective detection of Hul5 activity may reflect that it is present on proteasomes at higher levels than other ligases in our preparations (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In addition, we suggest that the assay preferentially detects Hul5 because it is unique among proteasome-associated ligases in the nature or breadth of its substrate specificity. Proteasomes are associated with deubiquitinating activity as well as ubiquitin ligase activity. An integral subunit of the proteasome, Rpn11, removes ubiquitin chains en bloc from conjugates, apparently cutting at the substrate-proximal end of the chain (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J.

A second proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme is Ubp6, a proteasome-associated protein (Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J.

While cleavage by Rpn11 is coupled to substrate degradation (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J.

A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the activity of Ubp6 is not; on the contrary Ubp6 can inhibit degradation (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). When the conjugate-synthesis assay was carried out using ubp6Δ proteasomes, both the yield of conjugates and their average molecular weight increased significantly (Figure 2A), suggesting that conjugates synthesized by Hul5 can be substrates of Ubp6. To test this possibility, we prepared conjugates using ubp6Δ proteasomes, then quenched further conjugate synthesis by depleting ATP. Upon addition of purified Ubp6, we observed nearly complete elimination of high molecular weight conjugates by 30 min, while in the absence of Ubp6 these conjugates persisted for at least 90 min (Figure 2B, right panel). Thus, conjugates formed by Hul5 on the proteasome are favorable substrates for Ubp6. For the model substrates shown above to be stabilized in a hul5Δ mutant (Figure 1), E3 requirements have previously been defined, so it is unlikely that Hul5 could serve as a major E3 for these proteins (Meimoun et al., 2000Meimoun A.

If not an E3, Hul5 could function as a member of a rarer and more recently recognized group of ubiquitin ligases known as E4 enzymes, which are defined as specialized mediators of ubiquitin chain elongation (Koegl et al., 1999Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S.

A series of ubiquitin binding factors connects CDC48/p97 to substrate multiubiquitylation and proteasomal targeting.Cell. 2005; 120: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, an E4 enzyme should not modify a protein unless it has been previously ubiquitinated through the action of an E3. To test whether Hul5 can elongate preformed ubiquitin chains, we purified Hul5 (Figure S2) and assayed its ubiquitin-ligase activity using tetraubiquitin chains (Ub4) as substrate. These chains were efficiently elongated in a reaction mixture that included E1, E2, Hul5, and proteasomes, but not when Hul5 was omitted (Figure 3A). Also required for this reaction was the proteasome holoenzyme. These data suggest that Hul5 can serve as an E4, and that its enzymatic activity is stimulated by proteasomes, just as for Ubp6 (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The E4 model assumes that tetraubiquitin is being used as a ubiquitin acceptor rather than a donor in these conjugation reactions. This assumption was confirmed through biochemical analysis of the product conjugates. Tetraubiquitin carries a free C-terminal carboxylate group and therefore can, like ubiquitin, be activated by E1 and subsequently be donated to substrates. The “tetraubiquitin donor” model, an alternative to the E4 model, predicts that the conjugates produced by Hul5 lack a ubiquitin-derived C-terminal carboxylate; that is, they are conventional ubiquitin-protein conjugates rather than free chains. However, isopeptidase T, which is specific for free ubiquitin chains, digested the Hul5 reaction products readily (Figure 3B). Thus, tetraubiquitin plays an acceptor role in these conjugation reactions, consistent with the E4 model in which Hul5 extends chains. The predominant donor in these reactions appears to be free ubiquitin, which is supplied in excess (Figure S3). Proteins are thought to be targeted to the proteasome principally by Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, when tested with single-lysine ubiquitin derivatives, Hul5 formed chains more efficiently on Lys63 than on Lys48 (Figure 3C). To confirm the linkage preference of Hul5, we used mass spectrometry to map the linkage site on chains formed with wild-type (WT) ubiquitin. This analysis revealed a strong preference for the formation of Lys63 linkages (Figure 3D). Thus, Hul5 has the capacity to build chains with heterogeneous ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages. Hul5 can build off Lys48-linked chains, but in vitro it produces mainly Lys63 linkages. Whether this apparent chain specificity represents a functionally significant parameter for Hul5 in vivo remains to be assessed. The ability of Hul5 to promote protein degradation in vivo suggests that Hul5 should be able to extend ubiquitin chains on defined degradative substrates. We tested this using cyclin B, a highly unstable protein. Cyclin B was expressed in insect cells, complexed to Cdc2, purified, and ubiquitinated by the APC ligase (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The resulting conjugates are degraded almost to completion within 5 min by ubp6Δ proteasomes (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Ubp6, when added to such proteasomes, progressively trims the ubiquitin chains of cyclin B. Since the APC modifies cyclin B extensively, the conjugates do not run far into the gel, making it difficult to detect further chain extension. We therefore used Ubp6 to reduce the extent of cyclin B ubiquitination (Figure 3E, compare lanes 2 and 7) while suppressing cyclin B degradation with the proteasome inhibitor PS341 and blocking Rpn11-mediated deubiquitinating activity with o-phenanthroline. After 20 min of Ubp6-dependent processing, Hul5 was added, resulting in efficient addition of ubiquitin groups to the cyclin B conjugate (Figure 3E). Importantly, Hul5 was inactive on cyclin B that had not been ubiquitinated by the APC (Figure 3E, lane 6), indicating that Hul5 does not function as an E3 for cyclin B, but rather as an E4. Although Figure 3E shows that Hul5 acts preferentially on previously ubiquitinated cyclin B, it does not show that Hul5 elongates pre-existing ubiquitin chains on cyclin B. Alternatively, Hul5 might conjugate ubiquitin to lysine residues of cyclin B. According to the E4 model, the ubiquitin chains on cyclin B should both target the conjugate to Hul5 and provide the acceptor lysine residues for further ubiquitination. The latter possibility was tested by preparing ubiquitin cyclin B conjugates with mutant ubiquitin lacking Lys48 and Lys63, the two lysines that Hul5 preferentially utilizes for chain extension. Unlike Hul5, the APC can utilize Lys11 in addition to Lys48 and Lys63, and Lys48 is not required for in vitro degradation of ubiquitinated cyclin B by ubp6Δ proteasomes (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Conjugates lacking Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains were also degraded by purified yeast proteasomes (ubp6Δ) with an efficiency close to that of conjugates synthesized with WT ubiquitin (data not shown). However, when Hul5 was challenged with such conjugates in the presence of WT free ubiquitin as a donor, it failed to catalyze significant ubiquitination (Figure 3F). These results imply that Hul5 elongates preformed ubiquitin chains on cyclin B, as expected of an E4 enzyme. To examine how Hul5 might promote proteasome function in vivo, we searched for endogenous ubiquitin conjugates that were hypoubiquitinated in the hul5Δ mutant. Ubiquitin was expressed in a 6-histidine-tagged form, and total cellular conjugates were isolated by Ni-NTA-affinity chromatography under nondenaturing conditions and in the presence of proteasome inhibitor. The eluates were subjected to mass spectrometry and to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to various proteins in experiments to be reported more fully elsewhere. Most notably, proteasome subunit Rpn10 was observed via this enrichment procedure to be extensively modified by ubiquitination (Figure 4A). Rpn10 was seen to be modified in both the WT and hul5Δ samples, but species bearing more than four ubiquitin groups were much reduced in hul5Δ samples (Figure 4A). Thus, Hul5 may act as an E4 for Rpn10 in vivo. The observation of Rpn10 ubiquitination led us to examine its turnover. Surprisingly, Rpn10 is an unstable protein and undergoes Hul5-dependent degradation (Figure 4B). Thus, ubiquitin chain extension by Hul5 appears to promote degradation of this novel proteasome substrate. We next assayed Hul5 E4 activity on oligo-ubiquitinated Rpn10. We performed conjugation assays with WT and hul5Δ proteasomes in the presence of a chromatographic fraction (fraction 8; see Supplemental Data) that was active in forming oligo-ubiquitinated Rpn10. Fraction 8, prepared from a hul5Δ strain, catalyzed oligo-ubiquitination of Rpn10 by means of a yet uncharacterized E3. When this reaction was supplemented with hul5Δ proteasomes, Rpn10 conjugates did not exceed four ubiquitin moieties (Figure 4C, lane 5), as found for endogenous Rpn10 conjugates recovered from hul5Δ cells (Figure 4A, right lane). In contrast, incubations with WT proteasomes produced strong polyubiquitination of Rpn10 (Figure 4C, lane 10). Proteasome inhibitor PS341 dramatically increased the accumulation of high-molecular-weight conjugates (Figure 4C, compare lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that this pool of conjugates includes degradative intermediates of Rpn10. Thus, formation of long conjugates by Hul5 is apparently linked to Rpn10 proteolysis in vitro, as observed in vivo in Figures 4A and 4B. Affinity-purified proteasomes are associated with ubiquitin conjugates, probably substoichiometrically (Chen and Madura, 2002Chen L. Madura K. Rad23 promotes the targeting of proteolytic substrates to the proteasome.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Elsasser et al., 2004Elsasser S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26817-26822Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The presence of these conjugates could reflect their capture by the proteasome as well as conjugate synthesis at the proteasome. Suggestive of the latter possibility, proteasome-associated conjugates were severely reduced in abundance in hul5Δ mutants, and their apparent molecular weights were likewise strongly reduced (Figure 5A). Analysis of proteasome-associated species by two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE (Figure 5A, right panels) and by mass spectrometry (data not shown) indicated that they we"

A key question in the field is whether neurotoxicity is mediated by aberrant, novel interactions with the expanded protein or whether its wild-type functions are augmented to a deleterious degree. We examined soluble protein complexes from mouse cerebellum and found that the majority of wild-type and expanded ATXN1 assembles into large stable complexes containing the transcriptional repressor Capicua. ATXN1 directly binds Capicua and modulates Capicua repressor activity in Drosophila and mammalian cells, and its loss decreases the steady-state level of Capicua. Interestingly, the S776A mutation, which abrogates the neurotoxicity of expanded ATXN1, substantially reduces the association of mutant ATXN1 with Capicua in vivo. These data provide insight into the function of ATXN1 and suggest that SCA1 neuropathology depends on native, not novel, protein interactions.

SCA1 (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1) is one of nine unrelated genes in which expansion of a glutamine-encoding triplet repeat causes a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease. Despite broad expression of polyglutamine proteins, distinct subsets of neurons are vulnerable in each disease. Genetic studies have shown that expansion of the polyglutamine tract confers a toxic gain of function (Duyao et al., 1995Duyao M.P. Auerbach A.B. Ryan A. Persichetti F. Barnes G.T. McNeil S.M. Ge P.

Genet. 1995; 11: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The nature of this gain of function has, however, remained mysterious. While it is clear that polyglutamine tract expansion alters the conformation of soluble mutant proteins and decreases protein solubility leading to aggregation (Ross and Poirier, 2004Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar), there is considerable debate as to the biophysical and biochemical state of the disease protein that renders it neurotoxic and the mechanism that leads to selective neuronal vulnerability in each of these disorders. Emerging data reveal that neurotoxicity is modulated by the context of the polyglutamine expansion. For example, the S776A mutation of polyglutamine-expanded ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) prevents the ataxia and neurodegeneration caused by expression of the SCA1 disease protein in mouse Purkinje cells (Emamian et al., 2003Emamian E.S.

Likewise, in Huntington disease, phosphorylation, SUMO modification, or mutation of the Caspase-6 cleavage site modulate the neurotoxicity of mutant Huntingtin (Graham et al., 2006Graham R.K. Deng Y.

Nevertheless, it is unknown if neurotoxicity of the mutant proteins occurs through associations with these native protein complexes, loss of these associations, or aberrant interactions and novel complexes formed by misfolded or aggregating disease protein. To test the hypothesis that polyglutamine expansion mediates pathology by modulating the native protein interactions of the disease protein, we sought to characterize the endogenous ATXN1 protein complexes in mouse cerebellum and identify ATXN1-associated proteins by biochemical copurification from stable cell lines. We report that ATXN1 isolated from mouse cerebellum predominantly associates into large complexes containing the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor containing a Sox-like high mobility group (HMG) box. Both major isoforms of CIC (CIC-L and CIC-S) are subunits of these complexes. We demonstrate that expression of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 alters the repressor activity of CIC, establishing a functional link between the two proteins. Finally, we provide evidence that SCA1 neuropathology depends on incorporation of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 into its native CIC-containing complexes. To identify the major ATXN1 protein complexes in vivo, we examined soluble ATXN1-associated complexes in wild-type mouse cerebellum using gel-filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Gel filtration revealed that the majority of endogenous wild-type ATXN1 (∼75%) elutes as large protein complexes (estimated size ∼1.8 MDa) (Figures 1A and 1B). Only about 25% of ATXN1 elutes as smaller protein complexes (observed as a shoulder on the larger complexes elution profile, estimated size ∼300 kDa) (Figure 1B, right panel). To identify proteins that interact with ATXN1 in its native complexes, we purified ATXN1-associated proteins by tandem affinity purification (TAP) (Rigaut et al., 1999Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar) and mass spectrometry (Figure S1). We found two novel interacting proteins with apparent molecular masses of ∼160 kDa and ∼250 kDa, both corresponding to the human homolog of Drosophila Capicua (Cic). Northern blot analysis of mouse brain RNA for Cic identified two major transcripts (Figure S5A) corresponding to two Cic mRNA transcripts predicted to encode proteins of 258 kDa for CIC-L and 164 kDa for CIC-S (Figure S2A). We also identified these alternatively spliced CIC mRNA transcripts for both human and Drosophila (Figures S2A and S2B). To detect the endogenous CIC protein, we generated antisera against the common C-terminal region of the mouse CIC isoforms (Figure S3A). This antibody specifically recognized CIC-L and CIC-S from mouse cerebellar and HeLa cell extracts (Figures 1 and S3B). To determine whether CIC is a stable ATXN1-interacting partner, we analyzed the elution profile of CIC by gel-filtration chromatography. We observed that CIC-S and CIC-L coeluted with the large ATXN1 protein complexes (Figures 1A and 1B). Quantification of the relative elution profiles of CIC and ATXN1 using 1 ml fractions, which allows the entire profile to be analyzed on a single gel, revealed a near perfect match between the elution profiles of CIC and the large ATXN1 complexes (Figure 1B). If CIC and ATXN1 are components of the same protein complexes, loss of ATXN1 will alter the elution profiles of CIC. Indeed, we found that elution of the CIC isoforms is shifted toward later fractions in cerebellar extracts from Sca1 null mice (Figure S4). Furthermore, we observed a strict cofractionation of ATXN1 with the CIC isoforms using anion exchange chromatography (Figure 1C). Although no significant population of ATXN1 fractionated independently of CIC, we did detect low levels of ATXN1 in the flow-through fractions in the absence of detectable CIC (data not shown), suggesting the smaller ATXN1 complexes have minimal binding to the column matrix. In sum, the nearly identical elution patterns of the large ATXN1 complexes with CIC-L and CIC-S, and the shift of the CIC profiles in the absence of ATXN1, suggest that the majority of endogenous CIC in the mouse cerebellum stably associates into ATXN1-CIC protein complexes. Also, the smaller ATXN1 protein complexes likely do not contain CIC. To determine whether ATXN1 and CIC interact in the tissue most vulnerable in SCA1, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) of cerebellar extracts from wild-type and Sca1 null mice using anti-ATXN1 antibody (11NQ). The anti-ATXN1 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated both CIC isoforms from cerebellar extracts of wild-type but not Sca1 null mice, indicating that CIC and ATXN1 interact in vivo (Figure 2A; input and loading controls for this coIP are in Figure 3A). This is in agreement with our recent work, in which we identified CIC as a binding partner of ATXN1 in an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen (Lim et al., 2006Lim J. Hao T. Shaw C. Patel A.J. Szabo G. Rual J.F. Fisk C.J. Li N. Smolyar A. Hill D.E. et al.A protein-protein interaction network for human inherited ataxias and disorders of Purkinje cell degeneration.Cell. 2006; 125: 801-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Having established the ATXN1-CIC interaction, we compared their expression patterns in mouse brain. Northern blot analysis showed that the Cic isoforms are highly expressed in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb (Figure S5A, upper panel). In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain for Cic and Sca1 revealed strikingly similar expression patterns, with high expression in Purkinje cells and in the hippocampus (Figures S5B–S5I). Immunohistochemistry for CIC and ATXN1 also displayed matching protein expression patterns in most brain regions (data not shown). Importantly, both proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of the Purkinje cells, where polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 does the most damage (Figure 2B). To look for interdependence between CIC and ATXN1, we examined CIC protein levels in Sca1 null mice. We found that both CIC isoforms had significantly reduced levels in Sca1 null mouse cerebellum (Figures 2C and 2D) and cerebrum (data not shown). As the mRNA levels of the Cic isoforms are unaltered in Sca1 null mice, the dependency of CIC on ATXN1 is posttranscriptional (Figure 2E). Thus, CIC is less stable in the absence of ATXN1 in vivo. To assess the degree of CIC association with ATXN1 in vivo, we immunoprecipitated ATXN1 from cerebellar extracts and measured the codepletion of CIC from the post-IP supernatants. Both CIC isoforms were substantially depleted following ATXN1 immunodepletion, demonstrating that the majority of endogenous CIC associates with ATXN1 (Figure 3A). In contrast, the levels of neither Gapdh (data not shown) or AKT (Figure 3A), an ATXN1 kinase thought to interact transiently with ATXN1 (Chen et al., 2003Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. et al.Interaction of Akt-phosphorylated ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 mediates neurodegeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Cell. 2003; 113: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), are decreased by ATXN1 immunodepletion. Averaging data from independent experiments, we observed that when an average of 72% of ATXN1 is immunodepleted, an average of 62% of CIC-L and 56% of CIC-S are codepleted from the cerebellar extracts. We therefore estimate that ∼80% of endogenous CIC associates with ATXN1 (Figure 3B). The depleted CIC isoforms are found in the pellet of the immunoprecipitate (see for example Figure 2A). To establish whether CIC also interacts with mutant forms of ATXN1, we performed immunoprecipitation on lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected with variants of FLAG-tagged ATXN1 containing 2Q, 82Q, or 82Q with a S776A mutation (which abolishes the interaction of ATXN1 with 14-3-3) or 2Q with a deletion of the AXH domain. We found that both endogenous CIC isoforms coimmunoprecipitated with each of these ATXN1 variants, except the one lacking the AXH domain (Figure 3C). We conclude that the ATXN1-CIC interaction requires the AXH domain and is independent of 14-3-3 binding. To identify the domains responsible for interaction between the two proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid interaction assays using a series of ATXN1 and CIC deletion constructs. We found that two N-terminal fragments of CIC-S (amino acids 1–300 and 1–205) interact with the C-terminal half of ATXN1 and that the AXH domain of ATXN1 is sufficient for its interaction with CIC (Figure 3D). To further map the ATXN1 binding domain of CIC, we generated serial deletions at the N terminus of mouse CIC-S for pull-down assays with GST-tagged full-length wild-type ATXN1 (Figures S6A and S6B). We narrowed the interaction region to 31 amino acids (amino acids 16–46) of CIC-S (Figure S6C). Comparison of this 31-amino acid sequence across species revealed a conserved stretch of eight amino acids present in both CIC-S and CIC-L isoforms with the consensus sequence WXX(L/I)(V/L)PX(L/M) (Figure 3E). We then confirmed in vitro that human ATXN1 binds to Drosophila Cic through the consensus eight amino acids (Figure S6D). ATXN1 and CIC thus appear to be in vivo binding partners that interact directly through evolutionarily conserved domains. Having established that polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 interacts with CIC, we asked whether the expanded polyglutamine tract alters the incorporation of ATXN1 into its native protein complexes. We examined cerebellar extracts from Sca1154Q/+ animals that express polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1[154Q] from its endogenous locus and are an accurate model of SCA1 (Watase et al., 2002Watase K. Weeber E.J. Xu B. Antalffy B. Yuva-Paylor L. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Atkinson R. Sun Y.

As previously reported, the levels of soluble expanded protein are significantly lower than wild-type ATXN1 levels in these animals, although expression of the mutant allele is identical to the wild-type allele (Watase et al., 2002Watase K. Weeber E.J. Xu B. Antalffy B. Yuva-Paylor L. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Atkinson R. Sun Y.

Gel-filtration chromatography of extracts from early symptomatic animals (10–15 weeks of age) revealed that soluble ATXN1[154Q] and wild-type ATXN1 (expressed from the untargeted allele) eluted into the same fractions as ATXN1 from wild-type extracts (Figure 4A). The elution profile of CIC from Sca1154Q/+ mice is indistinguishable from that seen in wild-type animals (Figure 4A). A subtle change in the elution profile of the smaller ATXN1 complexes (elution fractions from 13 ml to 16 ml) was observed in the mutant animals: both ATXN1[154Q] and wild-type ATXN1 showed a relative loss from elution fractions at 14 ml and beyond, with a corresponding increase in elution fractions at 13 ml and 13.5 ml (estimated size ∼500 kDa) compared to wild-type animals (compare Figure 1A to 4A). The basis for this change is unclear at present, but it could represent an alternate conformation of the smaller ATXN1 protein complexes coupled with the slight increase of molecular weight due to polyglutamine expansion. The similar elution patterns of wild-type and expanded ATXN1 by gel-filtration chromatography suggest that polyglutamine expansion does not prevent the incorporation of ATXN1 into its normal endogenous protein complexes. To confirm that polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 incorporates into similar complexes as wild-type ATXN1, we analyzed cerebellar extracts from Sca1154Q/+ animals by anion-exchange chromatography. We found that ATXN1[154Q] coelutes with wild-type ATXN1 and with both CIC isoforms (Figure 4B). The elution profiles of ATXN1, CIC-L, and CIC-S in extracts by anion-exchange chromatography are quite broad; this argues against a single complex of uniform structure and suggests that the ATXN1-CIC protein complexes adopt multiple conformational or compositional states separable by differences in their charge (Figures 1C and 4B). We previously showed that mutating serine 776 of ATXN1 to alanine (S776A) dramatically suppresses the neurotoxicity of the polyglutamine-expanded protein in Purkinje cells (Emamian et al., 2003Emamian E.S. Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Zu T. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T.

This mutation causes loss of interaction with the chaperone protein 14-3-3 (Chen et al., 2003Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M.

In autophagy, a double membrane structure called an autophagosome sequesters a portion of cytoplasm and fuses with the lysosome/vacuole to deliver its contents into the organelle lumen. Atg5 was identified together with other Atg proteins by genetic screening in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Because Atg5 has little sequence homology with proteins with known functions, it is difficult to predict its structure and function from the sequence. Thus far, biochemical analyses have shown that Lys-149 of Atg5 is conjugated to Atg12, a ubiquitin-like (Ubl) 2The abbreviations used are: Ubl, ubiquitin-like; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; API, aminopeptidase I; PAS, pre-autophagosomal structure; CA, casamino acid; SD, synthetic defined; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI3P, phosphoinositide 3-phosphate; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HR, helixrich; -N, nitrogen-depleted; -NC, nitrogen- and carbon-depleted. modifier dependent on ATP and two enzymes Atg7 (E1-like) and Atg10 (E2-like) (9Mizushima N.

Compared with other ubiquitin-like modifications, the Atg12-modification is unique in that it is irreversible and constitutive. The majority of Atg5 and Atg12 exist as Atg12-Atg5 conjugates irrespective of whether autophagy is induced or not and behave as a single protein (11Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In yeast, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate localizes to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), a putative center for autophagosome formation (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). All Atg proteins involved in Atg12-Atg5 conjugation are also conserved in mammals. Localization studies of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate in embryonic stem cells using green fluorescent protein-fused Atg5 showed that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is translocated from the cytosol to the isolation membranes upon nutrient deprivation and, immediately upon completion of autophagosome formation, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate dissociates from the membrane, suggesting that it plays a significant role in autophagosome formation (13Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). In addition to the covalent interaction with Atg12, Atg5 interacts non-covalently with a multimeric protein, Atg16 (14Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Atg16 was originally obtained from a two-hybrid screen using Atg12 as a bait and was later confirmed to interact with Atg5 (but not Atg12) via its N-terminal region. Because Atg16 self-assembles via its C-terminal coiled-coil motif (residues 58-123), the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate forms a multimeric complex with Atg16 (11Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Further, as the majority of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates form a complex with Atg16 constitutively, the conjugates should function as a complex with Atg16 during autophagosome formation. In fact, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate cannot localize to the PAS in Δatg16 yeast strains (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 15Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In mammals, Atg16L, a functional counterpart of yeast Atg16, was shown to localize to the isolation membranes together with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate during autophagosome formation (16Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Although the significance of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex in autophagosome formation has been shown, its molecular function is still not clearly understood. One identified function of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is to promote the formation of the Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugate, the other conjugate essential for autophagosome formation, and the targeting of the Atg8-PE conjugate to the PAS (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is first processed by a cysteine protease, Atg4 (17Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The processed Atg8 is conjugated to PE dependent on ATP and two enzymes, Atg7 (E1-like) and Atg3 (E2-like) (18Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Although Atg3, Atg7, Atg8 (processed form), and ATP are sufficient for Atg8-PE conjugation in vitro (19Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is also required for Atg8-PE conjugation in vivo (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The expression of Atg8 is dramatically enhanced upon nutrient depletion. Under such conditions, Atg16 is also required for the efficient formation of Atg8-PE (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and Atg16 promote Atg8-PE formation is not clear. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of plant Atg12 and revealed that Atg12 is a ubiquitin-fold protein (20Suzuki N.N. Yoshimoto K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, structural information on Atg5 and Atg16 has been thoroughly lacking, preventing us from elucidating the molecular functions of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex. In this report, we describe the first structure of Atg5 in complex with the N-terminal region of Atg16. Furthermore, based on structural information, Atg16 mutants that lost the binding affinity to Atg5 were constructed and used to clarify the significance of the direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 in autophagy. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression and purification of Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) and Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) as well as the construction of the expression vector of hexahistidine-tagged Atg5 were described previously (21Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. F. Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The expression vectors of GST-fused Atg16 and its mutants were constructed as follows. The full-length ATG16 gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities and were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. After cell lysis, GST-fused Atg16 and its mutants were purified by sequential chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare) and a Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Hexahistidine-tagged Atg5 was purified by sequential chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and a Superdex75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Diffraction Data Collection—Crystallization of Atg5·Atg1-(1-46) and Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) was performed, and four crystal forms (I-IV) were obtained as described previously (21Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. F. Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Crystal form I (Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) complex) was used for phase determination, and crystal form IV was used for structure determination of Atg5·Atg16-(1-57). Collection of native data for Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) and Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) for final refinement was described previously (21Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. F.

Native data for phase determination as well as the mercury and platinum derivative data for Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) were collected on Rigaku R-AXIS IV and VII imaging plate detectors using CuKα radiation from an in-house Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data for the selenomethionine-substituted crystal of Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) at three wavelengths were collected on the ADSC Quantum 315 charge-coupled device detector at the BL41XU beamline, SPring-8. All diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

After multiple isomorphous replacement phases were calculated using the data between 50 and 3.5 Ä resolution for mercury and platinum derivatives, 35 selenium sites for selenomethionine-substituted crystals were identified from the anomalous difference Fourier map calculated using the peak data and the multiple isomorphous replacement phases. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phases were then calculated using the data between 50 and 3.0 Ä resolution for a selenomethionine-substituted crystal at three wavelengths and were combined with the multiple isomorphous replacement phases. After density modification, the obtained phases were used to calculate the electron density map for model building. Model building was performed manually using programs O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), and crystallographic refinement was performed using crystallography NMR software. The structure of Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) was determined by the molecular replacement method using the structure of Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) as a search model. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—GST-fused Atg16 and its mutants were mixed with hexahistidine-tagged Atg5 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 277 K for 30 min. Subsequently, a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added followed by further incubation at 277 K for 30 min. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were incubated with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0. The elutes were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In Vivo Assay—The significance of the complex formation between Atg16 and Atg5 in vivo was examined as follows. Point mutations were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pRS314- or pRS424-based plasmids containing the ATG16-HA gene (14Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) as templates. Successful introduction of the point mutations was confirmed by sequencing. These plasmids were introduced into Δatg16::LEU2 cells on a SEY6210 (MATα leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2) (26Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) or BJ2168 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 pep4-3 prb1-1122 prc1-407; Yeast Genetic Stock Center) background. SEY6210 Δatg16::LEU2 cells expressing Atg16 mutants were cultured in synthetic defined (SD) medium + casamino acids (CAs) + AdeUra medium to logarithmic phase and then transferred to SD (-N) medium. After culture for 4 h in SD(-N) medium, cells were collected. The lysates were prepared by the alkaline-trichloroacetic acid method, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE, with subsequent immunoblotting using anti-aminopeptidase I (anti-API) and anti-Atg8 antibodies. Signals were detected using an ECL system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a bioimaging analyzer (LAS1000; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To separate lipidated and non-lipidated Atg8 by mobility, separating gel containing 6 m urea was used (17Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Accumulation of autophagic bodies was examined using BJ2168 Δatg16::LEU2 cells expressing the Atg16 mutants. Cells in logarithmic phase of growth were transferred to S (-NC) medium. After culture for 4 h in S(-NC) medium, cells were observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Atg16 mutants were engineered by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using a plasmid containing the ATG16-YFP gene (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) as a template. Successful introduction of the point mutations was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into SEY6210 Δatg16::LEU2 cells. Cells with the plasmids were cultured in SD + CA + AdeUra medium to logarithmic phase and transferred to SD (-N) medium. After culture for 4 h in SD(-N) medium, the cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-81; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled chargecoupled device camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Nippon Roper, Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Buckinghamshire, UK) and processed using Adobe PhotoShop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Overall Structure of the Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) Complex—As the N-terminal half (residues 1-87) of Atg16 was reported to be sufficient for complex formation with Atg5 (14Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we constructed two lengths of Atg16, Atg16-(1-46) and Atg16-(1-57). Both were found to form a stable complex with Atg5 (data not shown). We prepared and crystallized both Atg5·Atg16-(1-46) and Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) complexes (21Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. F. Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and determined their structures. The structures of the two complexes were essentially identical except for residues 47-57 of Atg16; therefore, we refer only to the structure of the Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) complex hereafter. The structure of Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) was refined against 1.97 Ä of data to an R-factor of 0.215 and a free R-factor of 0.245. The regions corresponding to amino acids 1-310 of Atg5 and 22-57 of Atg16 were modeled along with 244 water molecules (Fig. 1A). Residues 65-68, 100-108, and 243-246 of Atg5 and residues 1-21 of Atg16 lacked defined electron density and were omitted from the model. The Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) complex has an α/β fold comprising 10 β-strands (β1-β10) and 10 α-helices (α1-α9 of Atg5 and a helix of Atg16), with overall approximate dimensions of 65 × 45 × 45 Ä. Atg5 Comprises Three Domains—Fig. 1B shows the topology of Atg5. Atg5 comprises two ubiquitin-like domains that flank a helix-rich domain. We named the N- and C-terminal ubiquitin-like domains UblA (yellow) and UblB (red), respectively, and the helix-rich domain between UblA and UblB, HR (green) (Fig. 1B). The linker regions connecting HR with UblA and UblB were named L1 and L2, respectively. In addition to the three domains and two linkers, Atg5 has an additional α-helix (α1) at its N terminus (orange) (Fig. 1B). A color-coded ribbon diagram of Atg5 domains is shown in Fig. 1C. Both UblA and UblB comprise a five-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices, which is a conserved feature in all ubiquitin superfamily proteins. Comparison of UblA and UblB of Atg5 with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the DALI search engine revealed that both domains show structural similarity to ubiquitin (PDB code 1UBI) and ubiquitin-like proteins, including LC3 (PDB code 1UGM, a mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8) and AtATG12b (PDB code 1WZ3, a plant ortholog of yeast Atg12) with a Z-score of 5.8-8.2 and a root mean square deviation of 2.3-3.0 Ä for 66-80 residues. Fig. 2 shows the sequence alignment of Atg5 homologs in which Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Phe, Tyr, and Trp are all considered to be hydrophobic residues and colored yellow, and other conserved residues are colored cyan. The sequences of ubiquitin and LC3 are also aligned based on their three-dimensional structures. Although the sequence identities of UblA and UblB with ubiquitin and LC3 are low (11-16%), hydrophobic residues that constitute the ubiquitin core are conserved, indicating that the two ubiquitin-like domains are part of the conserved architecture in Atg5 family proteins. HR comprises three long and one short α-helices that form a helix-bundle structure. Comparison of HR with the PDB data base using the DALI search engine showed that HR is structurally similar to the domain III of CysG, a multifunctional siroheme synthase (27Stroupe M.E. Leech H.K. Daniels D.S. Warren M.J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1L3I), with a Z-score of 4.8 and a root mean square deviation value of 2.9 Ä for 53 residues. HR also shows weak structural similarity to CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER), a ubiquitin binding domain, with a Z-score of 2.2 and a root mean square deviation value of 3.4 Ä for 40 residues. Eleven hydrophobic residues constituting the core of HR are conserved among Atg5 homologs (Fig. 2), indicating that HR is also part of the conserved architecture in Atg5 family proteins. Lys-149, the conjugation site for Atg12, is located on α4 of HR and exposes its side chain (Fig. 1). Structural Basis of the Atg5 Architecture—Although each domain constituting Atg5 has a common fold, the overall architecture of Atg5 is unique, and no similar structures have been reported. Three domains, two linkers, and α1 form many interactions with each other and are packed into a globular structure. Among all pairs, the UblA-UblB pair forms the largest interaction surface (1,574 Ä2). α3 of UblA is located on the central β-sheet of UblB and is surrounded by three loops connecting β6-β7, β8-β9, and α9-β10 of UblB (Fig. 3A, left), thus forming a wide point of contact with UblB. This binding mode is partly similar to that between ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-interacting motif (28Swanson K.A. Kang R.S. Stamenova S.D. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), although the direction of the bound helix is inverse (Fig. 3A, right). Compared with the interaction surface between UblA and UblB, those between UblA and HR (657 Ä2) and between UblB and HR (824 Ä2) are rather small. However, UblB and HR form extensive hydrophobic interactions with each other (Fig. 3B, left). Pro-201 and Phe-276 of UblB interact with Val-151 and Ile-154 of HR, whereas Phe-273 of UblB interacts with Trp-144 and Val-177 of HR. Phe-273 also interacts with Tyr-44 and Pro-86 of UblA, thus playing a crucial role in gathering the three domains. Interestingly, the loop connecting α9 and α10 of UblB, which plays a major role in these interactions, is both sequentially and structurally similar to the equivalent loop of LC3 (Figs. 2 and 3B, right). In LC3, the loop is involved in the interaction with two N-terminal α-helices, α1 and α2 (29Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Val-151 and Ile-254 of HR and Pro-201 and Ile-203 of UblB are also conserved in LC3 and are involved in the interaction between the ubiquitin fold region and α2 of LC3. Thus, the ubiquitin folds in both Atg5 and LC3 utilize the common residues for the construction of the architecture of each protein. Sequence alignment shows that, in addition to the three domains, α1 and L1 are also conserved among Atg5 homologs, whereas L2 is not conserved at all (Fig. 2). L1 has four hydrophobic residues, Leu-126, Pro-127, Ile-131, and Pro-132, which are conserved among Atg5 homologs (Fig. 2). Leu-126 and Pro-132 interact with each other, whereas Pro-127 and Ile-131 interact with the conserved tryptophans Trp-73 and Trp-83 of UblA, respectively (Fig. 3C). Through these interactions, L1 takes on a rigid conformation and may contribute to fixing the UblA-HR arrangement. In addition to the interactions described above, the interactions mediated by α1 seem to play critical roles in the formation of the Atg5 architecture. α1 has two conserved hydrophobic residues Leu-8 and Trp-9 (Fig. 2); Trp-9 interacts with conserved hydrophobic residues, Val-177, Phe-182, and Phe-185 of HR, whereas Leu-8 interacts with a conserved hydrophobic residue, Leu-270, of UblB (Fig. 3D). Ile-4 of α1, which is partially conserved, also interacts with Leu-270. Thus α1, which is located prior to the N terminus of UblA, plays an essential role in the assembling of the three domains. In addition to the intramolecular interactions, Ile-4 and Leu-8 of α1 also interact with the hydrophobic residues in Atg16 (Fig. 3D). Structural Basis of the Interaction between Atg5 and Atg16—Atg16-(1-57) comprises an α-helix (residues 22-40) and its downstream loop (residues 41-57). The helix moiety of Atg16 is bound to the groove formed by UblA, UblB, and α1, whereas the loop moiety is mainly bound to UblA (Fig. 4A). The N-terminal residues (residues 1-21) of Atg16 were disordered in the crystal and may not interact with Atg5. The detailed interactions observed between Atg5 and Atg16 are shown in Fig. 4B. The side chains of Asp-25, Arg-31, Arg-35, Asn-36, Glu-39, Asp-48, and Asn-49 of Atg16 form hydrophilic interactions with Atg5. In particular, the side chains of Arg-35, Asn-36, and Glu-39 are clustered at the deep groove at the boundary of UblA, UblB, and α1 of Atg5 and form extensive hydrophilic interactions with these three regions. Three glycine residues (Gly-11, Gly-88, and Gly-254) together with Arg-41 and Asp-92 of Atg5, which constitute the deep groove, are well conserved among Atg5 homologs (Fig. 2). In addition to the hydrophilic interactions, Atg16 also forms hydrophobic interactions with Atg5. Ile-255, Ile-257, Pro-258, Met-261, and Leu-270 of UblB and Ile-4, Leu-7, and Leu-8 of α1 form an extensive hydrophobic surface on which Met-24, Leu-27, Leu-28, Ile-29, and Leu-32 of Atg16 are bound. Furthermore, Leu-16, Arg-36, Leu-113, and Phe-115 of UblA form a hydrophobic cavity in which Phe-46 of Atg16 is bound. In contrast, residues 50-57 of Atg16 have few interactions with Atg5, which is consistent with the observation that Atg16-(1-46) is sufficient for complex formation with Atg5. To identify the residues of Atg16 crucial for the interaction with Atg5, an in vitro pulldown assay was performed using hexahistidine-tagged Atg5 and GST-fused Atg16 mutants. Eleven Atg16 residues (labeled in Fig. 4A) were mutated with alanine. As shown in Fig. 4C, Arg-35 and Phe-46, especially Arg-35, were crucial for the interaction between Atg5 and Atg16. Significance of the Atg5-Atg16 Interaction for Both Atg8 Lipidation and Autophagy—To reveal the significance of the direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16, we measured the in vivo activities of two Atg16 mutants, R35A and F46A, that lack binding affinity to Atg5 in vitro. As a control, the Atg16 D25A mutant, which retains binding affinity to Atg5 in vitro, was also assayed. The activity of Atg16 mutants was first assayed by monitoring the maturation of the proform of API (aminopeptidase I), which is transported into vacuoles via the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway or by autophagy under nutritionrich and starvation conditions, respectively. The protein is then processed into a mature form within vacuoles. API maturation, which was not observed in Δatg16 cells, was restored in cells expressing the Atg16 D25A mutant to a similar extent as those expressing wild-type Atg16 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, there was little restoration of API maturation in cells expressing the R35A or F46A mutants of Atg16 (Fig. 5A). Next, the accumulation of autophagic bodies in vacuoles was examined using an optical microscope. Typical accumulation of autophagic bodies was observed in wild-type cells and Δatg16 cells expressing wild-type or D25A Atg16 (Fig. 5B, a, c, and f), whereas no such accumulation was observed in either Δatg16 cells or those expressing the R35A or F46A mutants of Atg16 (Fig. 5B, b, d, and e). These results support the notion that direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 is crucial for autophagy. The Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex localizes to the PAS and plays a crucial role in autophagosome formation (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), where Atg5 and Atg16 (but not Atg12) is necessary for the localization. Thus, we next studied whether Atg16 mutants can localize to the PAS using yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Atg16 in Δatg16 yeast strains. Wild-type Atg16 localized to a punctate structure proximal to the vacuole, which corresponds to the PAS (Fig. 5C, top). The Atg16 D25A mutant also localized to a similar dot structure (Fig. 5C, bottom). In contrast, Atg16 R35A and F46A mutants did not localize to any punctate structures and spread in the cytosol (Fig. 5C, middle two panels). These results suggest that the direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 is essential for the localization of Atg16 to the PAS. The expression of Atg8 is significantly enhanced under starvation conditions, and the Atg8-PE level dramatically increases compared with that of unconjugated Atg8. Atg8-PE formation was severely diminished in the absence of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of Atg16, Atg8-PE formation was reduced, and unconjugated Atg8 was accumulated under starvation conditions but not under nutrient-rich conditions (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined Atg8-PE formation in Δatg16 cells expressing Atg16 mutants. In cells expressing the Atg16 D25A mutant, Atg8-PE formation was observed to a similar extent to those expressing wild-type Atg16 even under starvation conditions (Fig. 5D). In contrast, unconjugated Atg8 but not Atg8-PE was accumulated in cells expressing the R35A or F46A mutants of Atg16 under starvation conditions to a similar extent as cells transformed with a control vector (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 is critical for efficient Atg8-PE formation under starvation conditions. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, many Atg proteins have been observed to cluster into a punctuate structure proximal to the vacuole, called the PAS. From the PAS, isolation membranes, the precursors of autophagosomes, are thought to be formed. The Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex was found to be localized to the PAS, suggesting that the complex plays a critical role in autophagosome formation. Thus far, it has been reported that the localization of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex to the PAS depends on both Atg5 and Atg16, but not Atg12 (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the direct complex formation between Atg5 and Atg16 remained unclear. We have shown herein that the direct interaction between Atg5 and Atg16 is crucial not only for the localization, but also for autophagy (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we have also shown that the binding site for Atg16 and the conjugation site for Atg12 are located on the opposite sides of Atg5 (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex localizes to the PAS using the surface formed by both Atg5 and Atg16. The autophagy-specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which itself localizes to the PAS (30Obara K. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), is known to be essential for targeting the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate to the PAS (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Because PI3K produces phosphoinositide 3-phosphate (PI3P), it can be speculated that PI3P is produced on the PAS by PI3K and then interacts with the Atg5·Atg16 complex, either directly or via some PI3P binding protein(s), by which the complex is recruited to the PAS. Because the overall architecture of Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) is quite novel and the structure contains no known binding motifs for PI3P, the interaction between the Atg5·Atg16 complex and PI3P, if it exists, is also thought to be novel. Atg3, Atg7, Atg8 (processed form), and ATP are necessary and sufficient for Atg8-PE formation in vitro (19Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, in addition to these factors, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is also required for Atg8-PE formation in vivo (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and the significance of Atg12 in Atg8-PE formation was shown by mutational analyses (31Hanada T. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The expression level of Atg8 is dramatically enhanced upon nutrient depletion. Under such conditions, Atg16 is also required for the efficient formation of Atg8-PE (12Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that Atg16 mutants that lack affinity to Atg5 do not promote Atg8-PE formation (Fig. 5D). Because most Atg5 exists as a conjugate with Atg12 in vivo, this result suggests that Atg16 promotes Atg8-PE formation as a complex with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. This activity of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex is similar to that of E3 enzymes in the ubiquitin system. In most cases, E3 binds to both E2 and a target protein, thus mediating the transfer of ubiquitin between them. The Atg5·Atg16-(1-57) complex shows no structural similarity to E3 enzymes, and the molecular mechanism by which the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex promotes Atg8-PE formation is still unclear. Because complex formation between Atg16 and the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate is crucial for both the promotion of Atg8-PE formation and targeting of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex to the PAS, these two events appear to have a strong relationship. Atg12 was shown to interact with Atg3, the E2 enzyme for Atg8 lipidation, by yeast two-hybrid screening (32Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex binds to both Atg3 and the PAS, thus promoting the transfer of Atg8 between Atg3 and PE at the PAS. This idea is consistent with the observation that the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex is also crucial for the localization of Atg8-PE to the PAS. However, further studies are required to elucidate this mechanism, including the identity of the PAS itself. We thank Dr. D. J. Klionsky for providing the anti-API antibody and R.

https://openalex.org/W2090505304,"Several observations have implicated oxidative stress and aggregation of the presynaptic protein α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. α-Synuclein has been shown to have affinity for unsaturated fatty acids and membranes enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are especially sensitive to oxidation under conditions of oxidative stress. One of the most important products of lipid oxidation is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Consequently, we investigated the effects of the interaction of HNE with α-synuclein. Incubation of HNE with α-synuclein at pH 7.4 and 37 °C resulted in covalent modification of the protein, with up to six HNE molecules incorporated as Michael addition products. Fourier transform infrared and CD spectra indicated that HNE modification of α-synuclein resulted in a major conformational change involving increased β-sheet. HNE modification of α-synuclein led to inhibition of fibrillation in an HNE concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition of fibrillation was shown to be due to the formation of soluble oligomers based on size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography and atomic force microscope data. Small angle x-ray scattering analysis indicated that the HNE-induced oligomers were compact and tightly packed. Treatment with guanidinium chloride demonstrated that the HNE-induced oligomers were very stable with an extremely slow rate of dissociation. Addition of 5 μm HNE-modified oligomers to primary mesencephalic cultures caused marked neurotoxicity because the integrity of dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons was reduced by 95 and 85%, respectively. Our observations indicate that HNE modification of α-synuclein prevents fibrillation but may result in toxic oligomers, which could therefore contribute to the demise of neurons subjected to oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2131326854,"The apposition of axon terminals and dendrites is critical for the control of neuronal activation, but how distinct neuronal subpopulations establish selective dendrite patterns and acquire specific presynaptic inputs remains unclear. Spinal motor neuron (MN) pools project to specific target muscles and are activated by selective synaptic inputs from group Ia proprioceptive afferents (IaPAs). Here, we show that MN pools with radially projecting dendrites respond to sensory stimulation with monosynaptic latency and are strikingly different from MN pools with dendrites that avoid the central gray matter, which are only activated through indirect connections. We provide genetic evidence that the induction of the ETS transcription factor Pea3 by GDNF is essential in two cervical MN pools to control dendrite patterning and selectivity of IaPA connectivity. These findings suggest that target-induced transcriptional programs control MN dendrite orientation and play a crucial role in the establishment of sensory-motor connections in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W1972610733,"UDP-l-rhamnose is required for the biosynthesis of cell wall rhamnogalacturonan-I, rhamnogalacturonan-II, and natural compounds in plants. It has been suggested that the RHM2/MUM4 gene is involved in conversion of UDP-d-glucose to UDP-l-rhamnose on the basis of its effect on rhamnogalacturonan-I-directed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. RHM2/MUM4-related genes, RHM1 and RHM3, can be found in the A. thaliana genome. Here we present direct evidence that all three RHM proteins have UDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase, and UDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose 4-keto-reductase activities in the cytoplasm when expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Functional domain analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of RHM2 (RHM2-N; amino acids 1–370) has the first activity and the C-terminal region of RHM2 (RHM2-C; amino acids 371–667) has the two following activities. This suggests that RHM2 converts UDP-d-glucose to UDP-l-rhamnose via an UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose intermediate. Site-directed mutagenesis of RHM2 revealed that mucilage defects in MUM4-1 and MUM4-2 mutant seeds of A. thaliana are caused by abolishment of RHM2 enzymatic activity in the mutant strains and furthermore, that the GXXGXX(G/A) and YXXXK motifs are important for enzymatic activity. Moreover, a kinetic analysis of purified His6-tagged RHM2-N protein revealed 5.9-fold higher affinity of RHM2 for UDP-d-glucose than for dTDP-d-glucose, the preferred substrate for dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase from bacteria. RHM2-N activity is strongly inhibited by UDP-l-rhamnose, UDP-d-xylose, and UDP but not by other sugar nucleotides, suggesting that RHM2 maintains cytoplasmic levels of UDP-d-glucose and UDP-l-rhamnose via feedback inhibition by UDP-l-rhamnose and UDP-d-xylose.

Three major pectic polysaccharides (homogalacturonan, RG-I, and RG-II) are present in the primary cell walls of plants (1Ridley B.L. O'Neill M.A. Mohnen D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 929-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). RG-I is a polymer of more than 100 individual α1,4-linked disaccharide units that are themselves composed of l-rhamnose and d-galacturonic acid (1Ridley B.L. O'Neill M.A. Mohnen D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 929-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). RG-II is a structurally complex polysaccharide that exists in primary walls as a dimer covalently cross-linked by a borate diester bond (1Ridley B.L. O'Neill M.A. Mohnen D.

These pectic polysaccharides play a major role in the development and growth of all vascular plants (1Ridley B.L. O'Neill M.A. Mohnen D. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 929-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). In bacteria, cell surface polysaccharides also contain l-rhamnose and are essential for survival and interaction between bacteria (4Dong C. Beis K. Giraud M.F. Blankenfeldt W. Allard S. Major L.L.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The rhamnose-containing polysaccharides of bacteria are synthesized from dTDP-rhamnose (dTDP-Rha) (4Dong C. Beis K.

Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the last decade, much effort has been directed at studying the dTDP-Rha synthetic pathway (e.g. gene structures, enzymatic properties, and their functions in cell wall synthesis) (4Dong C. Beis K. Giraud M.F. Blankenfeldt W. Allard S. Major L.L. Kerr I.D. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 532-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dTDP-Rha biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of the rmlB (or rfbB), rmlC (or rfbC), and rmlD (or rfbD) genes is responsible for biosynthesis of dTDP-Rha from dTDP-glucose (dTDP-Glc) in bacteria, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Fig. 1) (4Dong C.

Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The rmlB, rmlC, and rmlD genes encode dTDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.46), dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose (dTDP-4K6DG) 3,5-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.13), and dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose (dTDP-4KR) 4-keto-reductase (EC 1.1.1.133), respectively (5Jiang X.M. Neal B. Santiago F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In plants, UDP-Rha is synthesized from UDP-d-glucose (UDP-Glc) via an analogous enzymatic pathway (6Kamsteeg J. Van Brederode J. Van Nigtevecht G. FEBS Lett. 1978; 91: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). It is known that UDP-Rha is synthesized from UDP-Glc by UDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.76), UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose (UDP-4K6DG) 3,5-epimerase, and UDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose (UDP-4KR) 4-keto-reductase (6Kamsteeg J. Van Brederode J. Van Nigtevecht G. FEBS Lett. 1978; 91: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RHM1, RHM2/MUM4, RHM3, and UER1 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana are putative plant orthologues of the dTDP-Rha biosynthetic enzymes in bacteria (Figs. 2A and 3A). It has been reported that the UER1 protein (7Seifert G.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), also called NRS/ER (8Watt G. Leoff C. Harper A.D. Bar-Peled M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), has both dTDP/UDP-4K6DG 3,5-epimerase and dTDP/UDP-4KG 4-keto-reductase activities, forming dTDP/UDP-Rha from dTDP/UDP-4K6DG. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of RHM proteins are similar to bacterial RmlB and RmlD proteins, respectively. On the basis of bioinformatics analysis, Reiter and Vanzin (9Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) reported that RHM1, RHM2/MUM4, and RHM3 proteins are putative nucleotide sugar interconversion enzymes in A. thaliana. It has also been reported that in the mucilage of seeds of MUM4 (MUCILAGE-MODIFIED4)-1, MUM4-2 mutants and rhm2 T-DNA insertion mutants, RG-I is found at lower levels and is of a lower molecular weight than in the mucilage of normal seeds (10Usadel B. Kuschinsky A.M. Rosso M.G. Eckermann N. Pauly M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Western T.L. Young D.S. Dean G.H. Tan W.L. Samuels A.L. Haughn G.W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that RHM2 is involved in the synthesis of UDP-Rha. However, no biochemical evidence for the postulated function of these enzymes has been described. On the other hand, a mutation of rhm1 was isolated as an extragenic suppressor of a mutation in the gene that encodes LRR-extensin1 (LRX1), a typical A. thaliana cell wall-glycosylated protein (12Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although using recombinant RHM1, B.

Analysis of both enzymatic and physicochemical properties of specific protein fragments revealed that the N-terminal region of RHM2/MUM4 (RHM2-N: 1–370 amino acids) encodes UDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratase and the C-terminal region of RHM2/MUM4 (RHM2-C: 371–667 amino acids) encodes both UDP-4K6DG 3,5-epimerase and UDP-4KR 4-keto-reductase, indicating that the genes are responsible for the synthesis of UDP-Rha from UDP-Glc in plants. In addition, RHM2-N activity is strongly inhibited by UDP-Rha, UDP-d-xylose (UDP-Xyl), and UDP but not by other sugar nucleotides and d-glucose, suggesting that RHM2/MUM4 maintains cytoplasmic levels of UDP-Glc and UDP-Rha via feedback inhibition by UDP-Rha and UDP-Xyl. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the regulatory mechanism of UDP-sugar metabolism in plants. Microorganisms and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study were as follows (13Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Construction of RHM2-G18A, RHM2-K36A, RHM2-D96A, RHM2-K165A, RHM2-G193R, RHM2-G392A, RHM2-K413A, and RHM2-K518A—The following single point mutations in the Rossmann motif (GXXGXX(G/A)) (20Rossmann M.G. Argos P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1978; 21: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and YXXXK motif (21Duax W.L. Ghosh D. Pletnev V. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 121-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the RHM2 protein were introduced via site-directed mutagenesis: G18A, K36A, D96N, K165A, G193R, G392A, K413A, and K518A. Mutagenesis was performed with pTO-6xHIS-RHM2 as a template using primers RHM2-G18A-F (5′-CATTACTGGAGCTGCTGCATTTATTGCTTCTCATG-3′) and RHM2-G18A-R (5′-CATGAGAAGCAATAAATGCAGCAGCTCCAGTAATG-3′), RHM2-K36A-F (5′-GTAACTATCCTGATTACGCGATCGTTGTTCTTGAC-3′) and RHM2-K36A-R (5′-GTCAAGAACAACGATCGCGTAATCAGGATAGTTAC-3′), RHM2-D96N-F (5′-GCTGCTCAAACTCATGTTAATAACTCTTTTGGTAATAGC-3′) and RHM2-D96N-R (5′-GCTATTACCAAAAGAGTTATTAACATGAGTTTGAGCAGC-3′), RHM2-K165A-F (5′-CCTTACTCTGCAACTGCGGCTGGTGC-3′) and RHM2-K165A-R (5′-GCACCAGCCGCAGTTGCAGAGTAAGG-3′), RHM2-G193R-F (5′-CGGGAACAATGTTTATCGGCCTAACCAGTTTCC-3′) and RHM2-G193R-R (5′-GGAAACTGGTTAGGCCGATAAACATTGTTCCCG-3′), RHM2-G392A-F (5′-GATCTATGGTAAGACTGCTTGGCTTGGTGGTC-3′) and RHM2-G392A-R (5′-GACCACCAAGCCAAGCAGTCTTACCATAGATC-3′), RHM2-K413A-F (5′-CATATGAGTATGGGGCAGGACGTCTGGAG-3′) and RHM2-K413A-R (5′-CTCCAGACGTCCTGCCCCATACTCATATG-3′), RHM2-K518A-F (5′-CTACTCGAAAACCGCAGCCATGGTTGAGG-3′) and RHM2-K518A-R (5′-CCTCAACCATGGCTGCGGTTTTCGAGTAG-3′). The QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA Sequence—DNA sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using crude cell lysates. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using an electroblotter AE-6677 (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 mA for 1.5 h. After incubation of the membrane for 1 h in 3% skim milk (Wako), 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (blocking buffer), the membrane was transferred to 5 ml of solution containing Anti-Penta HIS mouse monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) or anti-3-phosphoglycerate kinase (yeast) mouse monoclonal 22C5 (anti-Pgk1p; Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5000. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (PBS buffer) for a total of 30 min, then incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG conjugate horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at a dilution of 1:5000. An ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize the immunoreactive proteins. Preparation of a Crude Enzyme Fraction—Yeast cells were grown in SD medium at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) with the Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (1 tablet of Complete/50 ml; Roche Applied Science), and lysed with glass beads. Crude membranes were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and the supernatants were used as crude enzyme. UDP-Rha Synthesis Assay—An in vitro assay for UDP-Rha synthase was performed as follows. The reaction mixture contained 3 mm UDP-Glc, 3 mm NAD+, and 3 mm NADPH (Sigma), Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (1 tablet of Complete/50 ml; Roche), 250 mm MOPS-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), and S. cerevisiae crude enzyme (A600 = 5.0–7.5) in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and the reaction was stopped by vortex mixing with 100 μl of ice-cold phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC (below). HPLC Analysis—The products were analyzed by HPLC using a Develosil RPAQUEOUS reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Nomura Chemical Co.) as previously described (22Oka T. Jigami Y. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm triethylamine acetate buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The retention times for UDP-Glc and UDP-Rha were 12.2 and 13.2 min, respectively, under the assay conditions. UDP-4K6DG was observed as a broad peak at the retention time from ranging 12.5 to 20 min. Alternatively, products were analyzed by HPLC with a CarboPac PA1 anion-exchange column (250 × 4.0 mm, Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) according to the method described by Kang et al. (23Kang Y.B. Yang Y.H. Lee K.W. Lee S.G. Sohng J.K. Lee H.C. Liou K. Kim B.G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2006; 93: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After sample injection, the column was equilibrated with solvent A (20 mm K2HPO4-KHPO4, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min for 5 min, and analyzed isocratically with solvent B (200 mm K2HPO4-KHPO4, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min for 30 min. The retention times for UDP-Glc, UDP-4K6DG, and UDP-Rha were 17.5, 18.3, and 16.2 min, respectively. After either method of separation, UDP-sugars were detected by UV260 absorbance. Mass Spectrometry—The HPLC-purified enzymatic products from UDP-Glc of RHM2 and RHM2-N were lyophilized and suspended with 1 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 10.0). The fractions were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Mass spectra were acquired on an Esquire 3000-plus instrument (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) in the negative-ion mode. Conditions for ESI-MS were as follows: nebulizer flow 10 p.s.i., nozzle temperature 300 °C, drying gas (N2) flow 5.0 liters/min. Negative ion spectra were generated by scanning the range m/z 500–570. NMR Analysis—Products were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. All proton spectra were acquired on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) equipped with a 5-mm TXI probe, operating at 500.13 MHz and 25.0 °C. The HPLC-purified products, UDP-Rha (∼250 μg) and UDP-4K6DG (∼100 μg), were lyophilized. Subsequently, purified material was dissolved in 500 μl of 99.97% D2O. The pH (pD) of samples were uncorrected. For each sample, water-suppressed high-resolution one-dimensional, two-dimensional water-suppressed COSY (correlated spectroscopy), TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy), and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) experiments were performed. Data points of 32 k were given to one-dimensional spectra and 2024 (t2: complex) × 256 (t1: real) data points were given to all two-dimensional spectra. The spectral width was set to 5.00000 × 103 Hz and phase-sensitive detection in the t1 domain was obtained in the States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation frequency discrimination (States method)) mode. A total of 16 or 32 scans for t1 increments were accumulated. For TOCSY, MLEV-17 (Malcom Levitt’s decoupling sequence) spin lock pulses (25–100 ms) were applied. For NOESY, 75–500 ms was selected for NOE mixing. Solvent suppression for all NMR measurements was achieved by weak continuous wave presaturation. All data were processed using the XWINNMR3.5 software package (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) to obtain the final 64 k (one-dimensional) or 2048 × 1024 (two-dimensional) data. Sequence Analysis—To analyze the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, GENETYX-MAC version 12.0.0 (Genetyx Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used according to the supplier’s protocol. Purification of RHM2-N from Yeast Cells—The His6-tagged RHM2-N protein was purified from yeast cell extracts using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. To prepare the cell extracts, yeast cells were grown in 6 liters of SD medium at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells (A600 = 3600) were harvested, resuspended in ∼200 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT from WAKO, 1 mm EDTA from Sigma, and complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche), and then lysed with glass beads. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min and then 4 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose was added to the supernatant. The supernatant-agarose mixture was gently shaken for 1 h. The Ni-NTA-agarose was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and washed for five times with 50 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl from WAKO, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture). The enzyme was then eluted twice with 5 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole (WAKO). The eluted enzyme was dialyzed in buffer A overnight. Finally, ∼4.5 mg of purified His6-tagged RHM2-N enzyme sample was obtained. The purified enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Test of Putative Inhibitors of UDP-Glc 4,6-Dehydratase—UDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratase activities were measured as follows. Reaction mixtures contained MOPS-NaOH (250 mm, pH 7.5), NAD+ (1.0 mm), DTT (5 mm), EDTA (2.5 mm), UDP-Glc (1.0 mm), and purified His6-tagged RHM2-N in a total volume of 100 μl. The UDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratase assay was performed in the presence of various inhibitors. The purified His6-tagged RHM2-N (1.92 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heat treatment (99 °C) for 10 min. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC using an anion-exchange column (CarboPac PA1). UDP-sugars were detected by UV260 absorbance. Three independent repetitions of each experiment were performed. Effects of Temperature and pH on Enzymatic Activity of His6-tagged RHM2-N—Optimal conditions for UDP-4,6-dehydratase activity were determined as follows. To determine the optimal temperature for His6-tagged RHM2-N, the purified protein (0.96 μg) was incubated at a series of temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C) for 60 min and the reaction was stopped by heat treatment (99 °C) for 10 min. The optimal pH for His6-tagged RHM2-N was determined as follows. Three kinds of pH buffer solutions, 250 mm MES-NaOH (pH 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0), 250 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0), and 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 8.0, and 9.0) were tested. The purified His6-tagged RHM2-N (0.96 μg) was used for reaction at 30"

Obtaining this knowledge is vital for understanding PRL3-mediated disease processes and for the development of novel anticancer therapies targeted to PRL3.

The activation of these pathways likely contributes to the increased cell growth and motility of PRL3 cells. We provide evidence that PRL3 induces Src activation through down-regulation of Csk, a negative regulator of Src. Importantly, Src activation and Csk down-regulation are also observed in colon cancer cells expressing a higher level of PRL3. Thus, we have revealed a biochemical mechanism for the PRL3-mediated cell invasion and proliferation in which elevated PRL3 expression causes a reduction in Csk level, leading to Src activation.

Defective or inappropriate regulation of PTP activity leads to aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, which contributes to the development of many human diseases, including cancer (2Zhang Z-Y. Curr.

The PRL phosphatase represents a novel subfamily of PTPs, which is comprised of three members (PRL1, -2, and -3) sharing a high degree (>75%) of amino acid sequence identity (4Diamond R.H.

Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the PRL phosphatases have been implicated in the development of a number of tumorigenesis and metastasis processes (7Stephens B.J. Han H. Gokhale V. Von Hoff D.D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).PRL3 has attracted much attention because of its involvement in tumor metastases (7Stephens B.J. Han H. Gokhale V. Von Hoff D.D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Sager J.A. Benvenuti S. Bardelli A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 952-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PRL3 is consistently and massively overexpressed in liver metastases of colorectal cancer, and its expression in primary tumors and normal colorectal epithelium is undetectable (9Saha S. Bardelli A. Buckhaults P. Velculescu V.E. Rago C. St. Croix B. Romans K.E. Choti M.A. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2001; 294: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PRL3 mRNA is found to be elevated in nearly all metastatic lesions derived from colorectal cancers, regardless of the sites of metastasis (liver, lung, brain, or ovary) (10Bardelli A. Saha S. Sager J.A. Romans K.E. Xin B. Markowitz S.D. Lengauer C. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5607-5615PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kato H. Semba S. Miskad U.A.

High PRL3 expression has also been reported in cancer types other than colorectal cancers. For example, PRL3 is highly expressed in a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line (12Schwering I. Brauninger A. Distler V. Jesdinsky J. Diehl V. Hansmann M.L. Rajewsky K. Kuppers R. Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 85-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in liver carcinoma samples (13Wu X. Zeng H. Zhang X. Zhao Y. Sha H. Ge X. Zhang M. Gao X. Xu Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2039-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); high PRL3 expression has been detected in invasive breast tumor vasculature (14Parker B.S. Argani P.

In addition, PRL3 promotes invasion and metastasis of human gastric carcinomas (16Miskad U.A. Semba S. Kato H. Yokozaki H.

Moreover, cells (Chinese hamster ovary and B16) stably transfected with PRL3 exhibit enhanced motility and invasive activity and induce metastatic tumor formation in mice (13Wu X. Zeng H. Zhang X.

Collectively, these studies suggest that an excess of PRL3 is a key alteration contributing to the acquisition of metastatic and proliferative properties of tumor cells.Although considerable evidence has now accumulated suggesting that PRL3 may play key causal roles in the development of tumorigenesis and metastasis, little is known about the underlying mechanism(s) by which PRL3 promotes cell invasion and growth. Obtaining this knowledge is vital for the development of novel anticancer therapies targeted to PRL3. In this study, we seek to define the signaling pathways that are regulated by PRL3. Our results indicate that PRL3 down-regulates the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), which in turn leads to Src activation. Activated Src then initiates a number of signal pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and p130Cas, providing a likely mechanism by which PRL3 promotes cell migration and proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), Csk, p130Cas, FAK, and vinculin antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-STAT3 and pSTAT3/Tyr-705 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were generous gifts from Dr. Xin-Yuan Fu (Indiana University School of Medicine) and Dr. Hua Yu (City of Hope). Anti-Src, anti-Src-pY416, and anti-Src-pY527 antibodies were from BIOSOURCE. Polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 and anti-pERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Src inhibitor SU6656 was purchased from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and Stable Clone Selection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Human PRL3 was inserted into pCDNA3 expression vector. HEK293 cells were seeded at 40% confluency in antibiotic-free medium and grown overnight. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 24 h after transfection, 0.5 mg/ml G418 was added to the culturing medium. Stable clones were picked after 2 weeks of selection. For Csk rescue experiments, HEK293/PRL3 cells were transfected with pcDNA6 vector, which expresses the tetracycline repressor. Stable cell lines were selected using blasticidine (7.5 μg/ml) as selection drug. The stable cell line was further transfected with pcDNA4-Csk, and final stable clones were established by selection with Zeocin (400 μg/ml).mRNA Extraction and RT-PCR—mRNA from different cell lines was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA was treated by DNase and quantified by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. RT-PCR was performed using the Invitrogen SuperScript one-step RT-PCR kit. Reverse transcription was done at 50 °C for 30 min, and cDNA was amplified for 36 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 90 s). The sequences of specific primers were as follows: PRL3 sense, 5′-CTTCCTCATCACCCACAACC-3′, and antisense: 5′-GTCTTGTGCGTGTGTGTGGGTC-3′; 18 S ribosome sense, 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTC-3′. The PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—The PRL3 mRNA level was determined with a two-step quantitative RT-PCR protocol using the fluorescent intercalating dye SYBR-Green RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). 250 ng of RNA was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis. Primer sequences for PRL3 and 18 S were the same as those used for the RT-PCR experiments. 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control. The cycle threshold (Ct) value, defined as the PCR cycle at which a statistically significant increase of reporter fluorescence is first detected, was used as measure for the starting copy numbers of target genes. The ratio of the Ct value of PRL3 mRNA to that of 18 S in each cell lines was determined as relative PRL3 mRNA level.Cell Migration Assay—Cells were serum-starved overnight, harvested with trypsin-EDTA, and washed twice with serum-free DMEM. Cells (5 × 105) were then suspended in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM and then added to the upper insert of the haptotaxis chamber (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). The lower well was added with 3 ml of DMEM medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The migration was allowed for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells on the upper chamber surface were mechanically removed with a cotton swab, and migratory cells were collected and counted with a hemocytometer.Cell Adhesion Assay—HEK293 cells were grown to 70% confluency in 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were released from the cell culture dishes with trypsin/EDTA. Cells were then incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum to neutralize trypsin. 5 × 105 cells in 2 ml of DMEM were applied to a 6-well plate and incubated for 2 h. Cell adhesion was monitored by photographing under ×200 magnitude.Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—Culture dishes (6 cm) were covered with a layer (7 ml) of 0.5% agar in medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum to prevent the attachment of the cells to the plastic substratum. Cell suspensions (5000 cells per well) were prepared in 1.5 ml of 0.3% agar and poured into the dishes. Agar was allowed to harden for 20 min before being returned to the culturing incubator and kept for 2 weeks until colonies appeared. The dishes were then scanned with a scanner, and the number of colonies with diameters bigger than 1 mm was counted.Wound-healing Assay—Cells were grown to 90% confluency in a 6-well plate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. A wound was created by scratching cells with a sterile 200-μl pipette tip. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the floating cells, and fresh culturing medium was added. Photos of the wound were taken under ×10 magnitude microscope.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to 70% confluency, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice for 30 min in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pervanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Lysate protein concentration was estimated using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg of antibody was added to 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads was then added and incubated for another 2 h. After extensive washing, protein complex was boiled with sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were analyzed with the software ImageJ developed by the National Institutes of Health. Data shown represented the results of at least three independent experiments.Src Kinase Assay—Cell lysate (5 mg) from each cell line was incubated with anti-Src antibody (Upstate Biotech) (1 mg of lysate/10 μg of antibody) for 2 h at 4 °C. Src immunocomplexes were recovered by incubating 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose with the lysate for another 2 h. Half of the immunocomplex was subjected to immunoblotting to determine the levels of pSrc527, pSrc416, and Src protein. The other half was used to assay for Src kinase activity using enolase as a substrate as described previously (45Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with the kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2). The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg of acid-treated enolase in a 30-μl volume at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 10% gel. 32P-Labeled enolase was visualized by autoradiography.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEctopic Expression of PRL3 Promotes Cell Invasion, Proliferation, and Transformation—To begin to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which PRL3 promotes cell invasion and proliferation, we employed human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, an epithelium-derived cell line. A number of stable lines ectopically expressing wild-type PRL3 and the catalytically inactive mutant PRL3/C104S, in which the active site Cys is replaced with a Ser, were established. The levels of ectopically expressed PRL3, determined by both RT-PCR and real time quantitative RT-PCR, were in general 3–5-fold higher than that of the endogenous PRL3 in vector control cells (Fig. 1). Strikingly, it is apparent that an increase in PRL3 expression induced EMT (Fig. 2A). Thus, PRL3-expressing cells exhibited a more motile, spindle-like morphology with a loss of cell-cell contact, whereas both the vector control and PRL3/C104S cells maintained a typical spreading epithelial cell phenotype. Because EMT is commonly associated with acquisition of metastatic potential, we investigated whether PRL3 enhances cell motility. Using a standard Transwell assay to measure cell migration toward serum, we found that 37% (1.85 × 105 cells) of the PRL3(1) and 18% (8.88 × 104 cells) of PRL3(2) cells reached the bottom chamber within 16 h, whereas less than 1% (∼5 × 103 cells) of the vector control and PRL3/C104S cells migrated across the Transwell membrane (Fig. 2B). To determine whether PRL3 cells also migrate faster on the surface of the tissue culture plate, we performed wound-healing experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C, PRL3(1) cells almost completely filled the scratched area in 16 h in response to serum, whereas the vector control cells were less responsive. We also assessed the effect of PRL3 expression on cell adhesion and spreading. As shown in Fig. 2D, 2 h after plating the cells in fresh culture dishes, the majority of the PRL3(1) cells assumed a spreading morphology, although very few vector control cells did so. Taken together, the results show that elevated expression of PRL3 promotes EMT and increases cell motility. The acquisition of these motile and invasive properties is consistent with involvement of PRL3 in tumor metastasis.FIGURE 2Overexpression of PRL3 induces EMT (A), increases cell migration in Transwell assay (B), promotes wound healing (C), and enhances cell adhesion and spreading (D). Error bars are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PRL3-expressing cells also displayed accelerated growth rates versus both vector control and the PRL3/C104S cells (Fig. 3A). The doubling time of the PRL3(1) and PRL(2) cells was 16.2 and 20.4 h, whereas those of the vector control and PRL3/C104S were 26.5 and 26.0 h, respectively. In addition, the PRL3(1) and PRL3(2) cells grew to a higher density of 3.31 × 105/cm2 and 2.86 × 105/cm2, whereas the vector control and mutant cells could only reach a density of 1.24 × 105/cm2 and 1.35 × 105/cm2, respectively. We also determined the ability of PRL3 to promote anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar colony-forming assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, PRL3(1) cells gained the capacity to form colonies in soft agar, a hallmark for transformation, whereas no visible colonies were found for both the mock control and PRL/C104S cells. Collectively, these results are in complete agreement with previous observations in a number of cell lines, including HEK293 (13Wu X. Zeng H. Zhang X. Zhao Y. Sha H. Ge X. Zhang M. Gao X. Xu Q. Am.

Consequently, the established PRL3 HEK293 cell lines serve as an excellent model system to study the mechanism(s) by which PRL3 promotes cell invasion and proliferation. Because the phenotypes were more prominent in the lower expressing PRL3 clone 1, the rest of the work was focused on this clone.FIGURE 3Ectopic expression of PRL3 increases cell proliferation (A) and causes cell transformation (B). A, cells (1 × 105) were seeded into a 6-well plate and counted each day for 6 consecutive days. Error bars are representative of three independent experiments. B, 5000 cells were allowed to grow in soft agar for 2 weeks. No visible colonies formed in vector control and PRL3/C104S cells, whereas 285 colonies with diameter bigger than 1 mm were apparent in dishes containing PRL3(1) cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Up-regulation of PRL3 Leads to Src Activation—As a first step toward elucidating the cellular pathways mediated by PRL3, we measured the total protein tyrosine phosphorylation of HEK293 cells expressing vector alone, PRL3, and PRL3/C104S using anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Dramatic increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins were observed in PRL3 cells in comparison with the control or PRL3/C104S cells (Fig. 4). This is an unusual observation because PRL3 is a protein phosphatase. We hypothesized that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation in PRL3 cells may result from a PRL3-mediated dephosphorylation of an inhibitory component(s) in signaling pathways, leading to activation of one or more tyrosine kinases. Given the pleiotropic role of Src kinase in controlling cell growth, adhesion, and invasion (20Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 21Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 22Parsons S.J. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7906-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), we suspected that Src may be activated in PRL3-expressing cells. Src activity is regulated by phosphorylation at two distinct tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-416 in the kinase domain is important for maintaining Src activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of Tyr-527 in the C-terminal tail by Csk inactivates Src because of an intramolecular Tyr(P)-SH2 interaction (23Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 24Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Indeed, removal of the inhibitory phosphate from Tyr(P)-527 results in an increase in Src activity (25Cooper J.A. King C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4467-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), whereas a decrease in Tyr(P)-527 phosphorylation because of ectopic expression of PTPα produces a transformed phenotype in embryonic fibroblasts (27Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Moreover, the oncogene v-SRC, which lacks the C-terminal Tyr-527, is constitutively active and causes transformation (28Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the transforming potential of Src is suppressed by Tyr-527 phosphorylation.FIGURE 4PRL3 cells display an increased tyrosine phosphorylation profile. Cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation level was determined using PY20 antibody (BD Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the effect of PRL3 expression on Src phosphorylation, total cell lysates from the vector control, PRL3, and PRL3/C104S cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with phosphospecific pSrc416 and pSrc527 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, Tyr-527 phosphorylation in PRL3 cells decreased 73% as compared with the vector control and PRL3/C104S cells. No significant changes were observed in the levels of Tyr-416 phosphorylation and Src protein among the different cell lines. According to the discussion above, these results indicate that Src kinase is activated as a result of elevated PRL3 expression. To show directly Src activation, Src protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Src antibodies and assayed for kinase activity using enolase and [32P]ATP as substrates. As shown in Fig. 5B, Src kinase activity increased by 180% in PRL3 cells as compared with those in vector control and PRL3/C104S cells. To determine whether Src activation is required for the observed phenotypes induced by PRL3 up-regulation, we assessed the effects of Src inhibition using a specific small molecule Src inhibitor SU6656 (Calbiochem). As expected, treatment of PRL3 cells with 2.5 μm SU6656 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, a direct substrate of Src, by 73% and caused a decrease in cell migration by more than 50% (Fig. 5C), indicating that Src activity is required for the PRL3-mediated cell migration. Taken together, the results support the conclusion that up-regulation of PRL3 leads to Src activation.FIGURE 5Up-regulation of PRL3 leads to Src activation and its downstream pathways ERK1/2, STAT3, and p130Cas. A, PRL3-induced Src activation results in ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Cell lysates (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting to detect pSrc527, pSrc416, Src, pERK1/2, ERK1/2, pSTAT3, and STAT3. Vinculin was used as a loading control. B, kinase activity of Src immunoprecipitated (IP) from cell lysate measured with enolase and [32P]ATP as substrates. C, preincubation (1 h) of PRL3-expressing cells with Src inhibitor SU6656 (2.5 μm) reduces cell migration and blocks ERK1/2 activation and p130Cas phosphorylation. D, p130Cas is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated and localized at focal contacts in PRL3 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ERK1/2, STAT3, and p130Cas Are Also Activated in PRL3 Cells—To further corroborate that Src is activated in PRL3 cells, we next examined the status of a number of signaling molecules downstream of Src, including ERK1/2, STAT3, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the adaptor protein p130Cas. One of the major signaling pathways regulated by Src is mediated by ERK1/2 (20Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), which are involved in several fundamental cellular processes in cell proliferation, survival, and motility (29Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, 30Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, a dramatic increase (410%) in ERK1/2 activity was apparent in the PRL3 cells when compared with the vector control and the PRL3/C104S cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, inhibition of Src activity with SU6656 completely blocked ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that ERK1/2 is downstream of Src (Fig. 5C). The transcription factor STAT3 is a direct substrate of Src, and STAT3 is constitutively activated in Src-transformed cells (31Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In fact, STAT3 target genes are implicated in all processes of tumorigenesis, including proliferation, invasion, and migration (32Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 33Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). To determin"

Physiol. 1999; 61: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); however, at least two additional Na+/HCO3- cotransporters, the electroneutral NBCn1 and the electrogenic NBC4, are also expressed in intestinal epithelia (17Praetorius J. Hager H. Nielson S. Aalkjaer C. Friis U.G. Ainsworth M.A. Johansen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G332-G343PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Newman D. Lee I. Xu G. Kurtz I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NBCn1 is present on the basolateral membrane of small intestinal enterocytes (17Praetorius J. Hager H. Nielson S. Aalkjaer C. Friis U.G. Ainsworth M.A. Johansen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G332-G343PubMed Google Scholar) and is co-expressed with NBC1 in colonic crypts (18Seidler U. Bachmann O. Jacob P. Christiani S. Blumenstein I. Rossmann H. J. Pancreas. 2001; 2: 247-256Google Scholar), whereas the membrane localization of NBC4 has not been determined in intestinal epithelia (21Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Newman D. Lee I. Xu G. Kurtz I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To understand the role of NBC1 in transepithelial anion secretion in the intestinal tract and also to assess its importance in kidney and other tissues, we developed a mouse carrying a targeted disruption of the Slc4a4 gene. Our data show that the loss of NBC1 in mice causes severe metabolic acidosis and impaired transepithelial HCO3- secretion in the colon. These results are consistent with the known function of NBC1 in bicarbonate absorption in the kidneys and demonstrate that it also serves a major secretory function in the intestinal tract. Preparation of Targeting Construct and Generation of Mutant Mice—PCR generated fragments of the mouse Slc4a4 gene and the pMJKO vector (22Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) were used for the targeting construct. A 3.2-kb genomic fragment starting in intron 7 and ending in exon 9 was inserted into a cloning site 5′ to the promoter of the neomycin resistance gene, and a 2.3-kb fragment corresponding to sequences in intron 9 was inserted between the 3′ end of the neomycin resistance gene and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Targeting of ES cells (cells derived from 129S6/SvEv Tac (Taconic, Germantown, NY) mice) was performed as previously described (22Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). ES cells that were positive for homologous recombination were identified by Southern blot analysis of EcoRV-digested DNA using a 5′ probe corresponding to genomic sequences from intron 6. Targeted ES cells were used to generate chimeric mice that were bred with wild-type Black Swiss females (Taconic). All studies were performed using mice of the mixed 129S6/SvEv and Black Swiss background with wild-type age-matched littermates serving as controls. At ∼5 days of age, offspring were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail DNA using the following primers: a forward primer from the deleted region of intron 9 (5′-TCACAAACCTTTCAGCAAAAGAGTGC-3′) that identifies only the wild-type allele; a reverse primer from intron 9 (5′-CAAAGAGCAACAGTCAGACAGC-3′) that identifies both wild-type and mutant alleles; and a primer from the neomycin resistance gene (5′-GACAATAGCAGGCATGCTGG-3′) that identifies only the mutant allele. Amplification using DNA from a tail biopsy and all three primers in the same reaction yields 269- and 241-bp products for the wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (30 μg) isolated from tissues of 14-day-old mice using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was denatured with glyoxal, fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled NBC1 cDNA probe. Histology—Tissue samples (brain, eye, kidney, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, cecum, proximal colon, distal colon, lung, and heart) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for histological changes by light microscopy. Analysis of Blood and Blood Counts—At 14–15 days of age, NBC1+/+, NBC1+/-, and NBC1-/- pups were sacrificed by decapitation, and trunk blood was collected into heparinized tubes for analysis on a blood gas analyzer (Chiron Diagnostics model 248, Norwood, MA). Plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations were determined using flame photometry (model 480; Corning Glass). For peripheral blood counts, blood smears were obtained from the tail vein and allowed to dry. Samples were then stained for 2 min with Giemsa stain, washed in distilled water, and coverslipped using CytoSeal. Smears were analyzed for the percentage of nucleated red blood cells, myelocytes (includes myelocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), lymphocytes, and mononuclear white blood cells. Analysis of Serum Aldosterone—Mice were euthanized with CO2, and blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. Serum was separated from whole blood via centrifugation and was stored at -80 °C. Serum from two mice was pooled together and diluted 1:4 in phosphate-buffered saline; a total of 14 mice were used for each genotype. Aldosterone concentrations were determined using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Samples were counted using a γ counter (Packard Instrument Co.). BCECF Microfluorimetry—The method used for imaging intact intestinal epithelium of the cecum was based on a previously described technique for imaging epithelial cells in intact duodenum (23Gawenis L.R. Franklin C.L. Simpson J.E. Palmer B.A. Walker N.M. Wiggins T.M. Clarke L.L. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1148-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following asphyxiation in 100% CO2 and bilateral pneumothorax, the cecum of 14–18-day-old animals was removed and placed immediately in an oxygenated, ice-cold Ringer solution. The ceca were opened along the mesenteric border, and the serosa and muscularis externa were removed from the underlying mucosa as previously described (24Simpson J.E. Gawenis L.R. Walker N.M. Boyle K.T. Clarke L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G1241-G1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The muscle-stripped preparations were mounted basolateral (serosal) side up on a horizontal bilateral perfusion chamber (24Simpson J.E. Gawenis L.R. Walker N.M. Boyle K.T. Clarke L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G1241-G1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The luminal (mucosal) and serosal surfaces were independently bathed with Ringer solution containing 1 μm indomethacin to minimize the effect of endogenous prostaglandins and 10 μm forskolin (to stimulate anion secretion and basolateral anion uptake) (25Bukhave K. Rask-Madsen J. Gastroenterology. 1980; 78: 32-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Sheldon R.J. Malarchik M.E. Fox D.A. Burks T.F. Porreca F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 572-582PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the serosal bathing medium contained 0.1 μm tetrodotoxin to minimize neural tone and 1 μm EIPA to inhibit activity of the basolateral Na+/H+ exchanger. The cecal segments were incubated with 16 μm BCECF-AM for 10 min on the luminal side in a modified Krebs bicarbonate Ringer solution containing TES and 140.0 mm Na+, 114.8 mm Cl-, 5.0 mm TES, 25.0 mm HCO3-, 5.2 mm K+, 2.8 mm PO42-, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, and 16.8 mm glucose that was gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C (pH 7.4). As described previously (24Simpson J.E. Gawenis L.R. Walker N.M. Boyle K.T. Clarke L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G1241-G1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), ∼10 epithelial cells were selected for ratiometric analysis of BCECF fluorescence. During Na+ removal, the serosal surface of the tissue was bathed in a Na+-free Ringer solution containing 140.0 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 114.8 mm Cl-, 5.0 mm TES, 25.0 mm choline, 25.0 mm HCO3-, 5.2 mm K+, 2.8 mm PO42-, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, and 16.8 mm glucose (gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C, pH 7.4). Ussing Chamber Analysis—Following asphyxiation of 14–18-day-old animals in 100% CO2 and bilateral thoracotomy, proximal, and distal colon samples were removed by a midline incision and placed in oxygenated, ice-cold Ringer solution (with 1 μm indomethacin). Tissues were opened along the mesenteric border and the muscle layers underlying the mucosa of the proximal colon segments removed by sharp dissection. Distal colon segments were used with the muscle layer intact. Colons were mounted in standard Ussing chambers (0.1-cm2 exposed surface area), and the mucosal and serosal surfaces were independently bathed in 4 ml of Krebs-bicarbonate Ringer solution (37 °C, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2)as described previously (27Gawenis L.R. Boyle K.T. Palmer B.A. Walker N.M. Clarke L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G1015-G1023Google Scholar, 28Gawenis L.R. Stien X. Shull G.E. Schultheis P.J. Woo A.L. Walker N. Clarke L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G766-G784Google Scholar). For Cl- substitution experiments, gluconate was substituted on an equimolar basis. To minimize the variations in neural tone and the generation of endogenous prostanoids, tetrodotoxin (0.1 μm serosal) and indomethacin (1 μm, mucosal and serosal) were added to the bathing solutions (25Bukhave K. Rask-Madsen J. Gastroenterology. 1980; 78: 32-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Sheldon R.J. Malarchik M.E. Fox D.A. Burks T.F. Porreca F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 572-582PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin (10 μm) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm) were added to the mucosal and serosal baths of amiloride-pretreated (10 μm) tissues to stimulate intracellular cAMP prior to the sequential addition of bumetanide (100 μm) and SITS (1 mm) to the serosal side. For all experiments, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the bath Ringer solution was maintained at or below 0.1%. Transepithelial short circuit current (Isc; reported as μA/cm2 tissue surface area) was measured using an automatic voltage clamp (VCC-600; Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA) as previously described (29Clarke L.L. Harline M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G718-G726PubMed Google Scholar). Transepithelial conductance (Gt, reported in mS/cm2 tissue surface area) was determined at 5-min intervals during the experiment by measuring the magnitude of the current deflection from application of a 5-mV pulse across each tissue and applying Ohm's law. All experiments were performed under short circuited conditions with the serosal bath serving as ground. Immunoblot Analysis—Mice were euthanized, and the colons were removed, cleaned in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C until further processing. Frozen tissues were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a tissue grinder, and the tissue powder was suspended in prechilled 1× homogenization buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors). The samples were then homogenized using a Polytron 3000 homogenizer, and the proteins were allowed to solubilize over ice for 2 h. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford method. The presence of NKCC1 protein and phosphorylated NKCC1 was determined by immunoblotting after separation of lysate proteins by electrophoresis on a discontinuous, 7% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The antibodies (described in Refs. 30Lytle C. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush 3rd, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 31Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F.X. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Lytle and B. Forbush), R5 for NKCC1 that was phosphorylated on two regulatory threonine residues (a gift from Dr. Biff Forbush, Yale University), and antiactin (Sigma A4700) for the loading control. Statistics—A two-tailed unpaired Student's t test assuming equal variances was used to compare data from two treatment groups. A one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey's t test was used for comparisons among more than two treatment groups. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Materials—All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Tetrodotoxin was dissolved at a stock concentration of 100 μm in 0.2% acetic acid. Forskolin and indomethacin were dissolved at stock concentrations of 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and amiloride were dissolved at stock concentrations of 10 mm in sterile water. EIPA was dissolved at a stock concentration of 1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. Acetazolamide and SITS were dissolved at stock concentrations of 10 and 100 mm in the perfusion Ringer solution for the experiment in which they were used (i.e. Krebs bicarbonate Ringer or Cl--free Ringer solution). Bumetanide was dissolved at a stock concentration of 100 mm in ethanol. Generation of NBC1 Null Mutant Mice—The targeting procedure replaced sequences that include part of exon 9 (including the 3′ splice site), which is present in the mRNAs for both NBC1 variants, and part of intron 9 with the neomycin resistance gene (Fig. 1A). Chimeric male mice generated using the targeted ES cells were bred to wild-type females to produce NBC1+/- mice, and breeding of heterozygous mutant mice resulted in live offspring of all three genotypes (Fig. 1, B and C). Northern blot analysis of kidney, small intestine, and colon demonstrated that the NBC1 mRNA was ablated in NBC1-/- mice (Fig. 1D). Gross Phenotype—Genotype frequencies of pups obtained from heterozygous matings exhibited a normal 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio (25.9% wild type, 48.6% heterozygous, and 25.5% null mutant among more than 1000 pups), with no alteration in the percentage of male or female null mutant mice. At birth, ∼25% of NBC1-/- mice were notably smaller than their wild-type and heterozygous littermates. As they developed during the postnatal period, all of the knockouts were emaciated, exhibited severe growth retardation (Fig. 2, A and B), and their teeth had a chalky white appearance and were easily chipped. NBC1 null mutants had poor survival, with death beginning about 5 days after birth and no survival beyond 24 days (Fig. 2C). Of the knock-out pups that survived to at least 20 days of age, ∼80% exhibited mild to severe intestinal impactions in the terminal ileum, cecum, and colon; however, the intestinal tracts of mice that died at much earlier ages were not obstructed. Regardless of whether they had intestinal impactions, 12–21-day-old NBC1-null mice had small, corkscrew ceca, a phenotype that has been observed in mice lacking either the CFTR Cl- channel (32Snouwaert J.N.

https://openalex.org/W2126263683,"End binding 1 (EB1) proteins are highly conserved regulators of microtubule dynamics. Using electron microscopy (EM) and high-resolution surface shadowing we have studied the microtubule-binding properties of the fission yeast EB1 homolog Mal3p. This allowed for a direct visualization of Mal3p bound on the surface of microtubules. Mal3p particles usually formed a single line on each microtubule along just one of the multiple grooves that are formed by adjacent protofilaments. We provide structural data showing that the alignment of Mal3p molecules coincides with the microtubule lattice seam as well as data suggesting that Mal3p not only binds but also stabilizes this seam. Accordingly, Mal3p stabilizes microtubules through a specific interaction with what is potentially the weakest part of the microtubule in a way not previously demonstrated. Our findings further suggest that microtubules exhibit two distinct reaction platforms on their surface that can independently interact with target structures such as microtubule-associated proteins, motors, kinetochores, or membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2077165618,"Histone lysine acetylation is a major mechanism by which cells regulate the structure and function of chromatin, and new sites of acetylation continue to be discovered. Here we identify and characterize histone H3K36 acetylation (H3K36ac). By mass spectrometric analyses of H3 purified from Tetrahymena thermophila and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), we find that H3K36 can be acetylated or methylated. Using an antibody specific to H3K36ac, we show that this modification is conserved in mammals. In yeast, genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments show that H3K36ac is localized predominantly to the promoters of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes, a pattern inversely related to that of H3K36 methylation. The pattern of H3K36ac localization is similar to that of other sites of H3 acetylation, including H3K9ac and H3K14ac. Using histone acetyltransferase complexes purified from yeast, we show that the Gcn5-containing SAGA complex that regulates transcription specifically acetylates H3K36 in vitro. Deletion of GCN5 completely abolishes H3K36ac in vivo. These data expand our knowledge of the genomic targets of Gcn5, show H3K36ac is highly conserved, and raise the intriguing possibility that the transition between H3K36ac and H3K36me acts as an “acetyl/methyl switch” governing chromatin function along transcription units.

In eukaryotes, the regulation of chromatin structure modulates all DNA-templated processes such as DNA replication and transcription. One major mechanism that regulates the structure and function of chromatin is the covalent modification of histones. A number of different post-translational modifications are known to occur on histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation (1Berger S.L. Curr. Opin.

While the majority of these modifications are restricted to the flexible N- and C-terminal ‘tail’ domains of these proteins, a significant number of these marks have been identified in their highly structured globular domains (6Cosgrove M.S.

An additional layer of functional complexity in the acetylation or methylation of lysine residues arises from the finding that lysine residues can be targeted for both acetylation and methylation but not simultaneously. Specifically, it has been shown in mammals and fission yeast that methylation at lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9) 4The abbreviations used are: H3K9, lysine 9 on histone H3; ac, acetylation; me, methylation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChIP-chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray detection; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. serves as a binding site for the recruitment of the chromodomain protein HP1, initiating the formation of heterochromatin (28Bannister A.J.

Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). However, acetylation on H3K9 prevents this site from being methylated, thus requiring deacetylation prior to methylation for proper heterochromatin formation (30Nicolas E. Roumillac C. Trouche D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This interplay between acetylation, deacetylation, and methylation at the same site demonstrates a dynamic relationship between gene activation and repression that has the potential to occur at other histone lysine residues. However, the possibility of “dual” modifications (here “dual” denoting the choice of being either one modification or another) occurring on lysine residues outside of H3K9 has not been widely explored (31Zhang K. Tang H. Huang L. Blankenship J.W. Jones P.R. Xiang F. Yau P.M. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Previous studies have characterized lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36) as a site of methylation mediated by the methyltransferase Set2 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (32Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In its methylated form, H3K36 functions in the process of transcriptional elongation and occurs predominantly in the coding regions of genes (21Shilatifard A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Sims 3rd, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes.

Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, in addition to being a site of methylation, H3K36 can also be a target for acetylation. We find that acetylation at H3K36 is conserved in mammals and, in yeast, is localized predominantly to the promoters of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. We also find that the Gcn5-containg SAGA complex specifically acetylates H3K36 in vitro and is required for H3K36ac in vivo. Collectively, these results identify H3K36 acetylation as a conserved modification that likely functions in transcription. Because H3K36 is also a site of methylation, these data raise the intriguing possibility that the transition between H3K36ac and H3K36me (69Turner B.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 110-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) represents a novel “chromatin switch” that controls the regulation of gene transcription. Yeast Strains—The wild-type histone H3 and H3K36-to-alanine point mutation (K36A) strains were in the WZY42 background and have been described previously (34Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The TAP-tagged GCN5 and SAS3 strains were in the BY4741 background and obtained from Open Biosystems. The wild-type (DY150), gcn5Δ (DY5925) (35Yu Y. Eriksson P. Bhoite L.T. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1910-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and sas3Δ (DY8179) strains were in the W303 background and were kindly provided by David Stillman (University of Utah). Histone Preparation—Yeast, Tetrahymena, and mammalian histones were acid-extracted from purified nuclei as previously described (36Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G.

Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6726) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analyses, Tetrahymena and yeast histone H3 were purified by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC as previously described (38Medzihradszky K.F. Zhang X. Chalkley R.J. Guan S. McFarland M.A. Chalmers M.J. Marshall A.G. Diaz R.L. Allis C.D. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 872-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 39Recht J.

A. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Typically, acid-extracted core histones were separated on a C8 column (220 × 4.6 mm, Aquapore RP-300, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a linear ascending solvent B gradient of 35-60% over 75 min at 1.0 ml/min on a Beckman Coulter System Gold 126 Pump Module and 166 Detector (solvent A was 5% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 90% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). Peak fractions corresponding to H3 were collected, dried, and resuspended in water. A portion of each fraction was used to confirm the presence of purified histones by gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The remainder of the fraction was used for mass spectrometric (MS) analyses. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Mass spectrometric analyses of Tetrahymena and yeast H3 were performed as previously described with slight modifications (36Hake S.B. Garcia B.A. Duncan E.M. Kauer M. Dellaire G. Shabanowitz J. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, Tetrahymena H3 was digested with trypsin prior to propionylation, whereas yeast H3 lysines were blocked by propionylation followed by digestion with either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Derivatization of H3 with propionylation reagent converts internal lysine residues (monomethylated and endogenously unmodified residues) and the N terminus to propionyl amides causing the blockage of trypsin cleavage on the C-terminal side of lysines allowing cleavage to occur only C-terminal to arginine (40Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Digestion of Tetrahymena H3 prior to propionylation allowed for the generation of peptides distinct from that of yeast H3 improving the chances of detecting post-translational modifications. Following digestion and propionylation reactions, samples were gradient eluted (Agilent 1100 Series) directly into a Finnigan linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) at a flow rate of 100 nl/min operated in the MS/MS data-dependent mode. All MS/MS data were manually validated by inspection of b- and y-type ions. Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analyses—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed using procedures and reagents from GE Healthcare. The anti-H3K36me3 (α-H3K36me3) rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam (catalog number ab9050) and used at a dilution of 1:2,000-1:5,000. All other rabbit histone modification-specific antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and used at the following dilutions: 1:10,000 for H3K18ac (α-H3K18ac, catalog number 07-354), 1:5,000 for H3K14ac (α-H3K14ac, catalog number 07-353), and 1:15,000-1:30,000 for the C terminus of H3 (α-H3, catalog number 07-690). The H3K36ac anti-serum (α-H3K36ac, 1:1,000-1:10,000 dilution) was developed by immunizing a rabbit with a synthetic Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide specific for acetylation at H3K36 (C-APATGGVKacKPH). Typically, histones or synthetic histone H3 peptides were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels (15% for histones and 10% for peptides), followed by transfer onto poly-vinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). In some cases, membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich) to ensure proper protein transfer. After incubation with primary antibody and addition of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare), membranes were incubated with ECL-Plus substrate (GE Healthcare), and proteins were detected by exposure to x-ray films. For peptide competition experiments, the H3K36ac antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml of the following peptides: unmodified histone H3 (amino acids 1-21), K9/14ac histone H3 (amino acids 1-21), K14ac histone H3 (amino acids 1-21), unmodified histone H3 (amino acids 27-46), and K36ac histone H3 (amino acids 27-46). Peptides were either obtained from Upstate Biotechnology or synthesized and verified by mass spectrometry at the University of North Carolina Micro-protein Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis Facility. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and DNA Microarray (ChIP-chip) Analyses—ChIP assays were performed as previously described (33Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes. Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Antibodies and amounts used in the immunoprecipitations (IPs) were as follows: α-H3K36ac (2 μl/IP, available from Upstate Biotechnology as immunoaffinity purified antibody), α-H3K36me2 (3 μl/IP, Upstate Biotechnology, catalog number 07-274), and α-H3K9/14ac (3 μl/IP, Upstate Biotechnology, catalog number 06-599). Following DNA recovery, the ChIP-enriched DNA were amplified as described (41Bohlander S.K. Espinosa 3rd, R. Le Beau M.M. Rowley J.D. Diaz M.O. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, two initial rounds of DNA synthesis with T7 DNA polymerase using primer 1 (5′-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATCNNNNNNNNN-3′) was followed by 25 cycles of PCR with primer 2 (5′-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATC-3′). Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP were then incorporated directly with an additional 25 cycles of PCR using primer 2. Direct microarray hybridizations of H3K36ac ChIP versus H3K36me2 ChIP or H3K9/K14ac ChIP versus H3K36me2 ChIP were performed using standard procedures (42Iyer V.R. Horak C.E. Scafe C.S. Botstein D. Snyder M. Brown P.O. Nature. 2001; 409: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). This method allowed for the direct comparison between the histone modification patterns, which showed that H3K36ac enrichment was preferentially in the promoter regions of genes while H3K36me2 enrichment was preferentially in the transcribed regions. Additional control experiments in which the reference DNA were from H3 ChIPs (for standard nucleosome occupancy normalization), H3K36ac ChIPs from a H3K36 point mutation strain (K36A), or genomic DNA also demonstrated the H3K36ac enrichment to be promoter specific (data not shown). Following hybridizations, the arrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner, and data were extracted with Genepix 5.0 software. Data were normalized such that the median log2 ratio value for all quality elements on each array equaled zero, and the median of pixel ratio values was retrieved for each spot. Only spots of high quality by visual inspection, with at least 50 pixels of quality data (regression R2 > 0.5) were used for analysis. All data were log-transformed before further analysis. For ChIP-chip data analyses, the log2 ratio of each spot was transformed to a z-score using the formula, zx = (X - μ)/σ, where X is a retrieved spot value, μ is the mean of all retrieved spots from one array, and σ is the standard deviation of all retrieved spots from that same array. z-scores from three biological replicates were averaged. Raw data can be obtained from the University of North Carolina Microarray Data base at genome.unc.edu. Data are also available through Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE5544). Purification of Native Yeast HAT Complexes—For purification of SAGA and NuA3, 4 liters of yeast cells containing Gcn5-TAP or Sas3-TAP were grown to an A600 between 1.0 and 2.0. Cells were disrupted by glass bead-beating in a breaking buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) followed by clarification of the extract by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (43Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged proteins were purified in a one-step procedure from the extracts by directly binding the calmodulin-binding peptide component of the TAP tag to calmodulin resin (Stratagene, 200-μl beads) in the presence of CaCl2 (1 mm final concentration) at 4 °C for 4 h. All wash and elution steps were performed in 0.8-× 4-cm Polyprep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Protein-bound resin was washed two times with breaking buffer containing CaCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm. Following washes, bound proteins were eluted in twelve 250-μl fractions with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). Generally, the peak of complex elution was found in fractions 2 and 3. Purified complexes were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining, immunoblot analysis with an anti-Protein A antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and in vitro HAT assays (see below). Additionally, an untagged wild-type strain was included in the purification procedure as a control to confirm that there were no contaminating activities due to nonspecific protein interactions with the calmodulin resin. HAT Assays—Acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously with modification (43Grant P.A. Eberharter A. John S. Cook R.G. Turner B.M. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5895-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 44Mizzen C.A. Brownell J.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 675-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μl of TAP-purified SAGA or NuA3 complex (fraction 2) was incubated with either 2 μg of chicken core histones, 2 μg of recombinant mononucleosomes, or 2 μg of synthetic H3 peptides along with 30 μm unlabeled acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetyltransferase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 12 μl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. For radiolabeled HAT assays, 3 μl of TAP-purified SAGA or NuA3 complex was incubated with 2 μg of synthetic H3 peptides along with 0.125 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (2-10 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare) in acetyltransferase buffer. Reactions were allowed to proceed as described above followed by spotting of reaction products onto p81 Whatman paper (Fisher Scientific) and monitoring of 3H incorporation by scintillation counting (filter binding assay). Recombinant mononucleosomes were a gift from Song Tan (Pennsylvania State University) and consisted of Xenopus core histones that were bacterially expressed, purified, and reconstituted with the NucB region of the murine mammary tumor virus promoter. Histone H3 Is Acetylated at Lysine 36 in Tetrahymena and Yeast—Methylation at H3K36 is a highly conserved modification found in eukaryotes ranging from Tetrahymena to humans, but whether other types of modifications occur at this residue was unknown. To determine if novel modifications occur at H3K36, we analyzed H3 from Tetrahymena by tandem mass spectrometry. This organism, a ciliated protozoan, has proven useful in the discovery of other “ON” histone covalent modifications, notably H3K4me (45Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Tetrahymena H3 was purified by RP-HPLC from acid-extracted bulk histones and digested with both trypsin and chymotrypsin followed by chemical derivatization using propionic anhydride reagent (46Syka J.E. Marto J.A. Bai D.L. Horning S. Senko M.W. Schwartz J.C. Ueberheide B. Garcia B. Busby S. Muratore T. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. J. Proteome. Res. 2004; 3: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Digests were analyzed by on-line nanoflow liquid chromatography-MS/MS on a linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer. Using this platform, we determined that H3K36 is acetylated. Shown in Fig. 1A is the MS/MS spectrum of a peptide produced from the propionylated tryptic digest of Tetrahymena histone H3. The [M+2H]2+ of the parent ion is shown at m/z 542.3062. The high mass accuracy of the linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer can easily distinguish between trimethylation and acetylation on peptides (Δm = 0.0364 Da). The accurate mass of the parent ion recorded was found to be consistent with acetylation on this peptide (+0.18 ppm) and not trimethylation. Importantly, we were able to also detect H3K36 mono-, di-, and trimethylation on other H3 peptides (data not shown), confirming that this residue can be methylated or acetylated. We additionally surveyed histone H3 purified from budding yeast to determine if H3K36 acetylation might be present in this distinct unicellular organism. Using the approach mentioned above for Tetrahymena H3, we identified that yeast H3K36 was also acetylated (Fig. 1B). H3K36 acetylation was observed on a number of different peptides. Fig. 1B displays the tandem mass spectrum of the [M+2H]2+ ion at m/z 823.4552 from a propionylated digest of one such identified H3 peptide. This peptide was identified to be the 27- to 40-amino acid H3 fragment, and it was found to contain acetylation at both H3K27 and H3K36. These results identify a novel acetylation event at H3K36 that is conserved between Tetrahymena and yeast. To further investigate the occurrence of this modification, we raised an antibody against a synthetic peptide acetylated at H3K36 and analyzed Tetrahymena and yeast histones by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the α-H3K36ac antibody efficiently recognized the RP-HPLC purified Tetrahymena H3, originally analyzed by mass spectrometry. We determined the antibody to be specific for H3K36ac, because only a synthetic H3 peptide acetylated at H3K36 could selectively compete away the signal detected by the α-H3K36ac antibody (Fig. 2A). Other unmodified or acetylated H3 peptides did not compete for this antibody's detection of H3. Next, we determined if this antibody could specifically recognize acetylation at H3K36 in yeast. Yeast histones isolated by acid extraction from a wild-type or H3K36 point mutant (K36A) strain were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the H3K36ac-specific antibody. Similar to Tetrahymena, the α-H3K36ac antibody detected H3 in a wild-type yeast strain but much less so in a strain where H3K36 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 2B). However, we note that high concentrations of histones loaded in these assays results in the ability of the α-H3K36 antibody to weakly recognize the backbone of H3 (Fig. 2B, K36A lane). Nonetheless, these results confirm our MS findings that H3K36ac exists in both Tetrahymena and yeast. H3K36 Acetylation Is Preferentially Enriched in the Promoters of RNA Polymerase II-transcribed Genes Genome-wide—Next, we used a ChIP-chip approach to determine the genomic distribution of H3K36ac and how it compared with the distribution of methylation found at H3K36 (47Pokholok D.K.

Enriched genomic DNA fragments were treated with RNase, amplified, and labeled fluorescently. DNA enriched from H3K36me2 ChIPs was prepared in a similar manner, and both samples were hybridized on the same array. Three independent sets of ChIPs were performed. Using this method, we directly compared the patterns of H3K36ac and H3K36me2 using arrays that tiled continuously over the entire genome at a resolution of ∼1 kb. We observed a preferential enrichment of H3K36ac at 5′-regulatory regions (bidirectional and unidirectional promoters) relative to coding regions (open reading frames) and 3′-untranslated regions (non-coding region downstream of two convergently transcribed genes) (Fig. 3A). Significantly, the H3K36ac pattern was found to be inversely related to that of H3K36me2, which occurs preferentially in the coding region and 3′-untranslated region of genes (33Xiao T. Hall H.

Its abundant distribution in the limbic region, which participates in the control of mood and emotion and is involved in nervous system diseases such as depression and Alzheimer disease, has caused it to generate much interest. However, the cellular mechanisms of 5-HT6R are poorly understood. In the present study we found, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, that the carboxyl-terminal region of 5-HT6R interacts with the Fyn-tyrosine kinase. We also determined using a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay that this interaction was mediated through the SH3 domain of Fyn and confirmed this by co-immunoprecipitation assays in two different transfected cell lines as well as in adult rat brains. Immunocyto(histo)chemistry also showed prominent co-localization between 5-HT6R and Fyn in transfected cells and a similar distribution between 5-HT6R and Fyn in the rat brain. Based on this interaction, we further examined the modulation of 5-HT6R by Fyn and vice versa. In addition, we demonstrated that the activation of 5-HT6R activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 via an Fyn-dependent pathway.

Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, the 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) is one of the most recently discovered 5-HT receptors and, like the 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptors, is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gs proteins (5Kohen R. Metcalf M.A. Khan N. Druck T. Huebner K. Lachowicz J.E. Meltzer H.Y. Sibley D.R. Roth B.L. Hamblin M.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 6Shen Y.

Craigo S.C. Choudhary M.S. Uluer A. Monsma Jr., F.J. Shen Y. Meltzer H.Y. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1403-1410PubMed Google Scholar, 13Boess F.G. Monsma Jr., F.J. Carolo C.

The abundant distribution in limbic region, which participates in the control of mood and emotion, and high affinity for antipsychotic and antidepressant compounds implies its significant roles in the CNS. Several functional studies have also implicated 5-HT6R in learning and memory disorders (14Woolley M.L. Bentley J.C. Sleight A.J. Marsden C.A. Fone K.C.

However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for 5-HT6R-mediated physiological responses are poorly elucidated. Therefore, to identify the function of 5-HT6R and its cellular mechanisms in the CNS, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen system on a human brain cDNA library, with the carboxyl terminus of 5-HT6R as bait and found that the Fyn-tyrosine kinase is bound to 5-HT6R. Fyn is a member of the Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (20Semba K. Nishizawa M. Miyajima N. Yoshida M.C. Sukegawa J. Yamanashi Y. Sasaki M. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl.

Recently, the physiological importance of Fyn has been suggested in the CNS. Using fyn- mutant mice, it was shown that a Fyn deficiency results in various neuronal defects, including defective long-term potentiation, impaired spatial memory, increased fearfulness, and ethanol sensitivity (24Grant S.G.

It is also reported that Fyn is involved in Alzheimer disease through the modulation of microtubule-associated tau and amyloid β (27Bhaskar K. Yen S.H. Lee G. J. Biol.

The kinase activity of Fyn is regulated by the two best-characterized tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-420 and Tyr-531. The Tyr-420 site undergoes autophosphorylation, which activates full kinase activity, but phosphorylation of the Tyr-531 site inhibits kinase activity through an intramolecular interaction between phospho-Tyr-531 and the SH2 domain, which stabilizes a non-catalytic conformation (33Resh M.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of Fyn (Fyn-SH3 domain), consisting of ∼60 residues, is the best-characterized domain for Fyn-mediated protein-protein interaction (33Resh M.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Fernandez-Ballester G. Blanes-Mira C. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal region of 5-HT6R contains the conserved PXhPXR amino acid sequence (X, any amino acid; h, hydrophobic amino acid), which is known as a class II ligand for the Fyn-SH3 domain (35Fernandez-Ballester G. Blanes-Mira C. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of 5-HT6R is bound with Fyn, in particular the Fyn-SH3 domain, and that the Tyr-420 site of Fyn kinase is functionally regulated by the activation of 5-HT6R. Furthermore, we examined the downstream signaling modulated by the activation of 5-HT6R and found that the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) via a Fyn-dependent pathway is one of targets in 5-HT6R-mediated signaling pathways. Plasmid Constructs—Full-length non- or HA-tagged human 5-HT6R cDNA in pcDNA3.1 were purchased from UMR cDNA Resource Center (Miner Circle Rolla, MO). cDNA fragments encoding the carboxyl terminus (CT) of 5-HT6R were subcloned (primer; Fw, 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG CCA CTC TTC ATG-3′, Rv, 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GTT CGT GGG-3′) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of Gal4 DNA binding domain vector, pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A human brain cDNA library in the GAL4 activation domain vector pACT2 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Full-length Fyn was subcloned (primer; Fw, 5′-CCG GAA TTC ACC ATG GGC TGT GTG C-3′, Rv, 5′-CGC GGA TCC TTA CAG GTT TTC ACC-3′) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) from the human brain cDNA library. His-CT plasmid was constructed by cloning the CT region (amino acids Pro321–Asn440) from pcDNA3.1/5-HT6R into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pET28a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). GST-SH2 and GST-SH3 plasmids were constructed by cloning the SH2 (amino acids Trp149–Cys246) and SH3 (amino acids Thr82–Ser143) domains from pcDNA3.1/Fyn into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Myc-tagged SH3 plasmid was constructed by recloning from pGEX4T-1/SH3 into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag 3B vector. Plasmid constructs were generated by standard PCR amplification methods, and the subcloned DNA fragments were systematically checked by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). The bait plasmid, pGBKT7/CT of 5-HT6R, was stably expressed in yeast strain AH109 and did not have a self-transcriptional activity. The prey plasmid, human brain cDNA library/pACT2, was transformed into yeast strain Y187. The corresponding AH109 yeast strains (MATα) were mated with the Y187 yeast strain (MATa). The diploid colonies were plated on a nutritionally selective plate deficient in adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) to screen the library. False positives were eliminated using two reporters, ADE2 and HIS3, and MEL1-encoding β-galactosidase was assayed on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) indicator plates. Doubly positive clones were isolated and characterized by DNA sequencing. β-Galactosidase activity for a yeast two-hybrid assay was measured using a β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech). Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Pulldown Assay— His-CT plasmid was transformed into the bacterial host strain BL21 (DE3) and induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C during midlog phase. GST, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3 plasmids were also expressed under the same conditions except with the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). His-CT proteins were purified using His·Bind column (Novagen). GST, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3 proteins were immobilized by glutathione gel, and GST pulldown assays were performed using the Profound Pull-down GST Protein:Protein Interaction kit (Pierce). Bound His-CT proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST (1:5000; Novagen) and anti-His6 antibodies (1:5000; Roche Diagnostics). For His-mediated pulldown assays using rat brain lysates, brain lysates were prepared from age- and weight-controlled adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (60–70 days old, 230–260 g). Rat brain was homogenized in 10 ml of lysis buffer A (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 0.32 mm sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to yield a crude membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer A and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. Separately, purified His-CT proteins were immobilized using a His·Bind-agarose resin, and the His-mediated pulldown assay was performed using the Profound Pull-down Poly-His Protein:Protein Interaction kit (Pierce). Immobilized His-CT proteins were incubated with the prepared brain lysates. Bound rat brain proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-Fyn (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and anti-His6 antibodies (1:5000). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were transiently transfected with human 5-HT6R and Gα15 G-protein in the absence or presence of Fyn using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Naiöve Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO/K1) and 5-HT6R stably expressed CHO (CHO/5-HT6R) cells (CHO/5-HT6R), which were kindly provided by Dr. M. Teitler (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY), were grown in F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). G418 (400 μg/ml) was additionally used in CHO/5-HT6R cells. For transient transfection, cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes and transfected with Fyn, Myc-SH3, or HA-5-HT6R using PolyFect® transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 or CHO/K1 cells were gently lysed with lysis buffer B (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. The soluble lysates were incubated with 4 μg of anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or anti-Fyn (Cell Signaling) antibodies for 6 h at 4 °C and then with 50 μl of ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G Plus (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed 6 times. Immune complexes were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (1:1000) or anti-Fyn (1:1000) antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitation using rat brain lysates, brain lysates were prepared as described in His-mediated pulldown assays. The soluble lysates from rat brain were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of a specific antibody (anti-5-HT6R (GeneTex Inc., San Antonio, TX), anti-Fyn (Upstate), or control rabbit IgG antibodies) and 50 μl of AminoLink® Plus Coupling Gel from Pro-Found Mammalian Co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) for 6 h or overnight at 4 °C and washed five times. Immune complexes were eluted using IgG elution buffer (Pierce) or by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer, detected, and immunoblotted anti-Fyn (1:2000). Immunocyto(histo)chemistry—For immunocytochemistry, HEK293 or CHO/5-HT6R cells were grown on culture slides (BD Biosciences), fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times in PBS, and preheated using antigen retrieval buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl and 5% (w/v) urea, pH 9.5). The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, washed 3 times in PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Then HEK293 cells were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with anti-HA (1:500; Cell Signaling) and anti-Fyn (1:500; Cell Signaling) antibodies, and CHO/5-HT6R cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-5-HT6R (1:50; GeneTex) and anti-Fyn (1:50; Upstate) antibodies. Next, the cells were washed 3 times and incubated with rabbit IgG (FITC) and mouse IgG (rhodamine) secondary antibodies (1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times, mounted on glass slides using CRYSTAL/MOUNT™ (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and viewed on a confocal LSM 510 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Goöttingen, Germany). For immunohistochemistry, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were sectioned at 10 μm in a cryostat at -20 °C. Sections were collected on a coated glass slide and dried at room temperature before being returned to -70 °C for storage. Slides were post-fixed with acetone for 30 min on ice. Slides were processed as described above, under “Immunocyto(histo)chemistry,” except that slices were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; anti-mouse or anti-rabbit; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and developed with diaminobenzidine (Roche Diagnostics). Assay of 5-HT6R Activity Using a FDSS6000 System—For assay of 5-HT6R activity, we used a FDSS6000 96-well fluorescence plate reader. HEK293 cells seeded at a density 5 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with human 5-HT6R and Gα15 protein in the absence or presence of Fyn using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection cells were seeded into 96-well black wall clear-bottom plates at a density of 60,000–80,000 cells/well, and 5-HT6R activity was measured the next day. The cells were loaded with 5 μm fluo-4/AM and 0.001% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a HEPES-buffered solution (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 13.8 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Cells were washed 3 times with the HEPES buffer and remained in a volume of 80 μl per well. During the whole procedure, cells were washed using the BIO-TEK 96-well washer (BIO-TEK instruments, Winooski, VT). After at least 10 min of incubation time, cells were assayed with the FDSS6000 system. After determination of a short base line, 10 μm or various indicated doses of 5-HT were added to HEK293 cells, and the calcium response was measured at 480 nm. All data were collected and analyzed using the FDSS6000 and the related software (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Surface Biotinylation—After 24 h of transfection, biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed using Pinpoint Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm plates were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline to quench and remove free biotin reagents and lysed in lysis buffer (Pierce). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with 50 μlof a 50% slurry of Immobilized NeutrAvidin for 3 h at 4 °C. Reaction complexes were washed three times with wash buffer (Pierce) and two more times with PBS, and then biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling) to detect 5-HT6R, anti-Fyn (1:1000; Cell Signaling), and anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma) antibodies. Fyn Kinase Activity Assay—CHO/5-HT6R cells were gently lysed with lysis buffer B containing 2 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm Na4P2O7. Total protein concentration was determined by the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 25 μl of AminoLink® Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce) followed by immunoblotting with anti-Fyn (1:200) and anti-pY416 Src (1:3000; Upstate) that cross-react with phospho-Tyr-420 Fyn. Phospho-ERK1/2 Assay—After CHO/5-HT6R cells were kept in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 16 h, the cells were treated with 5-HT or pretreated with the indicated drugs and lysed in lysis buffer B containing 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 10 mm NaF. Equal amounts of lysate were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-ERK1/2 (1:500; Cell Signaling) and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling) antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and the membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1.5 h at room temperature. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit 1:15,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature and visualized using the ECL kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Statistical Analysis—The intensity of the bands was measured using the AlphaEase program (Version 5.1, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and analyzed using the GraphPad Prism Version 4 program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All numeric values are represented as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the data was determined using Student’s unpaired t test. Significance was set at p < 0.05, and the values of P for significant differences are indicated in the text and figure legends. Identification of Fyn as a 5-HT6R-binding Protein Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System—To identify the function of 5-HT6R and its cellular mechanism in the CNS, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the CT of human 5-HT6R as bait. After screening the human brain cDNA library, we identified that Fyn-tyrosine kinase interacted with the CT of 5-HT6R. To confirm this specific interaction, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using CT cDNA (bait) transformed in the AH109 yeast strain and full-length Fyn cDNA (prey) transformed into the Y187 yeast strain as shown Fig. 1A. When both the AH109 and Y187 yeast strains were mated, a blue color was detected with the β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the interaction between the CT of 5-HT6R and Fyn is positive. Fyn Interacts with 5-HT6R in Vitro and in Vivo—First, the specificity of the interaction between the CT of 5-HT6R and Fyn, especially the Fyn-SH3 domain, was biochemically investigated using a GST pulldown assay. After GST, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3 were expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 2A), GST, GST-SH2, and GST-SH3 were immobilized by glutathione gel. His6-tagged CT protein was incubated with the glutathione gel bound to GST, GST-SH2, or GST-SH3. Purified His-CT protein interacted with GST-SH3 but not GST or GST-SH2 (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the CT of 5-HT6R selectively interacts with the SH3 domain but not the SH2 domain of Fyn in vitro. Second, we attempted to determine whether full-length 5-HT6R selectively binds to Fyn in mammalian cells using an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. After full-length HA-tagged 5-HT6R (HA-5-HT6R) was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Fyn antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, the transfected HA-5-HT6R was able to bind to endogenous Fyn (second lane) in the HEK293 cells, whereas no signal was detected from non-transfected cells (first lane). When co-immunoprecipitation was performed in reverse with anti-Fyn antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies, the result was the same (Fig. 2C, third lane). We next examined whether this specific association between 5-HT6R and Fyn was also present in CHO/K-1 cell lines. After HA-5-HT6R and Fyn were transfected into CHO/K-1 cells, the immunoprecipitation was performed with either anti-HA or anti-Fyn antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2D, HA-5-HT6R was co-immunoprecipitated with both exogenous (second and third lanes) and endogenous Fyn (fourth lane), whereas no signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from non-transfected cells (first lane). These results suggest that the specific binding of 5-HT6RtoFyn occurs in mammalian cells. Although the interaction between two proteins was validated in transfected mammalian cells, the association of two proteins in native tissues was still undetermined. We, therefore, examined the interaction between 5-HT6R and Fyn from rat brain lysates using His pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. We first showed that purified His-CT proteins of 5-HT6R pulled down Fyn proteins from rat brain lysates, whereas there was no signal when non-immobilized resin was used (Fig. 2E). The interaction between 5-HT6R and Fyn was next examined using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The cell lysates from whole rat brain were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-5-HT6R or anti-Fyn antibodies, and subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-Fyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 2F, 5-HT6R selectively binds to endogenous Fyn (third lane) in the rat brain, whereas no signal was detected in immunoprecipitates from control IgG antibody (second lane). These results consistently show that 5-HT6R associates with Fyn in native tissues. Co-localization and Immunohistochemistry of 5-HT6R andFyn—A common requirement for specific physical and functional interaction between 5-HT6R and Fyn is that they must be positioned in close proximity. Therefore, we next determined whether both proteins are co-localized in the same cellular compartment in HEK293 cells and 5-HT6R stably expressed CHO (CHO/5-HT6R) cell lines, which were later used for functional assays of 5-HT6R and Fyn, respectively. First, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-5-HT6R along with (Fig. 3B) or without Fyn (Fig. 3"
https://openalex.org/W2053712835,"The acetylating enzyme, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, participates in polyamine homeostasis by regulating polyamine export and catabolism. Previously, we reported that overexpression of the enzyme in cultured tumor cells and mice activates metabolic flux through the polyamine pathway and depletes the N1-acetyltransferase coenzyme and fatty acid precursor, acetyl-CoA. Here, we investigate this possibility in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase transgenic mice in which the enzyme is systemically overexpressed and in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase knock-out mice. Tissues of the former were characterized by increased N1-acetyltransferase activity, a marked elevation in tissue and urinary acetylated polyamines, a compensatory increase in polyamine biosynthetic enzyme activity, and an increase in metabolic flux through the polyamine pathway. These polyamine effects were accompanied by a decrease in white adipose acetyl- and malonyl-CoA pools, a major (20-fold) increase in glucose and palmitate oxidation, and a distinctly lean phenotype. In SSAT-ko mice, the opposite relationship between polyamine and fat metabolism was observed. In the absence of N1-acetylation of polyamines, there was a shift in urinary and tissue polyamines indicative of a decline in metabolic flux. This was accompanied by an increase in white adipose acetyl- and malonyl-CoA pools, a decrease in adipose palmitate and glucose oxidation, and an accumulation of body fat. The latter was further exaggerated under a high fat diet, where knock-out mice gained twice as much weight as wild-type mice. A model is proposed whereby the expression status of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase alters body fat accumulation by metabolically modulating tissue acetyl- and malonyl-CoA levels, thereby influencing fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation.

For the most part, polyamines do not incorporate into macromolecules but rather bind electrostatically to negatively charged molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and phospholipids. Thus, as metabolically distinct entities, homeostatic control of intracellular polyamines is critical to their role in supporting cell proliferation. This is achieved by effector systems that regulate biosynthesis, catabolism, uptake, and export of these molecules. The enzyme, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to the terminal amines of polyamines and, thus, readies the molecule for export or catabolism via polyamine oxidase. The enzyme is short lived, sensitively regulated by intracellular polyamine pools, and highly inducible by polyamine analogues and various cytotoxic agents (1Seiler N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although most antiproliferative strategies targeting the polyamine pathway seek to deplete intracellular pools by inhibiting biosynthesis, we have been investigating the alternative approach, of activating SSAT-mediated polyamine acetylation (3Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our initial expectation was that acetylation of polyamines would facilitate export and catabolism, leading to pool depletion and inhibition of cell growth. In the absence of a selective inducer of SSAT activity, we used genetic approaches to overexpress SSAT and test this hypothesis. Those studies detected an apparent linkage between polyamine homeostasis and fat metabolism (4Kee K. Foster B.A. Merali S. Kramer D.L. Hensen M.L. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Vujcic S. Mazurchuk R.V.

More specifically, conditional overexpression of SSAT in prostate tumor cells inhibited cell growth in a manner that correlated with depletion of acetyl-CoA pools (5Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S.

This occurs via a metabolic scenario whereby SSAT overexpression gives rise to a compensatory increase in polyamine biosynthesis and sustained metabolic flux (Fig. 1) through the biosynthetic and catabolic arms of the polyamine pathway (4Kee K. Foster B.A. Merali S. Kramer D.L. Hensen M.L. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Vujcic S. Mazurchuk R.V. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

More particularly, acetylation of polyamines promotes their degradation and export out of the cell as we predicted. However, this initial decline in Spd or Spm pools gives rise to derepression of the biosynthetic enzymes, ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (ODC and SAMDC, respectively). By providing a continuous supply of polyamines for acetylation and export, this deregulated metabolic cycling depletes the SSAT co-factor acetyl-CoA and restricts its availability for fatty acid biosynthesis. The associated growth inhibition is presumed to be linked to impaired fat-dependent processes, such as membrane biosynthesis and energy regulation, although these possibilities have not yet been investigated. Consistent with this interpretation, we note that transgenic overexpression of SSAT in mice is associated with a distinctly lean phenotype (7Pietilaö M. Alhonen L. Halmekytoö M. Kanter P. Jaönne J.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 877-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In agreement with our findings, a Finnish group has also associated altered SSAT expression with altered metabolic flux (9Jaönne J. Alhonen L. Pietilaö M. Keinaönen T.A. Uimari A. Hyvoönen M.T. Pirinen E. Jaörvinen A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, Rodriguez-Caso et al. (10Rodriguez-Caso C. Montanez R. Cascante M. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Medina M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21798-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently used mathematical modeling to conduct an in silico analysis of polyamine metabolism and arrived at the prediction that altered SSAT activity will affect acetyl-CoA availability. The following studies examine the relationship between polyamine and fat metabolism more closely by comparative studies with SSAT wild-type (SSAT-wt), SSAT overexpressing transgenic (SSAT-tg), and SSAT knock-out (SSAT-ko) mice (11Niiranen K. Pietilaö M. Pirttila T.J. Jarvinen A. Halmekytoö M. Korhonen V.P. Keinanen T.A. Alhonen L. Jaönne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25323-25328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), all in the C57BL/6 background. The hypothesis being tested is that by controlling flux through the polyamine metabolic pathway, SSAT modulates levels of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, thereby influencing fat homeostasis and accumulation of body fat. The possibility that SSAT expression status may affect fat metabolism could have implications for controlling obesity. The importance of the latter is clearly indicated by the fact that within the past 5 years, the health risks associated with obesity have risen to levels exceeding those of tobacco or alcohol consumption (12Sturm R. Health Aff. (Millwood). 2002; 21: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 13Stein C.J. Colditz G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2522-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Breeding of Mice—Mice were maintained in the C57BL/6 background for more than 10 generations. SSAT-tg mice carry ∼10-20 copies of the full-length murine Sat1 gene and express elevated levels of SSAT enzyme activity in most tissues (7Pietilaö M. Alhonen L. Halmekytoö M. Kanter P. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The transgene is under the endogenous, murine SSAT promoter. Carriers of the transgene are readily identified by hair loss, which begins at ∼3-4 weeks of age. Because female SSAT-tg mice are infertile except at a very young age, the line is maintained by breeding male SSAT-tg mice with SSAT-wt C57BL/6 female mice. Mouse embryonic stem cells, which carry a targeted inactivating mutation within the X-linked Sat1 gene, were used to generate the SSAT-ko mice (11Niiranen K. Pietilaö M. Pirttila T.J. Jarvinen A. Halmekytoö M. Korhonen V.P. Keinanen T.A. Alhonen L. Jaönne J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25323-25328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of the SSAT-ko allele (located on the X chromosome) was determined by standard PCR techniques. Through interbreeding, we developed female SSAT-ko mice with the SSAT gene homozygously deleted, which, when bred with SSAT-ko male mice, yield 100% SSAT-ko pups (6Tucker J.M. Murphy J.T. Kisiel N. Diegelman P. Barbour K.W. Davis C. Medda M. Alhonen L. Jaönne J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Berger F.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5390-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phenotypic characterization was performed at or around 30 weeks, since pilot studies revealed phenotypic differences in fat accumulation between SSAT-tg, SSAT-wt, and SSAT-ko mice at this age. Polyamine Metabolism—Tissues (i.e. liver and white adipose tissue (WAT)) were excised, snap-frozen, and stored at -70 °C for less than 2 weeks before analysis. Frozen tissues were crushed into a fine powder using a Bio-Pulverizer (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK). Tris/EDTA (pH 7.0) breaking buffer was added to ∼50-100 mg of sample for sonication and centrifugation to obtain the soluble supernatant extracts used in enzyme and polyamine pool analyses. SSAT activity was assayed radiochemically as described previously (3Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

Both ODC and SAMDC activities were determined by a CO2 trap assay as described previously (3Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Kee K. Vujcic S. Merali S. Diegelman P. Kisiel N. Powell C.T. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. J. Biol.

For polyamine pool analysis, buffered tissue extracts were further extracted with an equal volume of 1.2 n perchloric acid. Solubilized extracts were then dansylated and analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using methods refined by Kramer et al. (14Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This methodology detects and quantifies Put, Spd, and Spm and the SSAT products, AcSpd, N1-acetylspermine (AcSpm), and N1-,N11-diacetylspermine, an important SSAT product first reported in mammalian systems by the Porter laboratory (3Vujcic S.

Urinary Polyamines—Excreted mouse urine was collected from hand-held mice by pipette. The volume was brought to 205 μl and extracted with 0.6 m perchloric acid for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and neutralized with 220 μl of 2 m Na2CO3. Polyamines were dansylated and separated as described above. The levels of polyamines in urine were normalized to urinary creatinine measured using a kit (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were expressed as μg of polyamines/mg of creatinine. Measurement of Acetyl-CoA and Malonyl-CoA—The separation and quantitation of acetyl-CoA in biological samples follows the high performance capillary electrophoresis assay of Liu et al. (15Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as described previously (3Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P. Gan G. Kramer D.L. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38319-38328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with some modifications to separate malonyl-CoA and separate it from interfering peaks. Cells were lysed and processed by Sep-Pak plus solid phase extraction. Purified extracts were then analyzed on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system (Fullerton, CA) equipped with a photodiode array detector and an uncoated fused silica CE column of 50-μm inner diameter and 60 cm in length with 50 cm from inlet to the detection window (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). Electrophoretic conditions were as described by Liu et al. (15Liu G. Chen J. Che P. Ma Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the capillary was preconditioned with 0.1 m NaOH and Milli-Q water for 5 min each at 20 p.s.i. and then equilibrated with 100 mm NaH2PO4 separating buffer containing 0.1% β-cyclodextrin (pH 6.0) for 10 min. After each run, the capillary was rinsed with 1 m NaOH, Milli-Q water, and running buffer for 3 min each. The injection was done hydrodynamically at a pressure of 5 p.s.i. for 10 s. Injection volume was calculated using CE Expert Lite software from Beckman. Separation voltage was -30 kV at a constant capillary temperature of 15 °C. In order to establish the standard calibration curves, solutions containing acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and the internal standard (isobutyryl-CoA; 41 nmol) were prepared at concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 nmol. Standards were processed as described above for cell lysates and resuspended in 15 μl of water. The detector response (r > 0.99) for all acetyl-CoA species was within the above concentration range. Coenzymes A were monitored with a photodiode array detector at the maximum absorbance wave-length (253.5 nm). Data were collected and processed by Beckman P/ACE 32 Karat software version 7.0. Cellular acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels were expressed as nmol/106 cells. Fat Content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—Whole body fat quantitation in mice was carried out using a 4.7-Tesla, 33-cm horizontal bore MR magnet (GE NMR Instruments, Fremont, CA) incorporating AVANCE digital electronics and a 72-mm radio frequency quadrature coil (Bruker BioSpec platform with Paravision® version 3.02 operating system; Bruker Medical, Billerica, MA). Prior to imaging, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and positioned in the MR scanner. Animals were screened for fat/water ratios using MR spectroscopic methods. Spectroscopic data were converted from time domain to frequency domain using a Fourier transformation and base line-corrected with polynomial fitting (MestReC 4.4.6; Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The spectra were referenced by assigning the chemical shift of the water peak to 4.74 ppm, and the relative concentrations of water and fat protons were calculated by integrating the area under the peaks with ranges of 2.0-9.0 ppm for water and ∼1.0-2.0 ppm for fat. Following determination of fat/water ratios, representative animals from each group were selected for whole body imaging. Whole body, high resolution three-dimensional images were acquired using a T1-weighted, fast spin-echo imaging protocol that resulted in high contrast, hyperintense signal from adipose tissue versus nonadipose tissue due to the short T1 relaxation time and the intrinsic hyperintensity of fat with fast spin-echo imaging techniques (16Henkelman R.M. Hardy P.A. Bishop J.E. Poon C.S. Plewes D.B. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging. 1992; 2: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Image segmentation of fat from whole body data sets was performed through the creation of object maps using Analyze 5.0 (Analyze Direct, Lenexa, KS). Three-dimensional, whole body surface renderings were created from segmented image data using commercially available software (Amira 3.1; Mercury Computer Systems, Chelmsford, MA). Adipose tissue was rendered opaque as a yellow surface, whereas the whole mouse body was rendered partially transparent with a transparency value of 0.7. Serum Leptin Analysis—Analysis of serum leptin levels (17Wang A.Y. Hickman I.J. Richards A.A. Whitehead J.P. Prins J.B. Macdonald G.A. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 100: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was performed at the Mouse Metabolic Phenotypic Center (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) following protocol instructions to a commercially obtained ELISA-based kit (DuoSet; R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Whole Body Calorimetry—Experiments were performed with the assistance of the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (Dr. Owen McGuiness, Nashville, TN) following standard methodologies (18Yu X.X. Barger J.L. Boyer B.B. Brand M.D. Pan G. Adams S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E433-E446PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole body oxygen volume (VO2) and carbon dioxide volume (VCO2), heat, and respiratory exchange ratio were measured continuously for 21 h in single animal cages using conscious mice in the Oxymax Deluxe System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Fatty Acid and Glucose Oxidation—Palmitate and glucose oxidation were measured on liver slices and WAT spreads as described by Roduit et al. (19Roduit R. Nolan C. Alarcon C. Moore P. Barbeau A. Delghingaro-Augusto V. Przybykowski E. Morin J. Massé; F. Massie B. Ruderman N. Rhodes C. Poitout V. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Liver and abdominal fat pad WAT were excised and placed in cold KRB buffer (pH 7.4), and liver samples were sliced manually to ∼1-mm thickness. Liver slices and white fat spreads were weighed and placed in KRB buffer at 37 °C for 2 h with one of the following substrates: 10 mm glucose containing 1 μCi of d-[U-14C]glucose for glucose oxidation studies or 0.5 mm sodium palmitate containing 1 μCi of [1-14C]palmitate for fatty acid oxidation studies. A sealed test tube was filled with an insert containing 0.3 ml of NaOH to trap radiolabeled CO2 released from the reaction mixture over a 2-h period. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl added to the mixture, and samples were then allowed to incubate for 45 min at 37 °C. The CO2 traps were removed and added to 7.5 ml of scintillation fluid. Activities were expressed as nmol/g of tissue/h. High Fat Diet—The synthetic high fat diet used for the diet-induced obesity model was composed of 60% fat calories, 20% carbohydrate calories, and 20% protein calories (5.2 kcal/g) as obtained from Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ) (stock number D12492i). Control animals were fed a diet of standard rodent chow composed of 13% of calories from fat, 58% from carbohydrate, and 29% from protein (4.1 kcal/g) (Prolab RMH 2500, PMI Nutrition International, Inc., Brentwood, MO). Mice began consumption of experimental diets immediately postweaning at 5-6 weeks of age and were monitored weekly for food consumption and weight gain for up to 30 weeks of age. Previous studies have shown significant differences in accumulation of abdominal fat in C57BL/6 mice within 2 weeks of high fat diet feeding (20Van Heek M. Compton D.S. France C.F. Tedesco R.P. Fawzi A.B. Graziano M.P. Sybertz E.J. Strader C.D. Davis Jr., H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Statistics—Analysis of data obtained from the three mouse groups was performed using a Dunnett’s test within the one-way analysis of variance framework, where α level was reduced from 0.05 to 0.025. Unless indicated otherwise, p values typically derive from comparisons of SSAT-tg or SSAT-ko mice with SSAT-wt mice. Tissue Polyamine Metabolism—Mice were first compared for the effect of altered SSAT expression on various aspects of polyamine metabolism. As reported earlier (7Pietilaö M. Alhonen L. Halmekytoö M. Kanter P. Jaönne J. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18746-18751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), global overexpression of SSAT (SSAT-tg) was found to produce a significant increase in polyamine biosynthesis at the levels of ODC and SAMDC activities. In that previous study, ODC activities were increased 4-10-fold relative to SSAT-wt in various tissues, with ODC being more affected than SAMDC. Here, we analyzed enzyme activities in liver and WAT, which was not included in our earlier study (Table 1). SSAT activity was increased >4-fold in both tissues, leading to at least a 2-3-fold increase in ODC and SAMDC activities. Deletion of SSAT (SSAT-ko) lowered acetylation activity in both liver and WAT but did not completely eliminate it due to the presence of nonspecific acetylating enzymes (21Porter C.W. Ganis B. Libby P.R. Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3715-3720PubMed Google Scholar). In general, ODC and SAMDC activities were not remarkably affected in SSAT-ko mice. Polyamine pools, including those of acetylated polyamines, were also measured in the same tissues noted above and found to provide a clearer indication of metabolic activity (Table 1).TABLE 1Tissue polyamine enzymes and pools as affected by mouse SSAT expression statusMouse (at 30 weeks)Polyamine enzyme activitiesPolyamine poolsTissueSSAT statusSSATODCSAMDCPutSpdSpmAcSpdaN1-acetylspermidine; neither N1-acetyspermine nor N1, N12-diacetylspermine was detectable in any sample.nmol/min/mgμmol/mg/hμmol/mg/hpmol/μg proteinLiver (n ≥ 6)ko20 ± 714 ± 793 ± 1533 ± 77,632 ± 592bDunnett’s test, p < 0.05 relative to SSAT-wt.8,563 ± 998<10wt30 ± 1011 ± 591 ± 448 ± 85,966 ± 7327,705 ± 440<10tg160 ± 32cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.29 ± 8194 ± 27cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.2,210 ± 114cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.9,696 ± 575cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.3,891 ± 466cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.270 ± 45cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.WAT (n ≥ 7)ko147 ± 76<5<5314 ± 16813,725 ± 14205,976 ± 739<10cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.wt344 ± 97<5<5623 ± 24412,849 ± 2,0324,856 ± 1291<10tg1,276 ± 408bDunnett’s test, p < 0.05 relative to SSAT-wt.41 ± 17bDunnett’s test, p < 0.05 relative to SSAT-wt.73 ± 32cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.8,122 ± 1,702bDunnett’s test, p < 0.05 relative to SSAT-wt.9,635 ± 2,1632,832 ± 79496 ± 6cDunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt.a N1-acetylspermidine; neither N1-acetyspermine nor N1, N12-diacetylspermine was detectable in any sample.b Dunnett’s test, p < 0.05 relative to SSAT-wt.c Dunnett’s test, p < 0.005 relative to SSAT-wt. Open table in a new tab As previously reported (6Tucker J.M. Murphy J.T. Kisiel N. Diegelman P. Barbour K.W. Davis C. Medda M. Alhonen L. Jaönne J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Berger F.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5390-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), transgenic overexpression of SSAT led to variable tissue-specific shifts in Spd and/or Spm pools and a consistent increase in Put pools indicative of increased ODC activity and SSAT-facilitated use of the back-conversion pathway (see Fig. 1). Spm pools were decreased in liver and WAT and Spd pools were increased in both tissues. The fact that the polyamine pools were not depleted is due to the compensatory increase in polyamine biosynthesis, as indicated by elevated ODC and SAMDC activities noted above. Further indication of metabolic cycling was evidenced by the tissue accumulation of the SSAT product AcSpd in liver and WAT. There was no comparable accumulation of DASpm or AcSpm, perhaps, because they were rapidly oxidized by polyamine oxidase. These same trends were previously noted in the initial characterization of the SSAT-tg mice (6Tucker J.M. Murphy J.T. Kisiel N. Diegelman P. Barbour K.W. Davis C. Medda M. Alhonen L. Jaönne J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Berger F.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5390-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In SSAT-ko mice, polyamine pools were only marginally affected. As expected, acetylated polyamines were absent, and nonacetylated polyamine pools remained roughly similar to those of SSAT-wt mice with the exception of Put, which was modestly decreased (p ≤ 0.145). Urinary Polyamines—The relatively low levels of acetylated polyamines in liver and WAT of SSAT-tg mice are consistent with the understanding that these molecules are either rapidly oxidized by polyamine oxidase or transported out of the cell. Relevant to the latter, we measured urinary polyamine levels among the SSAT variant mice as a systemic sum total of SSAT activity and polyamine metabolic flux within the mouse. As shown in Table 2, Put was by far the predominant polyamine found in SSAT-wt urine, followed by Spd and Spm. Put is known to be especially high in male mouse urine due to an androgen-inducible kidney ODC (22Pajunen A.E.I. Isomaa V.V. Jaönne O.A. Bardin C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8190-8198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In SSAT-tg mice, the main perturbation was a large increase in AcSpd, reflecting the synthesis and export of massive amounts of the acetylated polyamines by various tissues. In SSAT-ko and SSAT-wt urine, AcSpd was difficult to quantify due to low levels and a competing unidentified peak thought to be N8-acetylspermidine (23Seiler N. Knodgen B. Bartholeyns J. Anticancer Res. 1985; 5: 371-377PubMed Google Scholar). There was also a significant decrease in Put and an increase in Spd in SSAT-ko urine. The latter may represent a compensatory response to the inability of these mice"

Our results suggest that the proteasome promotes a dynamic turnover of transcription factor and Pol II binding at tissue-specific gene domains in ES cells, thereby restricting permissive transcriptional activity and keeping the genes in a potentiated state, ready for activation at later stages. Accurate developmental regulation of transcription is critical for the establishment and maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in higher eukaryotes. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the ability to activate all somatic gene expression programs during their differentiation into various lineages, and consequently they are able to give rise to every cell type in the body. This property, which is termed pluripotency, raises important questions about how transcriptional competence of lineage-specific genes is maintained at the ES cell stage. There is evidence that in ES cells, tissue-specific genes are primed for transcription at later stages of development and that this is important for maintaining pluripotency (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L.

Dillon N. The epigenetic basis for embryonic stem cell pluripotency.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This primed state is characterized by a generally hyperdynamic state of ES cell chromatin (Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T.

A dynamic switch in the replication timing of key regulator genes in embryonic stem cells upon neural induction.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At the same time, localized regions of active histone modifications form early transcription competence marks (ETCMs) in ES cells, and these epigenetic marks have been shown to act as centers for transcription factor recruitment (Figure 1A) (Szutorisz et al., 2005aSzutorisz H. Canzonetta C. Georgiou A. Chow C.M. Tora L. Dillon N. Formation of an active tissue-specific chromatin domain initiated by epigenetic marking at the embryonic stem cell stage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1804-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Chromatin modification, general transcription factor (GTF) recruitment, and preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly are key control points for regulating transcription, because they specify where and at which time point RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription will be initiated. Site- and stage-specific control of PIC formation presents a particular problem in the permissive chromatin environment of ES cells. In fact, PIC assembly has been shown to be restricted to specific regulatory elements, colocalizing with the ETCM regions (Szutorisz et al., 2005bSzutorisz H. Dillon N. Tora L. The role of enhancers as centres for general transcription factor recruitment.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 593-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there are mechanisms that restrict nonspecific transcription factor binding in undifferentiated cells. The proteasome has recently been implicated in the dynamic control of factor binding to transcriptionally active promoters (Collins and Tansey, 2006Collins G.A. Tansey W.P. The proteasome: a utility tool for transcription?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The 26S proteasome is a highly conserved protease that plays a central role in the control of protein stability in eukaryotic cells. The 26S proteasomal complex is organized into two subcomplexes, the 20S proteolytic core and the 19S regulatory particle (Figure 1B). The 20S core is composed of four rings of α-type and β-type subunits with the two inner β rings having proteolytic activity (Groll et al., 2005Groll M. Bochtler M. Brandstetter H. Clausen T. Huber R. Molecular machines for protein degradation.ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 222-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 19S complex is divided into two components, the base and the lid. The base contains ATPases and nonenzymatic subunits, whereas the proteins that form the lid are thought to be responsible for substrate recognition (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the proteasome is involved in two different types of mechanism for regulating active promoters. One of these functions depends on the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome, which facilitates transcriptional elongation by mediating turnover of promoter bound activators and allowing the initiating RNA polymerase to escape from the promoter (Lipford et al., 2005Lipford J.R.

Rosenfeld M.G. Controlling nuclear receptors: the circular logic of cofactor cycles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also identified a second function for the 19S complex, which has been proposed to modulate factor recruitment independently of the 20S core by inducing conformational changes in the targeted proteins (Ferdous et al., 2001Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. The 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome is required for efficient transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II.Mol.

These studies highlight the involvement of the proteasome in the regulation of transcription at fully active genes. Here we show that proteolytic degradation by the proteasome has a previously undescribed role in controlling transcription factor binding to regulatory regions of cell type-specific gene domains in ES cells. At the pluripotent stage, where tissue-specific gene loci are maintained in a state that is competent for future expression but are still inactive, stable binding of transcription factors and Pol II to specific sequence elements is suppressed by the activity of the proteasome. This mechanism involves direct targeting of the proteasome to intergenic sequences and restricts permissive transcription in ES cells. We hypothesized that turnover of transcription factor binding at tissue-specific genes might be a key element that would contribute to maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. Removal of initiation complexes by the proteasome would be a potential mechanism for restricting transcriptional activity in permissive chromatin. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of chemical inhibition of proteasome activity on transcription of a tissue-specific locus in mouse embryonic stem cells. The VpreB1 and λ5 genes (Figure 1A) are activated during the early stages of B cell development under the control of a multicomponent locus control region (LCR); they are fully expressed in pre-B cells and silent in mature B cells (Sabbattini and Dillon, 2005Sabbattini P. Dillon N. The lambda5-VpreB1 locus–a model system for studying gene regulation during early B cell development.Semin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Low-level, permissive transcription is also detectable in the locus in ES cells (Szutorisz et al., 2005aSzutorisz H. Canzonetta C. Georgiou A. Chow C.M. Tora L. Dillon N. Formation of an active tissue-specific chromatin domain initiated by epigenetic marking at the embryonic stem cell stage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1804-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether transcriptional activity of the λ5-VpreB1 locus in pluripotent stem cells is controlled by the proteasome, ES cells were treated with inhibitors that block the proteolytic activity of the 20S core. The effect of proteasome inhibition on transcript levels at different regions in the locus was analyzed in ES cells and was compared with the effect on the active locus in pre-B cells and in mature B cells where the locus is silenced (Figure 1C). Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and changes in transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) during a 10 hr time course. Propidium-iodide- (PI) staining followed by FACS analysis showed that an 8 hr incubation in 20 μM MG132 did not substantially affect cell survival (Figure S1A). No significant morphological changes were observed in the cultures (Figure S1B), and FACS analysis of Oct-4 expression confirmed that short-term proteasome inhibition did not lead to ES cell differentiation (Figure S1C). Because we were primarily interested in the functioning of regulatory elements and it is known that increased noncoding RNA transcription can be a hallmark of PIC assembly, the analysis focused mainly on the gene promoters and intergenic regulatory sequences. A dramatic increase in transcript level was observed in ES cells only and was restricted to two regions of the locus (Figure 1C, values are shown as relative differences). One of the sites of increased transcription corresponds to an intergenic element that has been shown to have enhancer activity at the pre-B cell stage (Minaee et al., 2005Minaee S. Farmer D. Georgiou A. Sabbattini P. Webster Z. Chow C.M. Dillon N. Mapping and functional analysis of regulatory sequences in the mouse lambda5-VpreB1 domain.Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The second affected region extends from the λ5 promoter into the λ5 gene and includes both introns (Figure 1C, bottom panel). A small increase was also detected in the introns of the λ5 gene in mature B cells but not at the intergenic element. No significant change was found in the active locus in pre-B cells. Treatment with a different proteasome inhibitor (lactacystine) resulted in a similar pattern of increased transcription in ES cells (Figure S2A). Control treatments with the protease inhibitor leupeptin and the lysosome inhibitor ammonium-chloride did not lead to any increase in transcription (Figure S2B). No increase in transcript levels was detected when primers that amplify spliced λ5 RNA (spanning the second intron of the gene) were used (Figure 1D), indicating that the induced transcripts are not properly processed or initiated from the main transcription start site (TSS). It is particularly interesting that one of the regions where transcription is affected by proteasome inhibition in ES cells colocalizes with the ETCM, which is a center for factor binding during cell differentiation. As the λ5-VpreB1 genes are activated during commitment to the B cell lineage, the chromatin in the ETCM region undergoes remodeling and the resulting local accessibility is reflected in the early appearance of two DNase I hypersensitive sites, HS7 and HS8 (Szutorisz et al., 2005aSzutorisz H. Canzonetta C. Georgiou A. Chow C.M. Tora L. Dillon N. Formation of an active tissue-specific chromatin domain initiated by epigenetic marking at the embryonic stem cell stage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1804-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Increased transcript levels after chemical inhibition suggest the involvement of the 20S core proteasome. To dissect the role of individual subunits, expression of two core subunits was knocked down using siRNAs. ES cells were transfected with siRNAs against either the β4 or the β7 subunits, and the effect was monitored at 4 hr intervals (Figure 2A). Specificity of the knockdown was demonstrated by the fact that there was no significant change in TATA binding protein (TBP) levels and by transfection with control siRNAs against GAPDH. Transfection with the β4 or β7 siRNAs slowed the growth of the cells at late time points (Figure S3A), similar to the effect of chemical inhibition. Knock-down of either the β4 or β7 subunit of the 20S proteasome resulted in a highly specific increase in transcripts in the intergenic region (Figure 2B), confirming the effect that was observed using chemical inhibitors. The slightly different timing of the increase might be due to differential physiological responses of the cells to the loss of distinct proteasome subunits, affecting, e.g., transcription rate or RNA stability at the 38 hr time point. It is notable that, compared to chemical inhibition, the promoter region of the λ5 gene was less dramatically affected by the specific knockdown of the β4 and β7 subunits (compare Figures 1C and 2B). Together with the strong induction at the HS7/8 enhancer after specific knockdown of 20S proteasome proteins, this suggests that there could be site-specific recruitment of different proteasome subunits. Two explanations can be put forward to explain the change in transcriptional activity in the intergenic region following proteasome inhibition. One possibility is that there is an increased transcription rate that might involve more frequent reinitiation cycles from already active promoters due to lower turnover of activator binding. The other potential explanation is de novo activation of previously inactive promoters, and this would be reflected in the appearance of new initiation sites. In order to investigate whether proteasome inhibition leads to new initiation events in ES cells, transcription start sites in the λ5-VpreB1 locus were mapped by 5′ RACE following proteasome inhibition (strategy is shown in Figure S4A). RACE-PCR products were cloned and sequenced to determine the 5′ ends. The location of the transcription start sites is shown in Figure 3A. Consistent with our previous analysis (Szutorisz et al., 2005aSzutorisz H. Canzonetta C. Georgiou A. Chow C.M. Tora L. Dillon N. Formation of an active tissue-specific chromatin domain initiated by epigenetic marking at the embryonic stem cell stage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1804-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), transcripts that initiated correctly from the main λ5 TSS were not found in untreated ES cells, and a cluster of antisense (opposite direction to the λ5 gene) transcripts in the ETCM/HS8 region was observed. A number of new initiation sites were identified following inhibition of proteasome activity (Figures 3A and S4B). The most prominent group of start sites (transcribing in the sense direction) was found within an 800 bp region between HS7 and the λ5 promoter. No initiation sites were observed in this region in untreated cells. Another tightly localized cluster of antisense start sites was identified in the HS8 region. There was also a significant change in the pattern of initiation at HS8 with the 5′ ends reorganized into a single, discrete cluster. Transcription start sites were not detected in the HS7 region. Instead, de novo initiation events were found upstream and downstream of HS7, resulting in bidirectional transcription. These results could be explained by the presence of a strong bidirectional promoter in the HS7/8 region, which is suppressed by the proteasome in ES cells. The third cluster of start sites (transcribing in the sense direction) was detected in the first exon and intron of the λ5 gene. The pattern of initiation sites described above is consistent with the effect of proteasome inhibition on transcript levels (Figure 1C). The finding that proteasome inhibition gives rise to new intergenic transcription initiation sites in ES cells suggested that the proteasome might be involved in suppressing preinitiation complex formation. To investigate this hypothesis, the binding profile of several initiation factors was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The TBP and TBP-associated factors 5 and 10 (TAF5 and TAF10) can be components of the TFIID or the TBP-free TAF-containing (TFTC) complexes (Muller and Tora, 2004Muller F. Tora L. The multicoloured world of promoter recognition complexes.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transformation-transactivation-domain-associated protein (TRRAP) is a coactivator in different histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes (Frank et al., 2003Frank S.R. Parisi T. Taubert S. Fernandez P. Fuchs M. Chan H.M. Livingston D.M. Amati B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20405-20412Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Brg1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex (Muchardt and Yaniv, 2001Muchardt C. Yaniv M. When the SWI/SNF complex remodels…the cell cycle.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). All of these factors are expressed ubiquitously (Figure S5A) and are known to play important roles in the assembly of PICs. The results obtained for untreated cells are shown in Figure S5. Consistent with our previous results, the main sites of Pol II binding in ES cells are at the promoter of the Topo3β gene and in the intergenic region between the VpreB1 and λ5 genes (Figure S5B). In pre-B cells, the active λ5-VpreB1 domain is characterized by high-level, locus-wide transcription factor binding (Szutorisz et al., 2005aSzutorisz H. Canzonetta C. Georgiou A. Chow C.M. Tora L. Dillon N. Formation of an active tissue-specific chromatin domain initiated by epigenetic marking at the embryonic stem cell stage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1804-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In mature B cells, where the VpreB1 and λ5 genes are silent, some Brg1, TAF10, and Pol II binding was still detectable in the locus (Figure S5D). Inhibitor treatment results in three types of specific effects. Firstly, binding of factors to the λ5-VpreB1 locus is increased by proteasome inhibition only in ES cells (Figure 3B) and mature B cells (Figure 3D) where the genes are inactive. Proteasome inhibition resulted in increased binding of TBP, TRRAP, Brg1, and Pol II in these cell types. Binding was not significantly affected in pre-B cells, where transcription of the VpreB1 and λ5 genes is fully active (Figure 3C). Secondly, it is only in ES cells that increased Pol II binding is detected in the locus, consistent with the observation that proteasome inhibition at the ES cell stage results in elevated transcript levels in the intergenic region (Figures 1C and 2B). The third feature of the effect of proteasome inhibition on factor binding and transcription is the localization of much of the increased binding of TBP, Brg1, TRRAP, and Pol II to the intergenic region between the VpreB1 and λ5 genes in ES cells. One possible explanation for the increased binding of factors in ES cells would be a globally higher protein level in the cell due to proteasome inhibition. MG132-treatment results in accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins and an increase in the level of Mdm2, which is known to be a target for the proteasome (Figure 3E). However, western blot analysis of extracts from MG132-treated ES cells showed no significant increase in Brg1, TBP, and Pol II levels (Figure 3E). This, together with the fact that increased binding was only observed at some sites (Figure 3B), indicates that proteasome inhibition affects specific binding rather than global stability of these factors in ES cells. In mature B cells, where the λ5-VpreB1 locus is silenced, levels of Pol II binding (Figure 3D) and transcription (Figure 1C) showed only a very modest change, despite the presence of increased TBP and TRRAP binding. This could be a consequence of a less accessible chromatin structure and the binding of tissue-specific repressors in differentiated cells. We were interested in establishing whether the HS7/8 region might be able to affect transcription of other sequences in the locus at the ES cell stage. To test the effect of the HS7/8 fragment on transcription, the fragment was inserted upstream of the λ5 promoter linked to a promoterless human β-globin gene (Figure 3F) and analyzed by transient transfection of ES cells (Figure 3G). The λ5 promoter-reporter construct was expressed at low levels in ES cells, and insertion of the HS7/8 fragment resulted in a greater than 6-fold increase in reporter transcription. RACE analysis of 5′ ends showed that the transcripts initiate from the β-globin gene and not from the HS7/8 region (data not shown). These results suggest that the HS7/8 fragment contains positive regulatory sequences that can influence transcriptional activity of other regions of the locus in ES cells. Site-specific regulation of transcription by the proteasome raises the question of how the proteasome targets the affected regions in ES cells. To address this question, ChIP analysis was carried out to investigate the binding of different 20S and 19S subunits to the intergenic region of the λ5-VpreB1 locus. The 20S core complex subunits α4, β4, and β6 and the 19S proteasome subunits Rpt6 and Rpn12 were chosen for analysis. Rpt6 is an ATPase that is located in the base of the 19S particle and has been linked to proteolysis-independent transcriptional regulation (Figure 1B). Rpn12 is a nonenzymatic component of the lid, which has been suggested to participate in substrate recognition (Figure 1B) (Wilkinson et al., 2000Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. Analysis of a gene encoding Rpn10 of the fission yeast proteasome reveals that the polyubiquitin-binding site of this subunit is essential when Rpn12/Mts3 activity is compromised.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All five proteasome subunits are expressed at equal levels in ES cells and differentiated cell types (Figure 4A). In the absence of proteasome inhibition, binding of the 20S subunit α4 was observed in the region of the enhancer where HS7 forms at later stages of B cell development (Figure 4B, left). Lower levels of α4 and β4 occupancy were found in the HS8 region. No significant binding of 19S subunits was detectable under these conditions. When ES cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (Figure 4B, right), no increase was detected for α4 and β4, suggesting a relatively stable binding of these proteins, but a large increase in the binding of the core subunit β6 and the lid subunit Rpn12 was observed with the biggest difference detected in the HS7 region (Figure 4B, right). This dramatic increase indicates a highly dynamic regulation of recruitment and release of β6 and Rpn12 that depends on proteasome activity. Comparison of proteasome subunit binding in ES cells and differentiated cells showed that the recruitment of the proteasome to regulatory regions is a specific feature of ES cells (Figure S6). These data lead us to conclude that the control of transcription factor binding at a tissue-specific locus in ES cells involves direct recruitment of proteasome subunits to the sites where regulation occurs. It is particularly interesting that α4 and β4 binding to the intergenic region is observed in ES cells in the absence of proteasome inhibition, whereas significant β6 and Rpn12 occupancy is only detectable when proteasome activity is inhibited. These distinct binding profiles suggest a differential control of recruitment of proteasome subunits or subcomplexes to intergenic regulatory regions. To test this hypothesis, siRNA-mediated knockdown of individual components of the proteasome was combined with ChIP analysis of different subunits (Figure 4C). ES cells were transfected with siRNA targeted to the β4 core subunit. Following 26 hr of incubation, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added to half of the transfected ES cells. After an additional 8 hr, the cells were harvested and the binding pattern of proteasome subunits was analyzed by ChIP. Knockdown of β4 resulted in a substantial reduction in the binding of the 20S proteasome subunit α4 in the absence of proteasome inhibition. β4 knockdown also abolished the binding of β6 that is observed following chemical proteasome inhibition. These data suggest a cooperation between different subunits of the core complex in the assembly of the 20S proteasome at the targeted region. In addition, knockdown of β4 resulted in an altered profile of Rpn12 occupancy after MG132 treatment. Rpn12 binding was completely lost from the λ5 promoter region and reduced at HS7, but no significant change was detected at HS8, suggesting that Rpn12 can be recruited to the HS8 region independently of the binding of the core proteasome. These results point to the existence of two different types of targeting, as follows: (1) Rpn12 recruitment downstream of HS8 that depends on the binding of core proteasome subunits and (2) a core subunit-independent recruitment of an Rpn12-containing subcomplex to the HS8 region. It is notable that HS8 is also a center for GTF and Pol II recruitment in ES cells, suggesting that at least some Rpn12 binding to HS8 might be associated with the formation of the PIC. To gain a better insight into the role of Rpn12 in the recruitment of the proteasome to the intergenic region, we used siRNA to directly target Rpn12 expression (Figure 4D). Knockdown of Rpn12 slowed down ES cell growth (Figure S3B) and resulted in increased levels of intergenic transcripts in the HS8 enhancer region (Figure 4E), similar to the effects that were observed following chemical proteasome inhibition and knockdown of 20S proteasome subunits (compare Figure 1, Figure 2 with Figure 4E). The ChIP analysis (Figure 4F) showed that knockdown of Rpn12 abolished binding of α4 and also blocked the increase in β6 recruitment under conditions of proteasome inhibition. These data suggest that Rpn12 is part of the proteasomal complex that plays a critical role in suppressing permissive transcription in ES cells. The cooperation of the 20S proteasome with the lid subunit Rpn12 in this mechanism raises additional questions about the involvement of other subunits of the 19S complex in the regulation of permissive transcription. Therefore, we tested whether ATPases, which are located in the base of the 19S proteasome (Figure 1B), also participate in assembly of the proteasomal complex and suppression of intergenic transcription by targeting expression of one of the ATPases, Rpt3 (Figures 5A and S3C). Knockdown of Rpt3 again showed increased levels of intergenic transcripts (Figure 5B). Interestingly, binding of the α4 core proteasome subunit was not abolished, but an altered binding pattern was observed (compare Fi"

The immunoglobulins of jawed vertebrates are a large family of proteins with enormous sequence and structural diversity that can specifically recognize a virtually unlimited number of antigens (1Jung D. Giallourakis C. Mostoslavsky R. Alt F.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 541-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).

In the lamprey, a large repertoire of VLR genes is reported to be generated from a single germ line VLR gene by genomic rearrangement of flanking LRR (leucine-rich repeat) cassettes. Hagfishes have two germ line VLR genes, called VLR-A and VLR-B, that produce comparably diverse receptor repertoires (3Pancer Z. Saha N.R. Kasamatsu J. Suzuki T. Amemiya C.T. Kasahara M. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9224-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). An individual lymphocyte cell of the sea lamprey expresses a unique VLR protein in a monoallelic manner that can specifically recognize the corresponding antigen in the humoral response. When lampreys were immunized with a mixture of antigen and mitogen, the titer of VLR protein specifically interacting with the antigen increased dramatically in the plasma; this was accompanied by an increase of VLR-positive large lymphocytes in the blood samples (2Pancer Z.

Hagfish and lamprey are the only surviving jawless fishes belonging to the cyclostome taxon and appear to be the earliest creatures with an adaptive immune system (5Delarbre C. Gallut C. Barriel V.

They have lymphocyte-like cells comparable with those of jawed vertebrates; these cells express various genes reminiscent of the mammalian adaptive immune system (8Gilbertson P. Wotherspoon J. Raison R.L. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1986; 10: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Mayer W.E. Uinuk-Ool T. Tichy H. Gartland L.A. Klein J. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequences of VLR proteins are completely unrelated to those of the immunoglobulins. They have a variable number of the LRR modules that are frequently found in the innate immune receptors of multicellular organisms (2Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The LRR domains of VLRs contain a signal peptide, an N-terminal cap (LRRNT), a variable number of LRR modules, and a C-terminal cap (LRRCT). A threonine/proline-rich stalk and a hydrophobic tail region are attached to the C-terminal end of the LRRCT. Based on sequence alignment and variability, the LRR modules are subdivided into LRR1, LRRV (LRR variable), LRRVe (LRR variable end) and LRRCP (LRR connecting peptide) modules (4Alder M.N. Rogozin I.B. Iyer L.M. Glazko G.V. Cooper M.D. Pancer Z. Science. 2005; 310: 1970-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In a sequence analysis of 517 sea lamprey VLR and 139 pacific hagfish VLR-A clones, the number of LRRVs varied between 0 and 7 (average: 1.31) and 1 and 5 (average: 3.1), respectively (4Alder M.N. Rogozin I.B. Iyer L.M. Glazko G.V. Cooper M.D. Pancer Z. Science. 2005; 310: 1970-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The enormous diversity of VLRs derives from differences in the number and sequence of the LRR modules. To gain a precise structural insight into the diversity and antigen specificity of the VLR receptors, we performed a crystallographic study of inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri VLR-A and -B proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—VLRs (Eb7VLRA.29, residues 1-292; Eb8VLRB.59, residues 1-234; Eb8VLRB.61, residues 1-200) fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 were expressed in Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen). The primer sequences user for the cloning of the VLR-As are 5′-actacggatccATGATGGGTCCGGTCTTGGCTGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-actac gcggccgctATTTGGAGAGACGCAATCTGAGGCCGC-3′ (reverse). The primer sequences used for the cloning of the VLR-Bs are 5′-actacggatccATGAAGTTCGCACTGAGAGGAACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-actacgcggccgctAGTAGGGCAGATGATACTTCGGACGGG-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were inserted between the BamHI and the NotI sites of the pVL1393 recombinant baculovirus expression vector (BD Pharmingen). The Fc tag was cloned between the NotI and the BglII sites of the vector using primers 5′-actacgcggccgcCTGGTTCCGCGTGGTTCCGAGCCCAAATCTTGTGAC-3′ and 5′-atccaagatctTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGA-3′. The secreted VLR and Fc fusion proteins were purified using protein A-Sepharose (APBiotech) affinity chromatography. The Fc tag of the fusion protein was removed overnight with 0.5% (w/w) thrombin at 4 °C, and the cleaved VLRs were further purified using ion exchange chromatography and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (APBiotech). All VLR proteins were eluted as monomers in the gel filtration chromatography. They were concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl buffer and used for crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown at 22 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization buffer. Final crystallization conditions were 33% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 5.5, for Eb7VLRA.29; 33% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 5.5, for Eb8VLRB.59; and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for Eb8VLRB.61. Crystals suitable for diffraction experiments were formed after 1 week. For data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen at -170 °C in the crystallization buffer supplemented with 30% glycerol. The diffraction data were collected at the 4A beam line of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory and the ID29 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed using the HKL package (11Otwinowski Z.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). For each VLR target, three entries with the highest sequence homology were selected from the PDB data base using the BLAST server (www.ncb.nih.gov) and tested as probes in the molecular replacement calculation. Among these, the LRR structures of the Nogo receptor (PDB code 1OZN) (14He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and glycoprotein Ibα (PDB code 1M10) (15Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G.

Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) gave the lowest initial R-factors for Eb7VLRA.29 and Eb8VLRB.61, respectively, and were employed as search probes (supplemental Fig. 1). The LRRNT and LRRCT modules of the search probes were removed before molecular replacement. Some of the LRR modules in the probes were also removed to match the number of LRR modules in the target VLRs and search probes. The initial models of the VLRs were refined with the program CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), and the refined models were used to calculate the electron density maps (supplemental Fig. 2). The electron density maps corresponding to the LRRNT and LRRCT modules were clearly visible in the calculated maps, and the atomic models were built with the program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). For Eb8VLRB.59 we generated an artificial probe based on the Eb8VLRB.61 structure. The LRRV2 modules were duplicated and inserted between the LRRV2 and LRRV3 modules of Eb8VLRB.61. To make room for the inserted LRR, residues from LRRV3 to LRRCT were shifted ∼4.5 Ä while retaining the curvature and the twist of the horseshoe shape. The resulting structures were further refined. Ramachandran plots calculated with the final structures have no non-glycine residues in the generously allowed and prohibited regions. Homology Modeling and Prediction of Protein Interaction Surfaces—The sequences of the inshore hagfish VLRs were downloaded from the GenBank™ data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Model structures for the entire 84 E. burgeri VLR sequences (supplemental Table 1) were either taken from the crystal structures or generated by homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL (swissmodel.expasy.org) server in the first approach mode (18Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The SWISS-MODEL server requires both template structures and target sequences for automatic homology modeling. For VLRs containing a number of LRRV modules different from those of the crystallized VLRs, template structures were generated by deleting or inserting LRRV modules in the experimentally determined structures. To estimate the accuracy of the modeling we generated a template structure for Eb8VLRB.61 based on the structure of Eb8VLRB.59 by deleting one LRRV module. The model, generated by the SWISS-MODEL server, could be superimposed on the experimentally determined structure with a Cα r.m.s. deviation of 0.85 Ä. The 81 VLR models and three experimentally determined VLR structures were submitted to the PPI-Pred (protein-protein interface prediction) (19Bradford J.R. Westhead D.R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and ProMate (20Neuvirth H. Raz R. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) servers to predict the protein-protein interaction surface. The default score configuration (atoms distribution, chemical character, amino acid pairs distribution, evolutionarily conserved positions, non-regular secondary structure length, sequence distances within a circle, secondary structure, hydrophobic patch rank, water molecules) was used for the ProMate calculation. Sequence Variability Analysis—For reliable sequence alignment, VLRs with an equal number of LRRV modules were chosen for analysis. For VLR-A, all 43 inshore hagfish VLR-A sequences with three LRRV modules in the Swiss-Prot data base were aligned using the ClustalW program (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The structural model generated by homology modeling and the aligned sequence file were submitted to the ConSurf server (22Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The conservation scores were calculated using an empirical Bayesian method. For VLR-B, the structure of Eb8VLRB.61 and 10 inshore hagfish VLR-B sequences with two LRRV modules were analyzed using the ConSurf server. The calculation was repeated with Pacific hagfish VLRs, and similar results were obtained. Structure Determination—We determined the crystal structures of three inshore hagfish VLRs (Table 1). The GenBank™accession numbers are ABB21039 for clone Eb7VLRA.29, AAZ16360 for clone Eb8VLRB.59, and AAZ16361 for clone Eb8VLRB.61. The “stalk domain” was not included in the crystallized proteins because its amino acid sequence is invariant and therefore unlikely to be involved in antigen recognition. The structures of Eb7VLRA.29 and Eb8VLRB.61 were determined by the molecular replacement technique using the reported structures of the Nogo receptor and glycoprotein Ibα as search probes, respectively. The LRRNT and LRRCT modules of the search probes were removed before making the molecular replacement calculations, because their structures are predicted to differ from those of their VLR counterparts. The refined atomic model of Eb8VLRB.61 was used for the molecular replacement calculation of Eb8VLRB.59. The Structure of VLR-A—Eb7VLRA.29 adopts a horseshoelike solenoid structure common to LRR family proteins (Fig. 2). The LRR modules of all VLR proteins possess 24-amino acid repeats of consensus XLXXLXXLXLXXNXLXXLPXXXFX. Eb7VLRA.29 contains 8 modules of the LRR repeats including LRR1, LRRV1 to V5, LRRVe and LRRCP. Conserved LXXLXLX repeats form the concave surface containing 8 parallel β-strands. The remaining 17 amino acids of the consensus sequences form a short 310 helix and connecting loops in the convex part of the molecule. The VLR-A LRR sequence shows strict length conservation with virtually no insertions or deletions. The only exception is the last LRR module, LRRCP, which has only 16 amino acid residues, because the convex region of LRRCP is replaced by the LRRCT module. Structurally, VLR-A belongs to the “typical” subclass of the LRR family; the asparagine ladder and phenylalanine spine found in other typical LRR proteins are present in the VLR-A structure (23Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The conserved leucines and phenylalanines are involved in forming the extended hydrophobic core. The hydrophobic cores of LRR proteins are usually capped with cysteine-rich N- and C-terminal modules called LRRNTs and LRRCTs, respectively. VLR-A also contains these capping modules. The LRRNT module of VLR-A contains a β-hairpin structure stabilized by two disulfide bridges, whereas the LRRCT of VLR-A belongs to the CF1 class and contains a characteristic α-helix and two disulfide bridges. The Structure of VLR-Bs—Eb8VLRB.61 contains five LRR modules and also belongs to the “typical” subclass of the LRR family (23Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The leucines forming the hydrophobic core and the asparagines and phenylalanines involved in the asparagine ladder and phenylalanine spine, respectively, are strictly conserved (Fig. 3A). The LRR modules of VLR-B and VLR-A can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of the Cα positions of less than 0.84 Ä (Fig. 3, B and C). The disulfide bridges in the LRRNT and LRRCT modules are found at similar locations. However, these modules show recognizable structural variations from those of VLR-A. The β-hairpin structure in the LRRNT of VLR-B is considerably shorter because of amino acid deletions between the disulfide bridges. The backbone structure of the C-terminal α-helix is conserved in the LRRCT modules of both the VLR-B and VLR-As. However the structure and orientation of the connecting loops differ. The structure of Eb8VLRB.59 is highly homologous to that of Eb8VLRB.61 except that it has one additional LRRV module and an eight-amino acid insertion in the LRRCT module (Fig. 4A). The two structures can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of the Cα positions of less than 0.49 Ä (Fig. 4, B and C). The addition of the LRRV module does not cause detectable changes in the radius or twist of the horseshoe structure, and the effect of the eight-amino acid insertion in the LRRCT module is limited to the local area, with a minimal effect on the overall structure of the protein. Structure of Other VLR Proteins—Our structural studies of the three hagfish VLR proteins demonstrate that the structures of their LRR modules are highly homologous and their backbone atoms can be accurately superimposed. The VLRs of several other jawless fish, the Pacific hagfish and three lamprey species, have been reported (2Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Pancer Z. Saha N.R. Kasamatsu J. Suzuki T. Amemiya C.T. Kasahara M. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2005; 310: 1970-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although the LRRNT and LRRCT modules show significant interspecies sequence variation, key residues in their LRR modules are strictly conserved; the leucines and phenylalanines in the hydrophobic core and asparagines and prolines important for the convex structure are strictly conserved in all known VLR sequences. The length of the LRR modules is practically invariant, and the deletion or addition of residues is extremely rare. This high sequence conservation suggests that our structures are likely to represent the LRR structures of the entire repertoire of jawless fish VLRs. Prediction of the Antigen Binding Site—Identification and structural analysis of the antigen binding site is important for understanding the function of the VLR proteins. Because there is no reported antigen and hagfish VLR complex, experimental identification of the antigen binding site is not yet possible. Therefore we tried to predict the antigen binding site by sequence and structure analysis. Sequence variability analysis has proved to be useful for identifying antigen binding sites in immunoglobulins and MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules (25Reche P.A. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 623-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Analysis of the VLR sequences shows variable patches in both the concave and convex surfaces (Fig. 5). However, the variable patches on these two surfaces are differently distributed; the variable patches in the concave surfaces are clustered together forming a large hypervariable surface, whereas those in the convex surfaces are small and scattered over the surface. As shown for immunoglobulins, the antigen binding site of VLR is likely to form an extended surface for binding globular proteins. Therefore, our variability analysis indicates that the concave surface is the best candidate for the antigen binding site of VLRs. The hypervariable antigen binding loops of immunoglobulins contain an unusually high percentage of tyrosines (26Collis A.V. Brouwer A.P. Martin A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Tyrosine appears to be important for protein interactions, because it is hydrophobic but can be exposed on the protein surface. We analyzed 66 inshore hagfish VLR-A sequences and 18 VLR-B sequences in the Swiss-Prot data base. In the VLR-As, 9.1% of the amino acids on the concave surfaces are tyrosines compared with 2.1% in the VLR-A proteins as a whole. In the VLR-Bs the corresponding frequencies are 11.7 and 3.4%, respectively. A similar pattern was found in the VLRs of Pacific hagfish and sea lamprey. The high frequency of tyrosine residues in the concave surface supports the hypothesis that it is the antigen binding site. Bradford and Westhead (19Bradford J.R. Westhead D.R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) recently reported a new prediction method, PPI-Pred, for protein-protein interaction surfaces. This technique utilizes the shape, electrical property, hydrophobicity, and aromaticity of the protein surface for prediction, and its success rate is reported to exceed 70%. We applied this technique to predict the antigen binding site in the VLRs. For this analysis we built 81 models of the inshore hagfish VLRs using the SWISS-MODEL automatic homology modeling server, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table 2, the concave surface is predicted to be either the most probable or the second most probable surface for protein interaction. In contrast, the convex surface is consistently predicted to be the least probable surface for protein interaction in the majority of the VLRs. To test this prediction, we employed a different program called ProMate (20Neuvirth H. Raz R. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). ProMate also utilizes various structural properties of protein surfaces for prediction but with an independent algorithm. As expected, the concave surfaces of the majority of VLRs got scores higher than the convex surfaces in the ProMate calculation (Table 2).TABLE 2Prediction of the protein binding site in the inshore hagfish VLRRankPPI-PredProMateConcave surfaceConvex surfaceConcave surfaceConvex surfaceMost probable binding site4463352nd most probable binding site24438133rd most probable binding site541143Least probable binding site1170223Total analyzed VLR structures84 Open table in a new tab Structural comparison is often useful for predicting the functional site of a protein. To search for structurally related proteins, the VLR structures were submitted to the Dali data base. The Slit D3 domain (PDB code 1W8A), Nogo receptor (PDB code 1OZN), glycoprotein Ibα (PDB code 1M10), and TLR3 (PDB code 1ZIW) were identified by the server as the closest structural relatives of VLRs. These proteins have similar modular structures and patterns of amino acid sequence conservation (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, crystallographic analysis and data from mutation experiments indicate that the concave surface is the major protein interaction surface in Slit, the Nogo receptor, and glycoprotein Ibα (14He X.L.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, structural comparison with other LRR family proteins also supports the hypothesis that the concave surface is the most probable antigen binding site of VLRs. Our proposal regarding the antigen binding site is consistent with a previous prediction by Alder et al. (4Alder M.N. Rogozin I.B. Iyer L.M. Glazko G.V. Cooper M.D. Pancer Z. Science. 2005; 310: 1970-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Based on evolutionary analysis, they proposed that the concave surface of VLRs is under positive evolutionary selection and is the most likely site for antigen binding (4Alder M.N. Rogozin I.B. Iyer L.M. Glazko G.V. Cooper M.D. Pancer Z. Science. 2005; 310: 1970-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our view and that of Alder et al. clearly require future experimental validation. In this report, we have presented the first crystal structures of jawless fish VLRs. Both VLR-A and VLR-B have the horseshoe-shaped structure common to LRR family proteins. All of the VLRs appear to have a highly homologous backbone structure, and the sequence variation is concentrated in the concave surface of the protein. Based on various analyses, we proposed that the hypervariable concave surface of the protein is the most probable antigen interaction site. As noted previously, the concave surfaces of LRR family proteins are frequently used for protein interaction (6Pancer Z. Cooper M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 497-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 23Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). However, in some LRR proteins, including TLR3 and CD14, surfaces other than the concave surface are known to play the major role in ligand binding (29Bell J.K. Askins J. Hall P.R. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8792-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11347-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both TLR3 and CD14 interact with non-protein ligands, double-stranded RNA and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. The convex surfaces of TLR3 and CD14, unlike those of other LRR proteins, have nonrepetitive sequences and structural patterns. As a result, nonrepetitive secondary structures are frequently inserted into the convex part of the molecule. Therefore, unlike the majority of the LRR family proteins, their convex surfaces contain grooves or pockets ideal for ligand binding. The LRR modules of VLRs show strict length and sequence conservation even in the convex portion of the module. The resulting convex surfaces of the VLRs have a repeated pattern of 310 helices and connecting loops, without grooves or pockets large enough for ligand binding. The diversity of the antigen binding sites of immunoglobulins and VLRs is generated by gene rearrangement. However, their structures are completely different. In immunoglobulins, antigen binding is mediated by six hypervariable loops from the heavy and light chains. These loops are highly diverse in length, sequence, and backbone structure. By exploiting the structural diversity in these loops, immunoglobulins can recognize a wide variety of antigen structures. In contrast, the concave surfaces of VLRs are composed of rigid β-strands, and structural changes of the backbone atoms are minimal. The average surface area of immunoglobulins that binds protein antigens is ∼800 Ä2. The concave surface area of the most abundant form of hagfish VLRs with three LRRV modules is estimated to be more than 1500 Ä2. As shown for other LRR family proteins (15Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 32Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 33Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), this large binding area of the VLRs may promote high affinity interaction with macromolecular antigens. Sequence variation in immunoglobulins is essentially confined to the short antigen binding loops. The constant domain constitutes most of the immunoglobulin molecule and appears to be important either for stability of the protein or for interaction with effector proteins. Unlike the immunoglobulins, sequence variation in VLRs is present not only on the concave but also on the convex surface. It is not clear why the convex surface has variable patches. It is possible that it has a secondary role in antigen binding via long range interactions. Another possibility is that the LRR scaffold is very stable and some evolutionary variation is allowed without compromising the stability of the proteins. Several non-immunoglobulin frameworks have been tested for their ability to generate random artificial libraries that mimic the natural immunoglobulin library (34Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 35Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Binz H.K. Plückthun A.

The LRR library reported by Plückthun and co-workers (38Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) is a successful example of this approach. Based on the structure of ribonuclease inhibitor, they produced proteins with 4-14 LRR modules containing randomized amino acids in their concave surfaces. All the clones chosen at random from the resulting library, with a theoretical diversity of greater than 1012, produced monomeric, stable, and highly soluble proteins. Interestingly, the design principles of the artificial LRR library and the naturally evolved VLR library are strikingly similar. 1) Residues with an obvious structural role are strictly conserved. 2) Insertions and deletions in the LRR modules are essentially not allowed. 3) Sequence variability is focused on the concave surface. 4) The first and the last LRR modules contain special residues and their sequence conservation differs from that of the other LRR modules. The success of the artificial LRR library demonstrates that modularity is inherent in the LRR scaffold and that residues in the concave surface can be changed with-out affecting the overall stability of the protein (38Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These intrinsic properties of the LRR scaffold may have sustained the role of VLRs as adaptive immune receptors during evolution.

HSP-6 (hsp70F) is a nematode orthologue of mthsp70. Knockdown of HSP-6 by RNA interference in young adult nematodes caused a reduction in the levels of ATP-2, HSP-60 and CLK-1, leading to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and lower ATP levels. As a result, RNA interference-treated worms had lower motility, defects in oogenesis, earlier accumulation of autofluorescent material, and a shorter life span. These are the major phenotypes observed during the aging of worms, suggesting that the reduction of HSP-6 causes early aging or progeria-like phenotypes. The amount of HSP-6 became dramatically reduced at the expected mean life span in not only wild-type but also in long and short life span mutant worms (wild-type, daf-2, and daf-16). Mitochondrial HSP-60 and ATP-2 were also reduced following the reduction of HSP-6 during aging.

Mitochondria are major organelles that carry out cellular oxidation and produce most of the cellular ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria also play essential roles in controlling cell viability and proliferation (1Jezek P. Hlavata L. Int. J. Biochem.

Furthermore, mitochondria are thought to be deeply involved in the aging process, based on the free radical theory of aging, because mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; mthsp70, mitochondrial heat shock protein 70; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NGM, on nutrient growth medium; mts, mitochondrial targeting signal.

A mammalian mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mthsp70, also known as mortalin or Grp75) has been shown to function as a mitochondrial protein import motor and is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (14Stuart R.A.

In contrast, deletion mutations of SSC1, the yeast orthologue of mthsp70, were lethal (20Craig E.A. Kramer J. Shilling J. Werner-Washburne M. Holmes S. Kosic-Smithers J. Nicolet C.M. Mol. Cell.

Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1193-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, knockdown of hsp-6 by RNAi caused embryonic lethality, larval arrest, and sterile progeny (25Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S.

However, the role of HSP-6 in adult worms, which consist of nondividing somatic cells, has not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we addressed this issue by knocking down HSP-6 in adult worms. Strains and Culture Conditions—C. elegans strains (wildtype Bristol N2, daf-2(e1370), daf-16(mgDf50)) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. Individuals were maintained at 20 °C using the standard technique (27Sulston J. Hodgkin J. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 1988; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 587-606Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 20 °C. For collecting synchronized eggs, gravid worms were placed on nutrient growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli OP50, allowed to lay eggs for 3-6 h, and then removed from the plate. Eggs were allowed to develop for 3 days until the young adult stage. Transgenic Worms—For generation of the hsp-6::gfp reporter plasmid, a full-length hsp-6 cDNA and a 114-bp sequence at the 5′ end of hsp-6 containing a putative mitochondrial targeting signal (mts, N-terminal 38 residues) were amplified by PCR using C. elegans cDNA as a template. The following primers were used: 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATGCTTTCCGCACGAT-3′ for hsp-6/mts forward primer, 5′-TCCCCGCGGGGATAAGTTTTGCTCC-3′ for hsp-6 reverse primer, and 5′-TCCCCGCGGGGAAAGATCAATTC-3′ for mts reverse primer. The full-length gene and the mts sequence of hsp-6 were digested with XbaI/SacII and cloned into an XbaI/SacII-digested pPD91.14 plasmid vector, respectively. Correct insertion of the fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate a transgenic strain, hsp-6::gfp or mts::gfp plasmids (100 ng/μl) and pRF4 plasmid (20 ng/μl) were co-injected into the gonads of young adult N2 using standard methods (28Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). RNAi Treatment—RNA interference (RNAi) was performed as described previously (29Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). For generation of an hsp-6 feeding RNAi construct, 502 bp at the 5′ end of hsp-6 were amplified by PCR from C. elegans cDNA using the following primers: forward 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATGCTTTCCGCACGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCGTTGTTGAC-3′. The amplified fragments were digested with XbaI/XhoI and cloned into an XbaI/XhoI-digested pPD129.36 (L4440) plasmid vector. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli strain HT115 (DE3) was transformed with a pPD129.36 plasmid containing the N-terminal 502 bp of hsp-6 cDNA or an empty pPD129.36 plasmid as a control (mock transformation) using standard CaCl2 transformation methods. Single colonies of transformed HT115 were inoculated onto 2× YT-containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The pre-cultured E. coli was diluted 1:100 and grown to A600 = 0.4. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (0.4 mm, final concentration), and the culture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Additional ampicillin, tetracycline, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were added to the culture to double the concentration. Two to three drops of double-stranded RNA-induced E. coli culture were plated on NGM plates and stored at 4 °C until use. To begin the RNAi treatment, a young adult worm (3 days old) was transferred onto the RNAi plate. For longer culture, the worms were transferred onto a new plate every 2 days for the first 10-12 days and then onto a new plate every 4 days. Preparation of Antibody—Anti-HSP-6 antibody was described previously (19Yokoyama K. Fukumoto K. Murakami T. Harada S. Hosono R. Wadhwa R. Mitsui Y. Ohkuma S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Anti-HSP-1 (hsp70A) polyclonal rabbit antibody was prepared as described previously (19Yokoyama K. Fukumoto K. Murakami T. Harada S. Hosono R. Wadhwa R. Mitsui Y. Ohkuma S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, a chemically synthesized peptide, NDQGNRTTPSYVC (Biologica Co., Nagoya, Japan), was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antigen was injected subcutaneously. The resultant rabbit antiserum was used for Western blot analysis. Western Blotting—Worms (50-100 individuals) were collected and washed with M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42 mm Na2HPO4, 86 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4), resuspended in lysis buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m EDTA, 0.04 m EGTA, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS), sonicated six times for 25 s, and boiled for 5 min. This extract was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. Protein concentration was measured by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: anti-HSP-6 antibody at 1:30,000 dilution (19Yokoyama K. Fukumoto K. Murakami T. Harada S. Hosono R. Wadhwa R.

Then the membrane was washed with Trisbuffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with secondary antibody, and then washed with TBST. The blots were developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorograms were recorded by an LAS-1000 luminescence analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were analyzed using ImageGauge version 3.1 software (Fujifilm). ATP Levels—ATP levels were measured as described previously with slight modifications (30Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. De Vreese A. Vanfleteren J.R. Mech. Ageing.

All the plates contained 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml to inhibit progeny production. Worms were incubated for 2 or 4 days at 20 °C, washed four times with M9 buffer, resuspended in cell lysis buffer, and immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately. The samples were stored at -80 °C. The frozen samples were boiled for 15 min to release ATP, and dilution buffer was added, and the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 100-fold with dilution buffer. ATP levels were measured by using the ATP Bioluminescent HSII kit (Roche Applied Science) with the Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). ATP levels were normalized to protein concentration. Determination of Brood Size—Young adult worms were transferred to a mock or hsp-6 RNAi plate (one worm per plate) and allowed to lay eggs. The worms were transferred to fresh plates every day, and the numbers of eggs remaining on the plates were counted for 3 days. Eggs that did not hatch after 2 days were counted as “unhatched.” For each experiment, 10 to 11 worms were analyzed. Morphological Observation and Motility Assay—For observation by phase-contrast microscopy (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), worms were placed on an agar pad in M9 buffer and covered with a coverslip. For transmission microscopy (MVX10; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), worms were placed on an agar plate. For measuring the frequency of body bends, worms were placed in a dish containing a drop of M9 buffer and observed by transmission microscopy. Movement was recorded by a digital camera (Camedia C-4040ZOOM; Olympus), and the frequency of sinusoidal movements per min was counted (33Hosono R. Sato Y. Aizawa S.I. Mitsui Y. Exp. Gerontol. 1980; 15: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Experiments typically began with more than 50 worms, and the indicated numbers of surviving worms were randomly picked up and analyzed at later time points. For the pumping assays, worms were placed on a mock or RNAi plate (see RNAi Treatment section). The head region of worms was observed by transmission microscopy and recorded by a digital camera as described above. Video images were transferred to iMovie software (Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, CA), and the frequency of pharyngeal movement during 5 s was counted. Mitochondrial Staining—Worms were transferred to NGM agar plates containing 500 nm of MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and incubated for 2 days in the dark. Worms were washed with M9 buffer and mounted on an agar pad in M9 buffer and covered with a coverslip. Mitochondria in live worms were observed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). For analysis of membrane potential, worms were cultured on NGM plates without E. coli to allow bacteria in the intestine to be excreted for 3 h, mounted as described above, and observed using epifluorescence microscopy (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss). Analysis of Autofluorescence—Worms were placed on fresh NGM plates and incubated for 15 min. Worms were mounted on an agar pad in M9 buffer, covered with a coverslip, and then observed under a epifluorescence stereomicroscope (MVX10; Olympus). Photographs were taken using a digital camera (Camedia C-4040ZOOM, Olympus), and Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) was used to convert the intensity into pseudocolors. For quantitation, an area of intestine on the pharynx side of each worm (pictures shown) was encircled, and average intensity of the area was measured using ImageJ 1.34s (National Institutes of Health). Life Span Determination and Statistical Analysis—Young adult worms (more than 70 worms) were transferred to mock or hsp-6 RNAi plates. Thereafter, they were transferred to fresh RNAi plates every 2-4 days to supply fresh food and to remove progeny. Worms were scored as dead when they showed no response to prodding with picks or immersion in M9 buffer. Worms that crawled off the plate, exploded, or bagged were censored. The assays were repeated three times. Mini StatMate software (ATMS Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used for producing Kaplan-Meier survival curves and statistical analysis. Isolation of Mitochondria—Approximately 12,000 eggs were placed on large NGM agar plates (9 cm diameter) seeded with E. coli OP50 at 20 °C. When the worms reached the young adult stage (3 days old), 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine was added to the plates at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml to inhibit the development of progeny. The worms were harvested 2 days later and separated from bacteria and debris by 60% sucrose flotation. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (34Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Then samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the obtained supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. Mitochondrial Localization of HSP-6—HSP-6 is a predicted orthologue of mammalian mortalin/mthsp70/Grp75 and yeast Ssc1p. The amino acid sequence is 77% identical (87% similar) to that of mouse mortalin and 63% (78% similar) to that of yeast Ssc1p. The N-terminal sequence of HSP-6 is predicted to have an amphipathic helical structure with periodic appearance of basic residues, typical for mitochondrial targeting sequences. This region is similar in length to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of yeast Ssc1p and is significantly shorter than those of mammalian proteins. To confirm that HSP-6 is the orthologue of mortalin/mthsp70/Grp75, we first sought to determine its localization in mitochondria. We expressed tagged recombinant protein in a worm to analyze the subcellular localization. A fusion protein of HSP-6 and GFP was constructed and expressed in muscle cells using a myo-4 promoter (HSP-6-GFP). We chose muscle cells for observation because they have a simple and regular mitochondrial morphology (see below). When transgenic F2 progeny were observed for GFP fluorescence, most of the GFP fluorescence was observed with Mito-Tracker-positive structures, clearly indicating localization of the fusion protein to mitochondria (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Similar mitochondrial localization was observed using the 38-amino acid residue of HSP-6 that was predicted to contain a mitochondrial targeting signal (Fig. 1A, lower panels). To confirm the localization of HSP-6 in mitochondria, we performed subcellular fractionation analysis. Worms were homogenized, and a mitochondria-enriched fraction was prepared by differential centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1B, HSP-6 was clearly co-purified together with mitochondrial markers (HSP-60, a mitochondrial chaperone; ATP-2, the β-subunit of F1-ATPase; CLK-1, a subunit of ubiquinone synthetase), indicating the localization of HSP-6 in mitochondria. HSP-1 (hsp70A), which is most similar to HSP-6 (61%) and is localized in the cytoplasm, and actin were mostly recovered in the postmitochondrial supernatant and not in the mitochondrial fraction confirming the efficient removal of cytoplasm from the mitochondrial fraction. Taken together, these results show that HSP-6 localizes in mitochondria and that the N-terminal 38 amino acid residue functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Effect of HSP-6 Knockdown on Mitochondrial Structure and Function—Because knockdown of HSP-6 caused embryonic lethality (25Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A.

Kuijk E. van den Berghe P.V. Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Plos Biol. 2003; 1: E12Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we started feeding RNAi to young adult worms (3 days old) to analyze the role of endogenous HSP-6 in adult worms. A significant reduction in HSP-6 level was observed after 2 days of feeding in wild-type N2 (Fig. 2A). The level of HSP-1 was not affected (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the RNAi effect was specific. When young adults (3 days old) were stained with Mito-Tracker for 2 days, mitochondria were observed as distinct short rope-like structures regularly spaced and aligned in parallel along with myofibrils in the body wall muscle cells (Fig. 2B, top left panel) as reported previously (31Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 35Curran S.P. Leverich E.P. Koehler C.M. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54655-54662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, mitochondria were unevenly spaced, loosely aligned, and frequently interconnected across myofibrils in HSP-6-knockdown worms (hsp-6(RNAi)) (Fig. 2B, top right panel). In worms mock-treated for 4 days, the intestine was strongly stained with MitoTracker (Fig. 2C, left panels). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the intestine was lower in hsp-6(RNAi) (Fig. 2C, right panels). This result indicates that the uptake of Mito-Tracker was decreased in hsp-6(RNAi), suggesting that the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by the reduction of HSP-6. Correspondingly, the total ATP level of the worms was significantly decreased after 4 days of RNAi treatment, although not at 2 days of the treatment (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that depletion of HSP-6 immediately causes defects in mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology, and prolonged or severe defects in mitochondria causes the reduction of the ATP level. ATP is synthesized by F0F1-ATPase in a mitochondrial inner membrane driven by a proton gradient produced by oxidative phosphorylation (36Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We found that ATP-2, the β-subunit of the F1-ATPase (37Tsang W.Y. Sayles L.C. Grad L.I. Pilgrim D.B. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32240-32246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Tsang W.Y. Lemire B.D. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was decreased in hsp-6(RNAi) (Fig. 3, upper panels). Similarly, CLK-1, a mitochondrial subunit of ubiquinone synthetase, and HSP-60, a mitochondrial chaperon, were decreased in hsp-6(RNAi) (Fig. 3, lower panels). The level of HSP-6 became 10-15% that in the control worms on the 2nd day of RNAi treatment (Fig. 3, D2). At this time point, the levels of ATP-2 and HSP-60 reduced to about 45 and 60% compared with the mock treatment, respectively (Fig. 3, D2). The reduction in ATP-2, HSP-60, and CLK-1 became pronounced after 4 days of RNAi treatment (D4-D10). At that time, although the level of HSP-6 was only slightly more reduced (to about 10%), the levels of ATP-2 and HSP-60 dropped to 40 and 50% of the mock treatment levels, respectively. A significant reduction in CLK-1 was also observed at this time point (about 60% compared with the mock treatment). This was coincident with the reduction of the total ATP level (Fig. 2D). These results strongly suggest that depletion of HSP-6 causes defects in the mitochondrial protein import system leading to the decline in various mitochondrial proteins, including ATP-2, HSP-60, and CLK-1, and resulting in defects in ATP synthesis. Interestingly, mitochondria in the body wall muscle cells were noticeably thinner and less regularly shaped in untreated (not shown) and mock-treated worms by the 7th day of adulthood (Fig. 2B, left, D7). Mitochondria became thinner and fragmented in the older worms (Fig. 2B, right, D12). A similar aging effect was also observed in hsp-6(RNAi). The thinner and less regular mitochondrial structure was exaggerated in hsp-6(RNAi), and this may coincide with reduced function (membrane potential). Defects in Gonadal Functions in hsp-6(RNAi)—Depletion of HSP-6 in adult worms neither produced an acute lethal effect nor extended the life span of worms, in contrast to the depletion of other mitochondrial proteins (31Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 32Dillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H.

Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J.

Control young adult worms (3 days old) laid normal eggs for the first 3 days and then laid unfertilized oocytes, which were less translucent and had brownish color, for several days on the culture plates. In contrast, hsp-6(RNAi) stopped laying eggs by the 2nd day, and no oocytes were found on culture plates thereafter. 10 days after the RNAi treatment, oocytes accumulated markedly in the uterus (Fig. 4A, mock, asterisks). In contrast, the uteruses of hsp-6(RNAi) of the same age was empty (Fig. 4A). In addition, oocytes and gonads were less translucent and had brownish color, similar to the unfertilized oocytes (Fig. 4, B, D10, and A). To allow a quantitative analysis, the brood sizes of the worms were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4C, the brood size was reduced about 36% in hsp-6(RNAi) compared with the mock treatment. About half of the laid eggs were infertile (unhatched; these eggs did not hatch for 3 weeks excluding the delay of hatching), indicating defects in early development. When unhatched eggs were carefully inspected under a microscope, cell division and morphogenesis appeared to be arrested at various developmental stages (Fig. 4"
https://openalex.org/W2030938067,"Distal arthrogryposes (DAs) are a group of disorders characterized by congenital contractures of distal limbs without overt neurological or muscle disease. Unexpectedly, mutations in genes encoding the fast skeletal muscle regulatory proteins troponin T (TnT), troponin I (TnI), and beta-tropomyosin (beta-TM) have been shown to cause autosomal dominant DA. We tested how these mutations affect contractile function by comparing wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins in actomyosin ATPase assays and in troponin-replaced rabbit psoas fibers. We have analyzed all four reported mutants: Arg63His TnT, Arg91Gly beta-TM, Arg174Gln TnI, and a TnI truncation mutant (Arg156ter). Thin filaments, reconstituted using actin and WT troponin and beta-TM, activated myosin subfragment-1 ATPase in a calcium-dependent, cooperative manner. Thin filaments containing either a troponin or beta-TM DA mutant produced significantly enhanced ATPase rates at all calcium concentrations without alternating calcium-sensitivity or cooperativity. In troponin-exchanged skinned fibers, each mutant caused a significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity, and Arg156ter TnI generated significantly higher maximum force. Arg91Gly beta-TM was found to have a lower actin affinity than WT and form a less stable coiled coil. We propose the mutations cause increased contractility of developing fast-twitch skeletal muscles, thus causing muscle contractures and the development of the observed limb deformities."

Over half of the world's population is exposed to malaria (1Hay S.I. Guerra C.A. Tatem A.J. Noor A.M. Snow R.W. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2004; 4: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Until recently, the disease was controlled in or eradicated from a number of areas. However, the emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquito vectors and multidrug-resistant forms of the causative agent has contributed to resurgences of the disease, which in some cases have resulted in near catastrophic epidemics. As a result malaria remains a global problem, affecting many of the poorest nations and representing a serious threat to travelers. The development and implementation of effective new drugs and a vaccine is of paramount importance. Clinical malaria results from replication of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium in circulating erythrocytes. Like most apicomplexan pathogens, the malaria merozoite invades its host cell in a multistep process initiated by reversible binding to receptors on the erythrocyte surface, followed by high affinity attachment via the apical end of the merozoite, and finally entry into a parasitophorous vacuole. Invasion is facilitated by the discharge of apical secretory organelles called micronemes and rhoptries.

An essential role for AMA1 was first indicated by unsuccessful attempts to disrupt its gene in both P. falciparum (26Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F.

Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7078-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An elegant electron microscopic study in P. knowlesi using the mAb referred to above indicated that AMA1 is required for the reorientation step that follows the initial interaction between merozoite and host cell (27Mitchell G.H. Thomas A.W. Margos G. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using a conditional expression system in T. gondii, Mital et al. (28Mital J. Meissner M. Soldati D. Ward G.E. Mol. Biol.

Consistent with this, two reports have suggested an erythrocyte-binding role for AMA1 (32Fraser T.S. Kappe S.H. Narum D.L. VanBuskirk K.M. Adams J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Kato K. Mayer D.C. Singh S. Reid M. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5552-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More recent studies in T. gondii and P. falciparum have demonstrated that AMA1 functions as a complex with at least two distinct proteins (RON2 and RON4), which initially reside in the rhoptry neck, and that this complex contributes to formation of the moving junction that translocates over the invading parasite surface as it moves into the nascent parasitophorous vacuole (34Alexander D.L. Mital J. Ward G.E. Bradley P. Boothroyd J.C. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 35Alexander D.L. Arastu-Kapur S. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite all the above data, the molecular details of AMA1 function remain obscure. The biosynthesis and trafficking of PfAMA1 has been characterized in some detail. Maximally expressed during the latter stages of schizont maturation, PfAMA1 is targeted to the micronemes of developing merozoites (36Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Dluzewski A.R. Margos G.

Cowman A.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5751-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) where it is subject to a proteolytic processing event in which a short N-terminal “prosequence” is removed, converting the 83-kDa precursor protein (PfAMA183) to a 66-kDa product called PfAMA166 (38Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 39Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Upon schizont rupture PfAMA166 (but not its PfAMA183 precursor) is released from the micronemes to distribute across the surface of the free merozoite (38Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 39Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At or around the point of invasion the molecule is then quantitatively shed by a membrane-bound subtilisin-like “sheddase” called PfSUB2, which translocates across the parasite surface, possibly in association with the moving junction (40Harris P.K. Yeoh S. Dluzewski A.R. O'Donnell R.A. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. Blackman M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 41Howell S.A.

Shedding is mediated by a single cleavage just 29 residues distal to the transmembrane domain, resulting in release of essentially the entire AMA1 ectodomain in the form of a 48-kDa polypeptide called PfAMA148; an additional low level processing event within this molecule generates two disulfide-linked fragments, the larger of which is called PfAMA144 (41Howell S.A.

Following invasion only the juxtamembrane extracellular PfAMA1 “stub,” still membrane-bound via its cognate transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, can be detected in the young ring stage parasite (42Howell S.A. Hackett F. Jongco A.M. Withers-Martinez C. Kim K. Carruthers V.B. Blackman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The role of AMA1 shedding is unknown. However, some antibodies that prevent invasion also interfere with shedding, raising the possibility that shedding is essential for invasion. Its inhibition may represent one mechanism by which anti-AMA1 antibodies exert invasion-inhibitory activity (43Dutta S. Haynes J.D. Barbosa A. Ware L.A. Snavely J.D. Moch J.K. Thomas A.W. Lanar D.E. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2116-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 44Dutta S. Haynes J.D. Moch J.K. Barbosa A. Lanar D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12295-12300Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PfAMA1 exhibits significant polymorphism, and polymorphic residues have been identified at 52 different positions within the ectodomain (45Chesne-Seck M.L. Pizarro J.C. Vulliez-Le Normand B. Collins C.R. Blackman M.J. Faber B.W. Remarque E.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Bentley G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 144: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In most cases these are dimorphic, being represented by one or the other of two alternative residues, but more extensive diversity is evident at a number of positions. It has been suggested that the polymorphisms are a result of selective pressure exerted by host immune responses. A number of observations support this, including the fact that all the polymorphic residues are surface-exposed and that invasion-inhibitory anti-PfAMA1 antibody responses are often strain-specific. Remarkably, the distribution of the polymorphic sites is highly biased to one side of the PfAMA1 ectodomain (45Chesne-Seck M.L. Pizarro J.C. Vulliez-Le Normand B. Collins C.R. Blackman M.J. Faber B.W. Remarque E.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Bentley G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 144: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the significance of this is unknown. The availability of PfAMA1-specific mAbs that inhibit invasion provides opportunities to identify functionally important regions of the molecule. A recent study using phage display of PfAMA1 fragments showed that recognition of PfAMA1 by a strain-specific, invasion inhibitory mAb called 1F9 required the presence of a Glu residue at position 197, the most polymorphic position in PfAMA1 (46Coley A.M. Parisi K. Masciantonio R. Hoeck J. Casey J.L. Murphy V.J. Harris K.S. Batchelor A.H. Anders R.F. Foley M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2628-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This site is flanked by a number of other polymorphic sites. In our earlier preliminary work we used expression of a range of PfAMA1 mutants to show that recognition by a different invasion-inhibitory mAb called 4G2 involved interactions with an exposed flexible loop of domain II, composed of residues that are conserved in all P. falciparum isolates. Here we extend this work. We show that purified Fab fragments of 4G2 potently inhibit invasion, suggesting that the epitope lies within a functionally important region of the ectodomain. Next, we demonstrate by genetic complementation that a wholly synthetic gene designed for heterologous expression of PfAMA1 is fully functional in P. falciparum. Finally, we make use of this gene along with all the available high resolution structural data and a greatly expanded library of mutants to map the location of the 4G2 epitope with high precision. We show conclusively that binding of mAb 4G2 involves exclusively interactions with side chains of residues within the domain II loop, with no contribution by any residues from domain I or domain III. Antisera, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Fab Fragments—Mouse antisera were raised against the mature ectodomain of PfAMA1 (Ile97–Lys546) expressed in Pichia pastoris from a synthetic gene (FVO ama-1syn) designed to replace the A+T-rich codon usage of the P. falciparum FVO strain (23Kocken C.H.

Mice were immunized with the purified recombinant protein (called rPfAMA1) either in its native state or following reduction and alkylation as described previously (29Pizarro J.C. Vulliez-Le Normand B. Chesne-Seck M.L. Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. Faber B.W. Remarque E.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Bentley G.A. Science. 2005; 308: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), generating antisera N5 and R5, respectively. Antiserum N5 was then adsorbed with reduced and alkylated immunogen to remove antibodies reactive with this form of the protein. The product was an antiserum called N5Ads that recognizes only native, disulfide-dependent conformations of PfAMA1 and shows no cross-reactivity with the denatured form. For detection of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged proteins in Western blot and immunofluorescence (IFA), the HA-specific mAb 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) was used. The mAb 1E1 (48Burghaus P.A. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which recognizes an epitope in the C-terminal domain of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP119), was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (40Harris P.K.

The mAb 4G2 (23Kocken C.H. Withers-Martinez C. Dubbeld M.A. van der Wel A. Hackett F. Valderrama A. Blackman M.J. Thomas A.W. Infect.

For production of 4G2 Fab fragments, purified mAb at 12.3 mg ml-1 in 0.1 m NAOH/citrate solution, pH 3.5, was digested with pepsin (1 mg ml-1) at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The resulting F(ab)2 was purified by chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.2. The recovered F(ab)2 was reduced and alkylated by addition of 10 mm l-cysteine and incubation under nitrogen for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of iodoacetamide to 130 mm and incubation in the dark at room temperature for a further 2 h. Fab fragments were finally purified from this mixture by a second round of gel filtration as described above, then concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at -70 °C. Construct Synthesis—A construct based on pSecTag2A (Invitrogen) for transient, cell surface expression of a region of ama-1syn, encoding the entire PfAMA1 except for its native secretory signal sequence and pro-sequence (called sgPfAMA166) in COS-7 cells, has been described previously (29Pizarro J.C. Vulliez-Le Normand B. Chesne-Seck M.L. Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. Faber B.W. Remarque E.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Bentley G.A. Science. 2005; 308: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into regions encoding domains I and II (DI–II) of the PfAMA1 ectodomain by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The resulting mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by Western blotting (29Pizarro J.C. Vulliez-Le Normand B. Chesne-Seck M.L. Collins C.R. Withers-Martinez C. Hackett F. Blackman M.J. Faber B.W. Remarque E.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Bentley G.A. Science. 2005; 308: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For expression of ama-1syn in P. falciparum, a single HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA in single letter amino acid code) (50Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was first introduced into the juxtamembrane stub region (42Howell S.A. Hackett F. Jongco A.M. Withers-Martinez C. Kim K. Carruthers V.B. Blackman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) of the PfAMA1 ectodomain. To do this, sequence encoding 535IPEHKPTYD543 was modified by a two-step site-directed mutagenesis approach using QuikChange (Stratagene). Forward primers used for this were 2ndHalfHAfor (5′-GAG CAT AAG CCT gac Tat GcT AAC ATG AAG-3′) plus its reverse complementary primer (called 2ndHalfHArev), followed by FullHAfor (5′-GAA ATC GCT GAT taT CCA tAc gAT gtTC CTg acT AtG cTA ACA GTA AG-3′) plus its reverse complementary primer (FullHArev). Mutations required to introduce the tag are indicated in lowercase. For episomal expression of the resulting tagged gene (called ama-1synHA) in P. falciparum, the unique internal XhoI site was removed by site-directed mutagenesis leaving the encoded amino acid sequence unaltered, using forward primer XhoIrepfor (5′-CCA AGA AAG AAC CTg GAa AAC GCA AAG TTC GGT CTG TGG-3′) and its corresponding reverse complementary primer XhoIreprev (the original position of the XhoI site is indicated in bold, and the mutations introduced to remove this are shown in lowercase). The entire coding sequence was then amplified by PCR using primers XhoIfor (5′-ACC GAG ctc gag TTC ATG AGG AAG-3′) and XhoIrev (5′-GCC AGT ctc gag TTA GTA GTA AGG C-3′), and the product was cloned into pHAM-ACPGFP (unpublished; a kind gift of J. Healer, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia) pre-digested with XhoI to excise the acpgfp gene. The resulting plasmid (called pHAM-sgPfa1/HA) contains an expression cassette comprising the ama-1synHA gene between 1.4 kb of pfama1 5′-flanking sequence containing the pfama1 promoter, and the 3′ untranslated region of the P. berghei dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene, present to ensure correct transcription termination and polyadenylation of the gene. Plasmid pHH1–5′sgPfa1/HA was designed to disrupt the endogenous pfama1 gene by single crossover homologous recombination into the locus, simultaneously inserting the ama-1synHA expression cassette into the chromosome. A 900-bp region from the 5′-end of pfama1 (starting 60 bp downstream of the translational start ATG site) was amplified from P. falciparum T9/96 genomic DNA using primers PfaI-5′for (5′-CAT A TA TGA aga tct TTG GAA GAG GAC AG-3′) and PfaI-5′rev (5′-ctc gag GTA TAT CTT CTC AAT TTC CAT CGA CCC-3′) and cloned via BglII and XhoI sites (indicated in lowercase) into pre-digested plasmid pHH1 (51Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) producing plasmid pHH1–5′PfaI. The reverse primer was designed to incorporate a stop codon (indicated in bold) at the 3′-end of this gene-targeting fragment. The ama-1synHA expression cassette was excised from pHAM-sgPfa1/HA by digestion with HindIII and NotI, blunted with T4-DNA polymerase, and cloned downstream of the 900-bp target sequence into XhoI-digested, blunted pHH1–5′PfaI producing construct pHH1–5′sgPfa1/HA. Culture and Transfection of P. falciparum and COS-7 Cells— Asexual blood stages of P. falciparum clone 3D7 were cultured and synchronized as previously described (52Trager W. Jensen J.B.

Ring stage parasites at 1–5% parasitemia (assessed by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood films) were transfected by electroporation with 70–100 μg of plasmid DNA as previously described (40Harris P.K.

After initial selection for ∼4 weeks in 10 nm of the antifolate WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, Buena, NJ), parasites were subjected to repeated cycles of selection pressure followed by removal of the drug for 3 weeks. Clonal populations were eventually obtained by limiting dilution. Synchronous parasite preparations were saponin-treated and washed in phosphate-buffered saline for analysis by Western blot as described previously. For analysis of proteins released into culture supernatants, purified schizonts were cultured for 8 h in the presence of fresh human erythrocytes to allow reinvasion and shedding of invasion proteins. Parasites and uninfected erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation and the culture supernatant concentrated 50-fold using a 5000 molecular mass cut-off Vivaspin column (Vivascience) before analysis by Western blot. COS-7 cells adapted for growth under serum-free conditions were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with constructs for expression of unmodified and mutant forms of sgPfAMA166 as previously described (29Pizarro J.C.

To monitor PKD signaling in live cells, we generated a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for PKD activity, DKAR (D kinase activity reporter). DKAR expressed in mammalian cells undergoes reversible fluorescence resonance energy transfer changes upon activation and inhibition of endogenous PKD. Surprisingly, we find that agonist-evoked activation of PKD is driven not only by diacylglycerol production, but by Ca2+. Furthermore, elevation of intracellular Ca2+, in the absence of any other stimulus, is sufficient to activate PKD. Concurrent imaging of Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and PKD activity reveals that thapsigargin-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is closely followed by a robust increase in diacylglycerol production, in turn followed by PKD activation. The Ca2+-induced production of diacylglycerol and accompanying PKD activation is dependent on phospholipase C activity. These data reveal that Ca2+ is a major contributor to the initiation of PKD signaling through positive feedback regulation of diacylglycerol production, unveiling a new mechanism in PKD activation.

PKD plays a role in numerous processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, immune cell signaling, gene expression, vesicle trafficking, and neuronal development (1Toker A. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PKD transduces signals that generate the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). This ligand has two roles in the activation of PKD: it activates novel protein kinase C (PKC) family members, which catalyze an activating phosphorylation of PKD, and it directly binds PKD thus recruiting it to the membrane. PKD isoforms comprise a conserved catalytic core and N-terminal regulatory moiety. The regulatory region contains two cysteine-rich (C1) domains and a pleckstrin homology domain, and this region as a whole acts in an inhibitory manner on the kinase (2Rykx A. De Kimpe L. Mikhalap S. Vantus T. Seufferlein T. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). C1 domains are membrane-targeting modules that typically bind DAG and the functional analogues, phorbol esters (3Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). They are found in a number of proteins, most notably PKC, and provide a mechanism for proteins to be reversibly recruited to membranes in response to DAG. In the case of PKD, binding to either phorbol ester or DAG results in its membrane recruitment and activation. In addition to membrane recruitment by DAG, activation of PKD requires phosphorylation at two sites within its catalytic core (4Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, although DAG production leads to activation of PKD, it is not simply through the C1-mediated membrane binding and removal of autoinhibition by the regulatory region by which PKD becomes active. In addition, the upstream kinases, the novel PKCs, must phosphorylate PKD within its activation loop at Ser-744 and Ser-748 to promote its activity. This phosphorylation event is the rate-limiting step in PKD activation, and once phosphorylated, PKD remains active even after disengaging from DAG (5Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the novel PKCs themselves contain C1 domains, so that phorbol ester treatment or DAG production leads to PKD activation through coincident activation of the novel PKCs and localization of PKD near its upstream kinases. Hence, activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (such as certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases) leads to PKD activation via a signaling cascade: stimulation of phospholipase C activity results in the cleavage of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to produce the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and DAG. DAG production leads to activation of the novel PKCs, and thus PKD. Although IP3 stimulates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, this consequence of phospholipase C activation is not considered to control PKD activation, because neither the novel PKCs nor PKD bind Ca2+. To examine PKD signaling in live cells, we generated a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter designed to respond specifically to PKD activity. Such kinase activity reporters generally consist of two different fluorescent proteins flanking a phosphoamino acid-binding domain and a kinase substrate sequence (6Sato M. Umezawa Y. Methods. 2004; 32: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of the substrate sequence causes intramolecular complexation by the phosphoamino acid-binding domain altering fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorescent proteins. The resulting change in FRET enables the visualization of kinase signaling in real time in live cells. Current methods for assaying PKD activation include Western blotting to probe for the activating phosphorylations on PKD and kinase assays of immunoprecipitated PKD. Both of these approaches are effective; however, they can only reveal snapshots of PKD signaling. Design of a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter would allow the monitoring of PKD activity in live cells. Here we describe the design and use of a PKD reporter, DKAR (D kinase activity reporter), for visualizing agonist-stimulated PKD activation in live cells. We show that DKAR is a sensitive and reversible reporter of endogenous PKD activity. The reporter reveals differences in the kinetics and duration of PKD signaling downstream of distinct GPCRs in two different cell lines; both responses occur rapidly following GPCR stimulation, but in one cell line the signal is sustained whereas in the other cell line the response is transient. Lastly, we show that Ca2+ is a major contributor to the agonist-evoked activation of PKD and that it, alone, is sufficient to activate PKD. Visualization of DAG levels reveals that Ca2+ stimulates DAG production though positive feedback of phospholipase C, thus accelerating the rate of agonist-induced activation of PKD. In addition, Ca2+ can act on its own to stimulate DAG production, thus activating PKD. These data reveal a previously undescribed regulatory input in controlling cellular PKD activity through Ca2+-regulated DAG production. Materials—Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu), Gö 6983, Gö 6976, thapsigargin, ionomycin, edelfosine (ET-18-OCH3), and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Calbiochem. KN-93 was obtained from Sigma. Fura 2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies to PKD, to the phosphorylated activation loop of PKD (PKD P-S744/748), to the C-terminal autophosphorylation site of PKD (PKD P-S916), and to phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKD substrates were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Purified PKD1 (formerly known as PKCμ) was obtained from Upstate. HyBlot CL film used for Western analyses was from Denville Scientific (Plainfield, NJ). All other materials were reagent grade. Plasmid Constructs—DKAR was generated through substitution of a PKD substrate sequence, LSRQLTAAVSE, for the substrate sequence within C kinase activity reporter (9Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y.

The phospho-acceptor threonine was mutated to an alanine to create DKAR-T/A following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). For in vitro experiments, DKAR was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pRSET B (Invitrogen). MyrPalm-CFP and has been previously described (10Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C.

Protein Purification—DKAR and DKAR-T/A were expressed and purified from bacteria as described before (12Kunkel M.T. Ni Q. Tsien R.Y. Zhang J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In brief, a single colony of BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli containing pRSET-DKAR or pRSET-DKAR-T/A was grown for 2 days at room temperature. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm bestatin, 500 nm benzamidine, and 500 ng/ml leupeptin, and lysed by Dounce homogenization followed by French press. DKAR was purified from cleared lysates by nickel chelation chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in the presence of 10 mm imidazole. Following washes, DKAR was eluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 200 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed by dialysis. Protein yield was estimated by CFP absorption at 434 nm. Kinase Assays—For kinase assays, 1 μg of purified DKAR or DKAR-T/A protein was incubated with 50 units of pure PKD1 or pure PKCβII in a reaction volume of 40 μl at 30°C for 30 min. Buffer compositions were: 50 mm Tris, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 for PKD and 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 500 mm CaCl2, with 140 μm phosphatidyl-serine/3.8 μm DAG vesicles for PKC. Reactions were quenched in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were probed with the phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKD substrate antibody and analyzed by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal (Pierce). Cell Transfection—COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes prior to transfection. Transient transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were imaged within 24 h following transfection. Cell Imaging—Cells were washed one time in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Cellgro) and imaged in Hanks’ balanced salt solution in the dark at room temperature. In pre-treatment experiments, cells were either preincubated with 500 nm Gö 6976 or 250 nm Gö 6983 for at least 10 min, 15 μm BAPTA for at least 15 min at room temperature, 5 μm KN-93 for 20 min at 37 °C, or 10 μm edelfosine for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with: 200 nm PdBu, 100 μm UTP, 10 μm histamine, 5 μm thapsigargin, or 1 μm ionomycin where indicated. Data were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) using a MicroMax digital camera (Roper-Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). All optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Data were collected through a 10% neutral density filter. CFP and FRET images were obtained every 15 s through a 420/20 nm excitation filter, a 450 nm dichroic mirror, and a 475/40 nm or 535/25 emission filter for CFP and FRET, respectively. A YFP image was obtained as a control for photobleaching through a 495/10 nm excitation filter, a 505 nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/25 nm emission filter. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10-2, Sutter). Integration times were 200 ms for CFP and FRET and 100 ms for YFP. For Ca2+ imaging, COS-7 cells were incubated with Fura-2 AM for 30 min at 37 °C and washed two times with saline prior to imaging. Data were collected every 10 s through a 10% neutral density filter. Images were obtained through a 350/10 nm and a 380/10 nm excitation filter, a 450 nm dichroic mirror, and a 535/45 nm emission filter. Western Blotting—COS-7 or HeLa cells were grown to confluency in 60-mm dishes. Cells were washed once in Hanks’ balanced salt solution and then treated for the indicated times with PdBu, UTP (COS-7 cells), or histamine (HeLa cells) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution at room temperature as shown. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml-1 leupeptin, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm microcystin) and cleared by a high speed spin. The cleared lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the relative amounts of PKD S744/748 (activation loop) and PKD S916 (autophosphorylation) phosphorylation. Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence. Design of DKAR—We have designed a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, DKAR, to monitor the kinetics of PKD-catalyzed phosphorylation in live cells. This reporter maintains the same modular structure as the previously described PKA, Akt/protein kinase B, and PKC activity reporters, A kinase activity reporter, B kinase activity reporter, and C kinase activity reporter, respectively (9Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 12Kunkel M.T. Ni Q. Tsien R.Y. Zhang J. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The primary distinction is that the substrate phosphorylation sequence was modified to make it a phosphorylation sequence for PKD. Specifically, DKAR consists of the FRET pair mCFP (cyan fluorescent protein rendered monomeric by the mutation A206K) and mYFP (the yellow fluorescent protein citrine (14Griesbeck O. Baird G.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), likewise with A206K) bracketing an FHA2 phosphothreonine-binding domain and a consensus PKD phosphorylation sequence (Fig. 1A). The consensus substrate sequence, LSRQLTAAVSE, where the T is the phospho-acceptor residue, was designed based on a combination of data describing optimal PKD phosphorylation consensus sequences and information identifying which residues are critical for FHA2 domain binding (15Döppler H.

Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Analysis of this sequence using Scansite (scansite.mit.edu) suggested that PKD is the preferred kinase to phosphorylate it. As with our previous kinase reporters, unphosphorylated DKAR exists in a conformation resulting in FRET from the donor molecule CFP to the acceptor YFP. Phosphorylation of the threonine within the substrate sequence triggers an intramolecular clamp with the FHA2, leading to a decrease in FRET (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of DKAR by PKD in Vitro—To determine whether DKAR can serve as a PKD substrate, DKAR was expressed in bacterial cells as a His-tagged fusion protein, purified, and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by purified PKD. A phosphorylation state-specific antibody, which detects phosphorylations at the optimal PKD sequence motif (15Döppler H. Storz P. Li J. Comb M.J. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15013-15019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), revealed phosphorylation of DKAR following incubation with the pure kinase (Fig. 1B). Importantly, this antibody did not reveal phosphorylation by PKD when a modified DKAR, in which the phospho-acceptor threonine was mutated to alanine (DKAR-T/A), was used. This establishes that PKD specifically phosphorylates the threonine within the designed substrate sequence of DKAR. Because the phorbol ester PdBu was used to stimulate PKD activity in living cells, we wanted to ensure that PKC, which is potently activated following phorbol ester treatment, was not able to phosphorylate DKAR at the consensus threonine. As seen in Fig. 1B, incubation of pure PKCβII with pure DKAR in an in vitro kinase assay did not result in phosphorylation of the reporter at the consensus threonine. These results reveal that PKD, and not PKC, phosphorylates DKAR at the threonine within the substrate sequence. DKAR Reports PKD Activity in Live Cells—Having demonstrated that pure PKD can recognize and phosphorylate DKAR on the threonine within its substrate sequence in vitro, we next wanted to test the ability of DKAR to function as a reporter to visualize PKD signaling in living cells. COS-7 cells overexpressing both DKAR and PKD1 were analyzed following PdBu stimulation. In Fig. 2A, the ratio of cyan emission to yellow emission (FRET ratio) was monitored for a few minutes to establish a baseline FRET ratio before stimulating with PdBu. Following PdBu treatment, the FRET ratio increased reflecting the conformational change induced by phosphorylation of the reporter at the consensus threonine. The phospho-acceptor mutant DKAR (DKAR-T/A) did not undergo a FRET ratio change in response to PdBu, confirming that the FRET ratio change results from phosphorylation of the threonine in the designed substrate sequence (Fig. 2A). To test whether DKAR is able to report PKD signaling mediated by endogenous PKD, we expressed only DKAR in COS-7 cells and monitored the FRET ratio change following stimulation with PdBu. PdBu treatment caused the FRET ratio to increase, however, the rate of increase was slower than that observed when PKD was overexpressed (half-time of ∼7 min compared with 2 min), and the magnitude of the change was lower (0.05 relative unit compared with 0.20, Fig. 2, compare A with B). Next, the ability of DKAR to reversibly report PKD signaling was examined by subsequently treating the cells with the PKD inhibitor Gö 6976. Following PKD inhibition, the FRET ratio change induced by PdBu treatment reversed (Fig. 2B). Not only does the reversibility of the response indicate that DKAR can act as a readout of both kinase activation and deactivation, but this result also confirms the specificity of PKD as the kinase responsible for phosphorylating DKAR. Thus, DKAR is a sensitive, reversible, and specific reporter of PKD signaling. The specificity of the DKAR response was further confirmed using a distinct pharmacological agent, Gö 6983, that inhibits all PKC isoforms but does not inhibit PKD. Previously we used Gö 6976, which inhibits not only PKD, but also conventional PKC isoforms. Importantly, Gö 6976 does not inhibit the novel PKC isoforms, which catalyze the activating phosphorylation of PKD. Thus, in the following experiments, cells treated with Gö 6983 would prevent the activating phosphorylations on PKD by novel PKCs, and PKD signaling would be blocked. In Fig. 2C (black diamonds), cells were treated first with PdBu and monitored until the DKAR FRET ratio reached its maximal response. Subsequent addition of Gö 6983 caused a modest drop in the FRET ratio. Note that this small decline is an artifact resulting from emission of the red-colored inhibitor into the FRET channel, 3L. L. Gallegos and A. C. Newton, unpublished data. and a similar decline can be observed following Gö 6983 addition in unstimulated cells. Taking this into account, Gö 6983 did not significantly reverse the DKAR response. Only after subsequent addition of Gö 6976 did the FRET ratio reverse. On the other hand, pretreatment of cells for 10 min with the PKC inhibitor Gö 6983 significantly blocked the DKAR response to PdBu (Fig. 2C, open circles). Together, these results verify the role of the novel PKCs in PKD signaling, and furthermore, they validate the specificity of DKAR as a PKD reporter. DKAR Reports Signaling Downstream of Endogenous G Protein-coupled Receptors—DKAR was designed to provide a realtime readout of PKD signaling in live cells; therefore, we wanted to monitor DKAR following stimulation of endogenous signaling pathways. To verify that the stimulus used in our study would lead to PKD activation, the phosphorylation state of the activation loop site of PKD was examined following receptor activation. The nucleotide UTP can stimulate phospholipase C-coupled P2Y receptors in many different cell types (19Brunschweiger A. Muller C.E. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20von Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn. Schmiedebergs. Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Treatment of COS-7 cells with PdBu or UTP both resulted in activation of PKD signaling as observed through the induction of phosphorylation of its activation loop site by upstream kinases (Fig. 3A). Histamine has been shown to activate G protein-coupled receptors in HeLa cells, and similarly, treatment of HeLa cells with PdBu or histamine resulted in PKD activation as seen by Western analysis of the PKD activation loop sequence (Fig. 3B). Having demonstrated the ability of UTP and histamine to activate PKD in COS-7 and HeLa cells, respectively, we next wanted to examine whether DKAR would report PKD activation following stimulation of these signaling pathways. COS-7 cells expressing DKAR were stimulated with UTP resulting in a rapid and sustained increase in the FRET ratio (Fig. 4A). Importantly, pretreatment of COS-7 cells for 10 min with the PKD inhibitor Gö 6976 completely blocked this increase confirming the specificity of DKAR as a reporter for PKD signaling downstream of UTP treatment (Fig. 4A). When the consensus threonine within the PKD substrate sequence of DKAR was mutated to an alanine (DKAR-T/A), treatment of cells with UTP resulted in no change in the FRET ratio (Fig. 4B). Although PKD signaling in HeLa cells was also observed using DKAR, the kinetics of the response was slightly different than the kinetics of the response observed in COS-7 cells following UTP treatment. Specifically, when HeLa cells expressing DKAR were stimulated with histamine, the FRET ratio change observed was rapid but began to decay within 2 min (Fig. 4C). However, the response did not fully reverse to baseline levels, even after PKD inhibition with Gö 6976 (data not shown). In accordance with this observation, pre-treatment of HeLa cells for 10 min with Gö 6976 followed by treatment with histamine resulted in a slower FRET ratio change that reached the same level as the new baseline observed from histamine treatment alone (Fig. 4C). Therefore, there exists either: 1) nonspecific phosphorylation by a distinct, Gö 6976-insensitive kinase, or 2) a pool of PKD within HeLa cells that cannot be inhibited by Gö 6976 treatment, which results in a ∼20% of maximal increase in the FRET ratio from DKAR. As a control, histamine did not cause a change in FRET ratio of DKAR-T/A expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, whereas the phosphorylation at the activation loop site on PKD was much more pronounced following PdBu treatment compared with UTP or histamine treatment (see Fig. 3), the kinetics of the DKAR response triggered by these ligands was considerably faster compared with the response triggered by PdBu (compare Fig. 2B with 4A and 4C). In summary, UTP or histamine treatment of COS-7 or HeLa cells, respectively, activates the PKD pathway resulting in a rapid and readily observed FRET ratio change by DKAR in live cells. Calcium Stimulates DKAR Phosphorylation—DKAR was designed to be a specific reporter of PKD signaling, and analysis of the substrate sequence by Scansite supported this specificity: a medium stringency scan indicates that PKD is the preferred kinase to phosphorylate DKAR. However, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is predicted by Scansite to be the next most likely kinase to phosphorylate the sequence. To examine the possibility that CaMKII activation may result in a FRET ratio change by DKAR, HeLa cells expressing the reporter were treated with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump inhibitor thapsigargin. Thapsigargin treatment leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+, a condition that would activate CaMKII within the cells. Following thapsigargin treatment of HeLa cells, DKAR displayed a significant and transient increase in the FRET ratio that returned to a new baseline (Fig. 5A). To assess whether CaMKII was mediating this Ca2+-induced FRET response from DKAR, we treated HeLa cells with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 before adding thapsigargin. As seen in Fig. 5B (closed triangles), pretreatment of cells with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 was not able to block the thapsigargin-induced DKAR FRET ratio change, therefore, CaMKII is not responsible for the FRET change by DKAR following Ca2+ release. Instead, pretreatment with the PKD inhibitor Gö 6976 prevented this thapsigargin-induced FRET ratio change (Fig. 5B, open circles). Because the DKAR response to increasing Ca2+ was blocked by Gö 6976 but not KN-93, these data reveal that the Ca2+ effect on DKAR is a result of PKD activity not CaMKII activity. To address whether the activation of PKD by Ca2+ is a general phenomenon, we asked whether elevation of Ca2+ also regulated PKD activity in a different cell line. Treatment of COS-7 cells with thapsigargin resulted in a slow and sustained FRET ratio change from DKAR that could be reversed to baseline levels following PKD inhibition (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed when Ca2+ levels were elevated through a distinct mechanism; COS-7 cells expressing DKAR were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. The FRET ratio of DKAR increased following ionomycin treatment when 1 mm Ca2+was present in the imaging saline (Fig. 5D). Removal of extracellular Ca2+ along with 5 mm EGTA to chelate residual Ca2+ in the imaging saline prevented a FRET ratio increase with ionomycin treatment; however, the FRET ratio increased rapidly when 10 mm Ca2+was added back to the imaging saline (Fig. 5E). Thus, surprisingly, increasing Ca2+ is sufficient to induce PKD signaling as reported by DKAR. Increasing Intracellular Ca2+ Results in DAG Production—A role for Ca2+ in PKD signaling has not been described previously, so our results showing that Ca2+ promotes DKAR phosphorylation were unexpected. Activation of PKD has traditionally been observed by monitoring the activating phosphorylations catalyzed by novel PKCs at the activation loop (Ser-744 and Ser-748). Once phosphorylated at these sites, PKD becomes catalytically competent and catalyzes its autophosphorylation at Ser-916 within its C terminus. Thus, this C-terminal site serves as a readout for the intrinsic catalytic activity of PKD. To directly address whether Ca2+ activates PKD, we analyzed the phosphorylation state of the activation loop and C-terminal sites of PKD following an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Western blot analyses of PKD from both COS-7 and HeLa cells that were treated for up to 15 min with thapsigargin revealed that PKD is not only phosphorylated by its upstream kinases at the activation loop site, but PKD also autophosphorylates following a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6). Thus, as suggested by the DKAR imaging experiments, PKD is activated by increasing Ca2+ levels in the cell. The phosphorylation of the activation loop site on PKD has been reported to be catalyzed by novel PKCs, however, novel PKCs are activ"

We also cloned a cDNA encoding a putative protein highly homologous to the human XT-I, which was termed XT-II (9Goötting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both amino acid sequences have a 55% overall sequence identity. In addition, highly homologous regions with more than 80% identical amino acids are present (9Goötting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol.

All higher organisms have been found to harbor two xylosyltransferase genes, whereas Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have only one xylosyltransferase (11Goötting C. Muöller S.

However, no enzymatic activity has been shown for XT-II and, consequently, the physiological function of this protein has remained a mystery. Nevertheless, we could already present evidence that XT-II is of biological importance since mutations in the XT-II gene are genetic risk factors for diseases that are characterized by an altered proteoglycan metabolism, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (14Schoön S.

In the present study, we transfected xylosyltransferase-deficient pgsA-745 CHO cells with human XT-I and XT-II cDNA to restore proteoglycan biosynthesis and to elucidate the physiological function of XT-II. XT-II is an active xylosyltransferase that is capable of restoring the GAG chain biosynthesis in mutant CHO cells, and XT-I and XT-II are differentially expressed in animal tissues. This is the first report on the physiological function of human XT-II and its involvement in the proteoglycan biosynthesis. Radiochemical Xylosyltransferase Activity Assay—The method for determining xylosyltransferase activity is based on the incorporation of d-[14C]xylose with silk, recombinant bikunin, or bikunin peptides as the acceptor and was performed as described previously (17Campbell P.

Complementation of the Proteoglycan Biosynthesis Defect in pgsA-745 CHO Cells by Human XT-I and XT-II—Wild-type CHO cells (CHO-K1, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and xylosyltransferase-deficient pgsA-745 CHO cells (22Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under standard conditions. pgsA-745 CHO cells were transfected with the plasmids pSS1 and pCMV6-XL6-XYLT2 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), as recommended by the manufacturer. pSS1 encodes a green fluorescent protein-tagged form of the full-length human XT-I (23Schoön S. Prante C. Bahr C. Kuhn J. Kleesiek K. Goötting C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14224-14231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and pCMV6-XL6-XYLT2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_022167, TrueClone, Origene, Rockville, MD) contains the complete cDNA of the full-length human XT-II. Stable transfectants were selected with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and single clones were isolated. Flow cytometry analysis of FGF-2 binding was performed as described in the supplemental data. Recombinant Expression of XT-II in the Yeast Pichia pastoris—A cDNA fragment encoding the amino acids 37–865 of the human XT-II was cloned in the pPICZαA vector, and the soluble form of XT-II was expressed in P. pastoris using standard conditions. The culture medium was harvested after 24 h, and the enzyme activity was analyzed. Mock-transfected cells were used as control. HPLC Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate and Heparan Sulfate Disaccharides—The isolation of GAG chains was performed as described in the supplemental data. 2-Amino-acridone labeling of GAG disaccharides and HPLC analysis were carried out as described previously (24Kitagawa H.

Electrophoresis. 2006; 27: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of Xylosyltransferase Expression in Murine Tissues—The mRNA expression of the mouse XT-I and XT-II genes in different mouse tissues was analyzed by a fluorogenic RT-PCR assay using the Realplex Mastercycler system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and cDNA from different mouse tissues (Mouse MTC Panel, Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). The primer sequences and the PCR protocols are listed in the supplemental data. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of Xylosyltransferase I and II Expression in Wild-type and pgsA-745 CHO Cells—mRNA expression of the XT-I and XT-II genes in wild-type and pgsA-745 CHO cells was quantified by a fluorogenic RT-PCR assay using the Realplex Mastercycler system (Eppendorf) and intron-spanning primers listed in the supplemental data. Analysis of XT-II Amino Acid Sequences—Homology analysis of the amino acid sequences of the XT-II was carried out using sequences extracted form the GenBank, Swissprot, or Ensembl databases. The sequences and the procedures are listed in the supplemental data. Homology Analysis of Xylosyltransferase II Orthologs and Identification of Highly Conserved Sequence Blocks—All higher organisms were found to possess two putative xylosyltransferase genes based on surveys of available genome sequences. Using the ClustalX alignment method, a sequence alignment of the XT-II peptide sequences from multiple organisms was performed. The XT-II was highly conserved among all species (Fig. 1). XT-II of human and apes showed more than 98% amino acid sequence identity, whereas the XT-II sequence from other organisms were 60–93% identical, with a much higher portion of amino acids with similar physicochemical properties. Interestingly, large conserved sequence blocks that contained identical amino acids among all XT-II sequences could be identified (Fig. 1B). These comprised the transmembrane domain (amino acids 14–38) and large stretches of the protein indicated by the rectangles in the figure. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal DXD motif, which is located at positions 651–653 in human XT-II and which was found to be important for enzyme activity in XT-I (11Goötting C. Muöller S. Schoöttler M. Schoön S. Prante C. Brinkmann T. Kuhn J. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42566-42573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is also situated in the fourth conserved sequence block. The carboxyl-terminal 25 amino acids of the XT-II are highly conserved, which is in accord with previous findings, indicating that this region was necessary for catalytic activity or enzyme stability in Drosophila and C. elegans xylosyltransferases (13Hwang H.Y. Olson S.K. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Horvitz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11735-11738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Wilson I.B. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 794-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings clearly show that XT-II is an evolutionarily highly conserved glycosyltransferase like XT-II homologs (9Goötting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Goötting C. Muöller S. Schoöttler M. Schoön S. Prante C. Brinkmann T. Kuhn J. Kleesiek K. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 386: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Analysis of the gene structure and size of the XT-II genes in different organisms revealed that they consist of 11 exons with highly conserved exonintron borders (Fig. 1A). Differential mRNA Expression of the Xylosyltransferases—The expression of XT-II and XT-I was analyzed in various murine tissues using a real-time RT-PCR-based method with normalized cDNA. The mRNA abundance of the target genes XYLT-I and XYLT-II was determined relative to the housekeeping genes encoding GAPDH, phospholipase A2, and β-actin. The highest expression level of XT-II was found in liver tissue, where the mRNA abundance was more than 2-fold higher than the average XT-II expression level in all eight organs (Fig. 2). High XT-II mRNA levels could also be detected in the lung and the kidney. On the other hand, XT-I was highly expressed in mouse testis, kidney, and brain. Interestingly, no XT-I mRNA was detectable in liver tissue (Fig. 2). The expression levels of both target genes in the investigated mouse tissues varied up to 10-fold. These findings support the conclusion that XT-I and XT-II have a tissue-specific expression pattern. Expression of XT-I and XT-II mRNA in Mutant pgsA-745 CHO Cells—pgsA-745 is a xylosyltransferase-deficient mutant CHO cell line that was reported to have less than 5% of the XT activity found in wild-type CHO-K1 cells (22Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, the genetic basis of the proteoglycan biosynthesis deficiency in pgsA-745 is hitherto unknown. As the Chinese hamster was hypothesized to harbor two xylosyltransferase genes, we analyzed whether the expression of the XT genes is affected in pgsA-745 cells. An RT-PCR approach with oligonucleotides derived from the mouse XT-I and XT-II mRNA sequence and CHO-K1 cDNA was applied to identify the hamster XT-I and XT-II cDNA. Amplicons spanning the putative exons 3–8 of the XT-I gene and the exons 6–11 of the XT-II gene were generated, sequenced, and used for the design of hamster-specific XT-I and XT-II cDNA primers. The sequence identity between the mouse and hamster XT-I and XT-II cDNA sequences was 92 and 91%, respectively. Quantification of XT-I and XT-II mRNA showed that XT-II is the predominant isoform present in CHO wild-type cells (ratio of XT-I/GAPDH, 1:574 copies; ratio of XT-II/GAPDH, 1.3:1 copies). The relative abundance of XT-I and XT-II mRNA in wild-type and pgsA-745 CHO cells was then quantified. XT-I transcripts were detected in wild-type cells but not in pgsA-745 cells. Furthermore, XT-II expression was 2.3-fold reduced when compared with wild-type cells, indicating that both genes are affected in the XT-deficient cell line pgsA-745. These results lead to the conclusion that multiple mutations in both XT genes are responsible for the XT deficiency of pgsA-745. Either promoter mutations or premature stop codons leading to nonsense-mediated decay (28Byers P.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and a decreased mRNA stability are valid explanations for the absence of XT-I mRNA and the marked reduction of XT-II mRNA in pgsA-745 cells. However, further hitherto unidentified missense mutations that result in an inactive XT-II enzyme are proposed to be present in these cells. Restoration of GAG Synthesis by Human XT-I and XT-II cDNA Expressed in Xylosyltransferase-deficient CHO Mutant pgsA-745—The xylosyltransferase-deficient mutant CHO cell line pgsA-745 is not capable of synthesizing chondroitin or heparan sulfate (22Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that the GAG biosynthesis capacity of pgsA-745 can be restored by recombinant C. elegans XT (13Hwang H.Y. Olson S.K. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Horvitz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11735-11738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we transfected pgsA-745 CHO cells with human XT-I and XT-II cDNA and analyzed the GAG-dependent binding of FGF-2 to the cell surface. Clonal cell lines stably expressing XT-I or XT-II were generated and showed a full restoration of FGF-2 binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface (Fig. 3). No significant differences between XT-I- and XT-II-expressing clones were observed. FGF-2 binding to the cell surface could be completely blocked by the addition of unfractionated heparin in wild-type and pgsA-745-XT-I and pgsA-745-XT-II cells yielding mean fluorescence values identical to the corresponding samples without the addition of FGF-2. Furthermore, pgsA-745-XT-I and pgsA-745-XT-II cells synthesize comparable amounts and types of GAG chains (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that both xylosyltransferases can participate in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains and that they are capable of compensating a cellular deficiency of either one xylosyltransferase or both xylosyltransferases.FIGURE 4Relative activity of XT-II for peptide and protein substrates and GAG content of transfected CHO cells. A, relative enzyme activity of XT-II expressed in pgsA-745-XT-II CHO cells. Xylosyltransferase activity in the cell culture supernatant of pgsA-745-XT-II CHO cells was measured after 7 days using the radiochemical XT assay with different acceptors for XT-II-mediated xylosylation. 1, biotin-NH-QEEEGSGGGQKK(5-fluorescein)-CONH2; 2, recombinant bikunin; 3, FGF-2-(1–24) peptide; 4, silk fibroin. The acceptor concentration in the assay was 5μm for each acceptor with the exception of silk fibroin (70 mm). Mean and S.D. are shown. B, quantification of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate content in XT-I- and XT-II-transfected pgsA-745 CHO cells. 500,000 cells were seeded into 175-cm2 T-flasks and grown for 7 days, and the GAG content was then analyzed in the cell lysates. XT-I- and XT-II-transfected pgsA-745 cells synthesize comparable amounts of heparan sulfate (HS, dark gray boxes) and chondroitin sulfate (CS, light gray boxes). The GAG content in pgsA-745 cells transfected with the empty vector was less than 1/10 of the GAG concentration present in xylosyltransferase-transfected cells. C, xylosyltransferase activity of a soluble form of human XT-II expressed in the yeast P. pastoris. Culture supernatant of P. pastoris/pPICZα-XT-II and the mock-transfected (Mock) control cells P. pastoris/pPICZα was harvested after 24 h, and the xylosyltransferase activity was determined using the bikunin-homologous peptide biotin-NH-QEEEGSGGGQKK(5-fluorescein)-CONH2 as acceptor. Mean value and S.D. are shown; n.d., not detected; detection limit <0.001 units/l.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of human XT-I and human XT-II in pgsA-745 cells also resulted in restoration of xylosyltransferase activity. XT activity in the cell culture supernatant, as measured by the transfer of xylose to the bikunin-homologous peptide biotin-NH-QEEEGSGGGQKK(5-fluorescein)-CONH2 in the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay, was determined to be 31 ± 0.1 in pgsA-745-XT-I and 29 ± 0.3 microunits/10E5 cells in pgsA-745-XT-II, respectively (Table 1). The observed XT activity in the XT-I- and XT-II-transfected cells is 20-fold higher than that in cell culture supernatant of wild-type cells, where the XT activity was determined to be 1.5 ± 0.2 microunits/10E5 cells. pgsA-745 cells and mock-transfected pgsA-745 cells had virtually no xylosyltransferase activity (<0.01 microunits/10E5 cells). In the cell lysates, XT activities were 0.3 ± 0.01 for pgsA-745-XT-I, 0.3 ± 0.01 for pgsA-745-XT-II, 0.1 ± 0.01 for wild type, and less than 0.01 microunits/10E5 cells for pgsA-745 and mock-transfected mutant cells.TABLE 1Xylosyltransferase activities in CHO cell linesCellsXylosyltransferase activityRatio EC/IC (XT activity)Culture supernatantCellsmicrounits/wellCHO-K1 wild-type59 ± 63 ± 0.519:1CHO pgsA-745NDNDNACHO pgsA-745-Mock0.2 ± 0.3NDNACHO pgsA-745-XT-I1238 ± 410 ± 0.1122:1CHO pgsA-745-XT-II1148 ± 1211 ± 0.2108:1 Open table in a new tab These data show that both enzymes were predominantly secreted (Table 1). It has been shown previously that XT-I is shed from the Golgi surface and is released into the extracellular space together with large proteoglycans (4Goötting C. Sollberg S. Kuhn J. Weilke C.

Kleesiek K. Goötting C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14224-14231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our present results now demonstrate that XT-II is also secreted into the culture supernatant. Although a regulatory role in proteoglycan trafficking has been proposed, the biological role of this secretion process remains to be elucidated. In addition, expression of soluble XT-II lacking the transmembrane domain in the yeast P. pastoris resulted in a high XT activity in the culture supernatant (3589 ± 186 milliunits/l, Fig. 4). In the mock-transfected control cells, no XT activity could be detected (detection limit <1 milliunits/l), confirming that XT-II has xylosyltransferase activity. Kinetic analysis of the human XT-II expressed in pgsA-745-XT-II cells revealed that XT-II catalyzes the xylosylation of similar acceptor peptides as human XT-I but with different acceptor affinities. The bikunin-homologous peptide biotin-NH-QEEEGSGGGQKK(5-fluorescein)-CONH2 (19Kuhn J. Prante C. Schoön S. Goötting C. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 2006; 52: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is the best substrate known so far for XT-II-mediated xylosylation (Km 5.2 ± 0.5 μm). The Michaelis-Menten constant for recombinant bikunin was determined to be 22 ± 2 μm. The FGF-2-(1–24) peptide, which is homologous to the amino-terminal 24 amino acids of FGF-2 and which has been shown to be a good XT-I acceptor (29Kuhn J. Schnoölzer M. Schoön S. Muöller S. Prante C. Goötting C. Kleesiek K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), is also recognized by XT-II (Km 62 ± 21 μm). Furthermore, silk fibroin is a low affinity acceptor for XT-II (Km 677 ± 191 μm). The relative activity of XT-II for different peptide and protein substrates is shown in Fig. 4. To identify the reaction products, the bikunin-homologous peptide was xylosylated by either recombinant XT-I or recombinant XT-II and subsequently subjected to the linkage-specific digestion of the bound xylose with α-xylosidase, β-xylosidase, and alkaline β-elimination. In all samples, the incorporated xylose could be released from the peptide by β-xylosidase treatment and alkaline β-elimination but not by incubation with α-xylosidase. These results demonstrate that the xylose residue was transferred to the hydroxyamino acid serine of the peptide through a β-linkage and that both XT-I and XT-II are UDP-d-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-d-xylosyltransferases (EC 2.4.2.26). Conclusion—Although the XT-II gene was already described by us in 2000 (9Goötting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the XT-II enzymatic activity remained unknown for a long time. So far, only an inexplicit description of preliminary data was published, which suggested a potentially low level XT-II-mediated transfer of xylose to a perlecan peptide (30Brunner A. Kolarich D. Voglmeir J. Paschinger K. Wilson I.B. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we can now present for the first time evidence that XT-II is a xylosyltransferase that is involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Our experiments show that transfection of either XT-I or XT-II cDNA leads to a complete rescue of the proteoglycanbiosynthesis capacity of pgsA-745 CHO cells. Furthermore, our initial results prove that both enzymes utilize similar acceptors for xylosylation but with different acceptor affinities. Marked differences in the tissue-specific expression pattern of XT-I and XT-II were noticed; for example, XT-II is the only xylosyltransferase present in liver tissues. To summarize, these findings let us conclude that XT-I and XT-II are highly similar xylosyltransferases with tissue-specific expression patterns and that both enzymes are involved in the posttranslational biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region in proteoglycans. The presence of two xylosyltransferase genes in all higher organisms points to the importance of these enzymes for essential cellular functions. In addition, no human disease is known so far that is caused by a loss-of-function defect of any of the xylosyltransferases. However, mutations in the XT-II gene have been shown to be genetic risk factors for diseases that are associated with an altered proteoglycan metabolism (14Schoön S. Schulz V. Prante C. Hendig D.

For example, we could show that the XT-II gene mutation c.166G → A (p.D56N) leads to a more than 13-fold increased risk of a severe disease course and multiple organ effects in pseudoxanthoma elasticum patients (14Schoön S.

https://openalex.org/W2080962330,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy has provided important insights into the structure and function of the Mn4Ca cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of Photosystem II (PS II). The range of manganese extended x-ray absorption fine structure data collected from PS II until now has been, however, limited by the presence of iron in PS II. Using a crystal spectrometer with high energy resolution to detect solely the manganese Kα fluorescence, we are able to extend the extended x-ray absorption fine structure range beyond the onset of the iron absorption edge. This results in improvement in resolution of the manganese-backscatterer distances in PS II from 0.14 to 0.09Ä. The high resolution data obtained from oriented spinach PS II membranes in the S1 state show that there are three di-μ-oxo-bridged manganese-manganese distances of ∼2.7 and ∼2.8Ä in a 2:1 ratio and that these three manganese-manganese vectors are aligned at an average orientation of ∼60° relative to the membrane normal. Furthermore, we are able to observe the separation of the Fourier peaks corresponding to the ∼3.2Ä manganese-manganese and the ∼3.4Ä manganese-calcium interactions in oriented PS II samples and determine their orientation relative to the membrane normal. The average of the manganese-calcium vectors at ∼3.4Ä is aligned along the membrane normal, while the ∼3.2Ä manganese-manganese vector is oriented near the membrane plane. A comparison of this structural information with the proposed Mn4Ca cluster models based on spectroscopic and diffraction data provides input for refining and selecting among these models.

This results in improvement in resolution of the manganese-backscatterer distances in PS II from 0.14 to 0.09Ä. The high resolution data obtained from oriented spinach PS II membranes in the S1 state show that there are three di-μ-oxo-bridged manganese-manganese distances of ∼2.7 and ∼2.8Ä in a 2:1 ratio and that these three manganese-manganese vectors are aligned at an average orientation of ∼60° relative to the membrane normal. Furthermore, we are able to observe the separation of the Fourier peaks corresponding to the ∼3.2Ä manganese-manganese and the ∼3.4Ä manganese-calcium interactions in oriented PS II samples and determine their orientation relative to the membrane normal. The average of the manganese-calcium vectors at ∼3.4Ä is aligned along the membrane normal, while the ∼3.2Ä manganese-manganese vector is oriented near the membrane plane. A comparison of this structural information with the proposed Mn4Ca cluster models based on spectroscopic and diffraction data provides input for refining and selecting among these models. Photosynthesis by green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria provides essentially all of the dioxygen in the biosphere as a byproduct of the electron transfer processes utilizing water as the ultimate electron source: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e–.Water oxidation is a light-driven reaction that is catalyzed by an oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) 4The abbreviations used are: OEC, oxygen-evolving complex; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform; PS II, photosystem II; XANES, x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; XRD, x-ray diffraction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: OEC, oxygen-evolving complex; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; FT, Fourier transform; PS II, photosystem II; XANES, x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; XRD, x-ray diffraction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. of Photosystem II (PS II) (1Debus R.J.

The active site of the OEC is known to be a protein-bound complex containing four manganese and one calcium atom. This complex cycles through a series of five intermediate redox states that are referred to as S states (S0 to S4) (5Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). The S state transitions are driven by successive light-induced one-electron oxidations of the PS II reaction center. In each step the complex accumulates oxidizing equivalents until dioxygen is released during the spontaneous return from S4 to S0.Many of the proposed mechanisms of water oxidation depend critically on knowledge of the Mn4Ca cluster structure. To date, structural models of the OEC complex have been suggested based on EPR techniques (6Miller A.F. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

A recent XAS study showed that the OEC complex is very susceptible to reduction and disruption during x-ray exposure, under the conditions used in collecting the published XRD data (24Yano J. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Latimer M.J. Bergmann U. Glatzel P. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Sauer K. Messinger J. Zouni A. Yachandra V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consequently, the precise location of the manganese and calcium atoms has not been reliably established within active OEC centers by XRD, as acknowledged in the most recent study (17Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar).Manganese XAS enables a detailed analysis of the Mn4Ca cluster in the OEC. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) contains information on the electronic structure and changes in oxidation states of the manganese that accompany S state transitions (25Messinger J. Robblee J.H. Bergmann U. Fernandez C. Glatzel P. Visser H. Cinco R.M. McFarlane K.L. Bellacchio E. Pizarro S.A. Cramer S.P. Sauer K. Klein M.P. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 7804-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). EXAFS allows for a precise determination of manganese-backscatterer distances (26Yachandra V.K. Wydrzynski T. Satoh S. Photosystem II: The Light-Driven Water:Plastoquinone Oxidoreductase. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005: 235-260Google Scholar) and is, furthermore, very sensitive for establishing the permissible x-ray dose (24Yano J. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Latimer M.J. Bergmann U. Glatzel P. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Sauer K. Messinger J. Zouni A. Yachandra V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12047-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar).Recent EXAFS studies of the Mn4Ca cluster of the OEC have led to the conclusion that there are three manganese-manganese vectors in the range 2.7–2.9 Ä reflecting di-μ-oxo-bridged manganese atom pairs (27Yano J. Pushkar Y. Glatzel P. Lewis A. Sauer K. Messinger J. Bergmann U. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14974-14975Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), one manganese-manganese vector at 3.3 Ä, and one or two manganese-calcium vectors at 3.4 Ä (22Cinco R.M. Holman K.L.M.

Fernandez C. Holman K.L.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13271-13282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability of the EXAFS technique to determine the presence of similar backscatterers at closely separated distances, ΔR, is dependent on Δk, the width of the k-space EXAFS data set (Ä–1) (for details see supplemental data). The presence of iron, partly an integral component of the OEC and partly from adventitious sources, restricts the useful range in conventional manganese EXAFS to ∼550 eV (Δk = 12.5 Ä–1) above the manganese edge (iron K-edge at 7120 eV). Consequently, in PS II the manganese-manganese distance resolution is limited to Δr = 0.14 Ä, meaning that two manganese-manganese vectors should differ greater than 0.14 Ä to be resolved. Improvement in manganese-backscatterer distance resolution is critical for precise structural and mechanistic studies of the OEC. Conventional EXAFS spectra of PS II samples are based on the detection of the manganese Kα1,2 fluorescence (∼5.9 keV) using a solid state detector of at best 150–200 eV from full width at half-maximum resolution (28Scott R.A. Rousseau D.L. Structural and Resonance Techniques in Biological Research. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 295-362Crossref Google Scholar, 29Cramer S.P. Koningsberger D.C. Prins R.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 638-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), making it impossible to discriminate completely against the Fe Kα1,2 fluorescence at 6.4 keV (see Fig. 1). This limitation can be overcome by utilizing a crystal monochromator with high resolution (∼1 eV) for the fluorescence detection (31Bergmann U. Cramer S.P. SPIE Conference on Crystal and Multilayer Optics. SPIE, San Diego, CA1998: 198-209Google Scholar, 32Glatzel P. de Groot F.M.F. Manoilova O. Grandjean D. Weckhuysen B.M. Bergmann U. Barrea R. Phys. Rev. B. 2005; 72: 014-117Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that manganese EXAFS of the OEC can be collected up to ∼1000 eV (k = 16.1 Ä–1) above the manganese K-edge (27Yano J. Pushkar Y. Glatzel P. Lewis A. Sauer K. Messinger J. Bergmann U. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14974-14975Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), improving the manganese-backscatterer distance resolution to 0.09 Ä. This enabled us to study the heterogeneity in the manganese-manganese distances of solution samples in the S1 and S2 states, providing evidence for three manganese-manganese distances of ∼2.7 and ∼2.8 Ä present in a 2:1 ratio (27Yano J. Pushkar Y. Glatzel P. Lewis A. Sauer K. Messinger J. Bergmann U. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14974-14975Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These improvements in determining the structural parameters are important for choosing among different proposed structural models, and they provide an opportunity for investigating the changes that occur as the Mn4Ca catalyst cycles through the S states. Additional geometric information about the spatial arrangement of manganese-backscatter vectors can be obtained if oriented PS II samples, such as oriented membranes or single crystals, are used for the measurement of EXAFS dichroism with linearly polarized synchrotron x-rays. Collection of the polarized EXAFS spectra on oriented PS II membranes at different angles between the membrane normal and the x-ray electric field vector results in dichroism that depends on how the particular absorber manganese-backscatter vector is aligned with respect to the electric field of the x-ray beam. Thus, the average orientation of a particular manganese-backscatter vector relative to the membrane normal and the average number of scatterers per absorbing atom can be determined (33George G.N. Prince R.C. Cramer S.P. Science. 1989; 243: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 34Mukerji I. Andrews J.C. DeRose V.J. Latimer M.J. Yachandra V.K. Sauer K. Klein M.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5274-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Previous studies on oriented native and NH3-treated PS II membranes were based on conventional EXAFS. Average angles relative to the membrane normal of ∼60° for the ∼2.7 Ä vectors (di-μ-oxo-bridged Mn2 units) and ∼43° for the ∼3.3 Ä vectors (superposition of mono-μ-oxo-bridged manganese-manganese and manganese-calcium vectors) have been reported in two studies (34Mukerji I.

Liang W. Yachandra V.K. Sauer K. Klein M.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5274-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas another study reported an average angle of 80 ± 10° for the ∼2.7 Ä vectors without providing results for the ∼3.3 Ä vector (36Schiller H. Dittmer J. Iuzzolino L. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Solé V.A. Nolting H.-F. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7340-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of the limited resolution, conventional EXAFS is not able to determine the orientations of the individual manganese-manganese and manganese-calcium vectors in the 3.2–3.4 Ä region. In a complementary study, strontium K-edge polarized EXAFS of strontium-reactivated PS II membranes was used to predict the manganese-calcium orientation. It showed a lower and upper limit of 0 and 23°, respectively, for the average angle between the manganese-strontium vector(s) and the membrane normal and yielded an isotropic coordination number of manganese neighbors to strontium of either one or two (23Cinco R.M. Robblee J.H. Messinger J. Fernandez C. Holman K.L.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13271-13282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A recent polarized x-ray absorption spectroscopy study of PS II single crystals from cyanobacteria, using an x-ray dose below the threshold of damage, has derived feasible structures for the Mn4Ca cluster and the orientation of the cluster in the PS II crystal (14Yano J. Kern J. Sauer K. Latimer M. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Saenger W. Messinger J. Zouni A. Yachandra V.K. Science. 2006; 314: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar).In this work, we applied range-extended EXAFS to study the dichroism of the Mn4Ca cluster in oriented PS II membranes from spinach chloroplasts. The study shows: (i) the separation of the manganese-manganese (∼3.2 Ä) and manganese-calcium (∼3.4 Ä) vectors, which allows independent analysis of their orientation relative to the membrane normal; (ii) the determination of the dichroism characteristics of the three short manganese-manganese vectors (two at 2.7 Ä and one at 2.8 Ä) and their orientation in the PS II membrane. These results are used to discuss the structure and orientation of the Mn4Ca cluster in the PS II membrane.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample Preparation and Characterization—PS II samples were prepared from spinach as previously described (37Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). They typically contain 4 manganese per 200–250 chlorophylls. The oxygen evolution rates for the PS II samples used in this study are between 400 and 500 μmol O2/(mg chlorophylls · h). The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm MES buffer, pH = 6.0, containing 0.4 m sucrose and 5 mm CaCl2 and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C (39,000 × g, 1 h). One or two drops of 50 mm MES buffer were added to the pellet, and the resulting paste was painted onto Mylar tape. The PS II membranes were dried under a stream of cold nitrogen gas at 4 °C in the dark for ∼1 h, as described previously (38Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 189-201Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This process was repeated five to seven times to generate samples with a sufficiently thick sample layer for the x-ray absorption experiment.The paint-and-dry cycles produce one-dimensionally ordered samples with a preferred orientation of the PS II membrane normal perpendicular to the substrate surface. The extent of orientation (mosaic spread, which is the half-width of the Gaussian distribution of the angle of the membrane normal to the substrate normal in the PS II samples) was assessed from the angle dependence of the Tyr Dox and cytochrome b559 EPR signals (see supplemental data). X-band EPR spectroscopy was performed with a Varian E-109 spectrometer, a standard TE102 cavity, and an Air Products liquid helium cryostat. The samples used in this study displayed a mosaic spread of 15–20°. After drying the samples, their integrity was assayed by monitoring the amount of S2 multiline signal formed upon sample illumination at 195 K. The amplitude of the manganese signal was the same as that obtained from randomly oriented membranes at a similar concentration. Manganese K-edge XANES spectra of oriented samples can be used to reconstruct the solution XANES spectrum, which is very sensitive to the manganese oxidation state and damaged PS II centers containing Mn2+. The two spectra are indistinguishable, indicating the intact state of the oriented samples.Data Collection—The x-ray spectra were recorded on the BioCAT undulator beamline 18-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). The energy of the incident x-rays was selected by means of a nitrogen-cooled silicon double-crystal monochromator at (111) orientation, yielding ∼1-eV resolution. The monochromator energy was calibrated using the preedge peak energy of KMnO4 at 6543.3 eV. Higher harmonics from the monochromator were rejected by the focusing mirror. The incident beam intensity was set to ∼4 × 1012 photons/s (∼60% of the flux available at 18-ID) at a beam size of 1 × 2 mm2. This allowed us to perform fast EXAFS scans in continuous mode before the onset of radiation damage; 15 s per sweep, energy range 6500 to 7500 eV in 1 eV increments, one sweep per spot on sample, 15–20 different spots per sample depending on orientation, ∼100 samples per orientation. The EXAFS scan parameters were chosen subsequent to and on the basis of a radiation damage study of the samples. XANES spectra were collected under identical conditions (number of photons, time and temperature that were used for subsequent EXAFS measurements), and the inflection point energy of the XANES spectra was monitored for any shifts to establish the safe x-ray dose (24Yano J. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Latimer M.J. Bergmann U. Glatzel P. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Sauer K. Messinger J. Zouni A. Yachandra V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12047-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Radiation damage measurements were determined for both 15 and 75° orientations of the samples used in the study and were repeated each time we had x-ray beamtime at the synchrotron sources to account for any changes in the beam characteristics. A second 15-s sweep of the EXAFS for some samples was collected and the spectra were unchanged, providing additional confirmation of the absence of radiation damage. To avoid unnecessary sample exposure, a beam shutter was automatically inserted when data were not being collected. The manganese Kα fluorescence was detected by four spherically bent germanium analyzers (8.9 cm diameter, 85 cm radius of curvature) using the (333) Bragg reflection in a Rowland geometry. The analyzer energy was tuned to the manganese Kα1 peak at 5899 eV at a Bragg angle of 74.84°. A nitrogen-cooled solid state (germanium) detector was placed at the common focus of the four crystals on the intersecting Rowland circles. The analyzer bandwidth of 0.8 eV was determined by measuring the elastically scattered peak.Experimental procedures and limitations for measuring range-extended EXAFS past multiple K- or L-edges, and the design and operation of the spectrometer have been described previously (32Glatzel P. de Groot F.M.F.

All samples were measured below 10 K in a liquid He cooled cryostat (Oxford CF1208).Data Analysis—For each EXAFS scan, the energy was calibrated using the KMnO4 pre-edge reference peak (6543.3 eV), and the intensity was normalized by I0 before averaging. Approximately 1000 scans were averaged for each orientation of PS II membranes relative to the x-ray e-vector with a custom Matlab program. Data reduction of the EXAFS spectra was done as described previously (10DeRose V.J. Mukerji I. Latimer M.J. Yachandra V.K. Sauer K. Klein M.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5239-5249Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40Robblee J.H. Messinger J. Cinco R.M. McFarlane K.L. Fernandez C. Pizarro S.A. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem.

Curve fitting was performed using ab initio calculated phases and amplitudes from the FEFF8 program from the University of Washington (41Rehr J.J. Albers R.C. Rev. Mod. Phys. 2000; 72: 621-654Crossref Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). These phases and amplitudes were used in the EXAFS Equation 1, which is described below and contains a sinusoidal function that gives the distance and an amplitude function that contains information about the scattering atom and the number of such neighboring atoms. χ(k)=S02∑jNjkRj2feffj(π,k,Rj)e−2σj2k2e−2Rj/λj(k)×sin(2kRj+αij(k))(Eq. 1) The neighboring atoms to the central atom(s) are divided into j shells, with all atoms with the same atomic number and distance from the central atom grouped into a single shell. Within each shell, the coordination number Nj denotes the number of neighboring atoms in shell j at a distance of Rj from the central atom, i. feffj is the ab initio amplitude function for shell j, and the Debye-Waller term e−2σj2k2 accounts for damping due to both static and thermal disorder in absorber-backscatterer distances. The mean free path term e–2Rj/λj(k) reflects losses due to inelastic scattering, where λj(k) is the electron mean free path. The oscillations in the EXAFS spectrum are reflected in the sinusoidal term sin(2kRj + αij(k)), where αij(k) is the ab initio phase function for shell j. This sinusoidal term shows the direct relation between the frequency of the EXAFS oscillations in k-space and the absorber-backscatterer distance. The EXAFS equation (Equation 1) was used to fit the experimental Fourier isolates using N, R, and σ2 as variable parameters. Fit details and evaluation of fit qualities are given in the supplemental data.The spatial resolution in EXAFS is inversely related to the spectral range. Several formulas can be found in the EXAFS literature describing the resolution limits of the method, such as ΔRΔk ≈ 1, ΔRkmax = π/2 and ΔRΔk = π/2 (40Robblee J.H. Messinger J. Cinco R.M.

Angle θ is the angle between the x-ray e-vector and the membrane normal, and ϕ denotes the relative orientation of the manganese-backscatterer (manganese-manganese or manganese-calcium) vector of interest to the membrane normal.RESULTSManganese X-ray Absorption Spectra—X-ray absorption manganese K-edge spectra of oriented membranes in the S1 state are shown in Fig. 2. Data were collected for two orientations in which the sample normal is placed at either 15 or 75° to the direction of the e-vector of the polarized x-rays. The edge positions and post-edge shape exhibit a marked angle dependence, as reported previously for oriented PS II membranes (34Mukerji I. Andrews J.C. DeRose V.J. Latimer M.J. Yachandra V.K. Sauer K. Klein M.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9712-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Dichroism of the manganese K-edge spectra is even more obvious in the second-derivative spectra (Fig. 2, bottom). The powder manganese XANES spectrum created from the spectra collected from oriented membranes at two different orientations is identical to that obtained from a frozen solution sample. This result provides independent confirmation that the oriented samples are intact and not damaged by x-rays.FIGURE 2Manganese K-edge spectra of oriented PS II membranes.

https://openalex.org/W1985391791,"Myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) binds to myosin with two binding sites, one close to the N terminus and the other at the C terminus. Here we present the solution structure of one part of the N-terminal binding site, the third immunoglobulin domain of the cardiac isoform of human MyBP-C (cC2) together with a model of its interaction with myosin. Domain cC2 has the beta-sandwich structure expected from a member of the immunoglobulin fold. The C-terminal part of the structure of cC2 is very closely related to telokin, the myosin binding fragment of myosin light chain kinase. Domain cC2 also contains two cysteines on neighboring strands F and G, which would be able to form a disulfide bridge in a similar position as in telokin. Using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry we demonstrate that cC2 alone binds to a fragment of myosin, S2Delta, with low affinity (kD = 1.1 mM) but exhibits a highly specific binding site. This consists of the C-terminal surface of the C'CFGA' beta-sheet, which includes Glu(301), a residue mutated to Gln in the disease familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The binding site on S2 was identified by a combination of NMR binding experiments of cC2 with S2Delta containing the cardiomyopathy-linked mutation R870H and molecular modeling. This mutation lowers the binding affinity and changes the arrangement of side chains at the interface. Our model of the cC2-S2Delta complex gives a first glimpse of details of the MyBP-C-myosin interaction. Using this model we suggest that most key interactions are between polar amino acids, explaining why the mutations E301Q in cC2 and R870H in S2Delta could be involved in cardiomyopathy. We expect that this model will stimulate future research to further refine the details of this interaction and their importance for cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2023680135,"The Fas/FasL signaling pathway has previously been demonstrated to be critical for triggering germ cell apoptosis in response to mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP)-induced Sertoli cell injury. Although Sertoli cells ubiquitously express the FasL protein, MEHP-induced germ cell apoptosis appears to tightly correlate with increased levels of Sertoli cell FasL. Here we characterize the transcriptional regulation of the murine FasL gene in Sertoli cells after MEHP exposure. A serial deletion strategy for 1.5 kb of the 5'-upstream activating sequence of the FasL promoter was used to determine transcriptional activity in response to MEHP. Luciferase activity of the FasL promoter in the rat Sertoli cell line ASC-17D revealed that two regions, -500 to -324 and -1250 to -1000, were necessary to drive the inducible transcription of FasL. Sequence analysis of these two regions revealed two cis-regulatory elements, NF-kappaB and Sp-1. By site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, it was confirmed that MEHP-induced FasL expression is enhanced through the transcriptional regulation of both NF-kappaB and Sp-1. Experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo revealed that MEHP exposure results in an increased production of sTNF-alpha and that sTNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation causes robust increases in FasL levels in both the ASC-17D Sertoli cell line and in primary rat Sertoli cell/germ cell co-cultures. In the seminiferous epithelium, Sertoli cells express TNFR1, whereas germ cells produce TNF-alpha. Therefore, sTNF-alpha released by germ cells after MEHP-induced Sertoli cell injury acts upon Sertoli cell TNFR1 and activates NF-kappaB and Sp-1 that consequently causes a robust induction of FasL expression. These novel findings point to a potential feed-forward signaling mechanism by which germ cells prompt Sertoli cells to trigger their apoptotic elimination."
https://openalex.org/W1995150531,"Homeodomain only protein, Hop, is an unusual small protein that modulates target gene transcription without direct binding to DNA. Here we show that Hop interacts with Enhancer of Polycomb1 (Epc1), a homolog of a Drosophila polycomb group gene product that regulates transcription, to induce the skeletal muscle differentiation. Yeast two-hybrid assay with the human adult heart cDNA library revealed that Hop can associate with Epc1. The amino-terminal domain of Epc1 as well as full Epc1 physically interacted with Hop in mammalian cells and in yeast. Epc1 is highly expressed in the embryonic heart and adult skeletal muscles. Serum deprivation induced differentiation of H9c2, a myoblast cell line, into skeletal myocytes, and Epc1 was up-regulated. Differentiation of H9c2 was induced by Epc1 overexpression, although it was severely impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Co-transfection of Hop potentiated Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin and myotube formation. Hop knock-out mice elicited a decrease in myosin heavy chain and myogenin expressions in skeletal muscle and showed delay in hamstring muscle healing after injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from Hop knock-out mice. These results suggest that Epc1 plays a role in the initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation, and its interaction with Hop is required for the full activity.

These results suggest that Epc1 plays a role in the initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation, and its interaction with Hop is required for the full activity. In cardiac muscle differentiation, the fine regulation of temporal and spatial expression of heart-specific genes in response to developmental events may require precise interactions among various transactivators and repressors, giving rise to cardiomyocytes from primordial cardiomyoblasts. Hop (homeodomain only protein) is an example of fine regulation of cardiomyocyte-specific gene transcription (1Chen F. Kook H. Milewski R. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Li J. Nazarian R. Schnepp R. Jen K.

Likewise, muscle-specific gene regulations are dependent on the precise orchestration between series of specific transcription factors and other ubiquitous factors. Hop encodes a 73-amino acid protein that includes a 60-amino acid motif homologous to the homeodomain of Hox transcription factors. Unlike other Hox homeodomains that regulate embryonic patterning, cell fate specification, and organ formation, however, Hop is unable to bind DNA. Nevertheless, Hop can function to modulate transcription by interfering serum-response factor (SRF) 4The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum-response factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; MHC, myosin heavy chain; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; PcG, polycomb group; E, embryonic day. 4The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum-response factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; MHC, myosin heavy chain; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; PcG, polycomb group; E, embryonic day.-dependent transcription of cardiac-specific genes. Thus, half of homozygous Hop mutant mouse embryos die of failure of cardiac muscle compaction (1Chen F. Kook H. Milewski R. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Li J. Nazarian R. Schnepp R. Jen K. Biben C. Runke G.

Enhancer of Polycomb1 (Epc1) is an unusual member of the polycomb group (PcG) gene family. Although homozygotic mutations of E(Pc) in Drosophila are lethal in the embryo, heterozygous mutations do not by themselves result in a zygotic homeotic phenotype. Rather, mutations in E(Pc) enhance the phenotypes in mutations of other PcG genes (3Hayes P.H. Sato T. Denell R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Sato T. Denell R.E. Dev. Biol. 1985; 110: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although Epc1 itself does not have enzymatic activity, the complex, including Epc1, is reported to possess both activating and repressive activities as a transcription regulator. For example, human EPC1 was also shown to interact with the transcriptional repressor RET finger protein, RFP (similar to RING1) (5Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Likewise, transcriptional repressor complex E2F6 containing Epc1 has a function to regulate the cell cycle. As an effort to understand the role of Hop in muscle-specific gene regulation, we sought a Hop-binding candidate by the yeast two-hybrid screening technique and found that Epc1, a novel Hop-interacting partner, initiates skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction with Hop is required for the full activity. Animals and Plasmid Constructs—Pregnant CD1 mice were purchased from Daehan Biolink (Daejeon, Korea). Hop knock-out mice were kindly provided by Prof. Jonathan A. Epstein (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). The experimental protocols were approved by the Chonnam National University Medical School Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. pcDNA3.1-mouse Hop-myc was described previously (6Kook H. Lepore J.J. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Wing-Man Yung W. Mackay J. Zhou R. Ferrari V. Gruber P. Epstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). pGBKT7-human HOP and pcDNA3.1-human HOP-V5/His were prepared by subcloning after PCR amplification of coding region of Hop from pcDNA3.1-HOP-myc or from human adult heart cDNA library (BD Biosciences). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. pCMV-myc-mouse Epc1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kristian Helin (Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Structures of human EPC1 and its truncated mutants were described previously (5Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Four Epc1 truncated mutants of the EPcA domain-containing region (EPC A, amino acids 2-285), EPcB domain-containing region (EPC B, amino acids 280-496), EPcC domain- and glutamine-rich-containing region (EPC CQ, amino acids 493-620), or CQ and carboxyl-terminal region (EPC CQCT, amino acids 493-836) are shown in Fig. 2A. For myogenin minimal promoter (7Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), -185 to +45 bp from the transcription start sequence was amplified from mouse genomic DNA and subcloned into pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For antisense strategy, complementary sequences of the 1-516-nucleotide region of rat Epc1 was amplified and subcloned into pcDNA6/myc-HisA (Invitrogen) containing the blasticidine resistance gene. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening for Binding Candidates—All assays were carried out according to the protocols of MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (BD Biosciences). pGBKT7-human HOP plasmid was co-transfected with human adult heart cDNA library into the AH109 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Approximately 1250 independent clones were found to grow on a minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine with 2.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. To confirm the positive reactions, a yeast one-to-one hybrid was performed in the AH109 yeast strains to detect the initiation of the lacZ reporter gene transcription qualitatively. Colony-lift filter assay was used to check the activity of β-galactosidase. Plasmid DNA from positive yeast clones were further characterized by sequencing and analyzed for gene homology by the BLAST data base. Epc1 domain mapping study was done by yeast one-to-one match experiments. The pGBKT7-human HOP plasmid was co-transfected with pACT2-EPC A, pACT2-EPC B, pACT2-EPC CQ, or pACT2-EPC CQCT into the AH109 strain of S. cerevisiae, and the histidine “jump-start” method was utilized. Antibodies, Cell Cultures, and Transfection Study—Epc1 antibody was generated from Peptron (Daejeon, South Korea), with the epitope region of human Epc1 195-209 amino acids. The antibodies able to recognize myogenin (Sc-576, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (M2, Sigma), V5 (Invitrogen) embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHCemb, MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and desmin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were utilized. H9c2, HeLa, COS7, and 293T cells were obtained from Seoul Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) and maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Differentiation of H9c2 cells was induced by depriving the serum with 1% FBS as described previously (8L'Ecuyer T. Horenstein M.S. Thomas R. Heide R.V. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To establish antisense Epc1 cell lines, pcDNA6/myc-HisA-antisense Epc1 and vector was transfected to H9c2 cells. The cells were treated with 5 μg/ml blasticidine (Invitrogen), and positive colonies were selected 2 weeks later. Epc1-overexpressing cell lines were generated by co-transfecting pCMV-myc-Epc1 and pSV2-hygro (Invitrogen). Positive cells were selected by adding 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. For transient transfection of Hop and Epc1, pcDNA3.1-HOP-V5/His and/or pCMV-myc-Epc1 was introduced to H9c2 cells by Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The differentiation rates were determined morphologically by analyzing multinucleated myotube formation and nuclei clustering using phalloidin staining. The nuclear fusion indices were measured as described (9Kashour T. Burton T. Dibrov A. Amara F. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 937-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The rate of myoblast fusion was expressed as the percentage of nuclei in fused cells of the total number of nuclei in randomly chosen fields as viewed under a microscope. Cells containing more than three nuclei were regarded as fused cells. The effect of Hop and Epc1 on cell proliferation/survival was measured by direct cell counting. Transfection of pcDNA3.1-HOP-V5/His and/or pCMV-myc-Epc1 to H9c2 cells was repeated every other day; the cells were lifted at the 5th days, and the numbers were counted as described previously (10Koh J.T. Kook H. Kee H.J. Seo Y.W. Jeong B.C. Lee J.H. Kim M.Y. Yoon K.C. Jung S. Kim K.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 172-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Primary myoblasts from either wild type or Hop knock-out mice were prepared as described (11Rawls A. Morris J.H. Rudnicki M. Braun T. Arnold H.H. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Muscle tissues from hindlimbs were dissociated by mincing with microdissecting scissors followed by treatment with collagenase (2 mg/ml; Worthington) for 60 min and trypsin/EDTA (0.25% Invitrogen) for 20 min. Then the enzymatic digestion was stopped by the addition of DMEM containing 15% FBS. The cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm and then a 70-μm sieve (Cell Strainer Nylon, Falcon) and collected. The cells were resuspended, and the contaminating fibroblasts were removed by preplating the cell suspension for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. The myoblasts were plated on culture dishes coated with 0.2% collagen and grown in 15% FBS in DMEM supplemented with 5 nm basic fibroblast growth factor (BIOSOURCE). Forty eight hours later, the cells were preplated once more to remove the extra fibroblast. To induce differentiation, the growth medium was changed to 2% horse serum in DMEM. Promoter analysis was described previously (1Chen F. Kook H. Milewski R. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Li J. Nazarian R. Schnepp R. Jen K. Biben C. Runke G. Mackay J.P. Novotny J. Schwartz R.J. Harvey R.P. Mullins M.C. Epstein J.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). H9c2 cells were plated in 24-well plates, and transfections were carried out. Total DNA used in each transfection was adjusted by adding the pcDNA3.1 vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured (Promega). Transfection rate was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Protocols for immunoprecipitation and Western blot were described previously (6Kook H. Lepore J.J. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Wing-Man Yung W. Mackay J. Zhou R. Ferrari V. Gruber P. Epstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Epc1 full or truncated mutants together with pcDNA3.1-HOP-V5/His by FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were harvested with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.5% v/v Igepal CA-630. Whole cell lysates were incubated with specific antibody or normal mouse IgG. Immunocomplex was pulled down by incubating the samples with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing the agarose beads three times, the immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot. The antibodies for Western blot analysis were anti-myogenin (1:500), Epc1 (1:200), actin (1:2000), and tubulin (1:1000). Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescent Immunocytochemistry—To examine the tissue distribution of Epc1 in the mouse embryo, immunohistochemistry was performed. Mouse embryos were obtained from pregnant mice at 13.5, 15.5, and 17.5 days post-coitum. Sagittal sections were obtained and utilized for immunohistochemistry as described (12Kee H.J. Sohn I.S. Nam K.I. Park J.E. Qian Y.R. Yin Z. Ahn Y. Jeong M.H. Bang Y.J. Kim N. Kim J.K. Kim K.K. Epstein J.A. Kook H. Circulation. 2006; 113: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the α-Epc1 antibody, an excess amount of blocking peptide that had been used to raise the antibody was simultaneously incubated with α-Epc1 antibody. Protocol for fluorescent immunocytochemistry was described previously (6Kook H. Lepore J.J. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Wing-Man Yung W. Mackay J. Zhou R. Ferrari V. Gruber P. Epstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—Northern blot analysis was performed using a specific probe spanning 432 bp in EPC A region (13Kee H.J. Ahn K.Y. Choi K.C. Won Song J. Heo T. Jung S. Kim J.K. Bae C.S. Kim K.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA from embryonic mouse heart and differentiated H9c2 cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to reverse transcription reaction followed by semi-quantitative PCR amplification. The amplified DNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing after cloning into pCR2.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for RT-PCRs can be provided upon request. In Vivo Wound Healing Assay—Seven- or 8-week-old wild type or Hop knock-out mice were utilized for in vivo wound healing assay as described previously (14Takahashi T. Ishida K. Itoh K. Konishi Y. Yagyu K.-I. Tominaga A. Miyazaki J.-I. Yamamoto H. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under anesthesia, right hamstring muscles were cut transversely using a 15 scalpel and then sutured with a modified Kessler stitch using nylon 7-0 wires. After 1 or 3 weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and the muscles were isolated. The transverse sections at suture sites were obtained and utilized for hematoxylin and eosin staining or desmin immunohistochemistry. Identification of Hop-interacting Partners—We postulated that Hop might be involved in muscle differentiation by interacting with other transcription regulators. By utilizing a yeast two-hybrid technique, we screened adult human heart cDNA library with a bait of full-length human HOP. From this screen we identified 300 clones that were His- and β-galactosidase-positive. Among them ∼100 clones were sequenced and blasted to the public data base. Six positive clones were proven to encode sequences of the amino-terminal part of Epc1. Enhancer of polycomb is highly conserved and is known to have several subtypes by gene duplication or alternative splice in mice as follows: Epc1L, Epc1S, Epc2L, and Epc2S (5Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A.R. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our yeast two-hybrid screening experiments, Epc1L was detected. To confirm the interaction further, in vivo interaction assay in yeast was performed with pGBKT7-HOP and pACT2-Epc1. HOP did show a strong association with Epc1, although it had no apparent interaction with an empty pACT2 vector (Fig. 1A). To test if the interaction takes place in mammalian cells, we performed immunoprecipitation and found that Hop successfully recruited Epc1 (Fig. 1B). We next tried to see the subcellular localization of Epc1 in relation to that of Hop by immunofluorescent staining. After transient transfection of both pCMV-myc-Epc1 and pcDNA3.1-HOP-V5/His, COS7 cells were stained with anti-Epc1 polyclonal and anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, the majority of Epc1 (Fig. 1C, panel a) and Hop (Fig. 1C, panel b) was co-localized in the nucleus of COS7 cells, as demarcated by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleus staining (Fig. 1C, panel c). The merged image is shown in Fig. 1C, panel d. Identification of Hop-interacting Domain of Epc1 by Deletion Mapping—Epc1 has four distinct structures named EPcA, EPcB, EpcC, and a Qx domain; all of them are conserved in many species, including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, mouse, and human (15Stankunas K. Berger J. Ruse C. Sinclair D.A.R. Randazzo F. Brock H.W. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the interacting domains, pACT2 vector versions of the truncated human Epc1 (Fig. 2A) were used for yeast one-to-one match experiments. Strong interaction was detected in the EPC A region. In contrast, the EPC B, EPC CQ, and EPC CQCT regions showed no activity or very weak interacting activity (Fig. 2B). Each experiment was done by using four independent colonies, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2C. Hop-interacting domain of Epc1 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. FLAG-tagged full or truncated human EPC1 plasmids were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-human HOP-V5/His to 293T cells. The upper panel of Fig. 2D shows the expression of each truncated mutant of Epc1 with diverse molecular weights, and the middle panel shows the constant expression of V5-tagged HOP in each experimental condition. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, HOP was detected with anti-V5 antibody. HOP was pulled down by EPC full or EPC A, confirming that EPC A is responsible for the interaction with HOP (Fig. 2D). We next investigated whether the lack of interactions of truncated mutants was caused by loss of nuclear localization. Epc1 fragments as well as full clone were transfected into HeLa cells and stained with α-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2E). EPC A (Fig. 2E, panel b) and EPCB(panel c) were still localized in the nucleus as was EPC full (panel a), but EPCs, which have carboxylterminal regions only, were seen in the cytoplasm (panels d and e), suggesting that alteration in the structure and thereby failure of nuclear localization might be one of the causes of losing the interaction with Hop in the mammalian cells. Expression Patterns of Epc1—The tissue distribution of Epc1 was examined. Northern blot analysis for Epc1 showed expression of the 4-kb transcript. Although it was expressed ubiquitously, Epc1 was abundant in heart and skeletal muscles (data not shown). In Western analysis with mouse adult tissue blot, 90-kDa bands were detected (Fig. 3A, upper panel), which was confirmed by the presence of the same size band in pCMV-myc-Epc1-transfected 293T cells (rightmost lane). Those bands completely disappeared when the antibody was premixed with blocking peptide at excess amounts. Muscle tissues such as skeletal or ventricular muscles were strongly positive for Epc1 expression. We further investigated the time course of Epc1 expression at the ages ranging from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal week 8. Northern blot analysis showed that Epc1 expression in the heart is gradually decreased with aging (Fig. 3B). The changes in the Epc1 expression as well as cardiac specific genes were further examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and the typical gel pictures are shown in Fig. 3C. As expected, α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), one of the cytoskeletal proteins in the differentiated cardiomyocytes, was turned on in late embryonic stage and after birth, whereas β-MHC, a fetal cardiac protein, was expressed only in the embryonic period and in postnatal day 1, as suggested in previous reports (16Davis F.J. Pillai J.B. Gupta M. Gupta M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1477-H1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Northern blot, Epc1 transcript amount was abundant in early embryonic heart and gradually decreased after birth. The expression patterns of Epc1 in embryonic tissue were further investigated by immunohistochemistry with E13.5 to E17.5 embryo sections. Strong positive immunoreactivity was detected in E13.5 heart (Fig. 3D, panel a), which disappeared completely by premixing the excess blocking peptides (Fig. 3D, panel b). However, Epc1 expression in the heart (arrow in Fig. 3D, panel c, at E13.5) was gradually decreased by aging (Fig. 3D, panel d, E15.5, and Fig. 3D, panel e, E17.5 day). Interestingly, skeletal muscles such as tongue were gradually increased by aging (arrow in Fig. 3D, panel e), suggesting the differences in the expression patterns in both types of sarcomeric muscles. Epc1 was also well expressed in the endothelium, spinal ganglia, and cartilage. Although choroidal plexus and meninges were positive, brain parenchymal structures did not show any significant immunoreactivities. Changes of Epc1 Expression in Differentiating H9c2, a Myoblast Cell Line—Changes in expression patterns of Epc1 in skeletal and cardiac muscle led us to speculate that Epc1 is involved in the process of muscle differentiation. H9c2, a cardiomyoblast cell line originated from rats, is widely employed for the in vitro model of muscle differentiation (17Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Differentiating H9c2 cells could have either cardiac or skeletal phenotypes, depending on the presence of retinoic acid in differentiation media (18Menard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29063-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our experimental model, serum starvation with 1% FBS induced elongation of H9c2 cells and multinucleation. Typical serial changes in morphology are shown in Fig. 4A, which is accompanied by induction of myogenin (Fig. 4C). In our model, H9c2 seemed to undergo phenotype switch from cardiac to skeletal muscles during differentiation; the expression of cardiac type of voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC)α1 was decreased by differentiation, whereas those of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) and skeletal type of VDCCα1 were gradually up-regulated by differentiation (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, Epc1 was transiently up-regulated in the early phase of differentiation, whereas Hop was not changed (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that Epc1 plays an important role in the initiation of H9c2 differentiation. To delineate the role of Epc1 in the differentiation, we generated the Epc1-knockdown cell lines with antisense strategy as well as the stable cell lines overexpressing Epc1 (Fig. 5A) and induced the differentiation by serum starvation. As evidenced in Fig. 4A in which H9c2 differentiation is markedly impaired in knockdown cell lines, the increases in differentiation markers such as MCK and skeletal VDCCα1 were significantly reduced (Fig. 5C). In Epc1-overexpressing cell lines, however, induction of those markers was greatly enhanced (Fig. 5D). Skeletal muscle fate determination/differentiation processes are governed by several distinct transcription factors such as MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and Myf6/Mrf4 (19Buckingham M. Bajard L. Chang T. Daubas P. Hadchouel J. Meilhac S. Montarras D. Rocancourt D. Relaix F. J. Anat. 2003; 202: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether H9c2 cells elicit the skeletal muscle phenotype during its differentiation process, we tried to examine the expression of those four myogenic transcription factors. Myf5 and Myf6/Mrf4 were increased in the late phase of H9c2 differentiation, whereas MyoD was transiently up-regulated in the early phase of differentiation (Fig. 5B). Myogenin, a key step regulator of differentiation of skeletal muscle (20Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26245-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was abruptly increased in the beginning of the serum starvation. Strikingly, all of those changes in expression levels were significantly blunted or deranged in Epc1-knockdown cells (Fig. 5C), although they were enhanced in Epc1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5D). Forced Expression of Hop and Epc1 Induces H9c2 Differentiation—The roles of Epc1 and Hop in the differentiation of H9c2 cells were further investigated by transient transfection, followed by the evaluation of cell morphology (Fig. 6A) or myogenin expression (Fig. 6B). Hop itself did not induce significant changes in the cell morphology (Fig. 6A, panel b), compared with mock-transfected H9c2 cells (Fig. 6A, panel a). Epc1 transfection, however, caused the cells to be thinned or elongated and often fused to form multinucleated syncytia appearing like myotubes (Fig. 6A, panel c). The changes of the cell shapes became more prominent by co-transfection of Epc1 and Hop (Fig. 6A, panel d). The number of myogenin-positive nuclei as well as the expression level were increased in Epc1-transfected H9c2 cells (Fig. 6B, panel g) compared with mock- (Fig. 6B, panel e) or Hop-transfected cells (Fig. 6B, panel f). The myogenin staining was much stronger in Hop/Epc1-co-transfected H9c2 cells (Fig. 6, panel h). The expression of myogenin was quantified by Western blot analysis after transfection of Epc1 or Hop. Myogenin expression was increased when Epc1 or Epc1 + Hop was transfected to H9c2 cells (Fig. 6C). The transcript level of myogenin was also increased by Epc1 or Hop + Epc1 transfection (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, skeletal VDCCα1 was significantly increased by the co-transfection of Hop and Epc1 (Fig. 6D). On the contrary, the absence of Epc1 reduced myogenin and skeletal VDCCα1, and Hop did not affect the expression (Fig. 6, C and D). We next investigated if Epc1 can activate myogenin promoter. Because the myogenin promoter, which spans from -185 to +48 bp of its transcription initiation site, has been reported to have essential regulatory functions of the gene (7Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we subcloned the minimal promoter region to pGL3 basic vector to drive luciferase activity. By testing the basal promoter activity, 20 ng of myogenin minimal promoter (-185 to +45)-luciferase construct was selected for optimal reporter constructs (data not shown). Epc1 dramatically activated the myogenin minimal promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6E), although Hop did not increase the activity in the range fro"

CAV1 is localized in the plasmalemma, secretory vesicles, Golgi, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum membrane and associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton. Taxanes such as paclitaxel (Taxol) are potent anti-tumor agents that repress the dynamic instability of microtubules and arrest cells in the G2/M phase. Src phosphorylation of Tyr-14 on CAV1 regulates its cellular localization and function. We report that phosphorylation of CAV1 on Tyr-14 regulates paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Befitting its role as a multitasking molecule, we show that CAV1 sensitizes cells to apoptosis by regulating cell cycle progression and activation of the apoptotic signaling molecules BCL2, p53, and p21. We demonstrate that phosphorylated CAV1 triggers apoptosis by inactivating BCL2 and increasing mitochondrial permeability more efficiently than non-phosphorylated CAV1. Furthermore, expression of p21, which correlates with taxane sensitivity, is regulated by CAV1 phosphorylation in a p53-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings underscore the importance of CAV1 phosphorylation in apoptosis and suggest that events that negate CAV1 tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to anti-microtubule drug resistance.

Caveolin-1 (CAV1) 2The abbreviations used are: CAV1, caveolin-1; EV, empty vector; IMEM, improved minimal essential medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; wt, wild-type; ANOVA, analysis of variance; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is a 21-24-kDa protein and the prototype of a family of integral membrane proteins that associate with specific cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich domains to form the structural foundation of membrane invaginations called caveolae. Caveolae act as sites of signal transduction in various cell types (1Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). CAV1 is thought to regulate the activity of proteins such as Src kinases, epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase, Her2/neu (ErbB2) kinase, ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), H-Ras, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and G proteins (1Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) involved in survival pathways. In human breast tumors, CAV1 levels inversely correlate with tumor size (3Sagara Y. Mimori K. Yoshinaga K. Tanaka F. Nishida K. Ohno S. Inoue H. Mori M. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and CAV1 expression reduces the growth of mouse mammary tumors and their spontaneous metastasis to lung and bone (4Sloan E.K. Stanley K.L. Anderson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7893-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, in breast cancer cell culture models, CAV1 is down-regulated in non-invasive human breast cancer cells but upregulated in cells with an invasive phenotype (5Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 6Zajchowski D.A. Bartholdi M.F. Gong Y. Webster L. Liu H.L. Munishkin A. Beauheim C. Harvey S.

Taxanes are potent anti-tumor agents that function by binding to the β subunits of tubulin and repressing the dynamic instability of spindles (8Manfredi J.J. Horwitz S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1984; 25: 83-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 9Yvon A.M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), activities that lead to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase (10Dumontet C. Sikic B. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taxanes such as paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere) are routinely used in the first-line treatment of metastatic breast, lung, ovarian, and digestive cancers (11Gligorov J. Lotz J.P. Oncologist. 2004; 9: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In primary breast cancer, inclusion of taxane in adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the relative risk of recurrence and improves overall survival (12Clavarezza M. Del Mastro L. Venturini M. Ann Oncol. 2006; 17 (Suppl. 7): vii22-vii26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Acquired resistance through cellular adaptations or mutations in neoplastic cells remains a major problem in chemotherapy. Although taxanes are substrates for ABC transporters, other resistance mechanisms are clearly important (13Trock B.J. Leonessa F. Clarke R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 917-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of drug responsiveness and to identify better predictors of drug efficacy. CAV1 is essential for the formation and movement of caveolae through the cytoplasm along microtubule tracks, and it is localized in the microtubule-organizing center or peri-centrosomal region in Chinese hamster ovary cells (14Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an essential relationship between CAV1 and microtubules or microtubule-associated proteins and their function. Treatment with a cytostatic dose of paclitaxel blocks lung cancer cells in G2/M and causes an up-regulation of CAV1, implicating CAV1 in taxane-mediated cell death and perhaps drug resistance (15Roussel E. Belanger M.M. Couet J. Anticancer Drugs. 2004; 15: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Yang C.P. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Horwitz S.B. Lisanti M.P.

However, the role of CAV1 function in cell death remains unclear. In macrophages, induction of apoptosis by different apoptotic agents such as simvastatin and camptothecin leads to a large increase in CAV1 expression. As an early event, this increase in CAV1 is independent of caspase activation or DNA fragmentation but is associated with the plasma membrane translocation of phosphatidylserine (19Gargalovic P. Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1622-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Originally identified as a substrate for v-Src (20Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), CAV1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-14 by c-Src (21Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that phosphorylated CAV1 regulates caveolae formation and function (21Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R.

Endocrinol. 2005; 245: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The precise role of Src kinase in taxane-mediated cytotoxicity is unclear. Src can increase Taxotere sensitivity by mediating downstream apoptotic events through BCL2 phosphorylation in v-Src-transformed human gall bladder epithelial cells (26Boudny V. Nakano S. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in human ovarian cancer cells, an inhibition of Src activity increases paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity (27Chen T. Pengetnze Y. Taylor C.C. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise role of CAV1, and particularly that of phospho-CAV1(Y14), in affecting breast cancer cell responsiveness to taxanes is unknown. The current study was undertaken to determine whether CAV1 is involved in the cytotoxic and proapoptotic actions of paclitaxel in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. We overexpressed wild type (wt), a phosphorylation-defective CAV1 mutant (Y14F), or empty vector (EV) in MCF-7 cells that normally express low levels of endogenous CAV1. The effects of wtCAV1, Y14F, or EV expression on cell growth, apoptosis, and p53/p21 transcription in response to low dose (10 nm) paclitaxel were analyzed. This study provides novel insights into the function of CAV1 in paclitaxel sensitivity and the role of phosphorylation on Tyr-14 in CAV1-mediated effects on mitochondrial permeability and apoptosis. Cell Culture and Reagents—MCF-7 cells (obtained from the LCCC Tissue Culture Shared Resource) were cultured in improved minimal essential medium (IMEM; Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 95% air/5% CO2. Paclitaxel was obtained from Sigma and was dissolved in ethanol (which was used as the vehicle control). PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—MCF-7 cells were grown to 50-60% confluence and transfected with either human wt CAV1 or Tyr-14 → Phe-14 phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Y14F) in pcDNA6 or EV using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences). Medium was replaced 24 h later with complete growth medium, and the cells were allowed to grow for 5 days. Complete growth medium containing blasticidin S HCl (Invitrogen) (10 μg/ml) was used for stable selection. For all experiments, pooled populations of stable cell lines were used. Western Blot Analyses—To determine the effects of paclitaxel on CAV1 protein expression, cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nm paclitaxel in FBS-IMEM for 24 h. Controls were treated with vehicle alone (0.02% v/v ethanol). For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate phosphatase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Total protein was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Whole cell lysate (20-50 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: monoclonal antibody against phospho-CAV1(Y14) and polyclonal antibody against CAV1 (BD Biosciences); monoclonal cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, polyclonal phospho-BCL2(S70), polyclonal p53, polyclonal Src, and phospho-Src(pY418) antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); and monoclonal BCL2 (Stressgen Corp., Ann Arbor, MA); monoclonal β-tubulin (Sigma); monoclonal p21 (Calbiochem). Equal protein loading of gels was confirmed by immunostaining with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at least 3 h in serum-free and phenol red-free medium. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibody. Fluorophore conjugates and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Where appropriate, DAPI was added to visualize the nucleus, and non-confocal DAPI images were acquired using Hg lamp excitation and a UV filter set. Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX-70 confocal microscope with 405-, 488-, and 543-nm excitation lasers. Fluorescence emission was separately detected for each fluorophore in optical sections <1 μm in thickness (pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit). Transcriptional Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of p53 (Panomics, Fremont, CA) and p21 luciferase reporter plasmid (a gift from Dr. Jane Trepel, National Institutes of Health) and 0.1 μg of pCMV-Renilla (Promega, Madison, WI) per well using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. The next day, cells were treated with 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. Activation of the luciferase constructs was measured using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luminescence. Three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. for all experiments. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells were seeded at a density of 1-2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. For Src inactivation, cells were incubated with 10 μm PP2 for 2-3 h before adding paclitaxel. For small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock down of CAV1, cells were transiently transfected with CAV1 siRNA for 48 h before adding paclitaxel. To assess paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition, cells were treated with 10 nm paclitaxel (in FBS-IMEM) for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted using a Z1 Single Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). At least three independent experiments were done in sextuplicate. Data were normalized to vehicle-treated cells and are presented as the mean ± S.E. from a representative experiment. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assays—Following treatment of cells with 10 nm paclitaxel in FBS-IMEM for 24 h, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell cycle distribution was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Shared Resource facility. Annexin V and propidium iodide staining was done using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Mitochondrial permeability was detected using the ApoAlert mitochondrial membrane sensor kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Primer for CAV1 (Hs00971716_m1) and the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLPO) (Hs99999902_m1) was purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). MCF-7 cells were allowed to grow to 60-70% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks and were then treated with either different concentrations of paclitaxel (0, 10, 100 nm) for 24 h or 10 nm paclitaxel for 0, 24, and 48 h. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), cleaned using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and analyzed by the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Santa Clara, CA). About 1 μg of DNase I (Invitrogen)-treated RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using Oligo(dT)16 (Applied Biosystems). Real-time absolute quantitative PCR for each cDNA sample and a standard curve were established using TaqMan PCR mastermix in the presence of CAV1 primer or the internal control RPLP0 primer. Reactions (10 μl) were run in triplicate in 384-well plates on an ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The ratio of CAV1 induction was estimated in comparison with RPLPO expression; data presented are the mean ± S.E. Transfection of siRNA—Cells were plated in 12- or 24-well plates in complete medium and allowed to grow to 50% confluence. Approximately, 100 nm p21 siRNA, p53 siRNA (Cell Signaling), CAV1 siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), or their respective control siRNA were transfected using the TransIT-siQUEST (Mirus, Madison, WI) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h, 10 nm paclitaxel or vehicle was added to the siRNA-transfected cells. Cells were lysed at 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis or cell proliferation assay as described above. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using the Sigmastat software package (Jandel Scientific, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Where appropriate, protein expression, cell growth, and apoptosis were compared using Student’s t test or ANOVA with a post hoc t test for multiple comparisons. Where several groups were compared with the same control, we used Dunnett’s test. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05; all tests were two-tailed. Exposure to Taxane Increased CAV1 Expression in MCF-7 Cells—CAV1 expression is very low but remains detectable in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. To evaluate the effect of paclitaxel on CAV1 expression, MCF-7 cells were grown to 50-70% confluence and treated with 10 nm paclitaxel for 0, 24, or 48 h or with vehicle alone, 10 nm, or 100 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. Real-time PCR showed a significant increase in CAV1 expression in MCF-7 cells within 24 or 48 h following paclitaxel treatment compared with control (untreated) (Fig. 1A, p ≤ 0.004, one-way ANOVA). Western blot analysis showed a corresponding increase in CAV1 protein within 24 or 48 h (Fig. 1B). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 and 100 nm for 24 h showed a significant increase in both CAV1 transcription (Fig. 1C, p ≤ 0.001, one-way ANOVA) and protein expression (Fig. 1D) compared with controls (vehicle). Thus, in MCF-7 cells, a significant induction of CAV1 occurs within 24 h following treatment with 10 nm paclitaxel. The induction of CAV1 following paclitaxel treatment suggests a role for CAV1 in drug responsiveness. Moreover, attenuating levels of endogenous CAV1 in MCF-7 cells with siRNA correlates with reduction in paclitaxel-induced inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2CAV1 is required for paclitaxel-induced cell growth inhibition. A, paclitaxel-induced up-regulation of CAV1 expression was inhibited with siRNA in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were transfected with either control or CAV1 siRNA for 48 h. Next, paclitaxel was added to the transfection medium to attain a final concentration of 10 nm; cells were incubated with paclitaxel for 24 h before Western blot analysis or cell proliferation assay. B, attenuation of CAV1 expression in MCF-7 cells correlated with reduction in paclitaxel-induced inhibition of cell growth. *, p < 0.05 versus control siRNA with vehicle alone. C, incubation of MCF-7 cells with 10 μm PP2 inhibited Src activation as detected by Western blot analysis of phosphor-Src(Y418). Although the level of CAV1 protein expression increased following treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 nm paclitaxel, phospho-CAV1(Y14) was undetectable using our Western blot analysis protocol (for up to 50 μg of protein loading/gel). Incubation of MCF-7 cells with 10 μm PP2 in addition to 10 nm paclitaxel significantly reduced cell growth inhibition effect of paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone (panel D, p ≤ 0.05). *, p < 0.05 versus MCF-7 with paclitaxel alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of CAV1 on Tyr-14 by Src is known to regulate CAV1 functions (21Lee H.

However, incubation of MCF-7 cells with 10 μm PP2 in addition to 10 nm paclitaxel significantly reduces the cell growth inhibition effect of paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone (Fig. 2D, p ≤ 0.05). wtCAV1 Expression Enhanced Paclitaxel-induced Growth Inhibition and Cell Cycle Arrest at G2/M—To establish the functional relevance of CAV1 in paclitaxel sensitivity, we generated MCF-7 cell lines that stably express either the full-length wild-type CAV1 (MCF-7/wtCAV1), Tyr-14 → Phe phosphorylation-deficient (MCF-7/Y14F) cells, or empty vector (MCF-7/EV) (Fig. 3A). Expression levels of CAV1 in MCF-7/wtCAV1 and MCF-7/Y14F were measured by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies for CAV1 or p-CAV1. CAV1α contains residues 1-178, whereas CAV1β contains residues 32-178. Because Tyr-14 is the principal substrate for Src kinase, only CAV1α undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation (28Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). CAV1 is thought to interact with Src and inhibit its activation (2Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Although not fully inactive, Src kinase activity is decreased in untreated MCF-7/wtCAV1 cells compared with MCF-7/EV and MCF-7/Y14F cells (Fig. 3A). Expression of CAV1 in MCF-7 cells can reduce the rate of proliferation (29Fiucci G. Ravid D. Reich R. Liscovitch M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Comparison of growth curves in basal medium shows a significant decrease in the rate of cell proliferation for MCF-7/wtCAV1 cells (p ≤ 0.05) at day 4 through day 6 compared with that for MCF-7/EV cells. In contrast, the difference in rates of proliferation between MCF-7/EV and MCF-7/Y14F cells is not significant (Fig. 3B). Cells were treated with paclitaxel to determine whether CAV1 tyrosine phosphorylation affects growth inhibition by the drug. MCF-7 cells expressing wtCAV1 are more sensitive than cells expressing either EV or Y14F (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that CAV1 phosphorylation on Tyr-14 plays a key role in paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, the effects of CAV1 on paclitaxel sensitivity are not simply a consequence of changes in the rate of proliferation; cells that have a higher rate of proliferation are generally more sensitive to cell cycle-specific cytotoxic drugs like taxanes (30Matsuoka H. Furusawa M. Tomoda H. Seo Y. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 163-167PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we did not see any difference in the partitioning of caveolar and intercellular compartments following subcellular fractionation (data not shown) between wtCAV1 or the Y14F mutant-expressing cell under control conditions or following paclitaxel treatment for 24 h. Thus, in terms of paclitaxel sensitivity, caveolar localization is unlikely to account for any differences between MCF-7 cells expressing wtCAV1 and Y14F. Taxanes stabilize microtubules and block sensitive cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase (31Schiff P.B. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). To determine whether CAV1 expression alters G2/M cell cycle arrest following treatment with paclitaxel, MCF7-EV, MCF7-wtCAV1, or MCF-7/Y14F cells were treated with either vehicle alone or 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of cell cycle distribution (Fig. 4A). MCF-7/Y14F cells exhibited a significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in the proportion of cells in the S-phase relative to MCF-7/EV. Following treatment with 10 nm paclitaxel, the percentage of cells arrested in the G2/M phase was significantly higher in MCF7-wtCAV1 compared with MCF-7/EV (p ≤ 0.05). In MCF-7/Y14F cells, the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase was comparable with that in MCF-7/EV cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, the taxane-induced decrease in cell proliferation in MCF7-wtCAV1 cells is likely to be a consequence of increased cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. To assess cellular morphology in vehicle (control) or drug-treated cells, MCF-7/EV, MCF-7/wtCAV1, and MCF-7/Y14F cells were treated with either vehicle or 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. Cells were fixed and permeabilized and co-stained for both β-tubulin and CAV1. In all three cell lines, vehicle-treated cells displayed an organized tubulin network that excludes the nucleus and extends throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). After 24 h of paclitaxel treatment, microtubule disruption was more distinct in MCF-7 cells expressing wtCAV1 compared with MCF-7 cells expressing EV or Y14F, as evident from clusters of microtubules or asters in the respective cells (Fig. 4D). Increased Apoptosis in MCF-7/wtCAV1-expressing Cells in Response to Paclitaxel—Paclitaxel can induce apoptosis in some breast epithelial cells (32Yeung T.K. Germond C. Chen X. Wang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commu. 1999; 263: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether CAV1 expression affects apoptosis, we treated MCF-7/EV, MCF-7/wtCAV1, and MCF-7/Y14F cells with 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after staining for fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and for propidium iodide. At 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h, only 1% of the MCF-7/EV or MCF-7/Y14F cells underwent apoptosis compared with 3% in MCF-7/wtCAV1 cells (Fig. 5A, p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, cells were analyzed for apoptosis by Western blot analysis of anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage to a 85-89-kDa fragment (Fig. 5B). Paclitaxel-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage appeared in MCF-7/wtCAV1 within 24 h following drug treatment and was more pronounced at 48 h relative to MCF-7/EV or MCF-7/Y14F cells. Although the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody (according to the manufacturer) should detect only a single band for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, we detected a nonspecific higher molecular band at ∼100-110 kDa that did not accurately reflect levels of full-length poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in our experiments. These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of CAV1 accelerates apoptosis in response to paclitaxel treatment and/or could be essential to signaling pathway(s) that are required for the induction of apoptosis. Microtubule disruption following treatment with taxanes increases phosphorylation of BCL2(S70) in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, abrogating the normal anti-apoptotic function of BCL2 and initiating an apoptotic program in cycling cancer cells (33Haldar S. Basu A. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 229-233PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of BCL2 phosphorylation correlates with the degree of apoptosis, Western blot analyses were done with whole cell lysate cells following treatment with vehicle or 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 or 48 h. At 24 h, we detected a significant increase in the level of BCL2(S70) phosphorylation in MCF-7/wtCAV1 cells in comparison with MCF-7/EV cells (p ≤ 0.05). In cells expressing Y14FCAV1, the level of BCL2(S70) phosphorylation remains comparable with cells expressing EV (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, measurement of mitochondrial permeability, which is tightly associated with the release"

Its activity is thought to be rate-limiting. Two xylosyltransferases have been found using genomic analyses, and one of these, XylT1, has been shown to have xylosyltransferase activity. On the other hand, the less studied XylT2 in recombinant form lacks xylosyltransferase activity and has no known function. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells express abundant Xylt2 mRNA levels and lack detectable Xylt1 mRNA levels. Analysis of a previously described Chinese hamster ovary cell xylosyltransferase mutant (psgA-745) shows that it harbors an Xylt2 nonsense mutation and fails to assemble glycosaminoglycans onto recombinant biglycan. Transfection of this cell line with a murine Xylt2 minigene results in the production of recombinant chondroitin sulfate-modified biglycan core protein and restoration of fibroblast growth factor binding to cell surface-associated heparan sulfate. Expression analyses on 10 different human transformed cell lines detect exclusive XYLT2 expression in two and co-expression of XYLT1 and XYLT2 in the others but at disparate ratios where XYLT2 expression is greater than XYLT1 in most cell lines. These results indicate that XylT2 has a significant role in proteoglycan biosynthesis and that cell type may control which family member is utilized.

It catalyzes the initial enzymatic reaction in the assembly of glycosaminoglycans to core proteins.

PGs are found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. PGs are fundamental to cellular processes including enhancement of receptor binding of cytokines and growth factors and augmentation of enzyme-substrate interactions important in coagulation and lipid catabolism (4Esko J.D.

Genomic analyses have identified two xylosyltransferase family members in mammals. XYLT1 encodes for xylosyltransferase I (XylT1), shown to have xylosyltransferase activity (13Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). XYLT2 encodes for xylosyltransferase II (XylT2), which when expressed in vitro failed to have xylosyltransferase activity (13Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol.

Glycoconj J. 2006; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and therefore, its function is unknown. A highly useful tool for the study of PGs has been the xylosyltransferase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) line pgsA-745 (15Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This cell line was isolated from an ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis screen of CHO-K1 cells for sulfation incorporation mutants. This cell line produces neither chondroitin nor heparan-sulfated PGs (15Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 16Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our long term investigation of this enzymatic pathway and the function of XylT2, we found that wild-type CHO cells express abundant levels of Xylt2 mRNA and near undetectable levels of Xylt1 mRNA. Furthermore, we discovered that the pgsA-745 cell line harbors an inactivating genetic defect in Xylt2 and that overexpression of Xylt2 in these cells complements their inability to add chondroitin sulfate to a glycosaminoglycan-free biglycan core protein and to bind basic fibroblast growth factor to surface associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNorthern Blot, RT-PCR, and Real-time RT-PCR—Poly(A) RNA was isolated as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen MicroFast Track). Northern blot filters were generated as described previously (17Hinsdale M.E. Kelly C.L. Wood P.A. Genomics. 1993; 16: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using 2 μg of poly(A) RNA. For human cell line analysis, a human cancer cell line poly(A) RNA Northern filter was used (Stratagene). Complementary mouse DNA probe templates were 1.5 kb for Xylt2 (according to nucleotides 753–2256 of GenBank™ accession number NM_145828) and 0.5 kb for Xylt1 (nucleotides 2584–3102 according to GenBank accession number NM_175645), both encoding the final coding sequence of the cDNA sequence including the stop codon at the 3′ end. The mouse Xylt1 probe template showed 91% homology with the hamster cDNA sequence. Human cDNA probe template for XYLT1 (nucleotides 2455–3009 according to GenBank accession number NM_022166) was a fragment that spanned the last 555 bp of the coding sequence of the cDNA. The human cDNA probe template for XYLT2 was a 2.4-kb fragment (nucleotides 98–2770 according to GenBank accession number XM_037916). A mouse Extl2 cDNA fragment was used as probe template (nucleotides 82–1298 according to GenBank accession number AF200973). A mouse β4GalT7 cDNA fragment was also used for probe template (nucleotides 5–1195 according to GenBank accession number BC027195). For RT-PCR, 5.0 μg of total RNA isolated from CHO-K1 (ATCC number CCL-61), psgA-745 CHO cells (ATCC number CRL-2242), and hamster kidney (Invitrogen TRIzol reagent) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified using hamster-specific primers to exons 11 and 12 for Xylt1 and exons 2 and 5 for Gapdh. Conditions were 94 °C for 1 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C 20 s, 63.6 °C 30 s, 72 °C 30 s followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Products were resolved on an 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) for Southern blot analyses using a hamster-specific Xylt1 cDNA fragment that spans exons 11 and 12. For real-time RT-PCR, first strand biosynthesis with reverse transcription was performed using 2.5–5.0 μg of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using standard techniques (SYBR Green PCR, Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate with gene-specific primers (see supplemental Table 1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers on the same 96-well plate. The GAPDH product values were used for normalization. In addition, to ensure reproducibility of the reactions, a standard curve was performed with both gene-specific primers and GAPDH primers using control human kidney total RNA reverse transcription product.Cloning the CHO Cell Xylt2 Locus—Long range PCR (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s recommended conditions was performed on genomic DNA from wild-type CHO cell line CHO-K1 (ATCC number CCL-61) and xylosyltransferase-deficient CHO cell psgA-745 (ATCC number CRL-2242) grown under recommended conditions. Primer sequences were designed based on human-mouse homologous sequence (see supplemental Table 1). Five overlapping genomic fragments spanning 13 kb in length were generated that included the sequence down to the provisional poly(A) addition site as identified by comparison with mouse cDNA sequence (according to GenBank accession number NM_145828). Some products were cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced, and others sequenced directly as PCR product. Both wild-type and mutant locus sequences have been deposited in the GenBank data base under GenBank accession numbers (EF051485 and EF051486, respectively).Production of Cell Lines—The coding portion of the Bgn cDNA, encoding mouse biglycan, was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) that contains a neomycin-selectable marker. A protein tag HPC4 (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was engineered into the C terminus of the recombinant biglycan. This created the BigHPC4 expression construct. An Xylt2 minigene containing the coding portion of exon 1 spliced to the remaining portion of the locus spanning exon 2 to the translational stop codon in exon 11 was cloned into the expression vector pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen) with the Zeocin cassette replaced with puromycin- and neomycin-selectable cassettes to create the expression vector XYIISCI-44. This put the Xylt2 minigene under the control of the EF-1α promoter. The parental cell line psgA-745 was purchased from ATCC. The psgA-745 CHO cells were grown as recommended and transfected with BigHPC4 using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) to create reporter cell lines. Cells were selected using medium with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Colonies were picked and transferred to 96-well plates, and conditioned media were analyzed by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody to HPC4 (a gift from Dr. Charles Esmon, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several clones had high expression levels of glycosaminoglycan-free mouse biglycan. One clone named A10 was transfected with XYIISCI-44 using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) followed by 400 μg/ml G418 and 0.02 mg/ml puromycin selection. Colonies were picked to 96-well plates, and conditioned media were analyzed by Western blot using a HPC4 monoclonal antibody as described above.Western Blot Analyses—Conditioned media from individual clones were denatured, reduced, and separated on 4–15% gradient acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using semidry transfer (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm CaCl. The primary antibody, a mouse monoclonal to the HPC4 epitope tag (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used at 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h. Blots were washed again and incubated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to film. For chondroitinase ABC digestion, 10 μl of conditioned medium was incubated 12 h at 37 °C with 0.02 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.03 m sodium acetate buffer in a total volume of 20 μl.Sequence Analysis—On at least three independent products generated by long range PCR as described above, sequence was obtained on an Applied Biosystems 3730 capillary sequencer using the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq polymerase- and locus-specific primers. For each independent product, a consensus was generated from at least two overlapping sequence sets. A final master consensus was generated from the compilation of the independent product consensuses. Ambiguous areas were regenerated with low error pfu Turbo Taq (Strategene) DNA polymerase and reanalyzed. All sequence analyses were performed with standard software.Flow Cytometry Analyses with FGF-2—This assay was performed as described previously (19Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Biotinylated fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) was graciously provided by Dr. Jeff Esko of the University of California at San Diego. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, the cells were incubated with 50 milliunits/ml heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8) in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C prior to staining with FGF-2.Immunocytochemistry for Heparan Sulfate in CHO Cells—Wild-type CHO-K1, clone 3, and psgA-745-expressing biglycan (parental clone) cells were applied to slides by cytospin. Slides were fixed 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and rinsed in heparitinase digestion buffer followed by digestion with heparitinase I (Seikagaku, 100703) in the same buffer. After several rinses in PBS and saponin, a 5-min incubation in hydrogen peroxide in methanol, and rinsing again in PBS and saponin, the slides were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% saponin, and PBS followed by incubation with 10E4 (Seikagaku, 370255) at 1:50. After three washes in PBS with saponin, the slides were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG/IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by NovaRED (Vector Laboratories) incubation, counterstaining, dehydration, and coverslip mounting.RESULTSWild-type CHO Cells Express Abundant Xylt2, and Mutant psgA-745 Cells Lack Detectable Levels of Xylt2 and Xylt1 mRNA—To identify the candidate protein responsible for the xylosyltransferase deficiency in the psgA-745 cells, the expression levels of Xylt1 and Xylt2 in both wild-type cell line CHO-K1 and psgA-745 mutant cell lines were determined. In addition, since little is known about the regulation of the PG biosynthetic pathway, it was of interest to determine the impact of xylosyltransferase deficiency on the expression of downstream enzymes in this pathway. Consequently, the mRNA level for β4Galt7 was measured. For controls, Extl2 and Gapdh expression was measured. The Extl2 protein product can catalyze the fifth biosynthetic step of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan assembly onto core proteins.Although XylT1 has been shown to be a xylosyltransferase capable of initiating glycosaminoglycan assembly onto PG core proteins, we did not detect Xylt1 mRNA levels in the wild-type CHO cells by poly(A) Northern blot analyses using a mouse probe that we have determined to be 91% homologous with the hamster cDNA (Fig. 1A). To confirm this result, we performed RT-PCR with hamster-specific primers and generated a faint product similar in size to the Xylt1 RT-PCR product from hamster kidney (Fig. 1C), but this product was nonspecific as determined by Southern blot analysis and sequence analysis. An additional primer set that spanned from exon 10 to 11 also failed to detect any Xylt1 mRNA in the wild-type CHO cells. On the other hand, the wild-type cells expressed abundant levels of Xylt2 mRNA (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the mutant psgA-745 did not express either (Fig. 1, A–C). In both cell lines, steady state levels of β4Galt7 and Extl2 mRNA were similar (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that XylT2 is a potential candidate for PG biosynthesis in wild-type CHO cells and that the psgA-745 CHO cell mutants are xylosyltransferase-deficient because of a defect in Xylt2 expression.Identification of Mutation Responsible for Undetectable Xylt2 mRNA Levels in psgA-745 Cells—To determine the reason for the undetectable levels of Xylt2 in the psgA-745 cells, the hamster Xylt2 genomic locus from both the wild-type and the mutant cell lines was cloned and sequenced. Overlapping fragments spanning the start of translation down to the provisional poly(A) addition site in the last exon were generated and sequenced. The total locus spanned 13 kb, containing 11 exons as in human (accession number NT_010783) and mouse (accession number NT_039521). This analysis revealed the locus to have two point mutations consisting of a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (Fig. 1D) and a G to A transition mutation in intron 7 (position 9031 with respect to the ATG of exon 1). The nonsense mutation is predicted to encode a truncated protein of 38 amino acids. However, this premature stop codon likely induces nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation (18Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), explaining the undetectable levels of Xylt2 mRNA in the psgA-745 mutants. Therefore, these results further suggest that XylT2 is responsible for xylosyltransferase activity in the parental wild-type CHO cells and that xylosyltransferase deficiency in the psgA-745 CHO cells results from a translational stop codon in Xylt2.XylT2 Can Restore Chondroitin Sulfate Modification of Biglycan—To determine whether the Xylt2 mutation is responsible for xylosyltransferase deficiency in the psgA-745 CHO cell mutant line, we attempted to complement the deficient cells by overexpression of an Xylt2 minigene. Several xylosyltransferase-deficient reporter CHO cell lines were made by expressing recombinant tagged biglycan in psgA-745 CHO cells. These cell lines produce only unmodified biglycan core protein as expected (Fig. 2A). A representative clone called A10 was transfected with a mouse Xylt2 minigene. Subsequent clones were isolated and analyzed, showing that they now produced glycosaminoglycan-containing biglycan (Fig. 2A) that was sensitive to chondroitinase digestion (Fig. 2B), confirming that XylT2 can restore the chondroitin sulfate modification of a core protein in the xylosyltransferase-deficient pgsA-745 cell line.FIGURE 2Expression of Xylt2 in xylosyltransferase-deficient cell line A10 induces chondroitin sulfate assembly onto biglycan core protein and cell surface heparan sulfate dependent binding of FGF-2. A, Western blot analysis using an HPC4 antibody on conditioned media from A10, the xylosyltransferase-deficient parental (P) cell line stably expressing biglycan. These cells produce biglycan without glycosaminoglycan side chains (Biglycan–). In contrast, representative clones 1 and 2 of parental cell line expressing Xylt2 produce chondroitin sulfate containing biglycan (Biglycan+). B, Western blot analysis using an HPC4 antibody on media from representative clone 3 untreated (lane 1) and treated (lane 2) with chondroitinase ABC (ABCase) as compared with untreated conditioned media from the parental cell line psgA-745 expressing biglycan (lane 3). C, flow cytometry analysis of mutant and Xylt2 transfected mutant cells after staining with biotinylated FGF-2. A representative clone 3 stained with biotinylated FGF (3+) shows bimodal distribution with 34% of the cells showing FGF-2 binding identified as the peak under the bar as compared with the stained parental cell line (P+)(light gray shaded plot) and wild-type CHO-K1 cells (CHO-K1+). The dark gray peak represents the negative control of clone 3 cells not stained with biotinylated FGF (3–) but incubated with streptavidin-conjugated fluorochrome.

This assay has been used by others to assess rescue of the psgA-745 cells transfected with the Caenorhabditis elegans xylosyltransferase sqv-6 (20Hwang H.Y. Olson S.K. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Horvitz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11735-11738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Biotinylated FGF-2 binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and this binding can be measured using flow cytometry. As compared with the parental A10 cell line from Fig. 2, A and B, 34.5% of clone 3 cells transfected with Xylt2 bound FGF-2 (Fig. 2C). Clone 3 cells that bound FGF-2 had a geometric mean of 88.63 as compared with the geometric mean of 6.5 for the parental and 242.4 for the wild-type CHO cells, respectively. These results are similar to the biglycan Western blot analysis where not all the biglycan was converted to the glycosaminoglycan-containing form, suggesting a heterogeneous population of cells despite being maintained on double selection growth conditions. Nevertheless, Xylt2 can restore FGF-2 cell surface binding mediated by heparan sulfate. To confirm that heparan sulfate mediates this binding, we digested the cells with heparitinase prior to staining with FGF-2 and found that with digestion, there is loss of FGF-2 binding (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we also screened the rescued cells with heparan sulfate-specific antibodies and found heparan sulfate on the rescued cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, transfected Xylt2 can restore heparan sulfate biosynthesis in xylosyltransferase-deficient cells.XylT2 Is Expressed in Multiple Cell Types—In humans (13Gotting C. Kuhn J. Zahn R. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), there is a wide tissue distribution of Xylt2 mRNA as opposed to Xylt1 mRNA. This suggests that preferential expression of Xylt2 is not unique to CHO cells. To determine this, we examined Xylt2 mRNA expression in 10 transformed human cell lines using Northern blot analyses and real-time RT-PCR. The Northern blot analyses showed that most cell lines express XYLT2, and fewer express only XYLT1 (Fig. 3). In addition, these analyses illustrate that when either XYLT2 or XYLT1 is expressed, there are single transcripts for each gene, indicating that there are no post-transcriptional modifications such as alternative splicing or alternative use of multiple polyadenylation sites. The real-time RT-PCR analyses likewise showed that all of the cell lines had detectable levels of XYLT2 mRNA (Fig. 4A), and XYLT1 expression when detected was considerably lower than XYLT2 expression in most cell types. Two exceptions are HL-60 and MG-63 cell lines that had a predominance of XYLT1 expression (Fig. 4B). Fewer cell types appear to express XYLT1, but on closer inspection, some cell types express very low mRNA levels (Fig. 4B, inset). Only HeLa and K562 cells had exclusive XYLT2 expression (Fig. 4, A and B, inset). These results imply that although some cells may differentially utilize XylT1 and XylT2 for xylosyltransferase activity, many cell types, similar to CHO cells, may rely primarily on XylT2 for PG biosynthesis.FIGURE 3Expression of XYLT1 and XYLT2 in multiple human cell types shows single transcript.

Real-time RT-PCR of total RNA from the indicated cell types is shown. A, XYLT2 expression in all cell types is found. B, XYLT1 expression comparable with that of XYLT2 is restricted to a limited number of cell types. The inset illustrates that some of those cell types appearing to lack XYLT1 expression actually have low levels of mRNA. However, HeLa and K562 cells completely lack XYLT1 mRNA by this analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe main finding of this study is that XylT2 has an important role in chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthesis as shown by expression and complementation analyses. We have demonstrated a correlation between expression of Xylt2 in wild-type CHO cells and chondroitin sulfate assembly on biglycan and heparan sulfate on cell surface proteoglycans and between loss of Xylt2 mRNA expression and absence of chondroitin sulfate modification and cell surface binding of FGF-2 in the xylosyltransferase-deficient CHO cells. Furthermore, we have shown that XylT2 can complement the loss of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate modification of core proteins in these cells. We have also demonstrated that many cell lines have abundant Xylt2 mRNA and near undetectable Xylt1 mRNA levels similar to CHO cells. Furthermore, two cell lines that exclusively express XYLT2 (21Charnaux N. Brule S. Hamon M. Chaigneau T. Saffar L. Prost C. Lievre N. Gattegno L.

Thus the role of Xylt2 in PG biosynthesis may not be exclusive to CHO cells.Since the XylT2 sequence is similar to the sequence of XylT1, which has been shown to ha"

In the oviduct, spermatozoa are exposed to glycodelin-A and -F that inhibit spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding. In this study, we determined whether these glycodelins would inhibit fertilization. The data showed that the spermatozoa without previous exposure to glycodelin-A and -F acquired glycodelin immunoreactivity during their passage through the cumulus oophorus. On the other hand, when glycodelin-A or -F-pretreated spermatozoa were exposed to the cumulus oophorus, the zona pellucida binding inhibitory activity of glycodelin-A and -F was not only removed, but the spermatozoa acquired enhanced zona pellucida binding ability. These actions of the cumulus oophorus were due to the presence of a cumulus isoform of glycodelin, designated as glycodelin-C. The cumulus cells could convert exogenous glycodelin-A and -F to glycodelin-C, which was then released into the surrounding medium. The protein core of glycodelin-C was identical to that in other glycodelin isoforms, as demonstrated by mass spectrum, peptide mapping, and affinity to anti-glycodelin antibody recognizing the protein core of glycodelin. In addition to having a smaller size and a higher isoelectric point, glycodelin-C also had lectin binding properties different from other isoforms. Glycodelin-C stimulated spermatozoazona pellucida binding in a dose-dependent manner, and it effectively displaced sperm-bound glycodelin-A and -F. In conclusion, the cumulus cells transform glycodelin-A and -F to glycodelin-C, which in turn removes the spermatozoazona binding inhibitory glycodelin isoforms and enhances the zona binding capacity of spermatozoa passing through the cumulus oophorus.

After ovulation, the oocyte-cumulus complex and follicular fluid are transported to the oviduct. Therefore, the spermatozoa have to traverse through the follicular fluid and the cumulus oophorus before they bind to the zona pellucida of the oocyte to initiate the fertilization process.

Thus, spermatozoa are exposed to these glycodelins in the oviduct and follicular fluid before they fertilize an oocyte. It seems paradoxical that both glycodelin-A and -F inhibit the binding of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida. Whether these glycodelin isoforms would inhibit fertilization in vivo remains unclear.Biological activities are often regulated by a fine balance between agonist and antagonist actions. For instance, progesterone induces acrosome reaction, but its activity is inhibited by human oviductal fluid (22Zhu J. Barratt C.L. Lippes J. Pacey A.A. Cooke I.D. Fertil. Steril. 1994; 61: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or glycodelin-F from human follicular fluid (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol.

Although the cumulus cells do not synthesize glycodelin, they take up glycodelin-A from the surrounding medium (24Tse J.Y. Chiu P.C. Lee K.F. Seppala M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S.

In the cell lysate of glycodelin-A-treated cumulus cells, a glycodelin-like molecule of size smaller than glycodelin-A was found. Whether this small glycodelin-like molecule represents product of taken up glycodelin-A or has another function is unknown. Recently, we reported our preliminary observation on the presence of a similar-sized glycodelin-like molecule in the cumulus matrix (13Yeung W.S. Lee K.F. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Ho P.C.

Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the cumulus cells produce another glycodelin isoform to modulate the activity of glycodelin-A and -F on spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding. The objectives of this report were 1) to determine the zona binding capacity of spermatozoa that had penetrated through the cumulus oophorus, 2) to characterize the small glycodelin-like molecule in the extracellular matrix of cumulus oophorus affecting spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding, and 3) to study the action of the molecule on glycodelin-A and -F-treated spermatozoa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSemen Samples—The Ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong approved the research protocol. Samples with normal semen parameters according to World Health Organization criteria (25Organization World Health Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction. 1999; (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK)Google Scholar) from men visiting the subfertility clinics at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong were used. The semen samples were processed by Percoll (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The processed spermatozoa were capacitated in Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS 3The abbreviations used are: EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HZI, hemizona binding index; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FITC-PSA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peanut (P. sativum) agglutinin. ; Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK) supplemented with sodium pyruvate and 3% bovine serum albumin for 3 h before they were resuspended in EBSS containing 0.3% BSA (EBSS/BSA).Purification of Glycodelin Isoforms—A monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43-7F9)-Sepharose column was used to purify glycodelin-A and -S from amniotic fluid and seminal plasma, respectively, as described (26Riittinen L. Narvanen O. Virtanen I. Seppala M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 136: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The bound glycodelin was eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Glycodelin-S was further purified by anion exchange chromatography (14Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Tsang H.Y. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25580-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Glycodelin-F was purified from human follicular fluid collected from women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment in Queen Mary Hospital (Hong Kong). The follicular fluid was passed successively through cibacron blue (HiTrap Blue), protein-G, concanavalin A-Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare), Amicon-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc. Beverly, CA), Mono-Q, and Superose columns as described (17Yao Y.Q. Chiu C.N. Ip S.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified glycodelin isoforms were determined by a commercial kit (protein assay kit; Bio-Rad). The N-glycosidase F deglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad) was used to deglycosylate glycodelins (18Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The deglycosylated protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in an AKTA system (GE Healthcare).Collection of Cumulus Oophorus and Cumulus Matrix—The Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong approved the protocol for collection and use of cumulus oophorus and cumulus matrix in this study. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were collected after oocyte retrieval from women who came for treatment with intracytoplasmic sperm injection because of male infertility. Human menopausal gonadotropin (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) was used for ovarian stimulation after down-regulation with buserelin (27Ng E.H. Ajonuma L.C. Lau E.Y. Yeung W.S. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 15: 772-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For use in the capillary-cumulus model (6Hong S.J. Chiu P.C. Lee K.F. Tse J.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), intact cumulus oophorus was obtained by mechanical dissection from the cumulus-oocyte complex. The cumulus matrix was collected after dispersion of the cumulus oophorus in 1 ml of 0.1% hyaluronidase at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min to remove the cumulus cells.Zona Binding Capacity of Spermatozoa Penetrating through the Cumulus Oophorus—A capillary-cumulus model was used (6Hong S.J. Chiu P.C. Lee K.F. Tse J.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBSS/BSA and cumulus oophorus were successively aspirated into a sterile glass capillary (Microcaps; Drummund Broomall, PA) to form columns of 3 and 2 cm in length, respectively. The end of the capillary with the cumulus column was dipped into a 100-μl droplet of sperm suspension containing 10 × 106 motile spermatozoa/ml overlaid with mineral oil. Another capillary containing only EBSS/BSA serves as the control. The setup was kept in a mobile in vitro fertilization chamber (Air-shields, Inc. Hatboro, PA) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After incubation for 1 h, the experimental capillary was cut at the interface between the cumulus column and the medium column. Spermatozoa that had passed through the cumulus oophorus (penetrated spermatozoa) were collected in the medium column. The control capillary was cut at a level that was similar to that of the experimental capillaries. Spermatozoa that had swum above the cutting level of the control capillary were collected as the control spermatozoa.The hemizona binding assay described (28Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 11: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was miniaturized to determine the zona binding capacity of the above spermatozoa. Unfertilized oocytes from assisted reproduction program were microbisected into two identical hemizonae. In this modified protocol, 6000 spermatozoa were incubated with each hemizona in 30 μl of EBSS/BSA under mineral oil for 3 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The numbers of tightly bound spermatozoa on the outer surface of the hemizonae were counted. The hemizona binding index (HZI) was defined as the ratio of the number of bound spermatozoa in test droplet to that in the control droplet times 100. The experiment was repeated 10 times using different sperm samples and cumulus masses.Glycodelin immunoreactivity on penetrated spermatozoa was determined by staining using monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43-7F9) recognizing the protein core of glycodelins (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Staining without the primary antibody was used as control. The experiment was repeated five times with five semen samples. The presence of glycodelin immunoreactivity in these spermatozoa suggested the presence of glycodelin in the cumulus matrix (see “Results”). Western blot analysis of the cumulus matrix using the same antibody was used to confirm the observation.Identification Glycodelin from Cumulus Matrix—Solubilized cumulus matrix was diluted 1:5 (v/v) with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The glycodelin in the matrix were isolated by the monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody-Sepharose column as described above. The bound glycodelin was eluted and further fractionated by a Mono-Q column using a stepwise elution with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The eluted fractions were concentrated by Microcon-10 (Millipore). Their purities were determined by SDS-PAGE.The bands in SDS-PAGE showing glycodelin immunoreactivity were excised for in situ digestion with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0). The peptides were recovered with Millipore C18 ZipTips and 60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid matrix. The peptide-matrix samples were analyzed with the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to obtain the peptide mass spectra, which were compared with the protein spectra in the protein data bases at the Swiss-Prot (www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/) as described (29Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. He Q.Y. Chiu J.F. Lee W.M. Luk J.M. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12763-12768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Biochemical Characterization of Cumulus Glycodelin—The protein core of cumulus glycodelin was also studied by peptide mapping (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this experiment, 600 pmol of deglycosylated glycodelin-A or -S or cumulus glycodelin was digested in 40 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3 with 2 units of agarose bound trypsin (Sigma) for 20 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides in the supernatant were analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE.The isoelectric point of the molecule was determined by analytical isoelectric focusing on 5% polyacrylamide gel (30Robertson E.F. Dannelly H.K. Malloy P.J. Reeves H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) in a pH range of 3–10. The experiment was performed with 25 mm NaOH (cathode buffer) and 20 mm acetic acid (anode buffer) at 200 V for 1.5 h followed by 400 V for another 1.5 h. The protein bands were stained by Coomassie Blue, and their pI values were estimated using the IEF calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences).Lectin binding assay (14Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Tsang H.Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 25580-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used to study the glycosylation of cumulus glycodelin. Briefly, the wells in 96-well plate were coated with various lectins (10 μg/ml) overnight. Uncoated sites in the well were blocked by incubation with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h with slow shaking. Glycodelins (7.5 pmol in 25 μl) were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing the wells twice with 0.05% Tween 20-TBS, monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43-7F9, 2.5 μgin200 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h. The wells were washed four times and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:5000 (Sigma) was added. After 2 h of incubation, the wells were washed, and 100 μl/well of o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) was added. The A490 was determined with a microplate reader (MR5000; Dynatech, Embrach, Switzerland). The assay was done at room temperature. The control wells contained BSA instead of glycodelin.The binding affinity of cumulus glycodelin to a monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody was compared with that of other glycodelin isoforms in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.03–6 pmol/ml of cumulus glycodelin and glycodelin-A and -F were coated onto a 96-well plate for 3 h at room temperature with slow shaking. Uncoated sites in each well were blocked by incubation with 100 μl of 3% BSA/TBS for 2 h. The wells were then washed with Tween 20-TBS followed by the addition of a limiting concentration of anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43-7F9, 1000 ng/ml) in TBS (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the wells were washed thrice with Tween 20-TBS and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:300 was then added. The bound fluorescence was measured with a fluorometer (FL600; Bio-Tek).Biological Characterization of Cumulus Glycodelin—The equilibrium binding of cumulus glycodelin to spermatozoa was determined as described (14Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Tsang H.Y. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25580-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Four semen samples were used (n = 4). Spermatozoa (2 × 106 motile spermatozoa/ml) in 100 μl of EBSS/BSA were incubated with different concentrations (0.162343 pmol/ml) of iodinated cumulus glycodelin at 37 °C for 1 h. The binding was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation at 300 g for 3 min. After washing the spermatozoa with fresh EBSS/BSA, the sperm-bound radioactivity was counted with a gamma counter (model 5500B; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The specific binding of cumulus glycodelin was determined by subtracting the sperm-bound radioactivity in the presence of a 50-fold higher concentration of unlabeled glycodelin from that in the absence of unlabeled protein. The determinations of total binding and nonspecific binding were done in duplicate.Competition binding analysis was used to compare the affinity of cumulus glycodelin and other lipocalins to spermatozoa (14Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Tsang H.Y. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25580-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The binding of 200 pmol/ml of 125I-cumulus glycodelin to 2 × 105 motile spermatozoa (n = 3) in 100 μl of EBSS/BSA was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations (2, 20, 200, 1000, and 2000 pmol/ml) of unlabeled cumulus glycodelin, glycodelin-A, -F, and -S, deglycosylated glycodelin and bovine β-lactoglobulin A (Sigma), or buffer alone at 37 °C for 360 min. The cell-bound radioactivity was then determined. Each individual experiment was repeated twice.The binding of purified cumulus glycodelin to spermatozoa was visualized by immunohistochemical staining after the incubation of capacitated spermatozoa (n = 5, 2 × 106 spermatozoa/ml) with 200 pmol/ml cumulus glycodelin for 60 min at 37°C under 5% CO2 in air. Binding of deglycosylated glycodelin was used as a control.Hemizona binding assay was used to study the effect of cumulus glycodelin on spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding. Briefly, capacitated spermatozoa (2 × 106 spermatozoa/ml; n = 5) were incubated with 0.3, 3, 30, 300, or 750 pmol/ml cumulus glycodelin or EBSS/BSA (control) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After 1 h of incubation, the spermatozoa were washed with fresh EBSS/BSA. Standard protocol of hemizona binding assay (28Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 11: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was performed on the 20,000 treated spermatozoa in 100 μl of EBSS/BSA. Glycodelin-A, -F, and -S and deglycosylated glycodelin were used as controls.The effect of cumulus glycodelin on sperm motility, viability, and acrosomal status were also determined. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peanut (Pisum sativum) agglutinin (FITC-PSA; Sigma) and Hoechst staining techniques were used to evaluate the acrosomal status of spermatozoa (16Chiu P.C. Ho P.C. Ng E.H. Yeung W.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fluorescence patterns of 300 spermatozoa in randomly selected fields were determined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with 600× magnification. Spermatozoa without Hoechst and FITC-PSA staining or with FITC-PSA staining confined to the equatorial segment only were considered as acrosome reacted. Hobson Sperm Tracker System (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, UK) was used to study sperm motility. The set-up parameters of the system and the procedures are described elsewhere (12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Effects of Cumulus Penetration on the Zona Binding Capacity of Glycodelin-A- and -F-treated Spermatozoa—Capacitated spermatozoa (2 × 106 spermatozoa/ml) were incubated with 300 pmol/ml of glycodelin-F or -A, deglycosylated glycodelin or EBSS/BSA (control) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 2 h. They were then washed and allowed to penetrate the cumulus oophorus column in the capillary as described above. The penetrated spermatozoa were washed with fresh EBSS/BSA, and their zona binding capacities were determined by hemizona binding assay. The experiment was repeated 10 times with different sperm samples and cumulus masses.The fate of sperm-bound glycodelin-F and -A after cumulus oophorus penetration was investigated by repeating the above experiment using iodinated or Alexa 488 (Alexa Fluor® 488 protein labeling kit; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA)-conjugated glycodelin-F and -A. The penetrated spermatozoa were collected and either smeared on slides to observe under a fluorescence microscope with an excitation filter BP 450–490, chromatic beam splitter FT510, and barrier filter LP520 or counted for their associated radioactivity as above.Effects of Cumulus Glycodelin on Sperm-bound Glycodelin-A and -F—Iodinated or Alexa 488-conjugated glycodelin-A or -F (300 pmol/ml) were incubated with 2 × 105 motile spermatozoa (n = 3) in 100 μl of EBSS with 0.3% BSA at 37 °C for 120 min. Unlabeled glycodelin-A or -F, cumulus glycodelin, or deglycosylated glycodelin (200 pmol/ml) was then added. After a further incubation for 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, or 90 min, ice-cold buffer was added to stop the dissociation. The spermatozoa were then washed, and their associated radioactivity or fluorescence was determined as described above.Processing of Glycodelin by Cumulus Cells—The dispersed cumulus cells were washed twice in TC-199 medium (Sigma) and resuspended to a final concentration of 4 × 106 viable cells/ml. Trypan blue exclusion test was employed to determine the viability of the cells. They were then cultured in 2 ml of TC-199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) as described (31Chian R.C. Ao A. Clarke H.J. Tulandi T. Tan S.L. Fertil.

https://openalex.org/W2003829546,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator is a 25-subunit complex that facilitates both transcriptional activation and repression. Structural and functional studies have divided Mediator subunits into four distinct modules. The Head, Middle, and Tail modules form the core functional Mediator complex, whereas a fourth, the Cyc-C module, is variably associated with the core. By purifying Mediator from a strain lacking the Med19(Rox3) subunit, we have found that a complex missing only the Med19(Rox3) subunit can be isolated under mild conditions. Additionally, we have established that the entire Middle module is released when the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator is purified under more stringent conditions. In contrast to most models of the modular structure of Mediator, we show that release of the Middle module in the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator leaves a stable complex made up solely of Head and Tail subunits. Both the intact and Head-Tail Δmed19(rox3) Mediator complexes have defects in enhanced basal transcription, enhanced TFIIH phosphorylation of the CTD, as well as binding of RNA Pol II and the CTD. The largely intact Δmed19(rox3) complex facilitates activated transcription at levels similar to the wild type Mediator. In the absence of the Middle module, however, the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator is unable to facilitate activated transcription. Although the Middle module is unnecessary for holding the Head and Tail modules together, it is required for the complex to function as a conduit between activators and the core transcription machinery.

The Mediator complex is a conserved interface between gene-specific regulatory proteins and the general transcription apparatus of eukaryotes at transcription initiation (1Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 2005; 19: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) studies have enabled the provisional assignment of yeast Mediator subunits into four distinct modules. Each of these modules is thought to have a unique role in the structure and function of the entire complex. The core functional Mediator complex was initially defined as the minimal intact complex, purified from a wild type strain, capable of facilitating activated transcription in a system reconstituted from highly purified general transcription factors (6Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 7Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Single-particle electron microscopic analysis of core Mediator identified three areas of density that were referred to as the Tail, Middle, and Head modules of the complex (3Chadick J.Z. Asturias F.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A fourth module, called the Cyc-C module, is found to be variably associated with the core Mediator modules and may regulate its function (8Samuelsen C.O. Baraznenok V. Khorosjutina O. Spahr H. Kieselbach T. Holmberg S. Gustafsson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6422-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The modular structure of the yeast complex appears to be conserved in Mediator complexes purified from metazoan cells (9Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2005; 30: 250-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies have helped assemble a reasonable model for the composition of, and the interactions within, the structural modules of Mediator (summarized in Refs. 3Chadick J.Z. Asturias F.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 11Guglielmi B. van Berkum N.L. Klapholz B. Bijma T. Boube M. Boschiero C.

Little, however, is known about how these modules are held together, what the functional implications of these intermodular interactions are, and how these interactions are regulated. Genetic, genomic, and functional assays in vitro have provided support for the model of the modular structure of Mediator but also raised further questions on how the modules function together. Mediator, purified from wild type cells, has three activities in vitro: the ability to facilitate activated transcription, the ability to enhance basal transcription, and the ability to enhance phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) 2The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; Pol, polymerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase. of RNA Pol II by TFIIH (7Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Tail module subunits of Mediator generally lead to defects in activated transcription but have little effect on enhancement of basal transcription or CTD phosphorylation (12Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Head module proteins have broad effects on all three functions in vitro (13Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Middle module mutant Mediators, Δmed9 and med10ts, appear to have defects in basal and activated transcription (15Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although the structural composition of these complexes has not been evaluated. A recent genomic study and a wealth of data from elegant yeast genetic screens have outlined key distinctions between the subunits in the Middle module and those in the Tail and the Head modules of Mediator. The Tail module subunits are largely encoded by nonessential genes, whereas the Middle and Head domains are encoded by roughly equal numbers of essential and nonessential genes. Genetic studies of various regulatory systems in yeast have revealed that subunits in the Tail and Head module have a positive influence on gene expression (4Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In contrast, a number of genetic screens have shown that mutations in Middle, Cyc-C, and some Tail module subunits lead to derepression of heat shock factor basal transcription (16Singh H. Erkine A.M. Kremer S.B. Duttweiler H.M. Davis D.A. Iqbal J. Gross R.R. Gross D.S. Genetics. 2006; 172: 2169-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), maltose-induced genes (17Wang X. Michels C.A. Genetics. 2004; 168: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), glucose-repressed genes (18Song W. Treich I. Qian N. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the HO gene (19Tabtiang R.K. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4707-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Systematic gene expression microarray and clustering analyses of Mediator mutant strains found a correlation pattern among subunits of the complex (5van de Peppel J. Kettelarij N. van Bakel H. Kockelkorn T.T. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A strong positive correlation was observed between members of Head and Tail modules, whereas a negative correlation was observed between members of these modules and the subunits of the Middle module. Given the separation of the Head and Tail modules by the Middle module in the structural models, it is an open question how the Head and Tail could function in concert with each other to exert a positive effect on gene expression on select sets of genes. Moreover, it is unclear how Middle module defects could lead to up-regulation of transcription, whereas these subunits are seemingly required to link two positive acting modules of the complex. A Mediator subunit that plays a key role in both activation and repression is Med19(Rox3). Med19(Rox3) was originally identified in a search for mutants increasing aerobic expression of the CYC7 gene (21Rosenblum-Vos L.S. Rhodes L. Evangelista Jr., C.C. Boayke K.A. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5639-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Analysis of purified Mediator by mass spectrometry conclusively demonstrated that Med19(Rox3) was a subunit of Mediator (22Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Li Y. Redd M.J. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 48-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Med19(Rox3) was initially found to be encoded by an essential gene product; however, a strain made as part of the genome wide deletion library lacks MED19(ROX3) and is viable (EUROSCARF). med19(rox3) mutants have been shown to be defective for activation of Gal4 (23Brown T.A. Evangelista C. Trumpower B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6836-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gcn4 (24Qiu H. Hu C. Yoon S. Natarajan K. Swanson M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4104-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)-induced genes. On the other hand, med19(rox3) mutants also lead to derepression of heat shock (16Singh H. Erkine A.M.

Hoheisel J.D. Tizon B. Cerdan M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a med19(rox3) truncation strain (5van de Peppel J. Kettelarij N. van Bakel H. Kockelkorn T.T. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of broad sets of genes are both up- and down-regulated. To gain further insight into the unusual functional properties of Med19(Rox3), we purified Mediator complexes from the Δmed19(rox3) strain. Consistent with the Middle module phenotypes caused by med19(rox3) mutants, we found that Med19(Rox3) was critical for the stable association of the Middle module with the complex. In contrast to current models of Mediator structure, we found that release of the Middle module of Mediator left an intact and stable complex between Tail and Head module subunits. Characterization of this complex using binding and transcription assays in vitro has given us further insight into the coordination of Mediator structure and function. Yeast Strains—The Δmed19(rox3) strain was obtained from EUROSCARF (accession number Y03119). To construct the MED18(SRB5)-FLAG-tagged Δmed19(rox3) strain, the NatR marker was swapped for the KanMX4 marker in an otherwise wild type MED18(SRB5)-FLAG strain (SHY349). The strain yLM40 was made by transforming SHY349 (26Rani P.G. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with an EcoRI fragment of the plasmid p4339 (27Tong A.H. Boone C. Methods Mol.

A triple FLAG epitope tag was placed at the C terminus of MED18(SRB5) in the Δmed19(rox3) strain, by amplifying the 3′ end of a previously FLAG-tagged copy of MED18(SRB5) from the genomic DNA of the yLM40 strain using the following primers: 5′-GGAGGGTTCCTTTTAAAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GAAGCAAATTGCCAAACA-3′. The PCR product was then used to transform the Δmed19(rox3) strain, and transformants were selected for nourseothricin resistance. The correct integration of the FLAG tag was confirmed by PCR and immunoblotting for FLAG-tagged Med18(Srb5) in the strain yLM45. Protein Purification—The untagged Δmed19(rox3) complexes were prepared by modification of the methods used for conventional purification of the wild type Mediator complex (28Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Δmed19(rox3) strain was grown at 26 °C to an A600 of 2 in YPD (4% glucose). The lysis, as well as the Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography were carried out as previously described for the wild type complex (28Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The hydroxyapatite column was run as previously described; however, there were two distinct peaks containing Mediator proteins instead of one. The first peak, containing only Middle module subunits, co-eluted at ∼75 mm potassium phosphate, whereas a second peak containing subunits from all three modules co-eluted at ∼125 mm potassium phosphate. The peak containing only Middle module subunits was pooled and applied to a Mono-Q 5/5 column (GE Biosciences) as previously described, except that a 26 column volume linear gradient was run from 200 to 1500 mm potassium acetate. The peak of Middle module subunits co-eluted at ∼925 mm potassium acetate. This peak of Middle module subunits was pooled and applied to a Heparin 5PW column (TosoHass) at 200 mm potassium acetate. The Middle module subunits all flowed through the Heparin column. The flow-through fractions were pooled, concentrated, and used directly for immunoblots. The hydroxyapatite peak containing subunits from all three modules was pooled and applied to a Mono-Q 5/5 column as previously described, except that a 26-column volume linear gradient was run from 200 to 1500 mm potassium acetate. Instead of a single peak of Mediator proteins, a peak of Head and Tail module subunits co-eluted at ∼740 mm potassium acetate, and a separate peak containing Head, Middle, and Tail modules co-eluted at ∼880 mm potassium acetate. The peak of Head and Tail module subunits was pooled and applied to a Heparin 5PW column as described (28Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Comp.

The Head, Middle, and Tail module subunits co-eluted from the Heparin column at ∼370 mm potassium acetate. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and used directly for immunoblots.

Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 212-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of Δmed19(rox3)—The MED18(SRB5)-FLAG-tagged wild type and Δmed19(rox3) strains were grown at 26 °C to an A600 of 2 in YPD (4% glucose) and an extract prepared by the a blender/liquid N2 lysis method (29Takagi Y. Chadick J.Z. Davis J.A. Asturias F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31200-31207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The extract was dialyzed against FLAG buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 300 mm KOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and adjusted to a final KOAc concentration of 300 mm by the addition of FLAG buffer with no KOAc. Approximately 20 mg of dialyzed extract was added to 200 μl Anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma), incubated for 2h at 4 °C with rotation, and washed four times with 10 ml of FLAG buffer. Mediator was eluted with FLAG buffer containing 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). To evaluate the stability of the wild type and Δmed19(rox3) Mediators, the above protocol was modified to add a wash with 10 ml of FLAG buffer containing 1 m urea subsequent to the 4 × 10-ml washes with FLAG buffer. Before the FLAG peptide elution, a 10-ml wash with FLAG buffer followed the wash with 1 m urea. To obtain a highly purified preparation of the Δmed19(rox3) complex containing only Head and Tail module subunits, a lysate was prepared from the MED18(SRB5)-FLAG-tagged Δmed19(rox3) strain. Starting from this lysate, a complex containing only Head and Tail module proteins was purified as described above for the untagged complex. After the Mono-Q step, the peak fractions containing the Head-Tail (HT) complex were pooled, dialyzed against FLAG-buffer, and adjusted to a final salt concentration of 300 mm KOAc. This sample was than applied to the FLAG-agarose beads, which were washed and eluted as described above. Immunoblot Analyses—Immunoblot analyses with the α-Med2, α-Med4, α-Med7, and α-Med8 antibodies were performed as previously described (7Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M.

Fukasawa, and the α-Med1 antibody was a gift of S. Bjorklund. Transcription and Kinase Assays—Basal and activated transcription reconstituted from purified yeast general transcription factors was measured using the G-less cassette assay as previously described (7Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The final salt concentration in the reaction buffer was 165 mm KOAc, and the reactions were preincubated for 10 min in the absence of nucleotides followed by a 60-min reaction time after the addition of the nucleotides. The general transcription factors used for all of the reactions in this study came from identical aliquots of a single preparation. The kinase assays with purified Mediator complexes, TFIIK, and GST-CTD were performed as previously described (30Guidi B.W. Bjornsdottir G. Hopkins D.C. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Activator and RNA Pol II Binding Assays—Binding of wild type and Δmed19(rox3)-HT purified Mediator complexes to immobilized GST activator fusion proteins was carried out as previously described (31Hengartner C.J.

To assay the binding of core RNA Pol II to wild type and Δmed19(rox3)-Head-Middle-Tail (HMT) Mediator, a Med18(Srb5)-FLAG-tagged version of each of these complexes were immobilized on FLAG-agarose as described above. The immobilized Mediator beads were equilibrated in FLAG buffer with 200 mm KOAc. Equal amounts of purified core RNA Pol II was added to the wild type and Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, the supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed four times with FLAG buffer with 200 mm KOAc. Wild type or Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator and any associated RNA Pol II was eluted with FLAG buffer containing 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Deletion of Med19(Rox3) Leads to Dissociation of the Middle Module of Mediator, Leaving an Intact Mediator Subcomplex Consisting of Head and Tail Modules—We undertook a conventional purification of complexes containing Mediator subunits from a Δmed19(rox3) strain to determine the structural impact of deleting the Med19(Rox3) subunit from Mediator. We followed the purification by immunoblotting with antibodies against subunits in all three modules of core Mediator. From the Δmed19(rox3) lysate through the first two ion exchange columns (Bio-Rex70 and DEAE-Sepharose), the strain showed an identical fractionation pattern to wild type (Fig. 1A). Fractionation of the DEAE pool containing Δmed19(rox3) Mediator on hydroxyapatite, however, showed a pattern distinct from that of wild type. Instead of a single peak, we observed an initial peak of Middle module subunits, followed by a second peak containing subunits from all three modules (Fig. 1B). To further characterize the peak containing only Middle module subunits, we pooled these fractions and observed that the Middle module subunits co-elute over a Mono-Q column and all flow through a Heparin column (Fig. 1A). The flow through fractions were pooled, concentrated, and compared with wild type Mediator by immunoblotting. This Middle module complex (Δmed19 (rox3)-M) contained stoichiometric amounts of Middle module subunits (compared with wild type) and levels of Head and Tail module subunits that were below detection (Fig. 1D). The second peak on the hydroxyapatite, containing subunits from all three modules, was pooled and further fractionated on a Mono-Q column (Fig. 1A). In contrast to wild type Mediator, two distinct peaks of Mediator eluted from the Mono-Q column. The first peak contained subunits from only the Head and Tail modules of the complex, whereas the second peak contained subunits from all three modules (Fig. 1C). Both of these peaks were individually pooled and applied to a Heparin column. Fractionation of the first pool (Δmed19(rox3)-HT) on Heparin resulted in a peak of Head and Tail module subunits co-eluting from the column (Fig. 1A), whereas fractionation of the second pool (Δmed19(rox3)-HMT) on Heparin resulted in a peak of subunits from all three modules co-eluting from the column (Fig. 1A). These two peaks were individually pooled, concentrated, and compared with wild type Mediator by immunoblotting. The analysis of the (Δmed19(rox3)-HT) complex showed stoichiometric amounts of Head and Tail module subunits (compared with wild type) and levels of Middle module subunits that were below detection (Fig. 1D). The analysis of the (Δmed19(rox3)-HMT) complex showed stoichiometric amounts of subunits from all three modules (compared with wild type) (Fig. 1D). Immunoblotting with an antibody against Med19(Rox3) confirmed that this subunit was absent from all Mediator preparations from the mutant strain (data not shown). Three distinct Δmed19(rox3) Mediator complexes exist after purification. The first is a largely intact complex (Δmed19(rox3)-HMT), missing only the deleted subunit. The second and third (Δmed19(rox3)-M and Δmed19(rox3)-HT) appear to result from the dissociation of the Middle module complex from the Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator. The existence of a stable Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex was surprising; to further characterize the composition of the complex, we took an affinity purification approach. To purify the Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex to homogeneity, we grew cells from a Med18(Srb5)-FLAG-tagged wild type and Δmed19(rox3) strain and followed the conventional purification protocol, as described above, through the Mono-Q stage. After separation on Mono-Q, the fractions containing the Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex were pooled and subjected to a final purification step on FLAG-agarose. Immunoblotting of the pure Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex shows that an affinity tag on the Head module could pull down stoichiometric amounts of Tail module proteins as compared with the wild type complex (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of Head subunits by an antibody against a Tail subunit (α-Med2) confirmed this result (data not shown). A silver stain analysis of purified Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex shows that the complex appears to contain only Head and Tail module proteins in stoichiometric quantities (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that it is unlikely that additional “non-Mediator” proteins had associated with the complex and “compensated” for the absence of the Middle module subunits. We cannot, however, rule this possibility out given the differential staining of proteins by silver. Contrary to current models, the Head and Tail modules of Mediator can directly form a stable complex in the absence of a Middle module. To determine the composition of the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator under mild conditions, we purified the complex directly from lysate of the MED18(SRB5)-FLAG-tagged Δmed19(rox3) strain on FLAG-agarose. During the conventional purification of the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator, the complex is subjected to several highly stringent conditions that could lead to dissociation of weakly interacting subunits or modules. Immunoblotting of Mediator subunits from affinity-purified Med18(Srb5)-FLAG-tagged wild type and Δmed19(rox3) complexes show the presence of stoichiometric amount of subunits from all three modules, as compared with conventionally purified wild type Mediator (Fig. 2B). Hence, it appears as if the largely intact Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator is the predominant form of the complex under mild conditions. This procedure was an effective means to purify the Δmed19(rox3)-HMT complex to homogeneity. Silver stain analysis confirmed the purity and stoichiometry of the Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator complex purified under mild conditions (Fig. 2C). Absence of Med19(Rox3) Destabilizes Attachment of Middle Module in Intact Mediator Complex—Because a majority of the Δmed19(rox3) Mediator under mild conditions appears to be present in a largely intact form, we sought to determine the origin of the Δmed19(rox3)-HT complex. We hypothesized that the absence Med19(Rox3) leads to the destabilization of the intact complex and that a stringent step during the conventional purification resulted in the partial displacement of Middle module from the complex. To test this idea we immobilized both Med18(Srb5)-FLAG-tagged wild type and Δmed19(rox3)-HMT Mediator on FLAG-agarose and washed the complex with a buffer containing 1 m urea. Earlier studies have shown that the an immobilized wild type Mediator is resistant to 1 m urea but starts to dissociate at concentrations greater than 2 m (32Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J.

De novo synthesis of the vitamin can occur through either of two mutually exclusive pathways referred to as deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate-dependent and deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate-independent. The latter pathway has only recently been discovered and is distinguished by the presence of two genes, Pdx1 and Pdx2, encoding the synthase and glutaminase subunit of PLP synthase, respectively. In the presence of ammonia, the synthase alone displays an exceptional polymorphic synthetic ability in carrying out a complex set of reactions, including pentose and triose isomerization, imine formation, ammonia addition, aldol-type condensation, cyclization, and aromatization, that convert C3 and C5 precursors into the cofactor B6 vitamer, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. Here, employing the Bacillus subtilis proteins, we demonstrate key features along the catalytic path. We show that ribose 5-phosphate is the preferred C5 substrate and provide unequivocal evidence that the pent(ul)ose phosphate imine occurs at lysine 81 rather than lysine 149 as previously postulated. While this study was under review, corroborative crystallographic evidence has been provided for imine formation with the corresponding lysine group in the enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (Zein, F., Zhang, Y., Kang, Y.-N., Burns, K., Begley, T.

We have detected an unanticipated covalent reaction intermediate that occurs subsequent to imine formation and is dependent on the presence of Pdx2 and glutamine. This step most likely primes the enzyme for acceptance of the triose sugar, ultimately leading to formation of the pyridine ring.

The corresponding proteins function together as the glutamine amidotransferase, PLP synthase with Pdx2 as the glutaminase domain and Pdx1 as the acceptor domain. As a result of extensive labeling studies in yeast and biochemical analysis with the recombinant enzymes, the substrates of Pdx1 have recently been identified (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L.

In the presence of Pdx1, Pdx2, and glutamine, a combination of either ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) or ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) with either glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) or dihydroxyacetone phosphate resulted in the reconstitution of PLP biosynthesis. As either of two pentose or triose sugar phosphates could be utilized, it was proposed that Pdx1 can catalyze their isomerization (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In analogy to the reactions catalyzed by imidazole glycerol-phosphate synthase (HisH/HisF) (16Chaudhuri B.N. Lange S.C. Myers R.S. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 43: 7003-7012Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and thiazole synthase (17Dorrestein P.C. Zhai H. Taylor S.V. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem.

The observation of the expected mass for such an adduct with the isolated recombinant protein corroborated this hypothesis. This adduct was proposed to involve lysine 149, as deduced from tandem mass spectrometric analysis (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). With the knowledge of substrates and product at hand, and furthermore, the observation that 2′-hydroxypyridoxol is converted into pyridoxamine in whole yeast cells (18Zeidler J. Ullah N. Gupta R.N. Paulowski R.M. Sayer B.G. Spenser I.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4542-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a mechanism of action was proposed (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this context, Pdx1 appears to be exceptional in that it can catalyze pentose and triose isomerizations, imine formation, ammonia addition, and aromatic ring formation, all in a single enzymatic system. Many of the mechanistic steps proposed are hypothetical, and additional information on the actual mechanism of such an intriguing enzyme is highly desirable given its fundamental interest and its potential as a drug target in certain parasitic organisms (19Wrenger C.

Here we report on the identification of an unanticipated Pdx1 reaction intermediate. This intermediate is chromophoric; its formation is subsequent to that of the imine adduct and is concomitant with the release of phosphate from the pent(ul)ose substrate. Furthermore, it is dependent on glutamine hydrolysis by the Pdx2 subunit. In addition, we show that ribose 5-phosphate is the preferred C5 substrate of Pdx1. Lastly, although we can corroborate the participation of a pent(ul)ose phosphate-derived imine as a reaction intermediate, this adduct is now unequivocally shown to involve, in Bacillus subtilis Pdx1, lysine 81 rather than lysine 149, as suggested previously (11Burns K.E.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Pdx1-His6 K81R and Pdx1-His6 K149R were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) employing the following oligonucleotides: K81R, forward 5′-CCGGTAATGGCACGAGCGCGTATCGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCGATACGCGCTCGTGCCATTACCGG-3′; K149R, forward 5′-CTATGCTTCGCACAAGAGGTGAGCCTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCAGGCTCACCTCTTGTGCGAAGCATAG-3′ using pETBsPdx1-His6 as the template.

Generation of Free Pdx1—Isolated Pdx1-His6 was incubated with 0.5 mmdl-G3P and 20 mm ammonium sulfate for 3 h at room temperature prior to dialysis against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm sodium chloride. Dialyzed protein samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Synthesis of U-14C- and U-13C-labeled Ru5P and R5P—Uniform labeling of Ru5P with either 13Cor 14C was carried out by incubation of the respective uniformly labeled glucose (0.5 mm) with enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (hexokinase (2 units), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1 unit), 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase (1 unit)) in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.6 mm each of ATP, NAD+, and NADP+ at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals. When labeled R5P was required, 1 unit of phosphoriboisomerase was included. PLP Synthase Activity Assays—The activity of PLP synthase was monitored in 96-well plates (PowerWave™ microplate spectrophotometer, Bio-Tek) by following the absorbance at 414 nm, due to the formation of PLP (12Raschle T. Amrhein N. Fitzpatrick T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32291-32300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 20 μm free Pdx1 and 20 μm Pdx2, 1 mmdl-G3P, and 20 mm glutamine while varying the concentration of either R5P or Ru5P in the range of 0.01–1.0 or 0.3–6 mm, respectively. HPLC/Protein Methods of Pdx1—Pdx1 species were separated by RP-HPLC (Agilent 1100 series capillary LC System) employing a Zorbax SB C18 column (3.5 μm, 0.5 × 150 mm). Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–45% acetonitrile (v/v). Peak fractions were collected and analyzed by either MALDI-TOF (Bruker Ultraflex II) or ESI mass spectrometry (Waters quadropole time-of-flight Ultima API). Pdx1 tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC employing a Reprosil 100 C18 column (5 μm, 100 × 4.6 mm) equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The online addition of scintillation liquid (Flo-scint A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and radio detection (Radiomatic FLO-ONE-Beta, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) permitted identification of radiolabeled fractions. A gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at 1 ml/min was established over 45 min, held for 5 min, raised to 80% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 5 min, and then returned to the starting conditions over 15 min. Fractions of interest were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Ultraflex II). Total protein and phosphospecific staining was carried out using SYPRO® Ruby and Pro-Q® Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain according to the manufacturer’s (Invitrogen) instructions and Ref. 22Agrawal G.-K. Thelen J.J. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, respectively. Reconstitution of the Chromophoric Adduct—Free Pdx1 (20 μm) was incubated with R5P in the presence of either Pdx2 (20 μm) and 10 mm glutamine or 20 mm ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5. Measurement of the Release of Inorganic Phosphate—The inorganic phosphate released was monitored spectrophotometrically employing a coupled enzyme assay (EnzChek® phosphate assay kit, Molecular Probes). Typically, equimolar concentrations of Pdx1 and Pdx2 (20 μm) were incubated with glutamine and the kit constituents in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm MgC12. The reaction was started by the addition of R5P to a final volume of 300 μl and monitored by the increase in absorbance at 360 nm. Detection of a Chromophoric Reaction Intermediate of PLP Biosynthesis—During the preliminary characterization of the PLP synthase subunit, Pdx1, we frequently observed an absorbance maximum at 315 nm with the freshly isolated protein, which gradually disappeared over a period of days, in addition to the typical maximum at 280 nm (Fig. 1). Although this species could not be assigned to any known chromophore, denaturation experiments indicated that it is covalently attached to the protein (data not shown). Thus, to aid in its characterization, we attempted its reconstitution. The addition of the individual sugar substrates to Pdx1 alone did not affect the UV-visible absorbance spectrum. However, if the glutaminase subunit, Pdx2, and its substrate, glutamine, were included in the presence of the pent(ul)ose sugar, a time-dependent increase in the absorbance at 315 nm was observed (Fig. 2A). The increase was not observed in the presence of either Pdx2 or glutamine alone, suggesting that formation of the chromophore is dependent on glutamine hydrolysis. This was corroborated by employing the catalytically incompetent Pdx2 H170N mutant (21Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19284-19289Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which does not allow formation of the chromophore (Fig. 2A, inset). Pdx2 H170N can still bind glutamine when complexed to Pdx1 (21Strohmeier M. Raschle T. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. Sinning I. Fitzpatrick T.B. Tews I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19284-19289Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) but is unable to carry out its hydrolysis due to the replacement of the catalytic histidine (23Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was also possible to reconstitute the chromophore employing ammonium sulfate in place of Pdx2 and glutamine, albeit at a rate ∼10-fold slower (data not shown).FIGURE 2UV-visible absorbance changes of Pdx1 in the presence of R5P. A, reconstitution of the chromophoric adduct. Incubation of Pdx1 (20 μm) in the presence of R5P (0.2 mm), Pdx2 (20 μm), and glutamine (10 mm) results in an absorbance maximum at 315 nm. The spectra were recorded at 0-, 1.5-, 3-, 4.5-, 6-, 7.5-, and 9-min intervals. The inset shows the increase in absorbance at 315 nm observed when Pdx2 wild type (WT, solid line) was substituted for Pdx2 H170N (dotted line). AU, arbitrary units. B, the rate of chromophore formation is dependent on the concentration of R5P. The changes in absorbance at 315 nm were recorded as a function of the concentration of R5P (0–2 mm). Fitting of the data was according to f(x) = a × x/b + x. C, demonstration of the catalytic competence of the chromophoric adduct. The chromophoric adduct was first reconstituted as described in A and represents time = 0. dl-G3P (0.4 mm) was then added, and the spectra were recorded at 3-, 9-, 15-, 25-, 40-, and 60-min intervals. A decrease in the absorbance at 315 nm concomitant with an increase in the absorbance at 414 nm due to the formation of PLP is evident. The inset demonstrates that chromophore formation (black circles) precedes PLP formation (gray circles). The molar concentrations of adduct (ε315 = 16,200 m–1cm–1) and PLP (ε415 = 5380 m–1cm–1) are plotted as a function of time. Note that following reconstitution of the adduct, dialysis was performed to remove excess R5P and glutamine, and dl-G3P (0.4 μm) was added (indicated by an arrow). The reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate of chromophore formation is a function of the concentration of ribose 5-phosphate (Fig. 2B) from which an apparent Km (126 ± 27 μm) could be estimated. The intriguing possibility that the species observed may be a reaction intermediate of PLP formation prompted us to test its catalytic competence. Indeed, the addition of a stoichiometric amount of G3P resulted in formation of the reaction product, PLP (absorbance maximum at 414 nm) with a clear isosbestic point at 348 nm (Fig. 2C). The involvement of the supposed active site residues, Asp-24 and Lys-149 (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Zhu J. Burgner J.W. Harms E. Belitsky B.R. Smith J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27914-27923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in formation of the chromophore could be confirmed by the inability of the mutants, D24A and K149A, to support its formation (data not shown). The Site of Covalent Adduct Formation Is Lysine 81 of Pdx1—It was recently postulated that one of the early steps in PLP biosynthesis is the formation of an imine adduct between Lys-149 of Pdx1 and its pent(ul)ose substrate (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As we suspected that formation of the imine precedes formation of the chromophore, we sought to confirm its localization. In contrast to the chromophoric adduct, the imine can be fully reconstituted simply by preincubation of Pdx1 with the pent(ul)ose substrate (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A tryptic digest of the fully reconstituted imine adduct was performed, and the resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, but peak suppression prevented identification of the modified peptide. It was, therefore, necessary to first partially reduce sample complexity by isolating the peptide from the complete protein digest. For this, we employed [U-14C]R5P to reconstitute the imine followed by tryptic digestion and RP-HPLC as described above, permitting us to identify the fraction containing the modified peptide (Fig. 3A). Repetition of this experiment using either natural abundance material or [U-13C]R5P followed by comparative MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the analogous fraction revealed peptides with masses of 2686.246 and 2691.261 Da, corresponding to the 12C- and 13C-labeled species, respectively (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, tandem mass spectrometry of these peptides yielded spectra that matched the predicted fragmentation pattern of the peptide, MADPTIVEEVMNAVSIPVMAKAR (Fig. 3C), corresponding to residues 61–83, with the pentulose phosphate imine adduct residing at Lys-81 (12C predicted mass, 2686.286). An overlay of the unlabeled and labeled spectra substantiates incorporation of the label at Lys-81 (data not shown). This implied that the imine adduct in Pdx1 occurs at Lys-81 rather than Lys-149 as reported previously (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To corroborate the finding further, we attempted reconstitution of the imine adduct with the K81R/K81A and K149R/K149A mutants of Pdx1. ESI-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that K149A could not form the imine adduct (as has been shown previously (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)), nor could K81A or K81R. However, K149R retains the ability to form the imine (Fig. 4). Furthermore, formation of the chromophoric adduct could be observed with K149R (albeit at a rate 12 times lower than that of the wild type, kcat = 0.020 and 0.240 min–1 for K149R and wild type, respectively), whereas no activity could be detected for K81R. The difference in rate was mainly manifested in the kcat as the Km of K149R was close to that of the wild type (185 ± 26 and 126 ± 27 μm for K149R and wild type, respectively). However, we were unable to detect formation of PLP with K149R (data not shown). R5P Is the Preferential C5 Substrate of PLP Synthase—During the imine adduct reconstitution experiments, we noted a preference for R5P as a substrate when compared with Ru5P (Fig. 5A). This was already reflected in previous analyses where initial rates of PLP formation were substantially higher with R5P as the C5 sugar (11Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Raschle T. Amrhein N. Fitzpatrick T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32291-32300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, in these analyses, a fraction of the isolated protein would have the C5 sugar incorporated, thus interfering with an accurate comparison of the efficiency of the C5 sugars in PLP synthesis. To provide a more precise assessment of PLP synthesis, we isolated free Pdx1 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and reassessed PLP formation. Under these conditions, kcat values for R5P and Ru5P were very similar (0.040 and 0.042 min–1), whereas there was a 60-fold difference in the Km values (0.053 and 3.18 mm, respectively) (Fig. 5B). The preferential binding of R5P was also reflected in studies in which a mixture of [U-14C]Ru5P and [U-14C]R5P was synthesized from [U-14C]glucose as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation of Pdx1 with this mixture, the reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to detect co-migration of the label with Pdx1 (Fig. 5C). Indeed, a signal could be detected (Fig. 5C). However, if phosphoriboisomerase was omitted from the reaction mixture, thus resulting in formation of [U-14C]Ru5P predominantly, no such signal could be detected (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we observed that Pdx2 was not required for pentose binding to Pdx1, indicating that the sugar can bind to Pdx1 alone. Characterization of the Chromophoric Adduct—We employed RP-HPLC to assess the feasibility of separating the imine and chromophoric adduct, respectively, from the unmodified Pdx1 protein to further aid in their characterization. In the first instance, we selected a sample of isolated Pdx1 in which the chromophore could no longer be observed. This sample yielded two clearly resolvable peaks, annotated a and b (Fig. 6A, Sample 1). ESI-mass spectrometry of these two peak fractions revealed masses of 33049.0 and 32835.0 Da, corresponding to the pent(ul)ose phosphate imine (predicted mass difference 212 Da) and free protein, respectively (Table 1). Confirmation of the imine adduct was substantiated by RP-HPLC analysis of the reconstituted imine for which an expected increase in species a and a concomitant decrease in species b was observed (Fig. 6A, Sample 2). Moreover, the presence of a phosphate group in species a could be corroborated employing a phosphospecific stain (Fig. 6B). The marker protein, egg ovalbumin (45 kDa, contains two phosphate groups) and alkaline phosphatase-treated Pdx1 acted as controls.TABLE 1Molecular mass of observed species Pdx1SpeciesPredicted massObserved massObserved mass — observed mass of baDifference in mass observed when compared with that of the free-protein (species b).DaDaa33046.833047.0212.1b32834.832834.9c32929.832930.295.3a Difference in mass observed when compared with that of the free-protein (species b). Open table in a new tab Upon treatment of reconstituted a with ammonium salt and subjection to RP-HPLC as described for the imine adduct, three resolvable peaks, a, b, and c, were obtained. Notably, only the newly observed species c had an absorbance corresponding to that of the chromophore (Fig. 6A, Sample 3). ESI-mass spectrometry confirmed that species a and b correspond to the pent(ul)ose phosphate imine and free protein, respectively. Species c (observed mass 32,930 Da) on the other hand has an additional mass of 95 Da when compared with the native protein. Tryptic digestion followed by separation of the resulting peptides in a fashion analogous to that described above for the imine adduct localized the chromophoric adduct to Lys-81 in Pdx1 (data not shown). In addition, mass spectrometric comparison of the relevant natural abundance and U-13C-labeled peptide revealed that the adduct had retained all five carbon atoms from the pentose sugar. Furthermore, reconstitution of the chromophore employing 14N- and 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate in place of Pdx2 and glutamine indicated that nitrogen was not incorporated into the chromophore (data not shown). Additionally, we observed that species c did not stain positive for a phosphate group (Fig. 6B). In agreement with this, an enzyme assay confirmed that inorganic phosphate was released in an amount stoichiometric with the protein concentration (Fig. 6C) and that its formation is concomitant with the formation of the chromophore (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2093278374,"Mammalian eIF3 is a 700-kDa multiprotein complex essential for initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It consists of 13 subunits (eIF3a to -m), among which eIF3b serves as a major scaffolding protein. Here we report the solution structure of the N-terminal RNA recognition motif of human eIF3b (eIF3b-RRM) determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals a noncanonical RRM with a negatively charged surface in the beta-sheet area contradictory with potential RNA binding activity. Instead, eIF3j, which is required for stable 40 S ribosome binding of the eIF3 complex, specifically binds to the rear alpha-helices of the eIF3b-RRM, opposite to its beta-sheet surface. Moreover, we identify that an N-terminal 69-amino acid peptide of eIF3j is sufficient for binding to eIF3b-RRM and that this interaction is essential for eIF3b-RRM recruitment to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Our results provide the first structure of an important subdomain of a core eIF3 subunit and detailed insights into protein-protein interactions between two eIF3 subunits required for stable eIF3 recruitment to the 40 S subunit."

The crystal structure revealed that the SH3 domain binds intramolecularly to the DH domain, thus blocking the Rac-binding site. Furthermore, the RT-loop and the C-terminal region of the SH3 domain interact with the DH domain in a manner completely different from those for the canonical binding to a polyproline-peptide motif. These results demonstrate that the blocking of the Rac-binding site by the SH3 domain is essential for Asef autoinhibition.

The Rho family GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, participate in actin cytoskeletal network reorganization, thus resulting in cell migration and cell-cell adhesion (1.Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev.

The DH domain is followed by the PH domain, and a number of DH-PH fragment structures have been reported (2.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). The Asef protein contains the DH and PH domains (Fig. 1a) and exhibits a Rac-specific GEF activity when it is bound to the armadillo repeat of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) with a mutation (Asef stands for APC-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor) (3.Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Asef protein bound with the mutated APC is involved in the migration of colorectal tumor cells (4.Kawasaki Y. Sato R. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Asef includes the APC-binding region (ABR) (Fig. 1a), which is presumably a flexible peptide segment. In contrast, Asef by itself showed very weak GEF activity (3.Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a mutant form of Asef, lacking the N-terminal region, displayed GEF activity as strong as that of the APC-stimulated, full-length Asef. Therefore, the N-terminal region “autoinhibits” the DH domain of Asef in isolation, but the molecular mechanism of the autoinhibition has been elusive. A Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain resides between the ABR and the DH domain (Fig. 1a). Protein Expression and Purification−Selenomethionine-labeled Asef (residues 66–540) with an N-terminal histidine tag was expressed in the cell-free expression system (5.Kigawa T. Yamaguchi-Nunokawa E. Kodama K. Matsuda T. Yabuki T. Matsuda N. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2002; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by chromatography on a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and was subjected to tobacco etch virus protease digestion. The Asef protein was subsequently purified by MonoQ and Superdex75 gel filtration chromatography steps (GE Healthcare). The protein was concentrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 9.3 mg ml–1. Decomposition of the sample was detected after a few months, and therefore, to monitor the hydrolysis of the sample during crystallization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was conducted for the crystallized samples. The spectrum indicated that the sample was intact (residues 66–540). Crystallization and Structure Determination−Crystals of Asef were grown in 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m HEPES-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals belong to the space group C2, with unit cell dimensions a = 100.93 Å, b = 79.82 Å, c = 68.00 Å, and β = 123.6°. Three sets of x-ray diffraction data at different wavelengths (peak, 0.9789 Å; edge, 0.9794 Å; and high remote, 0.964 Å) were collected at beamline BL44B2 of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) with an ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector under cryogenic conditions with Paratone-N. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 program package (6.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Asef was determined by the multiple anomalous dispersion method at 2.36 Å resolution using SOLVE (7.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final model was assessed by PROCHECK in the CCP4 suite (11.Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot revealed that 90.4% of the residues are in the most favored regions, with 9.6% in the additionally allowed regions. The current model yielded Rwork and Rfree values of 0.232 and 0.299, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplemental Table 1. The ribbon and molecular surface models in the figures were depicted by PyMol. 4W. L. DeLano, personal communication. Molecular Dynamics Calculations−The x-ray structure of Asef was used as the initial structure for the SH3(+) simulation (residues 114–540) and for the SH3(–) simulations (residues 185–540). All initial structures were fully solvated by the spherical water of the TIP3P water molecules (13.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29474) Google Scholar), and each solvated system underwent energy minimization before the production molecular dynamics (MD) run. During the simulations, the water molecules were restrained by a soft harmonic potential (with 1.5 kcal mol–1 Å–2) to keep them associated with the protein. All MD simulations were carried out with the Amber 8.0 5D. A. Case, T. A. Darden, T. E. I. Cheatham, C. L. Simmerling, J. Wang, R. E. Duke, R. Luo, K. M. Merz, B. Wang, D. A. Pearlman, M. Crowley, S.

Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3472) Google Scholar) was adopted, and the time step was set to 2.0 fs. All non-bonded interactions were calculated accurately using the MDGRAPE-3 board. All bond lengths were constrained to equilibrium lengths by the SHAKE method (18.Ryckeart J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 23: 327-431Google Scholar). The temperature of each system was gradually heated at a rate of 6 K/ps and was kept constant by coupling to a temperature bath at 300 K, with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps (19.Berendsen H.J.C.

Cell Culture and Transfection and Antibodies−COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The rat monoclonal antibody against the HA tag (3F10) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics, and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the Myc tag (9E10) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoblotting−Cell lysates in Laemmli’s SDS sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Immobilon P; Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG or rat IgG (Promega) as a second antibody. Rac Activity Assay−To determine the cellular activation state of Rac, transfected cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NaCl, and 2% IGEPAL. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 20 μg of bacterially produced GST·PAK·CRIB fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads and the proteins bound to the fusion protein were washed three times with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 30 mm MgCl2 and 40 mm NaCl, and then the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before the immunoblotting analysis. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of Asef, consisting of the ABR and the SH3, DH, and PH domains (Fig. 1b). The present Asef structure reveals how the DH and PH domains interact with the SH3 domain (Fig. 1b). The SH3 domain of Asef adopts the typical fold of SH3 domains, with five antiparallel β-strands packed to form two perpendicular β-sheets and one turn of a 310 helix with the conserved Pro-173. The region connecting the SH3 and DH domains is disordered. The DH domain is composed of elongated helical bundles with six major helical segments (α1–α6) (Fig. 1b). The DH and PH domains are connected in the conventional way, which is widely conserved in many structures of GEFs for Rho family GTPases (20.Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the Asef structure, the last α-helix (α6) of the DH domain, consisting of 37 amino acid residues, is longer than those of other DH domains. Furthermore, this helix is characteristically bent in an arched shape with a curvature radius of 55 Å. Consequently, the relative location of the DH and PH domains in the Asef structure is different from those in other GEF structures. The intramolecular interactions of the SH3 domain with the DH and PH domains in Asef are shown in Fig. 2a. The SH3 domain associates mainly with the DH domain, with a contacting surface area of 350 Å2. The RT-loop (the loop between the first and second β-strands) and the C-terminal part of the SH3 domain are involved in the interactions. The main chain of the RT-loop parallels the α6 helix, with many hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 2b). In the Asef structure, the interdomain interaction surface of the SH3 domain is perpendicular to its polyproline peptide (PXXP)-binding groove and thus blocks one end of the groove. Trp-132, Trp-160, and Phe-176 of the Asef SH3 domain correspond to the three aromatic residues involved in the canonical PXXP binding. Trp-132 interacts with the α6 helix, whereas the other two are exposed to the solvent region. In the crystal structure of the p53·53BP2 complex (21.Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), the PXXP-binding groove and some other residues in the RT-loop of the SH3 domain of 53BP2 interact with a non-PXXP peptide of the p53 L3 loop. The intermolecular interaction surface of the 53BP2 SH3 domain (Supplemental Fig. 1a) is different from the intradomain interaction surface of the Asef SH3 domain (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, recent NMR studies revealed the binding surfaces of the p67phox, Pex13P, and Kalirin SH3 domains for non-PXXP motifs (22.Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4268-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23.Schiller M.R. Chakrabarti K. King G.F. Schiller N.I. Eipper B.A. Maciejewski M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18774-18786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Fig. 1a). These non-PXXP-binding surfaces are located on a different side than the PXXP-binding groove and partially overlap each other (Supplemental Fig. 1, a and b). Therefore, the interdomain interaction surface of the Asef SH3 domain is unique. The DH and PH domains constitute a unit responsible for the guanine nucleotide exchange activity in Dbl family proteins. Asef is a Rac-specific GEF (3.Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The common Rho family GTPase-binding site has been identified on the DH domain in the structures of DH-PH units complexed with RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac (20.Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L.

Biol. 2006; 359: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present Asef structure, the Rac-binding site of the DH domain is occupied by the SH3 domain (Supplemental Fig. 2). Therefore, the present Asef structure represents the autoinhibited form, with respect to the GEF activity for Rac. We created a model structure by superimposing the DH domain of Asef on that in the Rac·Tiam1 complex (27.Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The model revealed that the α6 helix of the Asef DH domain causes steric hindrances with the switch 2 region and the helix α3b C-terminal region of Rac. Thus, we speculated that the α6 helix may assume a straight form, as in the other DH-PH structures, if the association between the DH and SH3 domains is disrupted. An MD calculation was carried out for the DH-PH part of Asef in the absence of the SH3 domain, and the α6 helix was stretched after 2 ns of calculations (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the Asef SH3 domain competes with Rac for the binding site on the Asef DH domain, and Rac becomes able to interact with the binding site after the release of the SH3 domain. In the absence of the mutated APC, the SH3 domain should still occupy the Rac-binding site, and therefore, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Asef is autoinhibited (Supplemental Fig. 3). To test this autoinhibition mechanism involving the interaction between the SH3 and DH domains, several Asef mutants were prepared with respect to Trp-132, Asp-133, and Arg-178 of the SH3 domain and Glu-365 of the DH domain. Trp-132 makes a cation-π interaction with Lys-398 (DH), and Asp-133 forms hydrogen bonds with Asn-295 (DH) (Fig. 2b, upper right). Glu-365 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg-178, Val-181, and Asn-182 of the SH3 domain (Fig. 2b, lower right). The amounts of the GTP-bound Rac1 were analyzed for COS-7 cells expressing the mutants, in comparison with the wild-type Asef protein and its truncated form (residues 66–540), the structure of which was determined in this study (Fig. 2, b and c). The amount of the GTP-bound Rac1 in COS-7 cells was increased significantly by the expression of the full-length Asef protein with the R178A, E365A, W132L/D133A, or D133A/E365A mutation but only negligibly by the expression of the wild-type, full-length Asef protein or the truncated form (Fig. 2c). These results confirmed that the SH3-DH interactions found in the present Asef structure are important for the autoinhibition of the GEF activity of Asef in cells. As the effects of the R178A and E365A mutations are slightly greater than that of the D133A/W132L mutation (Fig. 2c), the hydrogen-bonding network involving Arg-178 and Glu-365 (Fig. 2b, lower right) is more important than the other interactions (upper right) for the autoinhibition. Therefore, the SH3 domain plays the crucial role in autoinhibiting the Rac1 GEF activity of the DH domain in Asef. In proteins with the DH and PH domains following the SH3 domain(s), such as mouse/human collybistin I (14.Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1624-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the GEF activity is negatively regulated by the SH3 domain. Intriguingly, a mutant intersectin-1, with the proximal SH3 domain mutated so as to abolish the PXXP binding ability, revealed that the PXXP-binding groove is not involved in inhibiting the GEF activity. These findings are consistent with our Asef structure, thus suggesting that the structural mechanism of the intramolecular GEF inhibition by the SH3 domain is conserved in these proteins. We thank Y.

Transcriptional repressors are widely believed to regulate this process, yet the exact factors involved and the mechanism of repression are not known. Here, we report that the POU domain transcription factor Oct-1 represses the expression of E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), two cytokine-inducible, NF-κB-dependent endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules that participate in the leukocyte recruitment phase of the inflammatory response. Co-transfection and microinjection studies demonstrate that Oct-1 blocks tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression. Gene expression arrays indicate that control of tumor necrosis factor α-induced, NF-κB-dependent gene expression by Oct-1 is promoter-specific. A DNA-binding mutant of Oct-1 represses NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. Biochemically, Oct-1 interacts with p65, suggesting that Oct-1 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB transactivation function. NF-κB-dependent gene expression is more pronounced in Oct-1-deficient than in wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts, and reintroduction of human Oct-1 abolishes these differences. Finally, the cytokine interleukin-6 induces Oct-1 gene expression, providing a biologically relevant means by which NF-κB-dependent gene expression can be selectively reverted by Oct-1 to quiescent levels.

At sites of vascular dysfunction, multiple signaling pathways are activated that can modulate gene expression. Rapid and transient induction of a select set of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), 6The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IL, interleukin; SMC, smooth muscle cell; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. is followed by the expression of a tissue-specific group of target genes. For NF-κB, these genes include the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules (E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1), proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and survival factors (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Collectively, these products activate the vascular cells, resulting in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes, and stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, ultimately causing pathology in the vessel wall. The NF-κB/Rel family of proteins consist of homo- or heterodimers (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Subunits of NF-κB include NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52, p49, and p50B), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel. NF-κB subunits share a Rel homology domain, which is a 300-amino acid N-terminal region that mediates several key functions, including dimerization, DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and binding of inhibitors. The C-terminal region of most subunits contains a transactivation domain, responsible for the recruitment of coactivators. In quiescent cells, NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm, where it is retained through association with an inhibitor (IκB), such as IκBα.IκBs bind preferentially to different NF-κB dimers and sterically hinder recognition of the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB subunits. Diverse stimuli can activate NF-κB, through phosphorylation and activation of the IκB kinase complex (3Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 4Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Karin M. J.

Activated IκB kinases phosphorylate IκBs, leading to the polyubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor by the 26 S proteasome. NF-κB dimers are transported to the nucleus, where they transactivate gene expression through interactions with other transcription factors and coactivators (6Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S.

In this state, endothelial cells do not proliferate and have antithrombotic, vasodilator, and growth-inhibiting effects on the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall. It is widely believed that repressors of gene transcription are important for maintaining vascular cells in the quiescent state. In the case of NF-κB activity, self-induction and expression of the inhibitor IκBα contributes to its autoregulation (10Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Similarly, other transcription factors, such as Egr-1 and NFAT, are autoregulated by the NABs (11Kumbrink J. Gerlinger M. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42785-42793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR-1 or calcipressin 1) gene products (12Minami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Abid M.R. Takabe W. Noguchi N. Kohro T. Ge X. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50537-50554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), respectively. Members of the POU domain family of transcription factors interact specifically with octamer motifs and can act constitutively or in response to signaling events to either activate or repress expression of specific genes. Octamer sites are found in the promoters of a series of genes that are important in immune responses (e.g. Ig, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-4), as well as genes that play a role in development (13Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 14Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Oct-1 is a prototypical member of the POU domain family, and one of its functions is to activate S phase-specific expression of the histone H2b gene (15Fletcher C. Heintz N. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Additionally, Oct-1 can interact with nuclear hormone receptors, such as retinoid X receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor, and influence their transcriptional activity (16Kakizawa T. Miyamoto T. Ichikawa K. Kaneko A. Suzuki S. Hara M. Nagasawa T. Takeda T. Mori J. Kumagai M. Hashizume K. J. Biol.

Oct-1 can also repress expression of certain genes, including the von Willebrand factor promoter (18Schwachtgen J.L. Remacle J.E. Janel N. Brys R. Huylebroeck D. Meyer D. Kerbiriou-Nabias D. Blood. 1998; 92: 1247-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prolactin gene promoter (19Subramaniam N. Cairns W. Okret S. J. Biol.

Although the mechanism of repression by Oct is not well established, recent studies suggest that it can interact with SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) (17Kakizawa T.

Oct-2 is preferentially expressed in B lymphocytes and interacts with the octamer site found in the promoters of immunoglobulin genes. Oct-1 and Oct-2 recruit a B-cell-specific coactivator, designated OBF-1 (or OCA-B or Bob-1), providing an example of cell type-specific gene expression in which the critical component is a coactivator, rather than a DNA-binding protein (20Matthias P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activity of another founding member of the POU family, Pit-1, is determined by a regulated balance between a co-repressor complex that contains nuclear receptor co-repressor and histone deacetylases and a co-activator complex that contains CREB-binding protein and p/CAF (21Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In response to specific signals, Pit-1 recruits the co-activator complex and displaces the repressor complex, stimulating Pit-1 function (22Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Oct-1 represses the expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1, two cytokine-inducible, endothelialleukocyte adhesion molecules that mediate leukocyte recruitment during an inflammatory response. The observation that Oct-1 is a powerful repressor of two distinct NF-κB-dependent genes raises the possibility that this octamer-binding protein may have a more general role in the regulation of κB-dependent gene expression and in the subsequent production of inflammatory mediators.

Cells from passage four were used for the microinjection studies. In these experiments, cells were treated with TNFα for 2 h after microinjection of cells. Rat-1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 2 mm GlutaMax (Invitrogen), 500 nm methotrexate (Sigma), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific).

Single Cell Nuclear Microinjection Assays—HUVECs were seeded at subconfluent density on acid-washed glass coverslips that were pretreated with 0.1% gelatin and were grown in endothelial growth medium. Expression plasmids encoding the appropriate genes were injected at 100 μg/ml. Cells were coinjected with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran to unambiguously identify them by immunofluorescence microscopy. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with the appropriate cytokine, fixed, immunostained to detect E-selectin expression, and mounted using gelvitol that contains 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Rat-1 fibroblasts were seeded on acid-washed glass coverslips at subconfluent density and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mm GlutaMax, 500 nm methotrexate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Before injection, cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 16-24 h. Each experiment was performed on three independent coverslips with >300 injected cells. RNA Isolation, RT-PCR Analysis, and RNA Profiling—Total RNA was isolated using either the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), RNAqueous-Micro (Ambion), or RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to each manufacturer’s protocol. First strand cDNA synthesis from total RNA template and PCR amplification of the resulting cDNA were combined in a single tube reaction using the ProSTAR HF Single-Tube RT-PCR system (Stratagene). In short, 1 μl (40 ng) of total RNA was added into each RT-PCR reaction mix containing RNase-free water, 1× HF RT-PCR buffer, 0.8 mm dNTP (0.2 mm each), and 100 ng of each primer. StrataScript reverse transcriptase (1.25 units/sample) and TaqPlus Precision DNA polymerase (2.5 units/sample) were added together prior to thermal cycling. 40 cycles of amplification were typically performed. For analysis, 25 μl of each PCR product was loaded on a 1% agarose gel. The primers used to amplify human E-selectin, VCAM-1, Oct-1, and GAPDH were designed as follows: E-selectin (forward), 5′-GTGAAGCTGTGAGATGCGATG-3′; E-selectin (reverse), 5′-TTACCACTTGGCAGGAAGGAA-3′; VCAM-1 (forward), 5′-CTGGAGGATGCAGACAGGAAG-3′; VCAM-1 (reverse), 5′-TGGAACAGGTCATGGTCACAG-3′; Oct-1 (forward), 5′-GAAGCCTTGAACCTCAGCTTT-3′; Oct-1 (reverse), 5′-TCTCTATGCTGGTGCGTTTCT-3′; GAPDH (forward), 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA-3′; GAPDH (reverse), 5′-TTCCATTGATGACAAGCTTCC-3′. The primers were custom ordered from either GenBase, Inc. or Integrated DNA Technologies. RNA profiling of HUVECs or MEFs was performed using the GEArray Q Series Human or Mouse NF-κB Signaling Pathway Gene Array (SuperArray Bioscience) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis of gene expression array data was done using the GEArray Expression Analysis Suite software (SuperArray Bioscience). GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion constructs containing various fragments of p65 and Oct-1 were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into the pGEX-2TA vector (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequence analysis verified the authenticity of the fusions. GST forms were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In preliminary SDS-PAGE studies, each of the fusion proteins was verified to be appropriate in molecular weight and expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3, A and B). 5 μg of the fusion protein was incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled protein, generated by in vitro transcription/translation, as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm potassium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm magnesium chloride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed and collected in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline/phosphatase inhibitors. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Nuclear fraction samples were centrifuged briefly and precleared with preimmune IgG and protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min. Precleared extracts were then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1-2 μg of each specified antibody. 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated with the samples for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-Oct-1 IgG for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times with TBST buffer, incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and then washed three times with TBST. The antigen-antibody interactions were visualized by incubation with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Blots were exposed to x-ray film for 5 s to 5 min. siRNA Knockdown—Target sequence for the Oct-1 siRNA oligonucleotide was designed by using the Dharmacon siDESIGN Center Web site. The sequence used was 5′-NNCUCGCUGGAACAAGUUUAC-3′. The oligonucleotide had been 2′-deprotected, duplexed, and desalted by the manufacturer. Sterile RNase-free water was then added to give a final concentration of 20 μm in 1× universal buffer. siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA pool obtained from Dharmacon was used as a control for non-sequence-specific effects. For microinjection studies, siRNA duplexes were diluted to a final concentration of 50 nm in microinjection buffer (5 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl). After 24 h, total RNA was isolated from the microinjected cells, and RT-PCR analysis was performed. Oct-1 Represses E-selectin and VCAM-1 Promoter-Reporter Gene Expression—Sequence inspection of the E-selectin promoter reveals potential octamer motifs that could bind members of the POU domain family of transcription factors. To determine whether Oct-1, which is ubiquitously expressed, or Oct-2, a tissue-specific member of the POU family, affects cytokine-induced E-selectin or VCAM-1 expression, we performed single cell nuclear microinjection assays using either an E-selectin (Fig. 1A) or VCAM-1 promoter/lacZ reporter construct (data not shown) in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Fibroblasts that were injected individually with each reporter plasmid showed minimal expression levels without cytokine stimulation. Treatment of the cells subsequent to injection for 2 h with TNFα induced expression severalfold. This activation was blocked by co-injection of an expression plasmid for Oct-1, but parallel injections with an Oct-2 expression plasmid did not inhibit activation (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when quiescent cells were co-injected with an expression construct for p65. Co-injection of Oct-1, as opposed to Oct-2, decreased the activities of both reporter genes close to quiescent levels. Similar findings were obtained when transient transfection studies were performed using an E-selectin promoter-CAT construct in COS-7 cells. As expected, overexpression of the NF-κB component p65 augmented the expression of the E-selectin promoter-reporter gene (data not shown). By comparison, overexpression of Oct-1 caused a decreased expression of p65-stimulated E-selectin reporter gene expression, and this decrease was clearly dose-responsive. Oct-1 appears to be as effective in decreasing expression from this promoter as p50, which, as a homodimer, is known to be associated with transcriptional repression (31Read M.A. Neish A.S. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3472-3479PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, increasing amounts of Oct-2 had no measurable effect on p65-induced E-selectin reporter gene expression. We also examined the effects of Oct-1 and Oct-2 overexpression on the expression of several NF-κB-independent genes to demonstrate that this repression caused by Oct-1 is specific and not merely an artifact of overexpression. Using microinjection, we introduced the prostate-specific antigen, pS2 (estrogen-responsive protein), or retinoic acid receptor β promoter-reporter genes into fibroblasts and compared their expression levels with or without their respective agonists as well as together with either Oct-1 or Oct-2. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-injection of neither the Oct-1 nor the Oct-2 expression plasmid together with each of the aforementioned reporter genes resulted in any significant decreases in ligand-induced gene expression. Altogether, these findings suggest that Oct-1 selectively represses the transcription of both the E-selectin and VCAM-1 promoter-reporter genes. Oct-1 Represses Authentic E-selectin and VCAM-1 Gene Expression in Cytokine-activated Endothelial Cells—To determine whether this apparent repression by Oct-1 occurs in vivo on endogenous promoters in a true chromatin environment, we developed a single cell nuclear microinjection assay for monitoring E-selectin expression in primary cultures of HUVECs. Briefly, HUVECs were microinjected with either the Oct-1 or Oct-2 expression vector, and after overnight incubation, the cells were treated with recombinant human TNFα to induce the expression of E-selectin. Positive E-selectin expression in HUVECs was identified by the presence of intense perinuclear staining after detection with a monospecific antibody (Fig. 1C, bottom left versus top left). Microinjection of the expression vector for Oct-1 (Fig. 1C, top right), but not Oct-2 (Fig. 1C, bottom right), caused a dramatic suppression of TNFα-activated E-selectin expression in HUVECs, which is reflected in the fluorescence images as a loss of perinuclear staining. These findings are quantitatively summarized in the underlying bar graph as the percentage of microinjected cells that exhibited E-selectin protein expression. In control studies, Oct-1 overexpression had no effect on the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules that are not affected by cytokine activation, such as PECAM-1 (data not shown). As an independent approach to examine endogenous E-selectin and VCAM-1 gene expression without the use of specific antibodies, we microinjected a small population of HUVECs and analyzed their cDNA levels by RT-PCR using custom designed primers to both the human E-selectin and VCAM-1 genes. Custom primers to the human GAPDH gene were used to verify equal cDNA inputs. The results showed that E-selectin and VCAM-1 gene expression increases with TNFα treatment (Fig. 1D, left) and is significantly blocked in both instances by Oct-1 (Fig. 1D, middle). In contrast, Oct-2 overexpression (Fig. 1D, right) had no apparent effect on the TNFα-induced expression of either E-selectin or VCAM-1. Repression of NF-κB-dependent Gene Expression by Oct-1 Is Promoter-specific—The observation that Oct-1 specifically represses the expression of two cytokine-inducible NF-κB target genes that belong to two distinct families of adhesion molecules raises the possibility that this octamer-binding transcription factor could have a more general role in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. To determine whether Oct-1 generally affects the expression of genes related to NF-κB signaling, we performed gene expression array studies using RNA extracted from a small population of HUVECs that were either uninjected or injected individually with Oct-1 or Oct-2 expression plasmids. As expected, treatment of endothelial cells with TNFα caused certain genes, including E-selectin, to be expressed at levels significantly higher than in quiescent cells (Table 1). More importantly, Oct-1 but not Oct-2 (data not shown), caused a significant down-regulation of some of these activated genes. The fact that only a subset of the genes induced by TNFα were negatively affected by Oct-1 overexpression implies that Oct-1-mediated repression is promoter-specific.TABLE 1Selective Oct-1 suppression of genes induced in HUVEC in response to TNFα treatmentGene symbolDescriptionInductionOct-1 suppressionATF2Activating transcription factor 2++ELK1ETS family member++ELK3ETS family member (SRF accessory protein 2)+−NFKB1p105++NFRKBNuclear factor related to kB binding protein+−RELc-Rel++RELAp65+−SAA1Serum amyloid A1+−SELEE-selectin++TLR4Toll-like receptor 4+−TNFAIP3A20++ Open table in a new tab Repression by Oct-1 Is Not Dependent on DNA Binding—Collectively, the results from the previously described experiments demonstrate that Oct-1 inhibits the cytokine-induced expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 but provide little insight into the mechanism.

We show by quantitative yeast two-hybrid, BIAcore, NMR HSQC and STD, and confocal analyses that amino acids phenylalanine (Phe454) and lysine (Lys456) are key residues that interact with actin orchestrating the cytoskeletal reorganization.

Despite its proposed function as a cell-cell adhesion molecule, CEACAM1 is often found on the lumenal surface of epithelial cells, suggesting the possibility that it also plays a role in cell polarization and lumen formation. In this respect, we have recently shown that CEACAM1 is expressed on the lumenal surface of normal mammary epithelial cells (14Huang J. Simpson J.F. Glackin C. Riethorf L. Wagener C. Shively J.E. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3203-3212PubMed Google Scholar), and that in a three-dimensional model of mammary morphogenesis, blocking its expression with either an antisense gene or anti-CEACAM1 antibodies blocks lumen formation (15Huang J.

CEACAM1 gene expression has been shown to be down-regulated early in colon cancer (12Neumaier M. Paululat S. Chan A. Matthaes P. Wagener C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although CEACAM1 is expressed in multiple isoforms with 1-4 Ig-like ectodomains and either long (72 amino acids) or short (12-14 amino acids) cytoplasmic domains, the short cytoplasmic domain isoforms predominate in epithelial cells. Because the cytoplasmic domain of this isoform is only 12-14 amino acids in length (the exact start of the domain is in doubt) it was originally thought not to play a role in signal transduction, but perhaps acted in a dominant negative fashion in the presence of the long cytoplasmic domain. However, we have shown that peptides or glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins from the short cytoplasmic domain bind directly to actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, and more recently, to the annexin-2 p11 tetramer AIIt (21Schumann D.

The results of our studies show that mutants F454A and K456A greatly decrease or increase, respectively, actin interactions, whereas the F454A and the double mutant T457A,S459A greatly reduce lumen formation. Further analysis reveals that either Thr457 or Ser459 are phosphorylated during lumen formation. The studies that identified these key residues are the subject of this report.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Baits for Yeast Two-hybrid ScreeningThe nucleotide and amino acid sequence for CEACAM1-4S is taken from NCBI entry number NM_001712, gi:4502404, the full-length coding sequence including the N-terminal signal sequence. To construct the bait containing the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S (amino acids 451-464), pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S-cyt for yeast two-hybrid screening, an EcoRI site was introduced in front of Phe451 (nucleotide 1352) of CEACAM1-4S by site-directed mutagenesis, using a set of primers, 5′-GCAGTAGCCCTGGAATTCTTTCTGCATTTCG-3′/5′-CGAAATGCAGAAAGAATTCCAGGGCTACTGC-3′, and KS/CEACAM1-4S as template. The plasmid DNA was digested by EcoRI and PstI (located at 3′-untranslated region CEACAM1-4S cDNA). The resulting fragments were then subcloned into the pGKT7 (Clontech) between the EcoRI and PstI sites to create pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S-cyt. All PCR were performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S-cyt MutantsA series of single and dual alanine mutants of CEACAM1-4S-cyt were created by sequence overlap extension PCR. The Matchmaker 5′ DNA-BD vector insert screening sense amplimer was: 5′-TCATCGGAAGAGAGTAGTAAC-3′, and Matchmaker 3′ DNA-BD vector insert screening antisense amplimer was: 3′-GAGTCACTTTAAAATTTGTATAC-5′. For each mutant, a set of inside primers were synthesized (supplementary Table 1S). The pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S plasmid served as the template. In the first PCR run, the inside antisense primer was used with the external sense primer and the inside sense primer was used with external sense primer to create two overlapping fragments. Both of these fragments served as templates to produce the larger fragment using the external primer set. The resulting products were digested with EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into pGKT7 previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. The pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S-cyt was also mutated to create pGKT7/CEACAM1-4S-cyt-DD by site-directed mutagenesis using a set of primers (supplementary Table 1S). The amino acids mutated were T457D,S459D, which mimic phosphorylation at these two sites.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and AnalysisThe Clontech human cDNA liver library used for screening contains 4 × 106 independent clones. The cytoplasmic domain from CEACAM1-4S (amino acids 451-464) was subcloned into pGKT7, transformed into yeast AH109 cells, and used as bait to screen the library. After mating, cells were plated on plates lacking Leu, Trp, His, and adenine (Ade). Colonies were replica plated onto a plate lacking Leu, Try, His, and Ade and printed onto a filter paper for β-galactosidase analysis using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate. Plasmid DNA of positive diploid clones were purified and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5. Transformants carrying the ACTII/prey were selected on LB/ampicillin plates. Plasmid DNA was purified and sequenced. The ACTII/prey plasmid DNA was transformed into yeast AH109 carrying the CEACAM1-4S-cyt bait construct or transformed into yeast Y187 for mating experiments. The co-transformants or mated cells were selected on plates lacking His and Trp. Colonies were picked and the supernatant of the overnight culture was used to assay for α-galactosidase. The cell mass was calculated by measuring the absorbance at A600 nm. The α-galactosidase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl-α-galactopyranoside as a substrate according to the Clontech manual, and normalized to the cell mass (A410/600 nm) for comparison.Mammalian Expression VectorsTo construct the mammalian expression vector pHβ-CEACAM1-4S-F454A, a single amino acid mutation (nucleotide 1360) was created by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, using KS/CEACAM1-4S as a template. KS/CEACAM1-4S-F454A was digested with SalI and HindIII and ligated into the pHβ-actin vector digested with SalI and HindIII. The β-actin promoter containing expression vector has been previously described (24Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar).pCDNA3/CEACAM1-4S-eGFPTo create a XmaI site for the insertion of eGFP into CEACAM1-4S, we first deleted the XmaI site located in the multicloning sites of the KS/CEACAM1-4S vector by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, using a set of primers: 5′-GAATTCCTGCAGCCTGGGGGATCCACTAG-3′/5′-CTAGTGGATCCCCCAGGCTGCAGGAATTC-3′. An XmaI site was introduced between Pro427 (nucleotide 1279) and Gly428 (nucleotide 1281) of CEACAM1-4S by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, using the set of primers: 5′-GAAAATGGCCTCTCACCCGGGGCCATTGCTGGCATTG-3′/5′-CAATGCCAGCAATGGCCCCGGGTGAGAGGCCATTTTC-3′. A full-length eGFP clone containing a XmaI cutting site and a G4 linker on both ends was amplified by PCR using PE-GFP-N2 (Clontech) as the template, a set of primers containing XmaI site and the G4 linker, 5′-TCCCCCCGGGGGAGGAGGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′/5′-TCCCCCCGGGTCCTCCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTC-3′, were used. The PCR product was digested with XmaI, the eGFP fragment was purified and subcloned into KS (XmaI-)/CEACAM1-4S (XmaI+) previously digested with XmaI to create the KS/CEACAM1-4S-eGFP vector. The CEACAM1-4S-eGFP fragment was cut out from KS/CEACAM1-4S-eGFP and subcloned into pCDNA3 previously digested by KpnI and EcoRI. In the resulting vector a G4 linker were introduced after Pro427 of CEACAM1-4S, and a PG3 linker was introduced before Gly428 of CEACAM1-4S.Mutations at Thr457 and Ser459 in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S were constructed according to the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). In short, mutations were introduced into CEACAM1-4S/pBlue-script II KS by PCR primers shown in supplementary Table 1S. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 1 min, 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 14 min. The parental (unmutated) strand was removed by DpnI digest. Mutants were sequenced and the selected clones were subcloned into the SalI and HindIII restriction sites of the pHβ-actin expression vector. Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and selected in 0.1-1.0 mg/ml G418 for 5 weeks to create stable CEACAM1-4S mutant cell lines. Geneticin-resistant cells were sorted for CEACAM1 expression, grown in a Matrigel sandwich assay, and scored for acinus formation. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher’s Exact test. For the Matrigel sandwich assay, 12-well plates were coated with 150 μl of Matrigel and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to let the Matrigel solidify. Cells (1 × 105) in 500 μl of mammary epithelial basal medium (MEBM) (Clonetics) plus pituitary gland extract (Cambrex) were added to each well. After 3 h of incubation the floating cells were removed and the bound cells were overlaid with 150 μl of 50% Matrigel (1:1, Matrgiel gel:MEBM plus pituitary gland extract and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml final)). Culture medium was changed every other day. After 6 days the Matrigel cultures were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde for histochemistry analysis.Cell Culture and Transfection of Jurkat, HeLa, and MCF7 CellsJurkat cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. MCF7 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were harvested and washed in Opti-MEM. An aliquot (800 μl) of cell suspension was mixed with 25 μg of DNA (in 20-30 μl) and transferred to an electroporation cuvette with a 0.4-cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad). Electroporation parameters used were 260 V, 900 microfarads, resulting in a pulse time of 20-23 ms. Stable transformants were selected with geneticin and selected clones were shown to have high levels of cell surface expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and confocal fluorescence analysis. Cells were grown in Matrigel as described above.Immunohistochemistry and Confocal MicroscopyImmunohistochemistry was performed according to Huang et al. (14Huang J. Simpson J.F. Glackin C. Riethorf L. Wagener C. Shively J.E. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3203-3212PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody 5F4 (kind gift from Dr. Richard Blumberg, Boston, MA). For immunofluorescence, Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) conjugated monoclonal antibody T84.1 (1 μg/ml) was used to detect CEACAM1. Staining was visualized on a Zeiss model 310 confocal microscope. The cellular distribution of CEACAM1-4S in stably transfected Jurkat cells was performed on cells plated on 6-well slides precoated with 20 ng/ml fibronectin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by treatment with nocodazole (Sigma) or cytochalasin B (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After a 30-min incubation, cells were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and incubated for 1 h with anti-CEACAM1 antibody T84.1 (1:500), followed by a 1-h incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). After washing three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were permeabilized in PSG (0.01% saponinin phosphate-buffered saline) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were stained for F-actin with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). For colocalization of CEACAM1-4S-eGFP with F-actin, Jurkat or MCF7 stable transfectants were grown in 6-well chamber slides in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS. In some experiments chamber slides were precoated with laminin 10/11 (Sigma), followed by fixation and permeabilization as described above. F-actin was stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. The slides were mounted in 80% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline and observed on a Zeiss confocal microscope using fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine filter settings to detect GFP and Texas Red-phalloidin, respectively.Peptide SynthesisSynthetic peptides corresponding to the 12 amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the CEACAM1 short cytoplasmic domain were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry with an N-terminal mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) extension by the City of Hope Peptide Synthesis Core. 15N-labeled Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs. MUA was purchased from Aldrich, and the mercapto group was protected by reaction with trityl chloride. The S-trityl derivative was purified by silica gel chromatography. Briefly, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (10 mmol, 2.18 g) was dissolved in dry pyridine (20 ml) and trityl chloride (11 mmol, 3.06 g) was added. The reaction mixture was left for 18 h, quenched with 20 ml of ethanol, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 150 ml of dichloromethane, cooled to 0 °C, and washed with ice-cold 1 m citric acid (3 × 50 ml) and saturated brine (50 ml), dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified on Silica Gel H (120 g) in a gradient of ethanol/dichloromethane (0-3%) with 1% of acetic acid present in both. Chromatography was monitored by TLC (Si60, Merck) in 10% dichloromethane/ethanol/acetic acid (89:10:1). The yield of pure product (RF = 0.65) was 4.0 g (8.75 mmol). Trityl-S-MUA (0.25 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 0.5 m HOBt, and reacted with 0.25 ml of 1 m dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dichloromethane for 30 min, filtered to remove the precipitated urea, and added to the peptide/solid support (0.1 mmol) containing a free amino group. Coupling was performed at 65 °C for 30 min, the resin was washed with N,N-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, dried, and cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid/water/ethanethiol/triethylsilane (90:5:2.5:2.5) for 30 min at 40 °C. Peptides were purified to >95% purity by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column and their masses confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer.BIAcore AnalysisBiomolecular interaction analyses were carried out in HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Surfactant P20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 or 5.5) using the BIAcore® 2000 (BIAcore, Inc.). Depending on the experiment, 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the HBS. Nonmuscle G-actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was immobilized on a CM5 sensorchip (BIAcore) using the Amine Coupling Kit (BIAcore). The surface of the sensorchip was activated with 30 μl of EDC/NHS (100 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylamino-propyl)-carbodimide hydrochloride, 400 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide) using a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For immobilization of proteins, 1-10 μg of G-actin or vitamin D-binding protein (DBP, Sigma) in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, were applied (flow rate: 5 μl/min). Subsequently, the sensorchip was deactivated with 30 μl of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5 (flow rate: 5 μl/min), and conditioned with 10 μl of 25 mm HCl (flow rate: 20 μl/min). Thiol immobilization of MUA peptides was performed according to application note 9 from BIAcore. Briefly, a CM5 chip was activated by NHS/EDC (1:1, 10 μl) followed by pyridine disulfide ethane amine (20 μl of 80 mm in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5) followed by MUA-peptide (7.5 μl of 2 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0) followed by cysteine, 1 m NaCl (20 μl of 50 mm in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0) to block excess sites. Binding studies and regeneration of the chip surface between injections were carried out at a flow rate of 20 μl/min unless otherwise noted. Samples were diluted in HBS buffer immediately prior to injection. Between sample injections the surface was regenerated with 15 μl of 25 mm HCl. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore), and curve fitting was done with the assumption of one-to-one (Langmuir) binding.NMR AnalysisHSQC—Peptide solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized powders in 5 mm Tris buffer containing 5% D2O, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and dithiothreitol (G-buffer, Cytoskeleton, Inc.) and the pH adjusted to 5.4 with 0.1 m HCl. The concentrations of wild-type and F454A mutant peptide were 0.10 and 0.15 mm, respectively. Actin was added to the peptide by dissolving lyophilized actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) in the peptide solution and the pH adjusted as necessary. The two-dimensional 1H-15N correlated HSQC experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance 600 NMR instrument equipped with actively shielded Z-gradient TXI-triple resonance cryoprobe. The Watergate-HSQC with water flip-back pulse was used for water suppression. The experiments were carried out at 15 °C.STD (Saturation Transfer Difference)—Experiments are widely used to identify the interaction between small ligand and large target biomolecules, and to determine the binding epitope of the ligand (25Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 26Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The advantage of the STD approach is that it works on large sized, and low concentrations of biomolecules without a requirement for isotope labeling of biomolecules. The concentration of protein can be as low as in the nanomolar range, and the optimal K ranges from 10-3 to 10-8 d m. STD is composed of two experiments. The first is a saturation experiment with carrier frequency irradiation on protein signals for a period of 2-5 s with soft pulse so that the target signals are saturated and ligand signals are not excited. Next, a reference experiment is carried out with a carrier frequency far away from protein and ligand signals. The two experiments are usually carried out in an interleaved fashion and the subtraction is realized by phase cycling. For a large sized protein, the saturation on any part of the protein (usually the methyl region) is spread out quickly through a spin diffusion mechanism to whole protein as well as the ligand in close contact with the protein. The protein signals from the subtraction of two experiments can be removed by a spin-lock delay (typically 40 ms), and thus the surviving signals are from the ligand that interacts with protein. Furthermore, epitope binding information can be obtained from the intensity of STD signals.STD experiments were performed according to Mayer and Mayer (25Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle actin (1 mg) was dissolved in 2 ml of G buffer, and then dialyzed two times versus 1 liter of G buffer at 4 °C. After dialysis, the G buffer was extensive exchanged to a G buffer prepared with D2O, deuterated dithiothreitol, and deuterated Tris. The final actin concentration was about 0.02 mm. STD experiments were carried out on a 500 MHz Bruker instrument with a TXI probe equipped with triple axis gradients. The irradiation power of the selective Gauss-shaped pulses was set to 86 Hz with duration of 55 ms. Saturation of actin signals was achieved with a train of 70 gauss-shaped pulses separated by a 1-ms delay. The on-resonance irradiation of the actin sample was carried out at -2.4 ppm, and no saturation of CEACAM1 peptide in the absence of actin was observed under these experimental conditions. The off-resonance irradiation was performed at -30 ppm. A 40-ms spinlock pulse with field strength of 4960 Hz was used to suppress the background signals of actin. The saturation time was optimized by arraying the numbers of gauss-shaped pulse, and the highest STD signals were obtained with saturation time of 3.9 s.Molecular Modeling—A molecular model of CEACAM1-4S transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was built using the HOMOLOGY module within INSIGHT II 2000 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Predicted transmembrane residues 429-452 were modeled using residues 437-460 from the membrane protein AcrB multidrug efflux pump as a template (26Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Coordinates for the cytoplasmic tail (residues 453-464) were modeled using residues 132-143 of the DBP bound to actin as a template (27Otterbein L.R. Cosio C. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8003-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The DBP-actin complex also served as a template for the initial docking of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S with the terminal unit of F-actin, as modeled by Holmes et al. (28Holmes K.C. Schroder R.R. Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), coordinates were courtesy of Ken Holmes, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany. To complete the model, the transmembrane helix of CEACAM1-4S was embedded in a standard model of a fluid lipid bilayer. Docking was optimized using the DISCOVER 3.0 module within INSIGHT II. The consistent valence force field was used throughout (29Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). The conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S and segments of actin within 4.5 Aå were simultaneously optimized using molecular dynamics (50 ps at 300 K) followed by conjugate gradient minimization to a maximum derivative of 0.5 kcal/mol Aå.Phosphorylation of CEACAM1-4S—MCF7 cells (1 × 107) transfected with CEACAM1-4S were grown in a three-dimensional culture for 4 days, incubated with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 plus 1% dialyzed FBS and 11 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN), harvested with Matrisperse (Collaborative Biomedical Products), and lysed with 2% Nonidet P-40. CEACAM1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody T84.1, and the proteins separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blot and autoradiography was performed to locate the 32P-labeled CEACAM1 band. The band was excised and counted in a Packard 1600CA scintillation counter. In a second experiment for CEACAM1-4S, transfected and vector control cells were grown for 4 days in Matrigel, harvested with Matrisperse, and lysed with 2% Nonidet P-40. CEACAM1 was immunoprecipit"
https://openalex.org/W2051828693,"The Tp34 (TP0971) membrane lipoprotein of Treponema pallidum, an obligate human pathogen and the agent of syphilis, was previously reported to have lactoferrin binding properties. Given the non-cultivatable nature of T. pallidum, a structure-to-function approach was pursued to clarify further potential relationships between the Tp34 structural and biochemical properties and its propensity to bind human lactoferrin. The crystal structure of a nonacylated, recombinant form of Tp34 (rTp34), solved to a resolution of 1.9Aå, revealed two metaloccupied binding sites within a dimer; the identity of the ion most likely was zinc. Residues from both of the monomers contributed to the interfacial metal-binding sites; a novel feature was that the δ-sulfur of methionine coordinated the zinc ion. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that, in solution, rTp34 formed a metal-stabilized dimer and that rTp34 bound human lactoferrin with a stoichiometry of 2:1. Isothermal titration calorimetry further revealed that rTp34 bound human lactoferrin at high (submicromolar) affinity. Finally, membrane topology studies revealed that native Tp34 is not located on the outer surface (outer membrane) of T. pallidum but, rather, is periplasmic. How propensity of Tp34 to bind zinc and the iron-sequestering lactoferrin may relate overall to the biology of T. pallidum infection in humans is discussed.

Syphilis is a chronic, complex sexually transmitted disease of humans caused by the noncultivatable spirochete Treponema pallidum (1LaFond R.E. Lukehart S.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Peeling R.W. Hook E.W. J. Pathol. 2006; 208: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, syphilis remains a significant threat to global health and can facilitate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (3Gerbase A.C.

After cutaneous inoculation, the bacteria become blood-borne and invade various organ systems, including the liver, heart, and nervous system (1LaFond R.E. Lukehart S.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Peeling R.W. Hook E.W. J. Pathol. 2006; 208: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Humans are the only known reservoir for T. pallidum, and although syphilis is one of the oldest recognized sexually transmitted diseases, it remains very poorly understood (1LaFond R.E. Lukehart S.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Peeling R.W. Hook E.W. J. Pathol. 2006; 208: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This largely is a consequence of the fact that T. pallidum cannot be cultivated continuously in vitro (1LaFond R.E. Lukehart S.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), thereby hampering studies on treponemal virulence and syphilis pathogenesis. Approaches for discerning T. pallidum membrane biology, which could reveal key aspects of the enigmatic parasitic strategy of the bacterium, thus, have been substantially limited (6Cox D.L. Chang P. McDowall A. Radolf J.D. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Radolf J.D.

In an attempt to elucidate molecules that could mediate interactions of T. pallidum with its human host, solubilization with the nonionic detergent Triton X-114 was employed to identify a group of integral membrane lipoproteins (9Radolf J.D. Chamberlain N.R. Clausell A. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 490-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chamberlain N.R. Brandt M.E. Erwin A.L. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This approach identified at least five lipoproteins, most of them representing dominant immunogens of T. pallidum (10Chamberlain N.R. Brandt M.E. Erwin A.L. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding constituted a major advance in the treponemal field, because there is increasing evidence that the lipoproteins serve functions vital to the membrane biology of T. pallidum (11Haake D.A.

Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more recent analysis of T. pallidum genome sequence information has predicted at least 45 lipoprotein genes (19Setubal J.C. Reis M. Matsunaga J. Haake D.A. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most of these predicted that open reading frames encode proteins with no known homologies to other structurally or functionally characterized bacterial proteins. In addition, the absence of techniques for in vitro cultivation and genetic manipulation of T. pallidum has greatly hindered the ability to characterize the functional aspects of T. pallidum membrane lipoproteins. As an alternative approach to investigating the peculiar membrane biology of T. pallidum, we have adopted a structure-to-function approach to formulate new testable hypotheses regarding the potential function(s) of a number of the treponemal lipoproteins. That a structural biology approach for analyzing T. pallidum lipoproteins is a fruitful avenue of investigation is exemplified in at least three recent studies on Tp47, Tp32, and PnrA (20Deka R.K.

The current structural study focuses on the Tp34 membrane lipoprotein (also known as Tp0971) of T. pallidum. Early studies by Staggs et al. (23Staggs T.M. Greer M.K. Baseman J.B. Holt S.C. Tryon V.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) denoted a protein, most likely Tp34, as having lactoferrin binding properties. Lactoferrin is a mammalian iron-binding glycoprotein found on mucosal surfaces and within biological fluids, including milk, saliva, and seminal fluid (24Kanyshkova T.G. Buneva V.N. Nevinsky G.A. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2001; 66: 5-13Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Levay P.F. Viljoen M. Haematologica. 1995; 80: 252-267PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fernaud S. Evans R.W. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Despite the preliminary functional characterization of Tp34, NCBI Clusters of Orthologous Groups data base includes Tp34 with five other bacterial proteins as COG3470, which is denoted as “uncharacterized proteins probably involved in high affinity Fe2+ transport.” However, the structural and functional aspects of this group of proteins remain undetermined. To investigate further the potential of Tp34 to serve as a ligand-binding protein (LBP), we determined the three-dimensional structure of Tp34 using x-ray crystallography. The relevance of our findings to the notion that Tp34 is involved in lactoferrin binding as well as the potential implications of this interaction for iron utilization by T. pallidum are discussed. Construction of His6-tagged rTp34—To produce a nonlipidated, recombinant version of Tp34 (rTp34) in Escherichia coli, a fragment encoding amino acid residues 2-185 (cloned without the post-translationally modified N-terminal Cys residue) was amplified by PCR from treponemal genomic DNA using primer pairs encoding the predicted 5′ and 3′ termini. The PCR products were ligated into pProExHTa vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI and PstI restriction sites such that the resultant construct encoded a fusion protein with a His6 tag at its N terminus; this His6 tag region is cleavable by tobacco etch virus protease. Ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene), and the sequences of plasmids isolated from colonies that tested positive by restriction digest were verified using standard DNA sequencing techniques. Expression and Purification of rTp34—E. coli XL1-Blue was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6. The culture was then induced for 4 h with 600 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells derived from 1 liter of culture were harvested by centrifugation and lysed at room temperature with gentle rocking for 30 min using 50 ml of B-PER II (Pierce). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. rTp34 was isolated from the supernatant by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) using a standard method (22Deka R.K. Brautigam C.A. Yang X.F. Blevins J.S. Machius M. Tomchick D.R. Norgard M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8072-8081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-terminal His6 tag was removed via cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 3 h, and then the protease was removed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Removal of the fusion segment was verified by SDS-PAGE. rTp34 was concentrated and bufferexchanged with 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A) using an Amicon ultracentrifuge filter device (Millipore) with a 10,000 molecular weight exclusion limit. The concentrated protein was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column and purified on anAökta fast performance liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) using buffer A. Subsequent to elution, peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. At this stage, the protein was pure to apparent homogeneity (i.e. >95%). Fractions containing purified rTp34 were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in buffer A for protein crystallization. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient of 1.491 mg-1ml-1cm-1 at 280 nm (27Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). To express protein for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization, bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The resultant 15N-labeled protein was purified as described above. For the production of a selenomethionine (SeMet) variant of rTp34, the expression vector was transformed into the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 cells (Novagen) and grown in the presence of M9 medium containing 5% LB supplemented with 125 mg/liter each of adenine, uracil, thymine, and guanosine, 2.5 mg/liter thiamine, 4 mg/liter d-biotin, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 mg/liter each of 19 l amino acids (excluding methionine), and 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine (Sigma). Labeled protein was prepared as described above with the addition of 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol to the purification buffers. NMR Spectroscopic Screening—Suitability of rTp34 for structure determination was evaluated by NMR screening of 15N-labeled protein (28Yee A. Chang X. Pineda-Lucena A. Wu B. Semesi A. Le B. Ramelot T. Lee G.M. Bhattacharyya S. Gutierrez P. Denisov A. Lee C-H. Cort J.R. Kozlov G. Liao J. Finak G. Chen L. Wishart D. Lee W. McIntosh L.P. Gehring K. Kennedy M.A. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1825-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of labeled protein were acquired at 25 °C by using a Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer with NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) used for data processing and NMRView (30Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) for analysis. Data were collected on 500 μm samples in 50 mm K3PO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Preparation of PnrA, Tp32, Human Milk Lactoferrin (hLF), Bovine Milk Lactoferrin (bLF), and Human Serum Transferrin (hTF)—The purification procedures for PnrA and Tp32 have been described previously (21Deka R.K.

As a final step, both proteins were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm octyl β-glucoside, pH 7.5). Lyophilized hLF, bLF, and hTF were obtained from Sigma and reconstituted in buffer A at protein concentrations of 10 mg/ml. Proteins were then dialyzed overnight into buffer B. ApohLF was prepared in the same buffer after exhaustive dialysis against 0.1 m citric acid (31Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determinations—Crystals were grown at 20 °C using the vapor diffusion method in hanging drop mode by mixing 4 μl of protein (10 mg/ml in buffer A) with 4 μl of reservoir solution (2.4 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Bicine, pH 9.0) and equilibrating against 500 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals appeared within 24 h and grew to average dimensions of 0.2 × 0.6 × 0.1 mm in about 3 days. The crystals were cryo-protected in 2.8 m ammonium sulfate, 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.1 m Bicine, pH 9.0, and then flash-cooled in liquid propane. Crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 34 Aå, b = 66 Aå, c = 151 Aå and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit and 41% solvent. Crystals for the selenomethionine variant of rTp34 (rTp34-SeMet) were produced under the same conditions. Diffraction data were collected at beamlines 19-ID and 19-BM (SBC-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Crystals diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing (dmin) of about 1.63 Aå. Phases for rTp34-SeMet were obtained from a single anomalous diffraction experiment using x-rays with an energy near the selenium K absorption edge. Using data to 2.5 Aå, 6 of 12 possible selenium sites were located and refined with the program CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), resulting in a figure of merit of 0.35. Phases were extended to 1.7 Aå and improved by density modification (CNS), resulting in a final overall figure of merit of 0.92. The resulting electron density map was of sufficient quality to automatically construct an initial model using the program ARP/wARP (34Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 458-463Crossref Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Manual rebuilding was carried out with the program Coot (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Refinement was accomplished using the program REFMAC5 (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 package (37Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The rTp34-SeMet model was used as a starting model for the refinement of native rTp34. The electron density revealed strong, spherical features near His-124 in each monomer, indicative of metal ions. These features were not present in rTp34-SeMet. An anomalous difference Fourier electron-density map showed peaks of about 6.4 and 4.7 σ that coincided with the features. Subsequently, a crystal of rTp34 was incubated with 10 mm zinc acetate (rTp34-Zn), and diffraction data were collected using x-rays with an energy near the zinc K absorption edge. The anomalous difference Fourier electron-density map revealed very strong peaks of about 32 and 33 σ at the previously observed positions. Zinc ions were, therefore, included in the model. An additional six zinc ions were located, but they had rather high B values and are, thus, minor sites. Although the nature of the metal ions in native rTp34 was not unambiguously clear, the peaks were interpreted as zinc ions at this stage. These metal-binding sites were not fully occupied as indicated by the comparatively weak electron density and high B factors. Furthermore, a second conformation appeared for some of the zinc-ligand residues, whereas these residues adopted only a single conformation in rTp34-Zn, where the main zinc sites were presumably fully occupied. As a control, a dataset was collected from a crystal of rTp34 that was grown in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (rTp34-EDTA). Density observed at the zinc sites was weak and was interpreted as water molecules. Final models had an Rwork and Rfree of 18.4 and 21.5% for rTp34-SeMet, 18.8 and 23.5% for native rTp34, 19.0 and 23.3% for rTp34-Zn, and 18.9 and 22.0% for rTp34-EDTA, respectively. About 31 N-terminal residues could not be located in all cases. Figure Generation—Figures that feature structural details of rTp34 were generated using PyMOL. They were rendered using POV-Ray. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The binding of rTp34 or other T. pallidum lipoproteins to various target proteins was analyzed by injecting a solution of each lipoprotein into a solution of target protein and monitoring the resultant heat changes upon binding using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). All proteins were exhaustively exchanged into buffer B before the titration experiment. Protein concentrations were obtained by measuring the absorbance of proteincontaining solutions spectrophotometrically followed by the calculation of the protein concentration using Beer’s Law (A = ɛcl, where A is absorbance, ɛ is the molar extinction coefficient, c is the protein concentration, and l is the path length). In the case of rTp34, hLF, and bLF, the extinction coefficients were experimentally determined following the method of Pace et al. (27Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). For other proteins ɛ was calculated by the ProtParam tool available at the ExPASy Proteomics Server. The titration was carried out using 31 serial injections of 8 μl of lipoprotein at concentrations of 500-600 μm into a stirred reaction cell (1.4 ml) containing solutions of the target protein at ∼30 μm.To study the potential binding of hTF to rTp34, a solution of hTF (126 μm) was injected into a solution of rTp34 (13.6 μm) as described above. The heats of interaction resulting from the titration were monitored by the VP-ITC instrument until the target protein was saturated with the lipoprotein. Integration of the resultant thermogram yielded the binding isotherm, which was analyzed using the Microcal-ORIGIN software package to yield the association constants and the thermodynamic parameters associated with binding. Titrations using rTp34 as the injectant and hLF as the target protein were carried out in triplicate; others were performed only once. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. For rTp34 sedimentation, samples of 390 μl of reference buffer C (20 mm Tris-Cl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) or rTp34 (19 μm) diluted in reference buffer were loaded into a dualsector charcoal-filled epon centerpiece. In experiments that contained divalent metal ions, they were included at a concentration of 3 mm unless otherwise noted. The samples were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm in an An60-Ti rotor, and sedimentation was monitored using either laser interferometry or absorbance spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 280 nm. Data were analyzed using the program SEDFIT, which generates a continuous c(s) distribution for the sedimenting species (38Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). For experiments designed to monitor the binding of rTp34 to another protein, the same buffer was used. The volumes, rotor, centrifugation speed, and instrumentation were as described above. Three simultaneous sedimentation experiments were performed in these cases, with the solution contents being (i) rTp34 (15 μm) alone, (ii) target protein (5 μm) alone, and (iii) a mixture of rTp34 (7.5 μm) and the target protein (2.5 μm). For such experiments, two signals from the proteins were concurrently used to follow their sedimentation. For some experiments, the two signals were absorbance at 280 nm and refractive index detection by laser interferometry; for others, the signals were absorbances at 280 and at 250 nm. Such data were analyzed according to the multisignal ck(s) methodology of Balbo et al. (39Balbo A. Minor K.H. Velikovsky C.A. Mariuzza R.A. Peterson C.B. Schuck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as implemented in the program SEDPHAT. Briefly, the sedimentation profiles obtained from experiments i and ii were used to calculate the unknown extinction coefficient of the protein at 250 nm or the unknown interferometric extinction coefficient. This is possible because the extinction coefficient of the proteins at 280 nm is known. Once the extinction coefficient at both signals is known, a characteristic signal increment ɛkλ of each protein component k at each signal λ can be defined that allows the spectral decomposition of the c(s) distribution into two ck(s) distributions, one for each of the protein components. Integration of a ck(s) peak yields the concentration of a given component in that peak. The concentrations of co-sedimenting proteins may, thus, be derived by analyzing the two ck(s) distributions; comparison of the two concentrations yields the stoichiometry of the proteins in that peak. The program SEDNTERP was used to estimate the partial specific volume of the proteins as well as the density and viscosity of the buffer solutions. All sedimentation coefficients quoted in this study have been corrected to values that would be observed under standard conditions (i.e. s20,w). Cultivation and Isolation of Treponemes—T. pallidum subspecies pallidum (Nichols strain) was maintained and passaged by intratesticular inoculation of adult male New Zealand White rabbits as previously described (40Robertson S.M. Kettman J.R. Miller J.N. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1982; 36: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spirochetes were harvested in T. pallidum medium (41Cox D.L. Riley B. Chang P. Sayahatheri S. Tassell S. Hevelone J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and flushed with a reduced oxygen atmosphere of 3% O2, 5%CO2, and the balance of nitrogen. The medium consisted of Earle’s balanced salt solution, minimum essential medium (MEM) (Hyclone) amino acids, MEM nonessential amino acids, MEM vitamin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 550 μm d-mannitol, 320 μm l-histidine, 24 mm sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm MOPS, 900 μm sodium pyruvate, 14 mm d-(+)glucose, 650 μm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc.) with a final pH of 7.5. Rabbit testicular debris was removed from treponemal suspensions by two successive rounds of slow-speed centrifugation (200 × g for 8 min). Spirochetes remaining suspended were enumerated by darkfield microscopy and diluted to a concentration of 108 ml-1 in T. pallidum medium. Indirect Immunofluorescence Detection of Antigens in T. pallidum—The agarose gel microdroplet method (42Cox D.L. Akins D.R. Porcella S.F. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1151-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was utilized to assess whether lipoproteins were exposed on the surface of T. pallidum. T. pallidum was encapsulated within agarose gel microdroplets as previously described (42Cox D.L. Akins D.R. Porcella S.F. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1151-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The encapsulation method stabilizes the fragile outer membrane of T. pallidum during antibody exposure and washing treatments. Mouse monoclonal anti-Tp47 (clone 11E3) (43Jones S.A. Marchitto K.S. Miller J.N. Norgard M.V. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1404-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and mouse monoclonal anti-Tp34 (44Swancutt M.A. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 384-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were diluted 1:20 and added directly to 1 ml of aliquots of microdroplets with or without 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100. The microdroplets were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The microdroplets were collected by centrifugation at (500 × g, 5 min) and washed 5 times with fresh T. pallidum medium. Two μg of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) were added to the microdroplets for 2 h before being re-washed 5 times and viewed on glass slides with a Olympus BH2 microscope (darkfield lens and BP490 (green) filter (Olympus America Inc.)). Images were obtained using a SPOT Pursuit camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Slides were prepared from each of 3 independent microdroplet preparations, and ∼100 bacteria were counted per slide. Any spirochete with a fluorescent signal, which was often punctated, was considered positive and compared with the total number of spirochetes observed via darkfield microscopy.

Despite variation in the number and conformation of its β-strands, the IFTase β-helix has a structure that is largely reminiscent of other β-helix structures but is unprecedented in that trimerization is a prerequisite for catalytic activity, and the active site is located at the monomer-monomer interface.

Fructans are polysaccharides composed of linear and branched polymers of fructose linked to sucrose through glycosidic bonds of various linkage types. They have been conceived as one of the principal stored forms of energy in 15% of higher plants, as well as in a wide range of bacteria and fungi (1Vijn I. Smeekens S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Several plant fructosyltransferases, each with a distinct substrate and glycosidic bond linkage-type specificity, have been suggested to be involved in the sequential enzymatic steps that produce fructans such as β-2,6-linked levan and β-2,1-linked inulin. In this process, fructose is first linked to vacuolar sucrose, and then fructosyl units are successively added to the resulting trisaccharide (1Vijn I. Smeekens S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2Van den Ende W. De Coninck B. Van Laere A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 523-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Not only do plant fructans play a major role as storage carbohydrates, but they are also implicated in additional physiological functions in plants, such as drought and cold tolerance (1Vijn I. Smeekens S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). By contrast, in bacteria, the multifunctional enzymes levansucrase (3Meng G. Fuötterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and inulosucrase (4van Hijum S.A.F.T. van der Maarel M.J.E.C. Dijkhuizen L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) catalyze fructan biosynthesis, producing inulin and levan, the predominant bacterial fructans, respectively. Details of the levan biosynthetic mechanism in bacteria were recently revealed by structural studies of levansucrase (3Meng G. Fuötterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Martinez-fleites C. Ortiz-lombardia M. Pons T. Tarbouriech N. Taylor E.J. Arrieta J.G. Hernandez L. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fructan-degrading enzymes that function primarily in the mobilization of stored fructans in plants and microbes have also been characterized. Just recently, the plant fructan hydrolases (EC 3.2.1) were found to catalyze the hydrolysis of levan and inulin via an exclusively exolytic mechanism that releases successive terminal fructose units (6Van Riet L. Nagaraj V. Van den Ende W. Clerens S. Wiemken A. Van Laere A. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The presence of these fructan exohydrolases, even in non-fructan-containing plants, suggests an additional, defensive role for these enzymes against pathogenic bacteria (2Van den Ende W. De Coninck B. Van Laere A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 523-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In bacteria, two distinctly different classes of enzymes perform fructan degradation. One of these classes includes two hydrolases, levanase (EC 3.2.1.65) and inulinase (EC 3.2.1.7), which exhibit both endo- and exotype hydrolytic activities. Classifications based on sequence similarity (7Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar) (CAZy; www.cazy.org/CAZY/index.html) place these plant and microbial hydrolytic enzymes into the GH32 family (O-glycoside hydrolases).

In addition, active sites for the proposed hydrolytic activity have been identified; they include three acidic amino acid residues. The second class of bacterial fructan-degrading enzymes, which includes levan fructotransferase (EC 4.2.2.16) (12Yang S.J. Park N.H. Lee T.H. Cha J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 35: 199-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim C.H. Jang E.K. Kim S.H. Jang K.H. Kang S.A. Song K.B. Kwon O.S. Rhee S.K. Lett. Appl.

(14Kang S.I. Kim W.P. Chang Y.J. Kim S.I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Haraguchi K. Yoshida M. Ohtsubo K. Biotechnol. Lett. 2003; 25: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), has long been known to catalyze the depolymerization of fructans into difructose dianhydrides (DFAs) via intramolecular fructosyl transfer (Fig. 1A). Because DFAs have physiological effects, including the promotion of human health, and show promise as low calorie sweeteners (reviewed in Ref. 16Ritsema T. Smeekens S. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), IFTase and levan fructotransferase have attracted the attention of the food industry. The linkage types of enzymatically produced DFAs vary with the specific enzymes and substrate fructans employed; IFTase produces DFA-I (α-d-fructofuranose-β-d-fructofuranose 2′,1:2,1′-dianhydride) and DFA-III (α-d-fructofuranose-β-d-fructofuranose 2′,1:2,3′-dianhydride), whereas levan fructotransferase results in DFA-IV (β-d-fructofuranose-β-d-fructofuranose 2,6′:2′, 6-dianhydride). Levan fructotransferases are categorized as GH32 enzymes, like other fructan hydrolases, and they share considerable sequence identity of 30-44% and several conserved regions with the other members of GH32 (12Yang S.J. Park N.H. Lee T.H. Cha J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 35: 199-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim C.H. Jang E.K. Kim S.H. Jang K.H. Kang S.A. Song K.B. Kwon O.S. Rhee S.K. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2005; 40: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Notably, IFTases do not exhibit any apparent sequence homology with levan fructotransferases, although both enzymes carry out similar reactions. Furthermore, IFTases appear to be unrelated to any other known proteins but are highly similar to members of the family, with 50-98% sequence identity (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the IFTases share a three-dimensional structure common to the family. The products of six bacterial genes have so far been characterized biochemically as IFTases and classified as GH91 enzymes, even in the absence of supporting evidence for hydrolase activity. The DFA-III-producing IFTase from Bacillus sp. snu-7 (BsIFTase; EC 4.2.2.18) consists of 450 amino acid residues, including a 40-residue, N-terminal signal sequence for secretion. Although biochemical features of BsIFTase have been characterized (14Kang S.I. Kim W.P. Chang Y.J. Kim S.I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Kim C.S. Hong C.K. Kim K.Y. Wang X.L. Kang S.I. Kim S.I. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar), the fundamental details of BsIFTase catalysis, such as the identities of the residues that catalyze intramolecular fructosyl transfer and the mode of enzyme action, remain elusive. To elucidate the structural and functional properties of BsIFTase, we determined its crystal structure at 1.8-Aå resolution and the structure of BsIFTase in a complex with a β-2,1-linked tetrafructosaccharide. Together with the results of site-directed mutagenesis, our structural and functional analyses provide the first atomic resolution structures of IFTase and some details of its enzymatic mechanism. Purification and Crystallization of BsIFTase—The gene for BsIFTase (access number DQ112363) from the Bacillus sp. snu-7 was cloned, and DNA for the mature BsIFTase (residues 41-450) was subcloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) using an NdeI and a SalI site (17Kim C.S. Hong C.K. Kim K.Y. Wang X.L. Kang S.I. Kim S.I. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged, selenomethionine-substituted recombinant BsIFTase was prepared by transforming the expression plasmid construct into Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3)pLysS, a methionine auxotroph (Novagen). The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C and then induced for 4 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and supplemented selenomethionine. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl). The His-tagged recombinant BsIFTase was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with buffer B (buffer A + 500 mm imidazole), dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and then concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. Crystallization was accomplished at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals of BsIFTase in space group C2 with three monomers/asymmetric unit were produced using the His-tagged, selenomethionine-substituted protein with a crystallization buffer consisting of 0.1 m imidazole, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1.0 m (NH4)2HPO4. The BsIFTase-tetrafructosaccharide complex was obtained by soaking the BsIFTase crystals for 90 min in a crystallization solution containing 200 mm substrate (see below). The crystal parameters are shown in Table 1. Crystallization of IFTase from Arthrobacter globiformis has been described previously, but the structure has not been reported (18Momma M. Fujimoto Z. Maita N. Haraguchi K. Mizuno H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2286-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab Purification of Tetrafructosaccharides—Tetrafructosaccharides, which serve as the minimal substrate for BsIFTase activity (17Kim C.S. Hong C.K. Kim K.Y. Wang X.L. Kang S.I. Kim S.I. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar), were initially produced by an enzymatic reaction between inulin and purified endoinulinase from Arthrobacter sp. S37 (19Kim K.Y. Rhee S. Kim S.I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); this enzyme produces oligosaccharides by endolytic degradation of inulin. The reaction products were subjected to charcoal-celite column chromatography, and the tetrafructosaccharides were eluted stepwise with 7% ethanol. Purified tetrafructosaccharides were freeze-dried for storage, and their chemical composition and purity were verified using thin layer chromatography (see below). Data Collection and Structure Determination—Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data for crystals of selenomethionine-substituted BsIFTase were collected at 1.8 Aå on Beamline 6B at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea). Diffraction data for the BsIFTase-tetrafructosaccharide complex at 1.8 Aå resolution were collected using a single wavelength on Beamline 6B at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The data were collected at 100 K, and the crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of 30% glycerol to each crystallization solution. The program HKL2000 was used for data processing (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 267: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The program SOLVE/RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar, 22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) was used for phasing and density modification of the native BsIFTase structure. Of 12 possible selenium atoms, a total of 10 sites were identified and used to calculate the initial phases. The presence of three monomers in the asymmetric unit improved density modification in RESOLVE with noncrystallographic symmetry averaging. The initial electron density map was sufficient to trace most of the residues in each monomer, except the highly disordered N-terminal region including the His tag and residues 41-51. Manual model building and refinement were performed using the programs O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilgus M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), respectively. The substrate-binding site was unambiguously located using a difference map with phases from the substrate-free native enzyme and amplitudes between the substrate-bound and native data. The difference map showed that only a disaccharide moiety of the tetrasaccharide was observed, and a conformation of the identified difructosaccharide corresponds to that of substrate, not the product DFA-III. Presumably, a high concentration of substrate (200 mm) led to stabilization of substrate binding in the active site. A model for the bound difructosaccharide was subsequently fit into the density, and the resulting model for the BsIFTase-substrate complex was then subjected to refinement using CNS. The residual density near the binding site could not be explained by any molecular model and was therefore modeled as water molecules (at positions 106, 118, and 159). Two molecules of phosphate were modeled in the putative intersubunit channel. Details of data collection and structure refinement are shown in Table 1. The stereochemistry of refined structures was confirmed using the program PROCHECK (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). With the exception of one residue, Val188, in each monomer, neither the native nor the substrate-bound structures contained residues with disallowed conformations. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System), and the structure was analyzed using the CCP4 suite (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Enzymatic Activity Assay—Genes encoding BsIFTase mutants were generated from plasmid pET15b-BsIFTase using polymerase chain reaction (Table 2), and their sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as His-tagged recombinant proteins in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS as described above, and each of the purified proteins appeared as a single major band on SDS-PAGE. BsIFTase enzyme activity was assayed as reported previously (14Kang S.I. Kim W.P. Chang Y.J. Kim S.I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Kim C.S. Hong C.K. Kim K.Y. Wang X.L. Kang S.I. Kim S.I. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar), using 1 μg of wild-type or mutant BsIFTase in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5% inulin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then their products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system of n-propanol:ethyl acetate:H2O (3:1:1).TABLE 2Primer sequences Open table in a new tab Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium sedimentation studies were performed using a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using six-hole, charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces. BsIFTase was dissolved at 1.8 μm (0.08 mg/ml), 3.6 μm (0.16 mg/ml), or 7.2 μm (0.32 mg/ml) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of the protein was determined using ɛ280 nm = 27,765 m-1 cm-1 calculated from its amino acid composition. The radial absorbance distribution was measured at 20 °C and 12,000 rpm at four different wavelengths (230, 235, 240, and 280 nm). After 48 h of centrifugation, five scans were collected and averaged for the analysis. A partial specific volume of 0.7265 cm3/g and a buffer density of 1.00808 g/cm3 at 20 °C were calculated using Sednterp (26Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelleitier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge. 1992; : 90-125Google Scholar). For data analysis by mathematical modeling using nonlinear least squares curve fitting, the fitting function was Cr = Cb exp(Ap Mp(r2 - rb2)) + ɛ, where AP = (1 - vρ)ω2/2RT, Cr is the total concentration at the radial position r, Cb is the concentration of protein at the bottom of the cell, Mp is the molecular weight of protein, v is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solution density, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, and ɛ is a base-line error term. The data were analyzed by mathematical modeling using MLAB (27Knott G.D. Comput. Programs. Biomed. 1979; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). All of the measured data fit well to a trimeric model, and a representative result obtained for 1.8 μm BsIFTase is presented. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis was carried out using MicroCalorimetry System (Microcal) at 25 °C. Two inactive mutants E244Q and D233N, as well as substrate inulin were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and then degassed. The data were analyzed using the Origin software (OriginLab Corp.). Overall Structure of Monomer—Mature BsIFTase consisting of amino acid residues 41-450 was crystallized in the C2 space group with three monomers/asymmetric unit (A, B, and C) related by noncrystallographic symmetry. The presence of a homotrimeric BsIFTase in a crystalline state is consistent with results obtained from analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (Fig. 2), which indicate that the enzyme exists exclusively as a trimer in solution at concentrations as low as 0.08 mg/ml. In size exclusion chromatography, however, BsIFTase appeared to behave as a dimer, possibly because of its elongated shape (data not shown). Each monomer forms a right-handed parallel β-helix (hence-forth, “β-helix”), a fold that was initially identified in the pectate lyase PelC (28Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). β-Helical folds have been identified in several classes of enzymes frequently associated with polysaccharides, including pectin lyase-related proteins (29Herron S.R. Benen J.A.E. Scavetta R.D. Visser J. Jurnak F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8762-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), pectin methylesterase (30Matteo A.D. Giovane A. Raiola A. Camardella L. Bonivento D. De Lorenzo G. Cervone F. Bellincampi D. Tsemoglou D. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and phage P22 tailspike protein (31Steinbacher S. Baxa U. Miller S. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10584-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, they have also been found in other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes in O-glycoside hydrolase families 28 (32van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E. Schroöter K. Kalk K.H. Armand S. Visser J. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30474-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 49 (33Larsson A.M. Andersson R. Stahlberg J. Kenne L. Jones T.A. Structure. 2003; 11: 1111-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and 82 (34Michel G. Helbert W. Kahn R. Dideberg O. Kloareg B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as well as in virulence factors (35Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The BsIFTase monomer, which is shown in Fig. 3A, has dimensions of 75 × 57 × 30 Aå. Each monomer has an overall cylindrical shape consisting of 399 residues that form 13 helical turns of a right-handed coil. The highly disordered N-terminal residues 41-51 are excluded from the final model. The BsIFTase structure exhibits the general structural characteristics of β-helical proteins (35Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but it differs in some details. Each turn consists of two, three, or four β-strands, joined by intervening loops, and the β-strands that are present between adjacent turns associate to form a parallel sheet on the surface of the enzyme. All of the β-strand residues fulfill two strict structural requirements: they are in the β-conformation region of a Ramachandran plot, and the main chain atoms of β-strands in adjacent turns interact by hydrogen bonding. A structure-based sequence alignment of the β-strands along the β-sheet is shown in Fig. 3B. Of particular interest is the fact that the N-terminal five turns (turns 3-7) of the coil involve four β-strands, whereas turns 8 and 9 include three, and the C-terminal four turns involve only two β-strands each (Fig. 3, A and B). Each β-strand consists of two to six residues, except that the β-strands in turns 10 and 11 have ten and nine residues, respectively. As a consequence of variation in the number of β-strands and loop length, the N-terminal turns exhibit wider interiors, with a 19-residue α1-helix capping the N-terminal domain, whereas the last two turns at the C terminus have narrow interiors with only two β-strands. Structural Characteristics of Turns—The BsIFTase turns are partially homologous to three-β-strand turns of PelC (28Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 36Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In PelC, the first, second, and third β-strands of the turns are designated PB1, PB2, and PB3, respectively, with loops T1, T2, and T3 following the corresponding strands. In BsIFTase, an additional two-residue β-strand is present within the four-β-strand turn at the region corresponding to T1 of PelC; this strand is designated PB1b. The second strand in the two-β-strand turns is designated PB2 because its location is equivalent to that of PB2 in a three-β-strand turn (see below). The long β-strands in turns 10 and 11 include all three regions (PB2, T2, and PB3; Fig. 3B). In cross-section, the turns resemble an “L” shape, with the β-strands almost perpendicular to each other. The most dramatic changes in β-strand conformation were observed at turns 10 and 11, in which the 10- and 9-residue PB2 strands are so sharply bent that the two PB2 ends are almost perpendicular. As a result, the first half of PB2 in these turns corresponds structurally to PB2, but the second half of PB2 is equivalent to PB3 in other turns. Although the BsIFTase structure differs from that of most other β-helical proteins in the number and conformation of β-strands in turns, it does resemble these proteins in that the interior of the β-helix is closely packed with hydrophobic or polar side chains along the sheet (35Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Jurnak F. Yoder M.D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Specifically, the internal hydrophobic resides, which include valine, leucine, and isoleucine predominantly, and occasionally phenylalanine, are stacked between adjacent turns, as indicated in the structure-based sequence alignment of the β-strands shown in Fig. 3B. PB1 has two rows of hydrophobic stacks, and PB2 and PB3 have one stack each, with each stack involving a total of 11-13 residues (Fig. 3C). With the exception of the 27-residue T2 loop in turn 2, the T2 loops are only two or three residues in length. Sharp kinks in a T2 loop are associated with a stack of seven asparagine residues that is located in the β-helix interior (Fig. 3B); this was first identified in the structure of PelC and is called the “asparagine ladder” (28Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In BsIFTase, this asparagine ladder, including Asn372 in turn 10 and Asn406 in turn 11, has a continuous hydrogen-bonded network between the asparagine side chains and forms hydrogen bonds between the main chain amide groups in a T2 loop of adjacent turns and the asparagine side chain (Fig. 3D); consequently, the ladder stabilizes the sharp kinks. Unlike T2 loops, T3 loops following PB3 strands exhibit a wide range of lengths and conformations. The T3 loops in turns 3, 9, and 10 protrude from the core β-helix, forming a relatively irregular protrusion on one side of the enzyme. In the central portion of the β-helix, the β-helix surface consists primarily of T3 loops. Notably, the protruding 27-residue T2 loop in turn 2 also wraps halfway around the β-helix and is localized in this loop cluster (Fig. 3A). Trimeric Structure of BsIFTase—The three parallel monomers in the asymmetric unit intertwine to constitute a trimer (Fig. 4A) in which PB2 in one monomer is packed in an anti-parallel manner against PB3 in the adjacent monomer. When the three monomers are superimposed, the resulting root mean square deviation for the corresponding Cα atoms is 0.05 Aå, indicating that the structures of the independent monomers are essentially identical. In contrast to the interior side chains, the external side chains of each BsIFTase sheet are relatively heterogeneous in amino acid composition and configuration. The side chains of adjacent subunits interdigitate, which stabilizes the trimer (38Kreisberg J.F. Betts S.D. Haase-Pettingell C. King J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Simkovsky R. King J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The surface area buried by trimerization is calculated to be 4439 Aå2/monomer, or 28% of the monomer surface area. Because of this close packing, no intersubunit channel is present between monomers or at the trimer interface. Specifically, in the channel that otherwise might be present in the center of the trimer, the only electron density observed arose from several water molecules and from two phosphate molecules from the crystallization buffer.

Reduced IRF-8 transcript levels were reported in CML patients, and a recovery to normal levels was observed in patients in remission following treatment with IFN-α. We demonstrate a significant correlation between the levels of IRF-8 and PML in these CML patients. Together, our results indicate that some of the myeloleukemia suppressor activities of IRF-8 are mediated through the regulation of PML.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) through the inhibition of Bcl-2 (14Burchert A. Cai D. Hofbauer L.C. Samuelsson M.K. Slater E.P. Duyster J. Ritter M. Hochhaus A.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3491-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In humans, down-regulation of IRF-8 expression was reported in CML and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) patients. Accordingly, a significant increase in IRF-8 expression was correlated with remission following treatment with IFN-α (14Burchert A. Cai D. Hofbauer L.C. Samuelsson M.K. Slater E.P. Duyster J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3648-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together, these observations point toward a role for IRF-8 as a tumor suppressor gene. To characterize the IRF-8 regulatory network in activated macrophages, a differential expression profile of peritoneal macrophages extracted from wild type (WT) mice versus IRF-8-/- mice, before and following 4 h of stimulation with IFN-γ and LPS, was studied using DNA microarray assay (18Dror N. Alter-Koltunoff M. Azriel A. Amariglio N. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Morgenstern A. Tamura T. Hauser H. Rechavi G. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among the many putative IRF-8-target genes, the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene was identified. PML is a tumor suppressor gene that serves as a scaffold protein for nuclear bodies (NBs). PML-NBs associate with numerous proteins and therefore were implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, proteolysis, tumor suppression, DNA repair, and transcription (for review see Refs. 19Salomoni P.

PML is involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) because of a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 15 (PML locus) and chromosome 17 (retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα) locus) leading to in-frame fusion peptides between these two loci (25de The H.

In this study we show that PML is regulated by IRF-8 in myeloid cells, and we provide evidence that the IRF-8-mediated CML tumor suppressor activity may be delegated via PML. Patient Samples—The cDNAs of peripheral blood from 13 healthy donors, 13 patients in chronic phase of CML at diagnosis, and 7 patients with CML in major or complete cytogenetic remission under an IFNα-based therapy were studied (14Burchert A. Cai D. Hofbauer L.C. Samuelsson M.K. Slater E.P. Duyster J. Ritter M. Hochhaus A. Muller R. Eilers M. Schmidt M. Neubauer A. Blood. 2004; 103: 3480-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All patients and healthy donors gave written informed consent for the use of their samples. Animals—The mouse strains, C57BL/6J (Harlan Biotech, Israel), IRF-1-/- (kindly obtained from Dr. Rubinstein, The Weizmann Institute, Israel, originally from The Jackson Laboratory), and IRF-8-/- (12Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bachmann M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I.

All animal work conformed to the guidelines of the animal care and use committee of the Technion. Cell Lines—U937 human leukemic monocyte lymphoma, HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, RAW264.7 mouse monocyte macrophage, and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). CL-2 murine macrophage cell line and Tot2 myeloid progenitor cell line were derived from IRF-8-/- mice and maintained as described previously (6Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Transfections—Mammalian expression vectors encoding for IRF-8, IRF-1, and PU.1 were all described previously (29Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar). The pGL3-PML containing the 1.44-kb promoter region conjugated to luciferase (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H. Venturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.C. Schindler C. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. de Thé; (Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France). The PGL3-mut-PML promoter harboring 2-bp mutations (AA bases at positions 1422 and 1423 were changed to CG) that destroyed its IFN-simulated response element (ISRE, the DNA binding motif for IRFs) is described hereafter. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of the ISRE site within the human PML promoter was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: 5′-GAT CTA AAC CGA GAA TCG CGA CTA AGC TGG GGT CC-3′ and the complementary oligonucleotide (positions 1404-1435 in the GenBank™ accession number X91752). The AA bases (1422 and 1423) were changed to CG and created an NruI site. Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were harvested as described previously (31Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 107 cells were plated in tissue culture Petri dishes (100 mm) and kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 4 h, nonadherent cells were removed, and 24 h later, adherent cells were either not treated or treated for 4 h with 100 units/ml IFN-γ (CytoLab, Rehovot, Israel) and 10 ng/ml LPS (Sigma). Isolation of Dendritic Cells (DCs)—The Flt3L method was used with minor modifications. Briefly, BM mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and recombinant human Flt3L (100 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 9 days. During the final 24 h of culture, cells were either not stimulated or stimulated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and LPS (10 ng/ml). Nonadherent DCs were harvested by gentle pipetting leaving adherent cells behind. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from cells and tissues was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, separated (15 μg) on a 1.6% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and blotted as described before (31Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled 600-bp murine PML cDNA fragment, generated by RT-PCR from total RNA of RAW264.7 cells by using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-AACTGTGGCTCCGTCCATAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACAGGGAACAACTGACCT-3′ (antisense), was used as a probe. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—100 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Reverse-iT™ 1st strand synthesis kit (ABgene, Surrey, UK) according to manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was amplified with two primers for each gene using ABsolute SYBER Green ROX Mix (ABgene, Surrey, UK) and Rotor-Gene 3000™ Real Time thermal cycler (Corbett Research, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplification conditions for all reactions were one time at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Quantitative results of real time PCR were assessed by determining the relative calculated concentration values. Using Primer3 software primers were designed as follows: mouse PML 5′-CAGGCCCTAGAGCTGTCTAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATACACTGGTACAGGGTGTGC-3′ (antisense); mouse GAPDH 5′-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3′ (antisense); human PML 5′-AGGATGTCTCCAATACAACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCTCAGACTCCATCTTGA-3′ (antisense); human IRF-8 5′-GAAGACGAGGGTTACGCTGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTCAGGAACAATTCGGTAA-3′ (antisense); human GAPDH 5′-CCTGGTATGACAACGAATTT-3′ (sense), 5′-GTGAGGGTCTCTCTCTTCCT-3′ (antisense). The primers used for PML isoforms amplification were designed using PrimerExpress software (ABI) are: PML-I 5′-CAAGATTGACAATGAAACCCAGAA-3′ (sense), 5′-GGATGACCACGCGGAACTT-3′ (antisense); PML-II 5′-GGTGATCAGCAGCTCGGAAG-3′ (sense), 5′-GGGCTCCATGCACGAGTT-3′ (antisense); PML-III 5′-AGGAAGTGAGGTCTTCCTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCCTACCTGCCTCCCCGGC-3′ (antisense); PML-IV 5′-ACCCCCAAGCAGAAGACAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCAGGAGAACCCACTTTCA-3′ (antisense); PML-V 5′-ACGCGTTGTGGTGATCAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGGCCACTCACCGATT-3′ (antisense); and PML-VI 5′-TTCCAGCCCTCAGTCTGAGGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTCTCCATGGGCTCCATG-3′ (antisense). The estimated amount of transcripts was normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression to compensate for variations in quantity or quality of starting mRNA and for differences in reverse transcriptase efficiency. The gene of interest/GAPDH ratio was expressed in percentage. The data are presented as the fold of induction for the gene of interest, e.g. the ratio between the relative mRNA levels in treated versus untreated cells. Retroviral Transduction—Retroviral pMSCV-puro and pMSCV-ICSBP-puro vectors and preparation of retroviruses were described previously (2Tamura T. Ozato K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Tot2 cells or DCs were transduced with retroviruses by spinoculation (2500 rpm for 1 h at 33 °C, twice) in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) on days 1 and 2. On day 4, puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to select for transduced cells. Transduced cells were analyzed on day 6 (Tot2) or day 9 (DCs). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from RAW264.7 cells and EMSAs were performed as described previously (32Meraro D. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Hauser H. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6224-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the human PML ISRE (sense 5′-TAAACCGAGAATCGAAACTAAGCTGGGGT-3′ and antisense 5′-ACCCCAGCTTAGTTTCGATTCTCGGTTTA-3′). Competitions were performed with a 100-200-fold excess of WT or mutated ISRE (sense 5′-TAAACCGAGCCTCGACCCTAAGCTGGGGT-3′ and antisense 5′-ACCCCAGCTTAGGGTCGAGGCTCGGTTTA-3′). Supershift assays were performed by adding 0.2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IRF-1, IRF-8, PU.1, and IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gels were run at 250 V for 2 h and were then subjected to autoradiography. FAST Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—RAW264.7 cells were grown to a final concentration of 1 × 107 with or without treatment with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) and LPS (10 ng/ml) for 12 h, and ChIP assays were performed exactly as described (33Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were incubated with 5 μg of anti-rabbit IRF-1, PU.1, and anti-goat IRF-8 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or acetyl-specific histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the murine PML promoter sequence by real time PCR (ABI 7300, Absolute quantification program) using the following primers: 5′-AGAGTTACTTCCATAGCTCCCTAGTCTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGAGGAAGTGAGACAGG-3′ (antisense). Relative quantity was calculated as described (33Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts (12 μg of nuclear/cytoplasmic) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was subjected to Ponceau S staining (Sigma). Subsequently, Western blot was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (34Hashmueli S. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Meraro D. Azriel A. Melamed D. Levi B.Z. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent ECL detection kit (Pierce). Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described by Boulware and Weber (35Boulware S.L. Weber P.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal anti-PML antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequently for 1 h with the secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit Rhodamine Red X-conjugate, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (0.3 μg/ml) in PBS, at room temperature for 5 min. Following mounting, fluorescence was visualized under Leica TCS-SP2 confocal laser scanning unit. Bioinformatics Analysis of Promoter Region—Analysis of the promoter sequence was carried out with GEMS Launcher (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany) using the FrameWorker tool which is based on the algorithms described. IRF-8 Is Essential for the Induced Expression of PML in Macrophage Cells and for the Constitutive Expression in Hematopoietic Organs—To identify genes that are regulated by IRF-8 and IRF-1 in macrophages, DNA microarray analysis was employed (18Dror N. Alter-Koltunoff M. Azriel A. Amariglio N. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Morgenstern A. Tamura T. Hauser H. Rechavi G. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we compared the expression profile of genes in peritoneal macrophages from WT and from IRF-8-/- mice, before and following 4 h of stimulation with IFN-γ and LPS. This analysis led to the identification of PML as a putative gene regulated by IRF-8 in activated macrophages (18Dror N. Alter-Koltunoff M. Azriel A. Amariglio N. Jacob-Hirsch J. Zeligson S. Morgenstern A. Tamura T. Hauser H. Rechavi G. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further validate these results, Northern blot analyses were performed using nonstimulated as well as stimulated peritoneal macrophages and the macrophage cell lines RAW264.7 (expressing IRF-8) and CL-2 (originating from IRF-8 KO mice (28Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). As seen in Fig. 1A, a strong induction of PML mRNA was observed following 4 h of treatment with IFN-γ and LPS in peritoneal macrophages and in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 6, respectively). This PML up-regulation was not observed in peritoneal macrophages and CL-2 cells originating from IRF-8 KO mice (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 8, respectively). By using real time PCR, it was clear that the mRNA level of PML was induced by 5-fold in peritoneal macrophages from WT mouse strain and by over 7-fold in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 but not in cells from IRF-8 and IRF-1 null mice (Fig. 1B). RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages were also treated with either IFN-γ or LPS alone in 8-h intervals up to 24 h (data not shown). PML transcript levels were not affected by LPS at all times. However, IFN-γ induced both IRF-8 and PML mRNA to similar levels shown in Fig. 1B for the combined treatment (IFN-γ and LPS, for 4 h), and therefore the latter was used in subsequent experiments. Taken together, PML induction was compromised only in cells from the IRF-8-/- and IRF-1-/- mouse strains. We next examined the expression level of PML in hematopoietic tissues (thymus, liver, spleen, and lung), and in a non-hematopoietic tissue (heart). mRNA was extracted from these tissues from the WT as well as from the IRF-8-/- mouse strains and subjected to Northern blot analysis. A strong mRNA signal corresponding to PML was observed in samples from the WT tissues except for the heart (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 to lane 9). We attribute this strong signal to the hematopoietic nature of these tissues, including the lung, which is rich in alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, PML mRNA levels in all samples extracted from the KO mice were significantly lower than in the WT counterparts. In fact, they were similar to the level of PML mRNA observed in the heart of the WT mice (Fig. 1C, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Taken together, the data indicated that IRF-8 is essential for the expression of PML in hematopoietic tissues. To test the effect of IRF-8 on PML protein expression, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW264.7 and CL-2 cells before and following activation with IFN-γ and LPS. Western blot analysis was performed using antibody against PML, and as seen in Fig. 1D, induced expression of PML is observed only in nuclear extract from the WT activated cells (e.g. RAW264.7 cells) in perfect alignment with the mRNA data. IRF-8 Is Essential for the Expression of Specific PML Isoform(s)—In humans, a large number of alternatively spliced PML transcripts generate a variety of PML isoforms that differ in their C-terminal sequences (see illustration in Fig. 2A). Recent studies assign specific activities to specific isoforms (36Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 37Nguyen L.A. Pandolfi P.P. Aikawa Y. Tagata Y. Ohki M. Kitabayashi I. Blood. 2005; 105: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Lin H.K. Bergmann S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2004; 431: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 39Xu Z.X. Zou W.X. Lin P. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the murine PML genomic locus exhibit similar architecture, the murine orthologues were not described yet. To characterize the hematopoietic-specific PML isoform(s), we used a human promyelocytic cell line, U937, that was either activated or not with IFN-γ and LPS for 4 h. The relative mRNA levels for PML isoforms (I-VI) as well as for IRF-8 was determined. We found that in addition to the expected induction in IRF-8 mRNA level (∼18-fold; Fig. 2B), the level of PML-I was significantly induced (10-fold; Fig. 2B). The levels of the other isoforms were marginally elevated as compared with that of IRF-8 and PML-I. This induction of PML-I was not observed in HeLa cells, and the expression levels were rather low before and following activation (data not shown). These results suggest that PML-I isoform is the major splice variant that functions in IFN-γ and LPS-activated U937 cells. The IRF-8-regulated Expression of PML Is Mediated by ISRE Element(s) Located in the PML Promoter—PML expression is induced by IFNs through identified ISRE and GAS elements in its promoter (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H. Venturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.C. Schindler C. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transcription factors involved in this induced expression were not determined. To determine the role of IRF-8 in the regulated expression of PML, reporter gene assays were performed. The characterized human PML promoter was transfected into RAW264.7 and CL-2 cells. Because IRF-8 is commonly engaged in heterocomplexes with PU.1 (3Levi B.Z. Hashmueli S. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Azriel A. Meraro D. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the role of the latter in this regulated expression was studied as well. PU.1 is a transcription factor obligatory for hematopoiesis (40Dahl R. Simon M.C. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 31: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, because PML was selected in our DNA microarray analysis of macrophages from both IRF-8-/- and IRF-1-/- mice, we hypothesized that IRF-1 may also be an important regulator of PML, and therefore its effect on PML expression was investigated. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with IFN-γ and LPS for 18 h led to the induced expression of the reporter gene (data not shown) that was equivalent to that observed following co-transfection of IRF-8-expressing vector (Fig. 3A, black columns). In addition, transfection of either IRF-1 or PU.1 expression vectors led to a significant increase in the reporter gene levels similar to that of IRF-8. Combined transfection of IRF-8 and IRF-1 led to a further increase in reporter activity. A strong additive activation of the reporter gene was observed when all three factors were cotransfected. Similar results were obtained with the CL-2 cells, lacking IRF-8. Here the reporter gene induced by IRF-8 was more profound (4-fold higher) than that of IRF-1 or PU.1 alone (Fig. 3A, white columns). This finding highlights the major role of IRF-8 in the expression of PML. To test the importance of the characterized ISRE (41Chelbi-Alix M.K. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Koken M.H. de The H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding site for IRFs in the PML promoter, 2-bp substitutions at positions 1422 and 1423 (AA to GC) were introduced to the PML reporter construct (mut ISRE). As seen in Fig. 3A (gray bars), only PU.1 could still affect this mutated reporter construct in RAW264.7 cells. The effects of IRF-8 and IRF-1 were reduced by more than 50%. This demonstrates that transcriptional activation of the PML promoter by both IRF-8 and IRF-1 is indeed mediated by this ISRE. To further characterize the binding activities of these three transcription factors, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from resting RAW264.7 cells. A DNA segment from the human PML promoter, encompassing the previously characterized ISRE element, was used as a probe (30Stadler M. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Koken M.H. Venturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.C. Schindler C. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar). A major slow migrating band was observed (Fig. 3B, indicated by arrowhead) that was competed effectively by an excess of unlabeled PML ISRE and not by an excess of mutated ISRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). This indicates that the competed band results from specific binding to the ISRE. To identify the proteins engaged in this binding, specific antibodies directed against"

https://openalex.org/W1986346193,"Recent realization that plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) may translocate and establish ligand-responsive signaling complexes in other cellular structures has motivated studies of site-specific differences in transductional pathways. GPCRs and their ligands may signal transcription and other nuclear events by two basic mechanisms. The first consists of GPCR-complex activation of messengers that enter the nucleus and there initiate cell-modifying processes without the GPCR leaving the plasma membrane. The second encompasses entry into the nuclear membranes or matrix of either GPCR ligands, which bind to non-GPCR nuclear signaling proteins, proteolytic fragments of GPCRs capable of ligand-independent signaling, or intact GPCRs with transduction-competent factors that directly initiate or regulate transcriptional events. With the second mechanism, often concurrent down-regulation of plasma membrane GPCRs terminates signaling from the cell-surface and moves it into the nuclear domain. Site-dependent differences in signals from the same GPCR provide potentials for unique cellular abnormalities attributable to defective intracellular movement and distribution of a GPCR, site-specific alterations in ligand concentration, and limited intracellular bioavailability of pharmacological agents that can interact specifically with both nuclear and plasma membrane forms of a GPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2017930243,"CDC48/p97 is an essential AAA-ATPase chaperone that functions in numerous diverse cellular activities through its interaction with specific adapter proteins. The ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX)-containing protein, PUX1, functions to regulate the hexameric structure and ATPase activity of AtCDC48. To characterize the biochemical mechanism of PUX1 action on AtCDC48, we have defined domains of both PUX1 and AtCDC48 that are critical for interaction and oligomer disassembly. Binding of PUX1 to AtCDC48 was mediated through a region containing both the UBX domain and the immediate C-terminal flanking amino acids (UBX-C). Like other UBX domains, the primary binding site for the UBX-C of PUX1 is the Na domain of AtCDC48. Alternative plant PUX protein UBX domains also bind AtCDC48 through the N terminus but were found not to be able to substitute for the action imparted by the UBX-C of PUX1 in hexamer disassembly, suggesting unique features for the UBX-C of PUX1. We propose that the PUX1 UBX-C domain modulates a second binding site on AtCDC48 required for the N-terminal domain of PUX1 to interact with and promote dissociation of the AtCDC48 hexamer. Utilizing Atcdc48 ATP hydrolysis and binding mutants, we demonstrate that PUX1 binding was not affected but that hexamer disassembly was significantly influenced by the ATP status of AtCDC48. ATPase activity in both the D1 and the D2 domains was critical for PUX1-mediated AtCDC48 hexamer disassembly. Together these results provide new mechanistic insight into how the hexameric status and ATPase activity of AtCDC48 are modulated.

The active form of CDC48/p97 is a ring-shaped complex comprised of six identical ∼90-kDa subunits containing three domains: an N-terminal domain followed by two Walker-type ATPase domains (D1 and D2) that are joined by conserved linker regions.CDC48/p97 protomers have the intrinsic ability to self-oligomerize, thereby creating the active hexameric ATPase (6Peters J.M.

Recent studies have revealed that the D2 domain of CDC48/p97 is responsible for the major enzyme activity of the chaperone (9Lamb J.R. Fu V. Wirtz E. Bangs J.D. J. Biol.

In contrast to the D1 domain, mutations in the D2 domain that inhibit ATP hydrolysis or binding displayed dominant negative properties in vivo. Ultrastructural studies of p97 have suggested that CDC48/p97 nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange in the D2 ATPase domain result in conformational changes that drive movement of the N-terminal domain.

The N-terminal domain of CDC48/p97 is also responsible for multiubiquitin chain binding necessary for the in vitro degradation of target proteins (24Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.C. J.

Bednarek, manuscript in preparation.The CDC48/p97 adapter p47 contains two independent CDC48/p97 binding sites, the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain and binding site 1 (BS1) (11Bruderer R.M.

Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The two binding sites interact independently with CDC48/p97. The UBX domain is comprised of ∼80 amino acids and shares common secondary structure organization with ubiquitin, characterized by a β-β-α-β-β-α-β β-Grasp fold. In contrast to ubiquitin, UBX domains lack the C-terminal glycine motif necessary for covalent coupling to target proteins and are typically located toward the C terminus of a variety of eukaryotic proteins that interact with CDC48/p97 (14Yuan X. Shaw A. Zhang X. Kondo H. Lally J. Freemont P.S. Matthews S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes seven UBX-containing proteins that have been shown to interact with Cdc48p. Deletion of the UBX domains abolishes their binding to Cdc48p, indicating that the UBX domain is a general Cdc48p binding module (32Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to the UBX domain, p47 contains a second CDC48/p97 interaction domain known as BS1, which is located between the C-terminal UBX domain and a conserved SEP domain of undefined function. The hydrophobic residues of BS1 in p47 are conserved in Ufd1 (located between residues 215 and 241) and are believed to be involved in the exclusive nature of interaction of CDC48/p97 with either p47 or Ufd1-Npl4 (11Bruderer R.M.

Recently we have shown that one of these proteins, PUX1, can regulate the oligomeric status and activity of the Arabidopsis CDC48/p97 ortholog, AtCDC48, as well as mammalian p97 but not the related AAA ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PUX1 association with the CDC48/p97 complex inactivated the ATPase and promoted the disassembly of the hexamer in vitro. Loss-of-function pux1 mutants displayed accelerated growth relative to wild-type plants, suggesting that PUX1 functions as a negative regulator of AtCDC48 function in vivo.Here we have defined further the interaction regions between PUX1 and CDC48/p97 and the requirement of the D1 and D2 ATPase domains for PUX1-mediated hexamer disassembly. Our results have demonstrated that the central UBX domain of PUX1 interacts through the N terminus of AtCDC48. In addition, we showed that the nucleotide status of AtCDC48 influences PUX1-mediated disassembly of the hexameric ATPase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides Used in This Study—All oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) (Table 1).

For the hydrolysis mutants, the glutamate residue of the Walker B DEXX motif was changed to glutamine (see Fig. 2A, constructs 6–11). Mutant sequences were verified by DNA sequencing and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET29A (Novagen). Wild-type and mutant H6T7-AtCDC48 proteins were expressed in the ROSETTA (Novagen) strain of E. coli at 28 °C using 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as described (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Studies—PUX1 binding assays contained 1 μg of purified E. coli-expressed H6T7-AtCDC48 or H6T7-Atcdc48 mutant proteins in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Full-length and GST-pux1 truncation mutant proteins were added at a molar ratio of 3:1 relative to H6T7-AtCDC48 or H6T7-Atcdc48 mutant proteins. Reactions were incubated in reaction buffer for 30 min on ice followed by affinity isolation using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). Isolated complexes were washed five times with binding buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by either staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250) or immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibodies (Novagen).ATPase Enzyme Activities of Atcdc48 Mutant Proteins—Kinetic analysis was performed as described previously (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with purified E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutant H6T7-Atcdc48. Assays were conducted in ATPase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with the specified ATP concentrations (0.05–0.2 mm) at 22 °C. Assay time parameters were empirically determined for all wild-type and mutant H6T7-Atcdc48 proteins to ensure that the initial rates of catalytic activity in the single time point assays were measured to ensure a fit to a Michaelis-Menten model. Colorimetric detection of phosphate product release was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate format, and absorbance measurements were measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) equipped with a 660-nm filter. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA). Activity values represent the ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.Analysis of Oligomeric Structure of Full-length and Mutant Atcdc48/pux1 Complexes—To assess the oligomeric status of full-length and mutant H6T7-Atcdc48 and the effect of PUX1-derived proteins on their structure, PUX1-derived proteins were mixed with wild-type and mutant H6T7-Atcdc48 proteins at a molar ratio of 3:1 and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. Approximately 20 μg of total protein was fractionated on a 5-ml 20–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Protein sedimentation standards were analyzed on parallel gradients. Gradients were fractionated as described (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibodies. Refractive indices of gradient fractions were used to allow comparison of different gradients.RESULTSThe PUX1 UBX Domain Interacts with AtCDC48—Recent studies have suggested that the UBX motif may serve as a general CDC48/p97 interaction domain (11Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Nat.

Consistent with this, we have shown that a fragment of the PUX1 protein containing a UBX domain with an additional 70 C-terminal amino acids (UBX-C terminus; aa 101–252; Fig. 1A) binds to AtCDC48 (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The PUX1 UBX-C terminus together with the N-terminal domain (aa 1–100) of PUX1 can mediate AtCDC48 complex disassembly in trans. When compared with the majority of UBX-containing proteins, the predicted PUX1 UBX domain, however, has several atypical features. First, the PUX1 UBX domain is positioned near the middle of the protein (Fig. 1A) as opposed to the C terminus observed in most other proteins. Second, the PUX1 UBX domain lacks a conserved phenylalanine-proline di-amino acid motif in the proposed protein loop between the S3 and S4 β-strands that is postulated to be required for the interaction of the p47 UBX domain with the N terminus of CDC48/p97 (11Bruderer R.M.

A, protein domain organization of Arabidopsis PUX1 and PUX5 (At4g15410). N-Term, N terminus; C-Term, C terminus. B, E. coli-expressed GST-UBX truncation fusion proteins of PUX1 (lanes 2 and 3) or full-length GST fusion of PUX1 (lane 4) were incubated with H6T7-AtCDC48 protein at a 3-to-1 molar ratio for 30 min at 4 °C, isolated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibody. C, PUX1-N terminus binds AtCDC48 in the presence of the PUX1 UBX (aa 88–211). GST or GST fusion protein of PUX1 was incubated with H6T7-AtCDC48. Protein complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. D, PUX5 UBX binds AtCDC48 but does not promote PUX1 N terminus binding.

I; input.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the isolated PUX1 UBX domain is sufficient for binding to AtCDC48, we examined the interaction of a GST-tagged fusion protein containing the UBX domain but lacking the C-terminal 70 amino acids with AtCDC48 in vitro. Based upon the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) protein motif search algorithm, the PUX1 UBX domain resides between amino acids 101 and 181. Unfortunately, a GST fusion protein containing this 81-amino-acid region was insoluble when expressed in E. coli (data not shown). The addition of the 13 and 30 amino acids that flank the N and C terminus of the “SMART-defined” UBX domain, respectively, was required to maintain the solubility of a GST-tagged UBX fusion protein (GST-UBX aa 88–211). As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-UBX (aa 88–211) bound to AtCDC48 with approximately the same efficiency as full-length PUX1 protein. In contrast, binding to AtCDC48 of a soluble truncated GST-UBX fusion protein, GST-UBX (aa 88–191), lacking the 19 C-terminal amino acid segment (aa 192–211), was nearly abolished (Fig. 1B).Similar to the PUX1 UBX-C terminus truncation mutant (aa 101–252) (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the GST-free UBX (aa 88–211) region greatly promoted the binding (Fig. 1C, lane 5) of the PUX1 N-terminal domain (aa 1–100) to AtCDC48 and subsequent dissociation of the AtCDC48 hexamer in trans (data not shown). In the absence of GST-free UBX (aa 88–211), we did not detect any interaction between AtCDC48 and the PUX1 N-terminal domain (Fig. 1C, lane 3), similar to previous observations (33Rancour D.M. Park S. Knight S.D. Bednarek S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54264-54274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).To determine whether all UBX domains could support the in trans PUX1 N terminus domain association with AtCDC48 or whether it was a unique feature of the PUX1 UBX, we examined whether the UBX domain from another AtCDC48-interacting PUX protein could also mediate the interaction of the N terminus of PUX1 with AtCDC48. For these experiments, the UBX domains of PUX5 (At4g15410) and PUX4 (At4g04210) were chosen to be analyzed due to their high sequence similarity to mammalian p47. PUX5, PUX4, and PUX3 (At4g22150) represent the closest Arabidopsis homologues to mammalian p47.4 As shown in Fig. 1D (lane 2), a GST fusion protein co"

Here we show that these sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events and their effect on c-Myc stability also occurs in the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These results suggest the presence of a conserved pathway in yeast that controls protein turnover in response to a specific phospho-degron sequence.

These findings have implications regarding conserved pathways for regulated protein degradation, and they validate the use of genetically tractable yeast for the study of the turnover of proteins such as c-Myc that contain this motif. The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes a helix-loop helix transcription factor that is involved in a number of crucial cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. c-Myc heterodimerizes with its partner protein, Max, and together they regulate transcription at E box sequences (CAC(A/G)TG) of a variety of important genes. Recently, it has been reported that c-Myc also regulates transcription of polymerase I- and III-dependent genes (1Grewal S.S. Li L. Orian A. Eisenman R.N. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Arabi A. Wu S. Ridderstrale K. Bierhoff H. Shiue C. Fatyol K. Fahlen S. Hydbring P. Soderberg O. Grummt I. Larsson L.G. Wright A.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Given that c-Myc is involved in many vital cellular activities, it is not surprising that it is highly regulated at several levels, including transcription, mRNA stability, translation, and protein stability (3Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 4Jones T.R. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell.

A number of animal models have shown that misregulation of c-Myc can result in tumorigenesis (7Arvanitis C. Felsher D.W. Cancer Lett. 2005; 226: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of c-Myc is observed in more than 70% of human cancers. This can involve amplification or translocation of the c-myc gene (8Popescu N.C. Zimonjic D.B. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2002; 6: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, these genetic changes are observed only in a minority of the cases, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as a change in c-Myc protein stability, may play a role in tumorigenesis. We and others have previously reported that the stability of c-Myc protein in mammalian cells is controlled by sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events on two highly conserved residues, threonine 58 and serine 62 (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell.

An initial event, phosphorylation at residue serine 62 by Ras-activated ERKs, 2The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; MBI, Myc Box I; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; S.D., standard deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; MBI, Myc Box I; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; S.D., standard deviation. stabilizes c-Myc, whereas a subsequent phosphorylation at residue threonine 58 by the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), destabilizes c-Myc. Before degradation, a cis to trans isomerization at the bond proceeding serine 62 is catalyzed by the peptidylprolyl isomerase, Pin1, allowing the stabilizing serine 62 phosphate to be removed by the trans-specific phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Singly, threonine 58-phosphorylated c-Myc can then be targeted for multiubiquitination by the E3 ligase SCFFbw7 and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (12Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.E. Harper J.W.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is frequently used as a model system to study mammalian proteins because of the ease of genetic manipulation, rapid doubling time, and the presence of conserved orthologs between a number of yeast and mammalian proteins, including a number of proteins required for proteasome-mediated degradation. For these reasons it is an excellent model system to study interactions, function, and turnover of mammalian proteins. Indeed, a number of groups have used the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, to study the ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of important mammalian cell cycle proteins (14Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Flinn E.M. Busch C.M. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Likewise, c-Myc half-life has been studied in yeast cells and found to be very short (14Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1177-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that c-Myc protein can be stabilized in this system by mutating core components of the yeast SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Specifically, c-Myc half-life has been shown to be increased in yeast strains containing mutations in Cdc53, Skp1, or the F-box protein, Grr1 (18Kim S.Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1177-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of the mammalian proteins that regulate c-Myc phosphorylation and protein stability are conserved in yeast. In this study we show that yeast orthologs of key proteins in the signaling pathways that control c-Myc phosphorylation are functionally conserved. These proteins are involved in the same sequential and interdependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events at serine 62 and threonine 58 in c-Myc that occur in mammalian cells. Additionally, these phosphorylation events have the same consequence on c-Myc protein stability. This is an important finding because it supports discoveries made in mammalian cells, it emphasizes the importance of this signaling pathway in regulating protein turnover through a conserved phospho-degron motif, it validates the use of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system to study c-Myc turnover, and it implicates this pathway in the degradation of yeast proteins and other mammalian proteins. Yeast Media and Reagents—All strains used were haploid and isogenic with BY4741 (Mata his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) or W303 (Mata ade2-1 his3-1,15 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 can1-100). Cells were grown in selective media or 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, adenine, 2% glucose at 23, 30, or 37 °C as indicated. Yeast strains were transformed with c-Myc expression constructs by lithium acetate-mediated transformation (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1986; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). To arrest cells in G1 or M phases, cells were treated with α factor (2 μg/ml) or nocodazole (15 μg/ml), respectively. Strains and Plasmids—Strains used in this study were BY4741, Δrim11, Δpph21, Δrts1, TAP-Rim11, TAP-Kss1 (Open Biosystems), W303, cdc4-1, Δgrr1 (generous gift of S. Lanker) ess1H164R, and ess1A144T (generous gifts of S. Hanes). The 2 μ plasmids pYESDEST52-MycWT, pYESDEST52-MycT58A, and pYESDEST52-MycS62A containing V5-His6 epitope-tagged c-Myc or c-Myc mutants under the control of the GAL1 promoter were generated using TOPO cloning (Invitrogen). Determination of Protein Stability—Cells were grown in a 2% raffinose synthetic complete medium overnight. Cells were then diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.3 and grown for an additional 2–4 h at the temperature indicated. A sample was removed as a negative control before the addition of galactose. Galactose was added to the media to a final concentration of 2% to induce expression of the c-myc gene from the GAL1 promoter for 1–3 h at the indicated temperatures. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 5% to stop gene expression, and samples were taken at the indicated time points. Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as described below. The optical density at 600 nm (A600) of all samples was measured, and the volume of each sample was adjusted to ensure that equal cell numbers were used. Antibodies—The monoclonal V5 antibody used to detect total c-Myc protein was from Invitrogen. The c-Myc serine 62 phospho-specific antisera were raised against the chemically synthesized phosphopeptides CKFELLP(A/T)PPLpSPSRRSG (pS is phosphoserine) in rabbits. The antisera were purified against this phosphopeptide (T only) conjugated to Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) as described (20Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). To deplete antibodies that recognized unphosphorylated c-Myc, the affinity-purified antibodies were re-purified by passing through Sulfolink coupling gel conjugated with the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide. The c-Myc threonine 58 phospho-specific antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal Cdc28 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western Blotting and Quantitation—Yeast extracts were prepared by using the rapid protein extraction procedure (21Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein from equal yeast cell numbers were separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey Blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) or 5% nonfat milk in PBS (P-Thr-58 antibody). Primary antibodies were diluted in 1:1 Odyssey Blocking buffer:PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 or in 2.5% nonfat milk PBS, 0.05% Tween (P-Thr-58 antibody). Primary antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies labeled with the near-infrared fluorescent dyes IRDye800 (Rockland, Philadelphia, PA) and Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to allow two-color imaging and band overlay. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in 1:1 Odyssey Blocking buffer:PBS, 0.05% Tween or in 1.25% nonfat milk PBS, 0.05% Tween (P-Thr-58 antibody). Blots were scanned with a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager (Lincoln, NE) to visualize proteins. c-Myc and Cdc28 protein levels were quantitated using LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager software Version 1.2. For degradation assays c-Myc total protein levels were normalized to total protein as measured by Cdc28 protein levels. Normalized c-Myc protein levels at each time point were calculated as a percentage of the first time point and graphed on a semi-log graph. Half-lives were calculated based on best-fit lines drawn using Microsoft Excel. Mean half-lives ± S.D. were calculated based on three or more independent experiments. In Vitro Kinase Assay—c-Myc expression was induced in the Δkss1 or the Δrim11 strains as described above. Cells were lysed in Ni-NTA lysis buffer (5 mm imidazole, 5 mm βME and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and c-Myc was extracted using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). c-Myc was eluted from agarose in Ni-NTA elution buffer (1:1 Ni-NTA lysis buffer:1 m imidazole). The TAP-Kss1 and TAP-Rim11 strains were grown overnight in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, adenine, 2% glucose to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. TAP-tagged proteins were extracted using calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA.) in IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). Beads were washed 3 times in calmodulin binding buffer and one time in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol). The immobilized kinases were incubated with eluted c-Myc, kinase buffer, and 12 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 60 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Unbound proteins were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Interdependent Phosphorylation of c-Myc at Threonine 58 and Serine 62 Occurs in Yeast—We and others have previously used phospho-peptide mapping and phospho-specific antibodies to demonstrate an interrelationship between phosphorylation at serine 62 and threonine 58 (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Specifically, Ser-62 phosphorylation is required before Thr-58 phosphorylation, and Thr-58 phosphorylation facilitates subsequent Ser-62 dephosphorylation (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 11Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C. Stukenberg P.T.

To perform a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify new proteins that interact with phospho-Thr-58 and phospho-Ser-62, we first investigated whether mammalian c-Myc is phosphorylated at either of these sites in yeast. We expressed c-MycWT or one of two c-Myc phosphorylation mutants, c-MycT58A or c-MycS62A, in a wild type yeast strain using the GAL1 promoter. This promoter is induced by the addition of galactose to the yeast media. After a 1-h induction of c-MycWT or the c-Myc mutants from the GAL1 promoter, total cell lysates from yeast expressing c-MycWT, c-MycT58A, or c-MycS62A were visualized by Western blot using antibodies specific for phosphorylated threonine 58 or phosphorylated serine 62. Specificity of the Thr-58 phospho-specific antibody has been previously documented (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). We recently generated new Ser-62 phospho-specific antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”). Specificity of these antibodies were demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown) and Western blotting with wild type and mutant c-Myc expressed in mammalian cells (23Arnold H.K. Sears R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2832-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and yeast (here). Using LI-COR technology we can double label for total c-Myc and phospho-c-Myc. This technology allows us to accurately quantitate the ratio of phospho-Ser-62 or phospho-Thr-58 c-Myc to total c-Myc (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1A, c-MycWT is both Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylated, with a weaker signal detected by the anti-phosopho-Ser-62 antibody (lane 1). The relative difference in Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylation detected with the phospho-specific antibodies is consistent with phosphopeptide mapping results showing a reduced amount of Ser-62 phosphorylation and increased Thr-58 phosphorylation under conditions where c-Myc is unstable (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In contrast, c-MycT58A, which lacks phosphorylation at Thr-58, showed a large increase, >10-fold, in Ser-62 phosphorylation levels compared with c-MycWT (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This increase in Ser-62 phosphorylation with the c-MycT58A mutant is also observed in mammalian cells both by phospho-peptide mapping and phospho-specific antibodies and is due to Thr-58 phosphorylation-dependent Ser-62 dephosphorylation (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell.

Nevins J.R. Means A.R. Sears R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Last, c-MycS62A does not appear to be phosphorylated on either site in yeast cells (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This is again consistent with observations in mammalian cells in which c-MycS62A lacks phosphorylation at Thr-58, forming the basis for the reported dependent relationship between Ser-62 and Thr-58 (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 10Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell.

These results are striking because they demonstrate the conservation of a pathway controlling two interdependent relationships between the Ser-62 and Thr-58 phosphorylation sites; 1) the hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser-62 followed by Thr-58 and 2) the role of Thr-58 phosphorylation in promoting Ser-62 dephosphorylation. Given that the interdependent phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser-62 and Thr-58 occurs in yeast, we next asked if phosphorylation at these sites also controls c-Myc protein stability in yeast as it does in mammalian cells. To study the stability of c-Myc protein in yeast, we used a galactose induction/glucose shut off system. Specifically, the addition of galactose to yeast cells activates expression of genes under control of the GAL1 promoter, whereas the addition of glucose rapidly shuts down the promoter. Galactose was added to yeast cells carrying a plasmid with either c-mycWT or the phosphorylation mutants under the control of this promoter to induce expression. After 1 h, expression was terminated by the addition of glucose, and samples were taken at various time points for Western blot analysis. c-Myc protein levels were quantified and normalized to the control Cdc28 protein, and c-Myc half-life was calculated. As shown in Fig. 1B, c-MycWT exhibited a short half-life in a wild type yeast strain of 8.3 min, with a mean half-life of 9.5 ± 1.6 min based on multiple independent experiments. This short half-life has previously been reported for c-Myc in both yeast cells and mammalian cells (14Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Flinn E.M. Busch C.M. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5961-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.Y.

Biol. 1984; 4: 2486-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and it is consistent with the levels of detected Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylation seen in Fig. 1A. In contrast, c-MycT58A showed a marked increase in half-life to 34.1 min, with a mean half-life of 33.9 ± 1.7 min. This approximate 4-fold increase over wild type c-Myc is consistent with results in mammalian cells where c-MycT58A is 4–6 times more stable compared with c-MycWT (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 14Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The c-MycS62A mutant demonstrated an intermediate mean half-life of 16.1 ± 1.5 min. The half-life of c-MycS62A in mammalian cells is either reported to be short like c-MycWT, or somewhat longer, but less than c-MycT58A, consistent with our observations in yeast (9Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 13Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N. Okumura F. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Taken together our results not only show that the interdependent phosphorylation of Thr-58 and Ser-62 occurs in yeast but also that phosphorylation of c-Myc at these sites appears to control c-Myc protein stability in yeast cells. That there are no known functional yeast homologues to mammalian c-Myc suggests the presence of a conserved pathway that controls protein degradation through a conserved phospho-degron. Proteins Controlling c-Myc Ser-62 and Thr-58 Phosphorylation and c-Myc Stability in Mammalian Cells Are Conserved in Yeast—The previous results suggest that functional homologues to mammalian proteins that target c-Myc for degradation are conserved in yeast. Indeed, many of the key proteins that have been implicated in controlling c-Myc Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylation and regulating c-Myc protein stability in mammalian cells have S. cerevisiae orthologs (Table 1). One of the advantages to working in yeast is its easy genetic manipulation. Thus, strains that are mutant in each of these proteins are available. We made use of these strains to ask whether deletion or mutation of yeast orthologs of proteins which destabilize c-Myc in mammalian cells affect c-Myc phosphorylation in yeast and whether this correlates with changes in protein stability.TABLE 1Mammalian proteins known to regulate c-Myc protein stability and their S. cerevisiae orthologsMammalian proteinEffect on c-Myc protein stabilityS. cerevisiae orthologsERK kinaseStabilizing (6Sears R.

Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, ERK can phosphorylate c-Myc on Ser-62, stabilizing the protein, whereas GSK3β is responsible for phosphorylating c-Myc on Thr-58, thereby destabilizing c-Myc protein. Both KSS1 and RIM11 are nonessential yeast genes, presumably due the presence of additional mitogen-activated protein kinase-like and GSK3-like kinases (28Bianchi M.W. Plyte S.E. Kreis M. Woodgett J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Casamayor A. Khalid H. Balcells L. Aldea M. Casas C. Herrero E. Arino J.

We asked whether the yeast kinase, Kss1p, affects the phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser-62 in yeast. To examine this, we expressed V5-tagged c-Myc in a wild type strain and a strain lacking the Kss1p gene (Δkss1) from the GAL1 promoter for 1 h. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and whole cell lysates were run on an SDS-PAGE gel. c-Myc protein was visualized by double labeling with one of the c-Myc phospho-antibodies as well as an antibody to the V5 tag to measure total c-Myc. The intensity of each band was quantified, and ratios of phosphorylated c-Myc to total c-Myc were calculated relative to c-Myc phosphorylation in the wild type strain. As shown in Fig. 2A, c-Myc expressed in the Δkss1 strain is decreased for phosphorylation at Ser-62 compared with that of c-Myc expressed in a wild type strain. This decrease in Ser-62 phosphorylation is presumably due to the loss of Kss1p. Residual phosphorylation of Ser-62 is likely due to other mitogen-activated protein-like kinases is the cell. This result suggests that Kss1p plays a role in phosphorylating c-Myc at Ser-62 in yeast cells, as ERK does in mammalian cells. We next examined whether the presence of Rim11p affects phosphorylation of Thr-58 in yeast. To test this, V5-tagged c-MycWT was again expressed from the GAL1 promoter for 1 h in both a yeast strain lacking RIM11 (Δrim11) and an isogenic wild type control strain. Whole cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. c-Myc protein was visualized by double labeling with one of the c-Myc phospho-specific antibodies and anti-V5 (Fig. 2B). We observed a substantial decrease in Thr-58 phosphorylation and an increase in Ser-62 phosphorylation in the Δrim11 strain compared with the wild type control. This decrease in Thr-58 phosphorylation is consistent with observations in"
https://openalex.org/W2042125331,"The HERG (human ether-à-go-go-related gene) protein, which underlies the cardiac repolarizing current IKr, is the unintended target for many pharmaceutical agents. Inadvertent block of IKr, known as the acquired long QT syndrome (aLQTS), is a leading cause for drug withdrawal by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Hence, an improved understanding of the regulatory factors that protect most individuals from aLQTS is essential for advancing clinical therapeutics in broad areas, from cancer chemotherapy to antipsychotics and antidepressants. Here, we show that the K+ channel regulatory protein KCR1, which markedly reduces IKr drug sensitivity, protects HERG through glucosyltransferase function. KCR1 and the yeast α-1,2-glucosyltransferase ALG10 exhibit sequence homology, and like KCR1, ALG10 diminished HERG block by dofetilide. Inhibition of cellular glycosylation pathways with tunicamycin abrogated the effects of KCR1, as did expression in Lec1 cells (deficient in glycosylation). Moreover, KCR1 complemented the growth defect of an alg10-deficient yeast strain and enhanced glycosylation of an Alg10 substrate in yeast. HERG itself is not the target for KCR1-mediated glycosylation because the dofetilide response of glycosylation-deficient HERG(N598Q) was still modulated by KCR1. Nonetheless, our data indicate that the α-1,2-glucosyltransferase function is a key component of the molecular pathway whereby KCR1 diminishes IKr drug response. Incorporation of in vitro data into a computational model indicated that KCR1 expression is protective against arrhythmias.

IKr, an important component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, is required for repolarization of the human cardiac action potential. Mutations in HERG (human ether-à-go-go-related gene), which encodes the α-subunit of the channel complex, are responsible for the chromosome 7-linked form (LQT2) of the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), 2The abbreviations used are: LQTS, long QT syndrome; aLQTS, acquired long QT syndrome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TM, tunicamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; WT, wild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: LQTS, long QT syndrome; aLQTS, acquired long QT syndrome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TM, tunicamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; WT, wild-type. an arrhythmia syndrome characterized by action potential prolongation and delayed cardiac repolarization. LQTS causes the atypical polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes, leading to sudden cardiac death (1Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T.

A far more commonly acquired form of LQTS (aLQTS) is precipitated by exposure to a wide range of therapeutic compounds that block HERG. aLQTS represents a significant problem for public health and the pharmaceutical industry 3Vincent, G. M. (2005) Romano-Ward Syndrome, www.genetests.org. 3Vincent, G. M. (2005) Romano-Ward Syndrome, www.genetests.org. and is typically observed in predisposed patients receiving treatment for noncardiac illnesses. Indeed, about half of all drug withdrawals since 1998 were in response to potential pro-arrhythmic effects linked to aLQTS (5Noble D.

However, mutations in the gene that encodes HERG are associated with only a small percentage of the aLQTS cases, suggesting that genetic variations in an array of other molecules modulate HERG pharmacology, either enhancing or reducing HERG block and aLQTS risk. The K+ channel regulator KCR1 (38Hoshi N. Takahashi H. Shahidullah M. Yokoyama S. Higashida H. J. Biol.

Moreover, a polymorphism associated with a reduced risk for aLQTS was shown to enhance KCR1-induced protection of IHERG from drug block in vitro (17Petersen C.I. McFarland T.R. Stepanovic S.Z.

Here, we show that KCR1 protects IHERG through an unanticipated biochemical function, α-glucosyltransferase activity. The closest known homolog of KCR1, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident yeast α-glucosyltransferase Alg10 (Die2) (18Burda P. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), protects HERG from drug block in a manner identical to that of KCR1, and conversely, KCR1 functionally substitutes for Alg10 in yeast. Additionally, KCR1 modulation of HERG pharmacology is dependent upon a fully functioning cellular glycosylation machinery. These findings reveal an unprecedented mechanism for HERG pharmacological regulation and suggest an important new avenue for developing targeted interventions for preventing aLQTS. Plasmid Constructs—The HERG cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSI (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as described previously (19Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

The HERG(N598Q) mutation was introduced into the same backbone using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The human KCR1 cDNA was subcloned into the pCGI vector for bicistronic expression with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (16Kupershmidt S. Yang I.C.-H. Hayashi K. Wei J. Chanthaphaychith S.

ALG10 (kindly provided by Dr. Markus Aebi, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) was inserted into the same vector for mammalian cell expression.

The 3′-end of the KCR1 cDNA was fused in-frame with cyan fluorescent protein by insertion into the AccI and SmaI sites of the pECFP-1 vector (Clontech). For in-frame fusion with the DsRed protein, KCR1 was subcloned into the XhoI/SacII sites of the pDsRed2-C1 vector (Clontech). pEYFP-ER was purchased from Clontech. The KCNE2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA using the upstream primer 5′-TTAATTAAGCTTGGCCATGTCTACTTTATCCAATTTCACACAG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AACTGCAGTCAGGGGACATTTTGAACCC-5′.

Cells exhibiting green fluorescence were chosen for current recordings. Membrane currents were recorded essentially as described (16Kupershmidt S. Yang I.C.-H. Hayashi K. Wei J. Chanthaphaychith S. Petersen C.I. Johns D.C. George Jr., A.L. Roden D.M. Balser J.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2263-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Data acquisition was carried out using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). A bath solution containing dofetilide was prepared from a 100 μm dofetilide stock in water on the day of experimentation. Tunicamycin (TM) was purchased from Sigma. After HERG current was recorded under control conditions, dofetilide (at the concentrations listed in each figure legend) was applied to the bath solution, followed by repetitive depolarizing pulses to +20 mV (2 s) from a holding potential of -80 mV (6 s) and by a hyperpolarizing pulse of -50 mV (2 s). The decline of relative tail currents during repetitive pulses in the presence of dofetilide was fitted to a single exponential function: y = y0 + Ae-t/τ, where y0 is the offset, A is the current amplitude under the control condition, t is the time, and τ is the time constant. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E., and statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance (Origin, MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA), with p < 0.05 indicating significance. Yeast Transformation—The culture and transformation of yeast were accomplished essentially as described previously (21Kupershmidt S. Yang I.C.-H. Sutherland M. Wells K.S. Yang T. Yang P. Balser J.R. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). KCR1 or ALG10 cDNA contained in the pGPD426 vector or pGPD426 alone was transformed into the Alg10-deficient wbp1-2/alg10 yeast strain YG649. Transformed cells (2 × 106) were counted in a hemocytometer and inoculated into uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium plus 1 m sorbitol. In parallel, the same numbers of SS328 and untransformed YG649 control cells were grown in uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium plus uracil and 1 m sorbitol. 54.5 h post-transformation, yeast protein extracts were prepared as described below. Western Blotting—Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from transfected CHO or Lec1 cells 2 days post-transfection as described previously (16Kupershmidt S. Yang I.C.-H. Hayashi K. Wei J. Chanthaphaychith S. Petersen C.I. Johns D.C. George Jr., A.L. Roden D.M. Balser J.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2263-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with anti-HERG antibody (1:400 dilution; Alomone Labs) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 5% nonfat dry milk, and proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein extracts from yeast cells were prepared by pelleting yeast cultures. The samples were heated to 70 °C in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min in the presence of glass beads, and vortexed. The pellet was extracted again by boiling, and supernatants were saved. 20 μg of the sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; Western blot analysis was performed using anti-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution; Molecular Probes) in 1× PBS/Tween plus 5% nonfat dry milk and 2% bovine serum albumin; and proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma) using ECL. Confocal Imaging—A triple-FLAG epitope was fused in-frame with amino acid 2 of the N terminus of rat KCR1 contained on the p3XFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma). Mouse atrial tumor myocyte HL-1 cells (22Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) were transfected with FLAG-KCR1 and split onto fibronectin-coated chamber slides 24 h post-transfection. 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized for 20 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in blocking solution (0.16 g of bovine serum albumin and 0.4 ml of goat serum in 10 ml of PBS). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) in PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. This was followed by three PBS washes and a 1-h incubation with rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and by three PBS washes and a 45-min incubation with Cy5-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 antibody (1:150 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA) to reveal calnexin localization. The slides were washed with PBS and mounted in AquaMount (Lerner Laboratories). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiophot LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective (ScanZOOM 1.0). The absorption/emission wavelengths used were 650/670 nm for Cy5 detection, 492/520 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate detection, 495/505 nm for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein detection, and 427/468 nm for cyan fluorescent protein detection. KCR1 Shares Sequence and Functional Characteristics with the Yeast Alg10 Protein—KCR1 (GenBank™ accession number AY845858) shows 28% amino acid identity (43% similarity) to ALG10 (DIE2; accession number D38049), which encodes the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-1,2-glucosyltransferase (Fig. 1). This enzyme is responsible for the addition of the terminal α-1,2-glucose residue to lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the yeast ER, a step that is thought to be necessary for the efficient transfer of oligosaccharides to nascent proteins (Fig. 2). Confocal imaging of FLAG-tagged KCR1 transfected into the mouse atrial tumor-derived cell line HL-1 (22Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A.

A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) and the endogenous ER marker calnexin showed that the distribution pattern of KCR1 was consistent with ER localization (Fig. 3). Similar findings were obtained when DsRed-linked KCR1 and the ER marker enhanced yellow fluorescent protein were transfected into HL-1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Schematic overview of the processes investigated in this study. The green outline indicates the ER. TM blocks the initial step in glycoprotein synthesisbypreventingthetransferofUDP-GlcNAc(blacksquares) to a dolichyl pyrophosphate lipid carrier (red ovals). In yeast, Alg10 acts by transferring the terminal glucose residue (triangles) to the pre-assembled oligosaccharide (4Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 18Burda P. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Alg10-catalyzed reaction is required for efficient transfer of the oligosaccharide to an asparagine residue on the nascent polypeptide. The magenta outline delimits Golgi-associated processes. Lec1 cells are deficient in GlcNAc glycosyltransferase, an enzyme important for Golgi-mediated glycoprotein processing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The ER marker calnexin co-localizes with a FLAG-KCR1 fusion protein in HL-1 cells.

The calnexin staining thus appears brighter than that of the neighboring cells. Slides were imaged as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether KCR1 and Alg10 also share functional characteristics in mammalian cells, we examined whether Alg10, like KCR1 (16Kupershmidt S. Yang I.C.-H. Hayashi K. Wei J. Chanthaphaychith S. Petersen C.I. Johns D.C. George Jr., A.L. Roden D.M. Balser J.R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2263-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), modulates drug block of IHERG. To this end, we transfected HERG alone or cotransfected HERG with KCR1 or ALG10 into CHO cells and assessed drug block of IHERG using the pulse protocol shown in Fig. 4A. As in our previous experiments, we added the antiarrhythmic dofetilide to the bath solution, applied repetitive pulses, and recorded IHERG tail currents (Fig. 4B). The pulse-dependent reduction of tail current amplitude was fitted to a single exponential function as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analogous to KCR1, coexpressing ALG10 and HERG significantly slowed drug block of IHERG (Fig. 4C), suggesting that KCR1 modulates drug block of IHERG via glycosylation. We incorporated the data from Fig. 4C into the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of the mammalian action potential (23Luo C.H. Rudy Y. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1071-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The results show that HERG block sufficient to evoke action potential prolongation and development of early afterdepolarizations (the cellular precursor to torsade de pointes) was reversed by KCR1 effects on IHERG equivalent to those measured in vitro (Fig. 4D). KCR1-dependent HERG “Protection” Requires Intact Glycosylation Pathways—To pursue this idea, we manipulated the cellular glycosylation pathway at multiple points (Fig. 2). TM is an antibiotic that blocks the first step of glycoprotein synthesis, thus inhibiting the synthesis of all N-linked glycoproteins. HERG-transfected or HERG/KCR1-cotransfected cells were preincubated with or without TM (1 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to current recording, and the drug response of IHERG to dofetilide was assessed using the pulse protocol shown in Fig. 4A. Preincubating HERG-transfected cells with TM did not influence the drug response of IHERG (Fig. 5A). The lack of effect of TM on HERG drug block allowed us to examine whether KCR1 is still able to influence IHERG drug block when N-linked cellular glycosylation is inhibited. Preincubating HERG/KCR1-cotransfected cells with TM prevented KCR1 from diminishing the drug sensitivity of IHERG, effectively abrogating the effects of KCR1 (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis of total cell extracts derived from transfections done with or without 1 μg/ml TM at various time points confirmed the effectiveness of the TM treatment in preventing the glycosylation of HERG, which was used as an indicator of glycosylation status (Fig. 5C). Lec1 cells are derived from CHO cells with defective N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in a defect in N-linked glycosylation and producing only truncated cell-surface glycoproteins (Fig. 2) (24Watanabe I. Wang H.G. Sutachan J.J. Zhu J. Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 51-66Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). If N-linked glycosylation is a requirement for the KCR1-mediated modulation of drug block of IHERG, the KCR1 effect should not be observed in Lec1 cells. HERG alone or with KCR1 was transfected into Lec1 cells, and drug block of IHERG was assessed using the pulse protocol shown in Fig. 4A. Coexpressing KCR1 and HERG in Lec1 cells did not influence drug block of IHERG (Fig. 6A). We used the glycosylation status of HERG to verify that Lec1 cells do not support glycosylation. As Western blot analysis showed (Fig. 6B), both the core and fully glycosylated forms of HERG are produced in CHO cells, whereas the fully glycosylated form is not produced in Lec1 cells. These findings further suggest that KCR1 modulates drug block of IHERG through glycosylation. Human KCR1 Rescues the Growth Defect Caused by alg10 Deficiency in Yeast—Although we have shown that Alg10 functionally mimics KCR1 to modulate IHERG drug block in CHO cells, it is still possible that the two proteins yield effects on HERG pharmacology through distinct mechanisms. Hence, we sought to determine whether KCR1 can supply Alg10 function in yeast. The alg10 mutant yeast strain YG651 does not have a detectable growth defect, whereas the alg10/wbp1-2 double mutant strain YG649 is growth-defective at 30 °C. The growth defect of YG649 can be complemented by the ALG10 gene (18Burda P. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We subcloned the yeast ALG10 and human KCR1 cDNAs into a yeast expression vector with a URA selectable marker and transformed them into the YG649 yeast strain, selecting for growth on uracil-deficient medium. Fig. 7A shows that YG649 transformed with either KCR1 or ALG10 exhibited robust growth on uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium after 2 days at 30 °C, whereas untransformed cells did not grow, and cells transformed with vector alone grew poorly. This suggests that, like Alg10, KCR1 can rescue the defect of the YG649 strain. In yeast, Alg10 functions as an α-glucosyltransferase, the activity of which can be assessed biochemically using the endogenous substrate CPY (18Burda P. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CPY is a yeast vacuolar protease with four N-linked oligosaccharides (27Burda P. te Heesen S. Brachat A. Wach A. Duösterhoöft A. Aebi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7160-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and therefore migrates at five different apparent molecular masses on a Western blot. We prepared yeast protein extracts from the wild-type (WT) strain SS328; YG649 mutants; and YG649 transformed with human KCR1, yeast ALG10, or the empty vector alone and performed Western blot analysis using anti-CPY antibody. Fig. 7B shows that, as expected, SS328 produced the mature form of CPY, whereas YG649 contained primarily the incompletely glycosylated -4, -3, and -2 forms of CPY. YG649 transformed with either KCR1 or ALG10 produced, in addition to the -4, -3, and -2 forms of CPY, the -1 and fully glycosylated forms, indicating that KCR1 rescues the alg10/wbp1-2 defect to the same extent as does ALG10 in yeast. This supports the conclusion that KCR1 supplies the same biochemical function as Alg10 and thus functions as an α-glucosyltransferase in yeast. N-Linked Glycosylation-induced Protection of HERG Does Not Require Glycosylation of the IKr Complex—The HERG protein contains two consensus N-glycosylation sites, Asn598 and Asn629, although a prior study indicates that only Asn598 is glycosylated (28Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because dofetilide is known to access its binding site from the cytoplasmic aspect of the channel (29Zou A. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1309-H1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas glycosylation occurs at the extracellular side, we did not expect HERG itself to be the target of the KCR1-mediated effects. Nevertheless, we assessed the effects of KCR1 on a glycosylation-defective HERG mutant and examined whether drug block of the N598Q mutant can be modulated by KCR1. HERG(N598Q) is assembled into functional channels and reaches the cell surface, although its membrane residency time is shortened compared with WT HERG (28Gong Q. Anderson C.L. January C.T. Zhou Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H77-H84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HERG alone, HERG(N598Q) alone, or HERG(N598Q) plus KCR1 were transfected into CHO cells, and drug block of IHERG was assessed using the protocol shown in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 8A, drug block of HERG(N598Q) was still modulated by KCR1. To confirm the glycosylation status of HERG(N598Q), we performed Western blot analysis, which showed a lack of the fully glycosylated form (Fig. 8B). This indicates that, although N-linked glycosylation is essential for KCR1-mediated protection of IHERG block, glycosylation of HERG alone does not render this protection.

https://openalex.org/W2078306479,"NMR-detected hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange of amide protons is a powerful way for investigating the residue-based conformational stability and dynamics of proteins in solution. Maize ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) is a relatively large protein with 314 amino acid residues, consisting of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)-binding domains. To address the structural stability and dynamics of FNR, H/D exchange of amide protons was performed using heteronuclear NMR at pDr values 8.0 and 6.0, physiologically relevant conditions mimicking inside of chloroplasts. At both pDr values, the exchange rate varied widely depending on the residues. The profiles of protected residues revealed that the highly protected regions matched well with the hydrophobic cores suggested from the crystal structure, and that the NADP+-binding domain can be divided into two subdomains. The global stability of FNR obtained by H/D exchange with NMR was higher than that by chemical denaturation, indicating that H/D exchange is especially useful for analyzing the residue-based conformational stability of large proteins, for which global unfolding is mostly irreversible. Interestingly, more dynamic conformation of the C-terminal subdomain of the NADP+-binding domain at pDr 8.0, the daytime pH in chloroplasts, than at pDr 6.0 is likely to be involved in the increased binding of NADP+ for elevating the activity of FNR. In light of photosynthesis, the present study provides the first structure-based relationship of dynamics with function for the FNR-type family in solution.

In light of photosynthesis, the present study provides the first structure-based relationship of dynamics with function for the FNR-type family in solution. Protein conformations as shown by x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are virtually dynamic entities over various time ranges in solution (1Kay L.E. Nat. Struct.

Clarifying such conformational motions at the level of the atom or residue is essential for understanding the structural stabilities of proteins and the relationships between protein structures and functions (3Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among several approaches, the H/D exchange combined with heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy is the most convenient and powerful way because it can provide residue-specific information for most residues (7Katou H. Hoshino M. Kamikubo H. Batt C.A. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For many globular proteins, this approach has identified protected cores, which are often composed of secondary structures buried inside the molecules and the cooperative interactions with partner molecules (4Polshakov V.I. Birdsall B. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 886-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Williams D.H. Stephens E. O'Brien D.P. Zhou M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 6569-6616Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar), leading to allostery (9Popovych N. Sun S. Ebright R.H. Kalodimos C.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 9: 831-838Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Detailed analyses of exchanges in the native state of cytochrome c in the presence of various concentrations of denaturants suggested a pathway to unfolding, in which groups of secondary structural elements (i.e. foldons) are unfolded sequentially through distinct folding intermediates (10Milne J.S. Xu Y. Mayne L.C. Englander S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the impact of the H/D exchange method combined with NMR analyses is obvious, its application has been limited to proteins for which the amide resonances were already assigned. Therefore, the measurements have been performed with relatively small proteins, mostly less than 20,000 in a molecular weight (11Li R. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1571-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The largest proteins examined so far are bovine β-lactoglobulin (162 residues) (7Katou H. Hoshino M. Kamikubo H. Batt C.A. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), T4 lysozyme (164 residues) (12Lu J. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4749-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and scFv (252 residues but with the same two domains) (13Freund C. Honegger A. Hunziker P. Holak T.A. Pluöckthun A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8457-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the unfolding of proteins with a molecular weight greater than 20,000 is usually irreversible, a quantitative kinetic analysis of H/D exchange has not been established for large proteins. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR, 1.18.1.2) from maize leaf is a ubiquitous protein consisting of 314 amino acid residues. It catalyzes the transfer of electrons during photosynthesis: FNR receives two electrons from ferredoxin, a one-electron carrier protein, and transfers them to NADP+ to produce NADPH (14Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The activity and affinities for substrates of FNR decreased in response to a pH change from about 8 to 6 in chloroplasts (15Carrillo N. Lucero H.A. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1058-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of maize FNR composed of the well defined FAD- and NADP+-binding domains has been solved by x-ray crystallography (16Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimita-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The FAD-binding domain (residues 1 to 153) is made up of a six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel the bottom of which is capped by an α-helix and a long loop. The NADP+-binding domain (residues 154 to 314), a variant of the typical dinucleotide-binding fold (17Karplus P.A. Walsh K.A. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 18Rossman M. Moras D. Olsen K. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), consists of a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices. The FAD cofactor is tightly bound to the FAD-binding domain with its isoalloxazine ring sandwiched between the two domains, whereas the substrate NADP+ binds to the NADP+-binding domain. The binding of FAD is essential for maintaining the native structure, so that apo-FNR, lacking FAD, is assumed to have an intermediate conformation with a largely unfolded FAD-binding domain (19Maeda M.

We have been studying the conformation and function of maize leaf FNR through heteronuclear NMR analyses with the recently achieved assignment for more than 95% of its amide protons (20Maeda M.

In the present study, taking advantage of the NMR assignment, we investigated the conformational stability of FNR using the H/D exchange of the amide protons. The results revealed the three protected core regions of FNR in which the NADP+-binding domain can be divided into two subdomains with distinct differences in their motions. Moreover, the C-terminal subdomain exhibited a pH-dependent change of motions, implying a potential role in adjusting binding affinity of FNR for NADP+ leading to effective functional control for photosynthesis in the daytime. Comparison of the apparent free energy change of unfolding (ΔGHX) estimated for each residue on the basis of H/D exchange with the global free energy change of unfolding (ΔGU) estimated from urea-induced unfolding suggests that H/D exchange provides a more reliable estimate of the stability of the core regions. Sample Preparation—The Escherichia coli strain TG1 cells transformed with the plasmids containing the DNA of FNR were inoculated in 50 ml of a Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and grown overnight. This pre-cultured medium was added to 8 liters of a LB medium, and the bacteria were further incubated at 37 °C. The expression of the proteins was initiated by adding 1mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cell density reached an absorbance of 0.65 at 600 nm. After additional incubation for 12 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by ultrasonication and the supernatant was applied to an anion-exchange column, DE52 (Whatman). The flow-through fraction was fractionated with ammonium sulfate at 40-70% saturation. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 40% ammonium sulfate, and the solution was loaded onto a gelfiltration column of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Unless otherwise noted, all chromatographic columns were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The FNR fraction was further separated by anion exchange chromatography with DEAE-Toyopearl (Tosoh, Japan). FNR was eluted by applying a linear gradient of the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 m in the same buffer, monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in theAöKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). In the last purification step, an affinity chromatography of a Fd matrix was used as described previously (19Maeda M. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Onda Y. Hase T. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17101-17107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Maeda M. Lee Y.H. Ikegami T. Tamura K. Hoshino M. Yamazaki T. Nakayama M. Hase T. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10644-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purity of FNR was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined by absorption using extinction coefficients of 10,000 m-1 cm-1 at 460 nm and 47,800 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. To obtain a uniformly 15N-labeled FNR for NMR measurements, a colony of the transformed cells was grown in 50 ml of LB medium containing 0.14 mm ampicillin at 37 °C for 6 h, and then 10 ml of the medium was inoculated with 1.5 liters of an M9 minimum medium containing 1.24 g/liters of (15NH4)2SO4 as a sole nitrogen source. The procedure used to purify 15N-labeled FNR was identical to that used for non-labeled FNR. CD and Fluorescence Measurements—CD measurements were carried out in a J-720WI spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan) using a cell with a 1-mm light path at a protein concentration of 4 μm. The results were expressed as the mean residue ellipticity, [θ], defined as [θ] = 100 θobs/lc, where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the concentration in residue moles/liter, and l is the length of the light path in cm. The temperature was controlled by a Jasco PTC-348WI peltier system. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 25 and 40 °C in a 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), using an F-4500 fluorometer (Hitachi, Japan) and at 40 °C in the same buffer (pH 6.0) in the presence and absence of 50 mm NaClO4. For the fluorescence spectrum of FAD, it was excited at a wavelength of 453 nm. The protein concentration was set at 1 μm, and the temperature was maintained by a thermostatically controlled water bath. Equilibrium denaturation experiments were done as follows. Protein solutions containing various concentrations of urea were preincubated for at least 24 h at room temperature prior to the experiments. The transitions were followed by measuring the far UV CD and fluorescence intensity of FAD. For CD measurements, the change in ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded. Relative fluorescence intensity was recorded at 530 nm with an excitation wavelength at 453 nm. The resulting transition curves were analyzed by non-linear least squares curve fitting assuming a two-state transition (21Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar) as shown in the following equation. [Signal]=(a+b[D])+(c+d[D])exp(m[D]-CmRT)1+exp(m([D])-CmRT)Eq. 1 In Equation 1, [Signal] is either the ellipticity at 222 nm or fluorescence at 530 nm, a and c are the intercepts, b and d are the slopes of the base lines for native and unfolded species, and [D] and Cm are the concentration of urea for each experiment and the concentration at the midpoint of the reaction, respectively. For the transition curves at pH 8.0 and 25 °C, when reliable pre- and post-transition base lines could not be obtained because of a scarcity of data points, the base lines in accordance with other base lines were defined manually (see Fig. 1). NMR Measurements—NMR spectra were measured at 40 °C on a Bruker DRX-800 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple-resonance probe or a DRX-600 equipped with a triple axis-gradient triple resonance probe. Two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 12,820.5 Hz (1,024 complex points) for 1H and 2,439.0 Hz (128 complex points) for 15N dimensions with four or eight scans accumulated for each free induction decay for 1.3 h. The field frequency was locked at the deuterium signal from D2O. Spectra were processed using nmrPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Baz A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11620) Google Scholar) and analyzed with nmrDraw, PIPP, and Sparky. H/D exchange was performed in the presence and absence of 2 m urea at 40 °C and pDr 8.0, and in the absence of urea at 40 °C and pDr 6.0. Exchange was initiated by manually mixing lyophilized FNR with a 25 mm d-sodium phosphate buffer at pDr 8.0. In the case of measurements at pDr 6.0, a dilution method was applied where 30 μl of a 5 mm FNR solution dissolved in a 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm sodium perchlorate at pH 6.4 was mixed with 270 μl of the same concentration of deuterium buffer at pDr 6.0. Unless otherwise stated, all NMR measurements were carried out at 40 °C and, for the measurements at pDr 6.0, 50 mm NaClO4 was added. The amide proton decays were monitored by measuring peak intensities in a series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The decay curves were fitted to a single exponential curve to obtain the apparent rate constant of exchange (kapp). The intrinsic rate constant (kint) values were calculated with the SPHERE program (23Bai Y. Milne J.S. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Global Unfolding of FNR Induced by Urea—We characterized the global stability of FNR by measuring urea-induced unfolding under several conditions. First, the apparent unfolding transitions induced by 1 day of incubation at 25 and 40 °C at pH 8.0 in the presence of various concentrations of urea were measured with far UV CD and fluorescence of FAD (Fig. 1A). The far UV CD of FNR in its native state exhibited a spectrum typical of α/β proteins (data not shown; see Ref. 19Maeda M. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Onda Y. Hase T. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17101-17107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in accord with the x-ray crystallographic structure. The addition of high concentrations of urea resulted in global unfolding, providing a CD spectrum of a random coil state. The transition curves constructed from ellipticity at 222 nm were cooperative with apparent Cm values of 5.9 m at 20 °C and 3.9 m at 40 °C, showing that the increase of temperature destabilized FNR (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). In the native state, the fluorescence of FAD is completely quenched (19Maeda M. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Onda Y. Hase T. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17101-17107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The urea-induced unfolding led to the release of FAD, producing a strong fluorescence of free FAD with a maximum at 530 nm. The transition curve after incubation for 1 day monitored by measuring the fluorescence of FAD coincided with that monitored using CD (Fig. 1A). This suggests that urea-induced unfolding is a cooperative process in which unfolding of the secondary structure and the release of FAD occur concomitantly. As expected for large proteins, the unfolding of FNR, made up of 314 amino acid residues and the cofactor FAD, was not reversible (19Maeda M. Hamada D. Hoshino M. Onda Y. Hase T. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17101-17107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar): the refolding yield after unfolding in a high concentration of urea (e.g. 8 m) was 10-30% depending on the methods and conditions used. Irreversible unfolding will lead the apparent transition curve to be dependent on the incubation time. With an increase in the period of incubation in urea, the concentration of urea required for unfolding decreased when the unfolding was monitored by the fluorescence of FAD (Fig. 1B). We also measured the unfolding transitions at pH 6.0 and 40 °C, where the catalytic activity of FNR is suppressed (15Carrillo N. Lucero H.A. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1058-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exhibiting the same effects of incubation time on the apparent stability (Fig. 1D). The apparent transition curves showed that the stability is greater at pH 8.0 than at pH 6.0. In this research, to increase the solubility of FNR required for the NMR measurements, we added 50 mm sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) to the FNR solution at pH 6.0. Because NaClO4 is a chaotropic salt known to denature proteins at high salt concentrations (24Shortle D. Meeker A.K. Gerring S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the unfolding in the presence of 50 mm NaClO4 (Fig. 1C) was also measured with the same incubation periods as in its absence. The results indicated that the apparent stability is slightly increased by a low concentration of NaClO4 as used in the present study. Although this might represent specific effects of the salt, the effects were too small to be addressed in this study. Although the unfolding transitions of FNR were not reversible, we provisionally analyzed the transition curves on the basis of an equilibrium two-state mechanism. Consequently, the apparent parameters were obtained, including the free energy change of unfolding (ΔGU) in the absence of denaturant (supplemental Table S1). H/D Exchange Monitored by NMR—The two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectrum exhibited more than 314 amide group cross-peaks (Fig. 2A), of which 285 were assigned, accounting for ∼95% assignments (excluding the N terminus and 13 Pro residues) (20Maeda M. Lee Y.H. Ikegami T. Tamura K. Hoshino M. Yamazaki T. Nakayama M. Hase T. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10644-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With these cross-peaks, we previously detected the protected amide protons by performing a H/D exchange for 3 days (20Maeda M. Lee Y.H. Ikegami T. Tamura K. Hoshino M. Yamazaki T. Nakayama M. Hase T. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10644-10653Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we carried out a far more detailed analysis of the H/D exchange kinetics, first, at pDr 8.0 and 40 °C, where pDr is a pH meter reading of the D2O solution. The H/D exchange was initiated by dissolving the lyophilized FNR sample into the pDr 8.0 buffer. At the shortest sampling time of 40 min (i.e. dead time), which included the time for preparing the NMR sample and making the first spectral measurement, many cross-peaks already disappeared (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that this rapid exchange was not caused by the dissolution of FNR (see below). In contrast, even after 17 days of incubation, more than 40 peaks of strong intensity remained, indicating the presence of highly protected amide protons (Fig. 2C). To accelerate the exchange, we added 2 m urea to the exchange buffer at pDr 8.0 and 40 °C, by which the protein was destabilized but still retained the native conformation even after 7 days (Fig. 1B). The overall exchange was accelerated in 2 m urea, although we still observed many intense peaks even after 17 days (supplemental Fig. S1C). These highly protected residues included Cys42 (β1), Met60 (β2), Tyr78 (β3), Tyr95 (β4), Val115 (β5), Cys137 (α1), and Val145 (β6) in the FAD-binding domain and Leu168 (β1), Met184 (α1), Phe201 (β2), Leu258 (α4), Cys272 (β4), Asp298 (α6), and Asn310 (β5) in the NADP+-binding domain (see Figs. 4 and 5 and supplemental Table S2). These strongly protected residues were evidently located in the core secondary structure regions as shown by the x-ray structure, i.e. the six antiparallel β strands and the α1-helix in the FAD-binding domain as well as the central β strands (β1, β2, and β4) of the β-sheet and α1-helix in the NADP+-binding domain. Judging from the peak intensities for methyl protons, most of the FNR remained in the native state after 17 days in the presence of 2 m urea.FIGURE 5Mapping of the PFs and cores on the crystal structures.

Lucero H.A. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1058-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): whereas FNR is inactive at pH 6.0, it becomes more active with an increase of pH from 6.0 to 8.0. This pH dependence is most likely to play a role in controlling the light-dependent circadian rhythm in stromas. To examine the effects of a pH shift on the conformational stability and dynamics of FNR, we further performed H/D exchange experiments at pDr 6.0 and 40 °C (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Here, we initiated the exchange reaction by diluting the concentrated FNR solution in H2O with D2O. The exchange pattern was generally similar to that at pDr 8.0, indicating that the method initiating the H/D exchange did not affect the observed kinetics. However, we found notable differences for several residues, particularly those located in the NADP+-binding domain: whereas their peaks disappeared completely at the first measurement at pDr 8.0, the time course of exchanges could be followed at pDr 6.0. Estimation of Protection Factors—The exchange kinetics measured at pDr 8.0 in the presence and absence of 2 m urea as well as at pDr 6.0 was analyzed by plotting a series of peak intensities against the incubation time (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S2). In all the H/D exchange experiments, the time ranges of exchanges widely varied depending on the residues. Generally, the reaction was faster in the order: pDr 8.0 in 2 m urea > pDr 8.0 in the absence of urea > pDr 6.0. In the absence of urea at pDr 8.0, among 269 assigned residues, 117 were exchanged completely within the first sampling period of 30 min, and are referred to as “the lower limit residues” (i.e. the protection is too low to quantify). In contrast, about 35 residues retained their initial peak intensities even after incubation for 17 days, and are referred to as “the upper limit residues” (i.e. the protection is too high to quantify). We excluded an additional 58 residues from the kinetic analysis, for which reliable data were not acquired because of a severe overlap of resonances or too large scattering of the peak intensity for unknown reasons, referring to them as “kinetics-undetermined residues.” Consequently, the remaining 75 residues revealed a solid time-dependent decrease in peak intensity. For these residues, we assumed a first-order kinetics and fitted each time course to a single exponential curve, to estimate the apparent exchange rate constant (kex). Considering the presence of highly protected upper limit residues, the smallest kex one can determine here was about 2 × 10-6 min-1, corresponding to 95% of intensity remaining after 17 days. On the other hand, the lower limit residues, with 5% of intensity left at 30 min, defined the largest kex to be about 0.1 min-1. Similar analyses were performed both at pDr 8.0 in the presence of 2 m urea and at pDr 6.0. The dead time measurements were 60 min at pDr 8.0 in the presence of 2 m urea and 50 min at pDr 6.0. The numbers of lower limit residues, residues that revealed the exchange rate constant, and upper limit residues were 128, 86, and 14, respectively, at pDr 8.0 in 2 m urea, and 81, 98, and 49, respectively, at pDr 6.0 (supplemental Figs. S1, S2, and Table S2). These numbers also indicate that the overall exchange was slower at pDr 6.0, suggesting that the intrinsic exchange rate, which increases along with pH, is an important factor for determining the observed kinetics. To take into account the variation in the exchange rate depending on the type of amino acid residue and neighboring residues, we calculated the protection factor (PF) for each residue at pDr 8.0 and 6.0. PF is defined as kint/kex = PF, where kint is the exchange rate constant in the random coil conformation (23Bai Y. Milne J.S. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 25Connelly G.P. Bai Y. Jeng M-F. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The profile of PF against the residue number shows significant variation ranging from 103 and 1010 under the different conditions. Here, the lowest PF values to be determined assuming that 5% of peak intensity remains at the first time point are 104-105 at pDr 8.0 and 102-103 at pDr 6.0, where the range of PF is produced by the variation of kint. For the same reason, the highest PF values to be determined with 95% of intensity remaining after an incubation period of 17 days at pDr 8.0 are 108-1010 depending on the residues (supplemental Table S2). They are 106-108 at pDr 6.0 according to 95% remaining intensity after 23 days. In other words, the true PF values of lower limit residues and upper limit residues can be smaller and larger, respectively, than these limiting values. Protected Core Regions—The plots of PF ag"

Fusion protein E1 and its envelope companion E2 are both anchored in the viral membrane and form an external shell with protruding spikes. In acid environments, mimicking the early endosomal milieu, surface epitopes in the virus rearrange along with exposure of the fusion loop. To visualize this transformation into a fusogenic stage, we determined the structure of the virus at gradually lower pH values. The results show that while the fusion loop is available for external interaction and the shell and stalk domains of the spike begin to deteriorate, the E1 and E2 remain in close contact in the spike head. This unexpected observation points to E1 and E2 cooperation beyond the fusion loop exposure stage and implies a more prominent role for E2 in guiding membrane close encounter than has been earlier anticipated.

Membrane fusion is important in biology to allow exchange of materials between compartments enclosed by lipid bilayer membranes. Naturally, viruses utilize such ways of genome delivery. Two different mechanisms of virus fusion are observed: the Class I mechanism, seen in viruses where the fusion protein structure is dominated by α-helix folding, like the influenza and the HIV, and the Class II mechanism, represented by viruses where the envelope proteins are dominated by β-sheet structures like the Tick Borne Encephalitis virus and the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 2The abbreviations used are: SFV, Semliki Forest virus; Cryo-EM, electron cryomicroscopy; CTF, contrast transfer function; MES, 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; D, domain; PDB, Protein Data Bank. in the Flavi and Toga virus families, respectively (1Hammar L.

The crystal structure of E1* reveals an elongated molecule, mainly folded into β-sheets and interconnecting loops (15Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A.

Here the DIII spreads around the spikes and align with those from neighboring spikes, leaving openings at the 5- and 2-fold axes. In the model the DII rises at a slant from the shell forming the sides of the spike and the lower parts of its bulky head (15Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Exposure of the soluble E1* to a low pH in the presence of a target membrane results in a membrane-inserted, vertically oriented homotrimer (E1*HT) (12Gibbons D. Reilly B. Ahn A. Vaney M. Vigouroux A. Rey F. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3514-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the fusion loops inserted into the target membrane. In the E1*HT, the core is formed by DI and DII, while the DIII is translocated to partly cover the hinge region in DII of a neighboring monomer. The C-terminal sequence is following the cleft between the monomers pointing toward the membrane-inserted fusion peptide. This fold-back generates a hairpin-like configuration with the fusion peptide and envisioned transmembrane region at the same end of the molecule (2Kielian M. Virology. 2006; 344: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). An E1 homotrimer has earlier been observed to form in virions under similar acidic conditions (9Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 6940-6946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), why the E1* trimerization would reflect a native phenomenon. To reveal stages of transformation of the SFV into a fusogenic configuration, we have exposed samples of the virus to a series of decreasing pH. The acid-treated SFV particles were subsequently plunged frozen in vitreous ice, and micrographs acquired. The micrographs were digitized, and the virus structures reconstructed. We earlier reported a gradual increase of the virion diameter after short incubations at pH 7.4, over pH 6.2, and down to pH 5.9 (8Haag L. Garoff H. Xing L. Hammar L. Kan S.T. Cheng R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4402-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The expansion occurred concomitant with a reciprocal relocation of assumed E1 and E2 densities in the shell and lower part of the spike region. In the present study, we determine the SFV structure at pH 5.8, and improve earlier reconstructions of the virus at pH 7.4 and 5.9. By mapping high density centers in the structure, assigned as density nodes, the relocations of stably folded subdomains in the glycoproteins could be followed at the different pH. The results obtained point to unexpected features of the alphavirus fusion mechanism, where the E2 protein may play an essential role after the fusion loop is exposed. Virus Purification and Low pH Treatment—The SFV was propagated and purified essentially as described previously (8Haag L. Garoff H. Xing L. Hammar L. Kan S.T. Cheng R.H.

Briefly, monolayers of BHK-21 cells were grown in 225-cm2 T-flasks using Glasgow’s modified Eagle’s minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES (Sigma), and 20 μg/ml cholesterol. At 90% confluency, the cells were infected with SFV (clone pSFV4) and further incubated at 37 °C. Virus was harvested at 18-h postinfection. The virus-containing supernatant was cleared from cell debris, and the virus pelleted at 17,000 × g, 4 °C for 18 h. The virus pellet was soaked in TNM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 pH 7.4) and applied to isopyknic centrifugation in a 10-30% (w/w) potassium tartrate gradient in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.4, run at 100,000 × g for 5 h at 4 °C. The virus was eluted from the gradient, diluted with TNM buffer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 h at 4 °C. The finally obtained virus pellet was soaked in TNM buffer and kept at 4 °C to avoid structural damage. The quality of the virus was controlled by SDS-PAGE and negative stain EM. For acid treatment, an adequate concentration of the virus was mixed with a predetermined volume of 50 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 5.6, to reach the final pH. This was determined from measurements in a large volume model system to obtain an accurate measure of the final pH. After 60 s of treatment, the sample was applied on a cryo grid, plunge-frozen into liquid ethane, transferred to liquid nitrogen, and subsequently to liquid helium for microscopy imaging. Cryo-EM and Three-dimensional Reconstruction—Images of the frozen-hydrated SFV particles were recorded on a Kodak SO163 electron film using a JEM3200F field emission gun (FEG) transmission electron microscope equipped with the top-entry type liquid helium cold stage at a magnification of ×40,000 and an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Micrographs at 1-μm underfocus were digitized on a Zeiss SCAI scanner using a 7-μm step size that was further bin-averaged to give a step size of 14 μm corresponding to 3.5 Ä per pixel at the specimen. Micrographs from every pH condition displaying well separated virus particles were analyzed. Individual intact particles were manually boxed out to generate a stack of more than 3,000 particles using the RobEM software package. The determination of orientation parameters and their iterative refinement were done using the model-based polar Fourier transform routines (21Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 22Cheng R.H. Kuhn R.J. Olson N.H. Rossmann M.G. Choi H.K. Smith T.J. Baker T.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The final reconstructions were computed with low-pass filtering set to suppress frequencies higher than 1/15 Ä-1, which is within the first zero of the contrast transfer function (CTF). The resolution was determined by the Fourier shell correlation at 0.5 coefficient cut-off and ranged from 11 to 15 Ä in the different samples. The structures to be compared were recalculated to the same resolution of 15 Ä. The number of particles included in the computation of the different reconstructions were 834 (pH 7.4), 730 (pH 5.9), and 1,205 (pH 5.8) with orientations well covering the asymmetric unit. The three-dimensional visualization was mainly carried out with the Iris explorer software (NAG, Inc., Downers Grove, IL) with custom-made modules. 3L. Bergman and R. H. Cheng, unpublished data. Fitting the X-ray Atomic Structure of E1* into Cryo-EM Density Maps of SFV at Different pH—The atomic structures of the external domain of SFV glycoprotein E1 (E1*) and its homotrimer (E1*HT), were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession codes: 2ALA and 1RER). Our Cryo-EM density maps were visualized using the program O run on Linux workstations. The E1* crystal structure (PDB: 2ALA) (16Roussel A. Lescar J. Vaney M.C. Wengler G. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Structure. 2006; 14: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was fit into our CTF-corrected 11-Ä resolution density map of SFV at pH 7.4. To achieve a good fit of E1* also in the low pH density maps we initially applied the entire E1* as one rigid body. However, the fit was not appropriate unless the E1* structure, which represents a neutral form, was treated as three independent rigid bodies (DI, DII, and DIII). These three rigid domains were fit into low pH density maps based on the match of the gravity centers between the density and coordinates. The evaluation of the fit was done considering that the acid configuration would originate from the E1 domain fitting in the pH 7.4 density map and the constraints implied by the icosahedral symmetry of the whole virion. The rigid domains were manually rotated about the hinge axes to fit into the Cryo-EM-derived densities. The E1* fitting procedures were based on the maximal fit of the independent domains into four quasi-equivalent E1* monomers densities. Consequently, the independent fitting generated our E1* model of the acid conformation. The final optimized fitting was judged both by visual inspection and program O calculations. Morphological Features, a pH-dependent Swelling—Three-dimensional SFV reconstructions derived from particles exposed to pH values of 7.4, 5.9, and 5.8 were compared at the similar resolution to reveal conformational changes related to the transformation into a fusogenic mode. Whereas an apparent feature of the acid-treated virus is a swelling, the overall particle morphology with icosahedral symmetry and T = 4 arrangement of the 80 tri-lobed spikes is essentially retained (Fig. 1). The increased diameters are evident by comparing the SFV structures in cross-section views and in one-dimensional radial average density plots (Fig. 1B). The comparison shows that the diameters of the virus particles gradually increase as the pH is lowered. This not only occurs down to pH 5.9, as was earlier observed (8Haag L. Garoff H. Xing L. Hammar L. Kan S.T. Cheng R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4402-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Hammar L. Markarian S. Haag L. Lankinen H. Salmi A. Cheng R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7189-7198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but further down to pH 5.8. Thus, particles expand from 707 to 721 Ä and 727 Ä in diameter in response to 60-s treatments at pH 5.9 and 5.8, respectively. As seen in the one-dimensional plot (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), the lipid bilayer essentially retains its thickness and its radial location, whereas the external protein layer expands. This expansion comes with (i) an elongated limb 4Through the years, different authors have used different terminology to describe the details of the virus morphology. Observing the structure of the SFV, Mancini et al. (32Mancini E.J. Clarke M. Gowen B.E. Rutten T. Fuller S.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) used “skirt” to indicate the shell region, and “subskirt” for the limb region. The morphological region that we term limb (here and in previous publications (8Haag L. Garoff H. Xing L. Hammar L. Kan S.T. Cheng R.H.

The height of the stalk region measures 19 Ä in the neutral virion and elongates to 21 and 22 Ä in the pH 5.9- and pH 5.8-treated virions, respectively (Fig. 2). As found earlier (8Haag L. Garoff H. Xing L. Hammar L. Kan S.T. Cheng R.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4402-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the openings at the 2- and 5-fold axes in the glycoprotein shell are enlarged in the acid structures (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Side (A) and top (B) views of SFV 3-fold spikes at pH 7.4 (Control) and pH 5.8 (Acid). In this surface rendering of the symmetrical 3-fold spike structure the same radial color code as in the legend to Fig. 1B is applied. The radii marked in A are based on maxima and minima in the radial average-density curve, shown in the one-dimensional plot of Fig. 1B. The expansion of the virion at the low pH is contributed by a rise in the limb and stalk regions. Meanwhile, the width of the spike is narrowed, and the limb region becomes slimmer and more elongated than in the control. There is a widening inbetween pillar structures in the stalk region (asterisk). Top views of the spikes demonstrate that the hole, located in the center, has expanded in the acid structure, and there is a partial reshaping of the spike head morphology.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From a more detailed examination of the 3-fold spikes of the control and acid structures, a series of differences are observed, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, comparing the spikes of the virus at pH 7.4 (control) and pH 5.8 (acid). As the whole shell-spike layer is lifted outwards, away from the lipid bilayer, the elongated limbs become thinner. A separation of elongated structures in the stalk region can be seen in the acid structure (Fig. 2A). The width of the spike is narrowed from 100 to 95 Ä, as seen in the side and top views of the 3-fold spikes. In addition, the central hole of the spike is widened in the acid structure (Fig. 2B). Fitting of E1* Crystal Structure into Cryo-EM Density Map to Assign E1- and E2-related Density Nodes—In a protein, secondary structures like β-sheets represent relatively nonflexible atomic arrays (23Bhella D. Ralph A. Yeo R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Jeng T.W. Crowther R.A. Stubbs G. Chiu W. J. Mol.

These would be the plausible source of high density centers (nodes), seen in the Cryo-EM-derived structure at high stringency. We assign the individual nodes by letters from top of the spike to the shell region, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. When co-localization of stable secondary structures with density nodes are taken into account in molecular fitting or modeling into a Cryo-EM density map, this provides accuracy in the fitting.FIGURE 4Demonstration of pH-dependent movement of density nodes in the SFV spike structure. Side (A) and top views (B-H) of a series of virtual sections through the head, stalk, and shell regions of the 3-fold spike are shown with the radial location indicated. The gradient color-coding, from blue to red, represents σ = 1to σ = 5 in the reconstructions. Major nodes are labeled as assigned in the legend to Fig. 3. The sections of the acid structure are cut at a 7-10 Ä higher radius than in the control to account for the expansion. The side view section (A) is cut to pass through nodes a, b, c, e, g, and i. The head of the spike holds nodes a, b, and c, the stalk region encompasses nodes d, e and f, and the shell region holds nodes i, g and h (node h is not seen in this side view section). In the acid structure, node a is lifted relative to b; node b moves out of this vertical section; nodes c and c′, to which the distal DII of the E1* is fit in the control structure, are moved toward the center of the spike in the acid structure. The horizontal section of the spike head (B), which passes through nodes a and b shows an overall anticlockwise turning of node b, relative to node a in the acid structure (r = 332 Ä in Control; r = 342 Ä in Acid, respectively). A series of sections through the stalk (C-E) show the torsion of triangles connecting the major nodes of the trimeric spike of the control and acid structures. Nodes c, e, and g follow anticlockwise turning (dashed triangles); whereas, node f turns clockwise (solid triangles). Node d, which connects the three lobes of the spike (r = 312 Ä, Control) appears with less density in the acid structure (r = 321 Ä, Acid), along with widening of the hole of the spike center in the acid structure. The pH-dependent separation in the stalk region is here seen as a separation between nodes e and f (black asterisk in D, as is also observed in the σ = 1 surface rendering in Fig. 2); whereas, nodes e and f ″ keep connected in the acid structure (r = 303 Ä, Acid). A series of sections through the shell (F-H) are shown. Node h follows the anticlockwise turning (dashed triangles). Node i viewed through both 3-fold and the 2-fold axes are shown in G and H, showing that the contacts (indicated by black small triangles) of node i with its neighbors are widened in the acid structure. The black arrow (see H, Control) shows the convergence point of E1 and E2 proteins toward the limb region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 3-Ä refined atomic resolution structure of soluble external domain of E1, E1*, is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 2ALA, Roussel et al. (16Roussel A. Lescar J. Vaney M.C. Wengler G. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Structure. 2006; 14: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). This is a fine-tuning of the earlier published Lescar et al. structure (15Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In the SFV, the domains DI and DIII of the E1* fit well in the shell, around the 2- and 5-fold axes, whereas the DII packs with a dimeric interaction between the spikes. Thus, the DII of the three E1* molecules that fit in the 3-fold spike are in contact with their quasi-2-fold (q2-fold)-related counterparts at the interfaces between projections (15Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The fitting of the E1* crystal structure into the shell-spike layer of our Cryo-EM-derived SFV structures points to a similar general organization of nodes and β-sheet domains within the contours of the molecule (Fig. 3). The fitting locates the DI and DIII to the shell region of the external SFV structure in an orientation such that the C terminus in DIII (Leu384) is connected to the limb. The DII of the model fit atomic E1* crystal structure follows a path on the outside of the spike toward the spike head (Fig. 3). Density analyses imply that DI of E1 contributes to nodes g and h, and the DIII to node i. Furthermore, based on relative distances, the first part of the long DII, with its twisted β-sheet structure, would fit with node e, while, again based on distance calculation and the assumed rigidity of the E1* molecule, node c in the bottom of the head would represent the distal double β-hairpin part of the DII. Looking back at the fitting of E1* in the spike structure, it is evident that the fusion loop and the cholesterol determinant β-turn at the tip of the molecule, would be located distal to the outermost region of node c. Like the E1 protein, E2 would be folded with a series of stable domains, giving rise to density nodes in the spike structure. If the fitting of E1* holds, the remaining density of the spike, with nodes a, b, d, and f would be formed by the E2 protein (Fig. 3). Nodes a and b are in the bulky head of the spike, and node d is the wing connector. Below node d, node f is an elongated structure that follows nodes e and g down to the shell. Thereby E2 would pass the shell region inside node i of E1. Therefore, E2 would be an elongated protein that follows an essentially vertical path inside E1, and covers E1 in the spike head. The E1-E2 dimeric heads are connected into a trimeric structure by node d of E2. Based on these node assignments, we will discuss the interplay of the two proteins during pre-fusion rearrangements induced by a lowered pH. Demonstration of pH-dependent Node Relocation in the SFV Spike Structure—To demonstrate the relocation of the glycoproteins enforced by a low pH, the 3-fold spike is virtually cut in a vertical plane, following the orientation of one E1 subunit according to our fitting of E1*, as shown in Fig. 4A. The density nodes assigned are represented by a color-coded intensity scale, as described in the legend. All the nodes identified in the control structure can also be traced in the acid structure. Compared with their position in the control structure, the nodes c, e, g, and i, corresponding to the E1 protein (Fig. 3), have all moved upwards into a more vertical position relative to the membrane in the acid structure (Fig. 4A). In the spike head, nodes a and b remain at a higher radius than node c of the E1, but with a slight relocation relative to each other. The density node b has moved partly out of the vertically cut plane, as can also be seen in a horizontal cut through the spike head (Fig. 4B). Details of the acid-induced structural changes are further analyzed in a series of virtual sections from the head, via stalk, to shell following the 3-fold axis (Fig. 4, B-H). The cutting radii are chosen to reveal the same nodes in the control and acid structures. The density node relocations in the spike head follow an overall anticlockwise rotation in the acid structure (Fig. 4"

The receptor is expressed both in the periphery, where pituitary activation underlies the major role of CRF activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis during stress, and in brain, where extrahypothalamic CRF activates central receptors to mediate mood and affect (12Heinrichs S.C.

Ther. 2004; 311: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).A two-site binding and activation model has been proposed for agonist binding to class B GPCRs (13Hoare S.R. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recent pharmacological data suggest that activation of the CRF1 receptor is initiated by the C terminus (∼30 amino acids) of the peptide ligand interacting with relatively moderate affinity to the extracellular N-terminal domain (ECD) of the CRF1 receptor (14Hoare S.R. Sullivan S.K. Schwarz D.A. Ling N. Vale W.W. Crowe P.D. Grigoriadis D.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3996-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This primary interaction has the effect of increasing the local concentration of the ligand and positions its N terminus (∼10 amino acids) in the optimal orientation to interact with the juxtamembrane region of the receptor, thus inducing the conformation change in the receptor required for activation and signaling. The model has been built through a series of binding and mutagenesis studies of both the CRF1 receptor and its ligands (14Hoare S.R. Sullivan S.K. Schwarz D.A. Ling N. Vale W.W. Crowe P.D.

One such study showed that a deletion mutant of the CRF1 receptor lacking the entire ECD was still capable of signaling but only in the presence of high (micromolar) concentrations of CRF (14Hoare S.R. Sullivan S.K. Schwarz D.A. Ling N. Vale W.W. Crowe P.D. Grigoriadis D.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3996-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This observation supported the two-site binding model hypothesis suggesting that the role of the ECD appears to be crucial in “trapping” the agonist ligand thus achieving physiologically relevant concentrations to activate the receptor (14Hoare S.R.

A. 2000; 97: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Peptide antagonists derived from native ligands have played a major role in the current level of understanding of class B GPCRs. For the CRF1 receptor, it was shown that truncation of the N-terminal 8 residues (CRF9–41) results in a loss of agonism but not the ability to bind to the receptor, thus creating an antagonist (21Rivier J. Rivier C. Vale W. Science. 1984; 224: 889-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The remaining C-terminal sequence of CRF was predicted and demonstrated to be predominantly α-helical in the presence of helix-stabilizing additives (22Pallai P.V. Mabilia M. Goodman M. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This finding was applied in the design of the potent peptide antagonist astressin. The increased potency of astressin versus CRF9–41 was achieved through selective residue substitutions and by introducing a covalent constraint between residues 30 and 33, which is presumed to stabilize the α-helical conformation (23Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although deriving most of its binding affinity from an interaction with the ECD of the CRF1 receptor, it was recently shown that astressin can induce receptor internalization (24Perry S.J. Junger S. Kohout T.A. Hoare S.R. Struthers R.S. Grigoriadis D.E. Maki R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11560-11568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition a 10-fold decrease in the affinity of astressin binding was observed when the juxtamembrane region of the receptor was removed (14Hoare S.R. Sullivan S.K. Schwarz D.A. Ling N. Vale W.W. Crowe P.D. Grigoriadis D.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3996-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together, these facts imply that astressin interacts both with the ECD at high affinity, as well as with the juxtamembrane domain, albeit with lower affinity, of the receptor. This property distinguishes astressin from truncated peptide antagonists developed by Yamada and co-workers (25Rijkers D.T. Kruijtzer J.A. van Oostenbrugge M. Ronken E. den Hartog J.A. Liskamp R.M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Yamada Y. Mizutani K. Mizusawa Y. Hantani Y. Tanaka M. Tanaka Y. Tomimoto M. Sugawara M. Imai N. Yamada H. Okajima N. Haruta J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which have equivalent potencies to astressin but are significantly smaller (12 amino acids) and are pure competitive antagonists with no effect on receptor trafficking. Because these minimal peptide antagonists interact only with the ECD and because they have superior solubility characteristics versus astressin, CRF, or the urocortins, we selected one such peptide, cyclic corticotrophin-releasing factor residues 30–41 (cCRF30–41), to study the molecular determinants of ligand binding to the ECD of the CRF1 receptor. cCRF30–41 corresponds to the 12 C-terminal residues of human CRF with the exception of residues 30 and 33, which are cyclized by a lactam bridge (Fig. 1A). The binding affinity of cCRF30–41 was most appropriate for NMR study; however, the most potent version of this 12-residue peptide family (YAM19) is equipotent to astressin and is shown for comparison in Fig. 1B.In these studies, binding of cCRF30–41 to the isolated ECD of human CRF1 receptors was characterized by using a combination of NMR spectroscopy techniques (27Megy S. Bertho G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Evrard-Todeschi N. Coadou G. Segeral E. Iehle C. Quemeneur E. Benarous R. Girault J.P. J. Biol.

A model of cCRF30–41 was constructed while bound to this recombinant ECD using transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (trNOE), in which a sufficient off-rate of the peptide from the ECD allowed information about interproton distances to be derived from the bound state of the peptide (30Clore G.M. Gronenborn A. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 31Clore G.M. Gronenborn A. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar). In addition, the primary points of interaction with the ECD (the binding epitope) were characterized using saturation-transfer difference NMR (STD NMR) (32Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 33Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the peptide is unstructured in solution and adopts an α-helical conformation upon binding to the ECD, burying a largely hydrophobic face that includes two amide functionalities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic Peptides—Human CRF, astressin, biotin-astressin, YAM19, and cyclic CRF30–41 were synthesized by solid-phase methodology on a Beckman Coulter 990 peptide synthesizer using t-Boc-protected amino acids and then was HPLC-purified. Peptide quality was assessed by analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry.Biotinylated Peptides—Using the above methodology, the N-terminal dPhe of astressin was replaced with dTyr-Gly(γ-biotin)-Lys to create biotinylated astressin (bAs). The affinity of bAs for full-length CRF1 receptors was within 2-fold of unmodified astressin. Similarly, C-terminally deamidated astressin (bAS-OH) was produced which had ∼2000-fold lower binding affinity than bAs and was used to generate our ligand affinity resin. Biotinylated CRF was purchased from Bachem AG (catalog number H-5756).Isotopically Labeled Peptides—The cCRF30–41 peptide was isotope-labeled at specific amino acids with 15N and 13C using two separate schemes. The first scheme specifically labeled the residues Ala31, Asn34, Leu37, Met38, and Ile41. The second scheme uniformly labeled the residues Arg35, Leu37, Met38, and Ile40. Labeled reagents for the synthesis included the following: sodium acetate-d3 (99.9%), acetic acid-d4 (99.9%), and D2O were purchased from Isotec, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The l-[3-13C]alanine-N-t-Boc, l-[U-13C,15N]asparagine-N-Fmoc, N-β-trityl, l-[U-13C,15N]leucine-N-Fmoc, l-[methyl-13C]methionine, l-[1,2-13C]glutamic acid-N-t-Boc, γ-benzyl ester, and l-[U-13C,15N]isoleucine-N-Fmoc were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). The peptide used for the second labeling scheme was synthesized by Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland).Expression and Purification of trx-ECD—Amino acids Ser1–Ala96, comprising the entire N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) (excluding the 23-amino acid signal peptide) of human CRF1 receptor, were cloned into the pET-32a vector and expressed in Origami™ pLysS Escherichia coli as a C-terminal fusion protein with thioredoxin (trx). The trx-ECD fusion protein was expressed as inclusion bodies, which were solubilized with 6 m urea and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography (Invitrogen). Monomeric trx-ECD was then isolated by gel filtration chromatography using a HiPrep 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Properly folded trx-ECD was isolated by running the monomeric pool over a peptide ligand affinity column (bAS-OH immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose). Finally, trx-ECD was purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C4 column to remove salts and buffers, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C until needed. Details of the expression and purification are provided in the Supplemental Material.Blot Overlay Binding Assay—To analyze the results of ligand affinity chromatography, fractions containing trx-ECD were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Protran nitrocellulose (0.2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell), and visualized with Ponceau S protein stain to compare protein levels in each lane. After destaining, the blots were blocked with 5% milk in TTBS for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 1 μm bAs or 5 μm biotinylated CRF. To reveal the extent of binding, the washed blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The blots were then washed and developed with WestPico ECL substrate (Pierce) and exposed to film.Scintillation Proximity Binding Assay (SPA)—Radioligand binding experiments were performed in SPA format using streptavidin-coupled polystyrene imaging beads (Amersham Biosciences). The trx-ECD fusion protein was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit (Pierce) and resulted in an average of two biotin labels per protein. Reactions were performed in singlet and consisted of 25 μl of unlabeled peptide at the indicated concentrations, 25 μl of radiolabeled [125I]astressin (∼300 pm, 2,200 Ci/mmol; custom iodination from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 50 μl of trx-ECD/SPA beads added sequentially in assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) to low binding 96-well plates (Corning Glass, Palo Alto, CA). The reaction was shaken and allowed to settle at room temperature for 90 min prior to reading with a CCD imaging system (Viewlux, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).A single-site binding model fit best for all displacement binding experiments. Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation with a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) fit using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using Kd values of 10 nm for [125I]astressin as determined from saturation binding experiments. Hill slopes for all curves routinely ranged from -0.9 to -1.2.NMR Experiments—All NMR samples were prepared with a peptide concentration of 2 mm in 50 mm sodium acetate-d3, pH 4.5, 90% H2O, 10% D2O + 0.01% NaN3. Samples used for the trNOE experiment were 100 μm trx-ECD (20:1), and two-dimensional STD NMR experiments were performed with a 40 μm concentration of trx-ECD (50:1), and one-dimensional STD NMR for epitope mapping was done with 20 μm trx-ECD (100:1).Spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 500-MHz spectrometer using a 4-mm SEI flow cell probe equipped with z axis gradients. Water suppression was achieved using the double-pulsed field gradient spin-echo scheme with 2-ms gaussian-shaped inversion pulses for selective inversion of the water resonance and a gradient ratio of 3:1 (34Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 37 °C because the off-rate of the peptide at this temperature was more favorable for the trNOE experiments.Sequential 1H assignments for the peptide were obtained using standard methods (35Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Spin systems were identified using a combination of two-dimensional 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy and 1H-1H ROESY experiments. For this peptide, the intermediate correlation time (ω0τc ∼ 1.12) necessitated the use of rotating-frame Overhauser effects (ROE) to characterize the free peptide. Additional information was obtained from two selectively 13C-labeled peptide samples. The free peptide was also characterized using the phase-sensitive two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC experiment (36Schleucher J. Schwendinger M. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sorensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Transferred NOE intensities were found to be linear up to 150 ms, so this data set was used for modeling of the bound structure. Mapping of the ECD-contacting residues was performed using one-dimensional saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR and employed 40 gaussian-shaped pulses of 50 ms each (for a total saturation time of 2 s) at alternating on- and off-resonance frequencies of -1 and 30 ppm, respectively (32Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Mapping of the binding epitope was further characterized using this sample under the same conditions as the one-dimensional experiment using a two-dimensional STD HSQC experiment. Additional trNOEs were obtained from the 13C-labeled peptide using a two-dimensional 1H-13C trNOESY-HSQC experiment. The two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC, ROESY-HSQC, trNOE-HSQC, and STD HSQC spectra are available in the Supplemental Material.Data were processed using XWINNMR 3.5 running on a LINUX work station and analyzed using SPARKY (37Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2006Google Scholar). Peaks in the two-dimensional spectra were selected, and their volumes were quantitated from the 150-ms trNOE spectrum using the standard gaussian line-fitting algorithm. One-dimensional NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the NMR Manager program from ACD/Labs (Ontario, Canada).Modeling of Bound Peptide—Peak volumes obtained from trNOE spectra were used to create structural restraints that were introduced into a stochastic energy minimization protocol as implemented in MOE on a desktop PC (38Chemical Computing Group, Inc Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Montreal, Canada2006Google Scholar). For the calculations described, the force field used was the CHARMM27 all-atom potential (39MacKerell Jr., A.D. Feig M. Brooks III, C.L. J. Comp. Chem. 2004; 25: 1400-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). To accurately simulate the environment of the peptide, an implicit solvation energy was calculated using the Born solvation model (40Onufriev A. Bashford D. Case D.A. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 3712-3720Crossref Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 41Hawkins G.D. Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1995; 246: 122-129Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Target distance restraints were incorporated into the protocol based on the proton NOE intensities from the 150-ms trNOE experiments. NOE peaks were grouped as weak, medium, and strong, representing upper distance restraints of 5–6, 3–5, and <3 Ä, respectively. Restraints for diastereotopic methylene protons were allowed to switch between protons; however, the configurations of the side chains were not found to vary with the protocol that was used because of the low number of long range distance information.For these calculations, the protocol was initiated with 50 replicates of an extended template with the bond angles and distances from the standard CHARMM27 topology file. These conformations were the starting point for the series of stochastic searches in Cartesian space using the standard method distributed in MOE. The experimental restraints were added (along with the Born solvation term) to the potential using harmonic functions centered at the appropriate inter-hydrogen distance ranges. Diminishing torsion constraints were used to initially guide certain regions of the molecule to increased sampling of the α-helical region. These restraints were not found to be absolutely necessary but increased the efficiency of the search. Experimental and torsion restraints were relaxed in a series of 10 steps. Convergence of each run was determined by satisfaction of a standard geometric tolerance, residual energy based on the CHARMM27 potential, and the experimental restraints.RESULTSPreparation and Characterization of Functional trx-ECD— The N-terminal ECD of the CRF1 receptor was fused to the C terminus of trx with an intervening His tag and thrombin cleavage sites and was expressed in E. coli. The strain of E. coli used to express the trx-ECD fusion protein has no functional thioredoxin reductase or glutathione reductase, and the resulting oxidative environment allows for the formation of disulfide bonds within the cytoplasm of the bacteria.The expressed trx-ECD was present as inclusion bodies that were solubilized with urea and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography to remove contaminant proteins (Fig. 2A). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, purified trx-ECD is a monomer in the presence of reducing agent, but in the absence of reducing agent, it migrates as both a monomer and a series of oligomers (Fig. 2A). Purified trx-ECD did not react in assays designed to detect free thiols (data not shown). These observations led us to conclude that disulfide bonding was complete and that both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds were present. Because properly folded ECD should contain three intramolecular disulfide bonds and no intermolecular disulfide bonds, we used gel filtration to separate out the oligomers and isolate the monomeric pool of trx-ECD (Fig. 2B). There are 15 possible combinations of intramolecular disulfide bonds for the ECD of which only one would be considered “properly folded” for the ECD of a class B GPCR (18Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H.

To isolate the fraction of the monomer pool that is properly disulfide-bonded, we generated a ligand affinity column using a low affinity analogue of astressin (bAS-OH) as the ligand. The weak but specific binding interaction allowed for the separation of folded and misfolded trx-ECD using native buffer conditions as outlined in Fig. 2C. To validate this approach, we compared the relative CRF binding activities of the monomer pool of trx-ECD (load), trx-ECD that flows through in the void volume of the column (peak A), and trx-ECD that is transiently retained (peak B) using a blot overlay binding assay with biotinylated CRF as the probe (Fig. 2D). The results clearly show that there was no CRF binding activity in trx-ECD from peak A, although there was a significant increase in binding activity in trx-ECD from peak B relative to what was loaded onto the column. A qualitative measurement of the increase in specific binding activity can be taken from the fact that a 1/5th equivalent of trx-ECD from peak B has more CRF binding activity than the material loaded onto the column. Material from peak B, which has been reduced and carboxymethylated, has no binding activity in the overlay assay. Identical binding results were obtained using biotinylated astressin as the probe (not shown). Purified trx-ECD was soluble in aqueous buffer at concentrations up to 100 μm.FIGURE 2Expression and purification of properly folded trx-ECD.

https://openalex.org/W2167960515,"Family 3 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which includes metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), sweet and “umami” taste receptors (T1Rs), and the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), represent a distinct group among the superfamily of GPCRs characterized by large amino-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domains (ECD) with homology to bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins that are responsible for signal detection and receptor activation through as yet unresolved mechanism(s) via the seven-transmembrane helical domain (7TMD) common to all GPCRs. To address the mechanism(s) by which ligand-induced conformational changes are conveyed from the ECD to the 7TMD for G-protein activation, we altered the length and composition of a 14-amino acid linker segment common to all family 3 GPCRs except GABAB receptor, in the CaR by insertion, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis of specific highly conserved residues. Small alterations in the length and composition of the linker impaired cell surface expression and abrogated signaling of the chimeric receptors. The exchange of nine amino acids within the linker of CaR with the homologous sequence of mGluR1, however, preserved receptor function. Ala substitution for the four highly conserved residues within this amino acid sequence identified a Leu at position 606 of the CaR critical for cell surface expression and signaling. Substitution of Leu606 for Ala resulted in impaired cell surface expression. However, Ile and Val substitutions displayed strong activating phenotypes. Disruption of the linker by insertion of nine amino acids of a random-coiled structure uncoupled the ECD from regulating the 7TMD. These data are consistent with a model of receptor activation in which the peptide linker, and particularly Leu606, provides a critical interaction for the CaR signal transmission, a finding likely to be relevant for all family 3 GPCRs containing this conserved motif.

The human extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) 2The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; [Ca2+]o, extracellular calcium; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; NCD, nine-cysteine domain; 7TMD, seven-transmembrane helical domain; VFTM, Venus flytrap domain motif; PI, phosphoinositide; ECD, extracellular ligand-binding domain; Endo-H, endoglycosidase-H; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; IP, inositol phosphates. 2The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; [Ca2+]o, extracellular calcium; GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; NCD, nine-cysteine domain; 7TMD, seven-transmembrane helical domain; VFTM, Venus flytrap domain motif; PI, phosphoinositide; ECD, extracellular ligand-binding domain; Endo-H, endoglycosidase-H; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; IP, inositol phosphates. is a novel cation-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in parathyroid cells and plays a central role in the regulation of extracellular [Ca2+]o homeostasis by controlling the rate of parathyroid hormone secretion (1Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The CaR may also be involved in other physiological regulation in organs such as bone, brain, kidney, and intestine. Activation of CaR by elevated levels of [Ca2+]o stimulates phospholipase C via the Gq subfamily of G-proteins resulting in the increase of phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and subsequently in the release of intracellular Ca2+ from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. CaR is a member of the family 3 GPCR gene family that includes eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1–8), two γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits (GABAB1 and GABAB2), three sweet and umami taste receptors (T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3), several putative rodent pheromone receptors (V2Rs), and orphan receptors (GPRC6A, GPRC5B–5D) (2Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). All family 3 GPCRs possess a large amino-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD) that share structural similarity to the bi-lobed Venus flytrap domain motif (VFTM) of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins connected to a seven-transmembrane helical domain (7TMD) prototypical for all GPCRs responsible for G-protein activation (1Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 2Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Many of the GPCRs in this family are covalently joined homodimers with two monomers being linked by one or more disulfide bridges in the VFTMs. This has been rigorously demonstrated for the CaR and mGluRs (3Ray K.

O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The GABAB receptor, in contrast, is an obligate heterodimer composed of GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits stabilized by a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil interaction (6Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Another major difference in the structure of the GABAB receptor and many other family 3 GPCRs including mGluRs, CaR, sweet/umami taste receptors, and putative pheromone receptors is the presence of a distinct highly conserved nine-cysteine domain after the VFTM (called NCD) with a carboxyl-terminal extension of a 14-amino acid linker after the ninth cysteine connecting to the first transmembrane helix of the 7TMD in the later receptors. Structural predictions suggest that NCD may possess four β-strands and three disulfide bridges and for the CaR this domain seems to be essential for transmission of signals from the ECD to the 7TMD (7Yu L. Liang S. Liu X. He Q. Studholme D.J. Wu Q. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 458-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Hu J. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16382-16389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the linker connecting the NCD with the first transmembrane helical domain contains no cysteines for disulfide linkages, the length of this 14-residue linker is highly conserved in NCD-containing receptors indicating a stringent structural constraint. Thus, we and others hypothesized that this peptide linker might contribute to the signal transmission of family 3 GPCRs (9Ray K. Int. Arch. BioSci. 2001; 2001: 1027-1035Google Scholar, 10Galvez T. Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To address how the ligand-induced conformational changes of the VFTM might be transmitted for G-protein coupling, the peptide linkers of the GABAB receptor heterodimer were examined (11Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Modification of two GABAB receptor subunit linkers by changes in sequence and/or length were mostly tolerated and thus the linker regions in GABAB receptors were predicted to act only as tethers for the VFTMs to the 7TMD, supporting a direct contact model of receptor activation. In this model illustrated in Fig. 1A, a, receptor activation occurs predominantly through contacts between the ligand-bound VFTM and exo-loops of the 7TMD and the linker acts solely to keep the VFTM in proximity to the 7TMD. Alternatively, x-ray crystallographic analyses revealed that the distance between the VFTM carboxyl termini in the dimers of the mGluR1 decrease upon glutamate binding in the closed state of the two VFTMs suggesting that the two 7TMDs may be drawn closer to VFTMs through the linkers upon ligand activation (12Kunishima N. Shimada H. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1A, b, this alternative model referred to as the peptide-linker model of receptor activation predicts that the structure and conformational change of the linker is important for receptor activation. In a combination model, a direct contact of the VFTM and 7TMD is mediated by a linker conformational change (Fig. 1A, c). To identify the role of the peptide linker in the activation process of the CaR and to test among the different proposed receptor linker activation models, we created deletions and insertions to modify the length and also changed the composition by chimeric substitution of homologous sequences between CaR and mGluR1 and introducing changes in residues by point mutation within this linker of the CaR. Our analysis of the expression and signaling properties of these receptor constructs suggests an essential role for highly conserved amino acids within this structure. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Chimeric and Point Mutant Receptors—The coding sequences for the human CaR was inserted into the pCR3.1 expression plasmid. Mutations were introduced in the sequences encoding the linker region of the CaR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (3Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pair of complementary primers with 65–70 bases was designed for each chimeric receptor construct with targeted residues placed in the middle of the primers. In case of point mutation, a pair of complementary primers with 30–35 bases was similarly constructed with the residue change placed in the middle of the primers. The overlapping oligonucleotide sequences used for site-directed mutagenesis and construction details of the chimeric and point mutant constructs are available upon request. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a Taq Dye Deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All five chimeric constructs were completely sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations in other regions of these mutant constructs. For each point mutant construct sequenced, we analyzed at least two independent clones and confirmed that they had identical expression and functional characteristics. Transient and Stable Expression of Receptors in Mammalian Cells—HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with the pCR3.1 expression plasmid encoding the CaR receptor constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). To achieve optimal expression, 90% confluent cells in 80-cm2 flasks were transfected with an optimized amount of plasmid DNA (8 μg/flask) diluted in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, mixed with diluted Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min and added to cells. After 5 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and this medium was replaced 24 h after transfection with complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. This amount of DNA was determined to generate optimal transfection efficiency and the highest expression level of the CaR. Clonal HEK293 cell lines expressing the Gly-link9ins chimeric CaR was selected by isolating Geneticin or G418 (800 μg/ml)-resistant independent clonal lines isolated 3 weeks after transfection. The clonal cell line (Gly-link9insC10) was selected and maintained in media containing 400 μg/ml G418 for functional studies on the basis of the highest cell surface expression determined by immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody, ADD, clone 5C10 (Affinity BioReagents), raised against a synthetic peptide from the CaR ECD. Immunoblot Analyses with Detergent-solubilized Whole Cell Extracts—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (3Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 80-cm2 flasks were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and solubilized in solution B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 10 mm iodoacetamide. The protein content of each sample was determined by a modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein (30 μg) was loaded in each lane and electrophoretically separated on 6% Tris glycine gels by SDS-PAGE. Samples were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with human CaR-specific monoclonal ADD antibody, and a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories), and immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For cleavage with endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H), Triton X-100-solubilized proteins (∼60 μg) were incubated with 0.5 milliunits of Endo-H for 1 h at 30 °C before loading 30 μg of sample per lane on 6% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. PI Hydrolysis Assay—Stimulation of PI hydrolysis in intact HEK293 cells was performed as previously reported (3Ray K. Hauschild B.C. Steinbach P.J. Goldsmith P.K. Hauache O. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27642-27650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 24-well plates were replenished in medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml of myo[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium overnight. Cells were then depleted of extracellular [Ca2+]o as follows: attached cells were first washed with Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a 30-min incubation and wash with PI buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm LiCl, and 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.2) containing no Ca2+. This solution was removed and cells were then treated for 30 min with test agents in PI buffer. The reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of HCl/methanol (1:1000, v/v). Total inositol phosphates (IP) were isolated by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns. Data Analysis—The [Ca2+]o saturation profiles of PI hydrolysis were analyzed using Graphpad Prism software (version 3). Data curve fits for single-site and other ligand-binding models were compared for minimum residual errors. The coefficients for the best-fit models for an individual experiment were used to compute EC50 values reported in Table 1. For the L606A mutant, the data were best-fit to a single site non-cooperative model.TABLE 1Maximal response and EC50 values of [Ca2+]o on CaR and its mutant receptorsReceptorIP formationEC50Emax% wt maxCaR4.76 ± 0.08100R1-link95.61 ± 0.1975.0 ± 6.7 (5)I603A5.72 ± 0.1278.8 ± 4.1 (5)F605A5.24 ± 0.1493.3 ± 8.7 (4)L606A3.35 ± 0.1731.4 ± 2.8 (5)W608A4.25 ± 0.10110.3 ± 12.7 (4)L606F4.45 ± 0.15122.6 ± 6.5 (5)L606I3.07 ± 0.14116.8 ± 16.3 (3)L606V2.76 ± 0.12105.2 ± 4.0 (5) Open table in a new tab Expression and Function of CaR Peptide Linker Chimeric Receptors—This study was designed to determine the impact of the length and composition of the peptide linker connection between the VFTM/NCD and 7TMD on processing/cell surface expression and signaling of the CaR. Amino acid sequence alignment among divergent members of family 3 GPCRs showed that the 14-amino acid chain length among all members between the last cysteine (Cys598 in CaR) of the NCD and the first amino acid of the transmembrane domain (Gly613 in CaR) is strictly maintained among the CaR, mGluR1, mGluR5, and sweet, umami taste (T1R1–3), and a putative pheromone receptor (V2R2), whereas there are significant divergence in the amino acid compositions of the linkers (Fig. 1B). We modified the linker length and composition of the CaR as shown in Fig. 1C. As described in this figure, two chimeric CaR receptor constructs were generated in which the linker lengths were increased with the insertion of either the corresponding nine-linker sequence of rat mGluR1 sequence (IPVRYLEWS) or with GGGASASGG, a Gly sequence predicted to form a random coil structure in the middle of the 14-amino acid CaR linker and these two chimeric receptor constructs were named R1-link9ins and Gly-link9ins, respectively. Two other chimeras (R1-link9 and Gly-link9, respectively) were generated that changed the composition of the linker sequences without changing the CaR linker peptide length. In these constructs, nine residues of the 14-amino acid CaR linker were changed either to the corresponding nine mGluR1 sequence or to Gly sequence as shown above. A fifth construct (Δ-link9) with the deletion of nine residues was also created with a shortened length of the CaR linker peptide. The analysis of the expression patterns of the wild type CaR and these five chimeric mutants is shown in Fig. 2A. Immunoblotting experiments for chimeric receptors transiently expressed in HEK293 cells showed that both the wild type CaR and R1-link9 receptor expressed efficiently at the cell surface by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody ADD (Fig. 2A). As seen in this figure, under reducing conditions, ADD antibody detected two major monomeric bands of ∼150 and 130 kDa molecular mass in wild type receptor expressing cells. We and others (13Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollack M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the 150-kDa band identifies CaR forms expressed at the cell surface, modified with complex carbohydrates by N-glycosylation of several Asp residues in the ECD and is resistant to Endo-H digestion. The 130-kDa band contains high mannose-modified forms, trapped intracellularly, and Endo-H digestion reduces these high mannose-modified receptor forms to non-glycosylated forms shifted to a 120-kDa band on immunoblots. Similarly, the ADD antibody detected both bands in R1-link9 chimeric receptor-expressing cells and the upper 150-kDa band showed resistance to Endo-H digestion, whereas the lower 130-kDa band was sensitive to Endo-H. HEK293 cells consistently expressed a lower intensity of signal for the 150-kDa forms of R1-link9 compared with the wild type CaR, probably indicating a lower number of this chimeric receptor at the cell surface. Surprisingly, other chimeric mutant receptors showed no detectable 150-kDa band with mostly a single Endo-H-sensitive 130-kDa band. However, the Gly-link9ins mutant in several immunoblotting experiments showed the presence of a faint upper 150-kDa band, indicating some forms of this mutant receptor may reach the cell surface. Next, each mutant receptor was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells and the capacity of each mutant receptor to generate intracellular signals for IP accumulation in response to [Ca2+]o was compared with that of a wild type CaR. With the exception of R1-link9, all of the chimeric receptors failed to show any response even at a saturating concentration (10 mm) of Ca2+. The maximal responses (Emax) for these mutants were indistinguishable from the basal level and none of the mutants displayed constitutive activity (data not shown). Among these chimeric receptors, the Gly-link9ins mutant that showed some cell surface-expressed receptor forms also failed to respond to [Ca2+]o in the PI assay (Fig. 2B). The saturation curves for wild type CaR and R1-link9 receptor are shown in Fig. 2B. The R1-link9 receptor exhibited similar sigmoidal saturation as the wild type CaR but with somewhat reduced sensitivity to [Ca2+]o (EC50 of 5.6 mm versus wild type CaR EC50 4.7 mm, Table 1). Signaling Properties of Chimeric Receptor Gly-link9ins—Because of the low level of cell surface expression in HEK293 cells transiently expressing Gly-link9ins receptor, we tested varying amounts of the Gly-link9ins plasmid DNA during transient transfection (1, 2, and 3 μg of DNA/well of a six-well plate) and decreasing the wild type CaR plasmid DNA amount (0.25 and 1 μg of DNA/well) to achieve comparable cell surface receptor levels of the two receptors. Based on the intensity of the 150-kDa band in immunoblots, comparable cell surface expression was achieved by transfecting cells with 0.25 μg of DNA/well for wild type CaR and 3 μg of DNA/well for Gly-link9ins receptor. Under these conditions, the wild type CaR showed 3–4-fold increases in IP accumulation in response to 10 mm Ca2+, whereas Gly-link9ins receptor showed no increase in inositol phosphate formation (data not shown). To confirm unambiguously that Gly-link9ins chimeric receptor expressed at the cell surface did not respond to [Ca2+]o, we created several stable HEK293 clonal cell lines expressing Gly-link9ins receptor. The clonal cell line (Gly-link9insC10) with the highest cell surface expression showed a 2-fold increase in basal response compared with non-transfected cells but with no IP formation at up to 10 mm Ca2+. However, application of 1 μm NPS-R568, a positive allosteric modulator of the CaR, with or without 10 mm Ca2+ resulted in greatly enhanced IP formation (Fig. 3A). Similarly, we observed in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the ECD-deleted CaR mutant receptor (T903-Rhoc) that Ca2+ or NPS-R568 alone stimulated little or no significant increases in IP accumulation, but co-application of both resulted in a significant increase in IP formation (Fig. 3B). Also, as shown in Fig. 3C, the [Ca2+]o saturation curve in the presence of 1 μm NPS-R568 on the Gly-link9ins receptor was similar to what we have observed previously for the T903-Rhoc receptor (15Ray K. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the reported binding sites of NPS-R568 and Ca2+ within the 7TMD of the CaR and this Ca2+ binding in the 7TMD appears to act synergistically to enhance NPS-R568 activation of the receptor (15Ray K. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Petrel C. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The results revealed that the cell surface forms of the Gly-link9ins receptor were indeed capable of generating cellular responses probably upon NPS-R568 and Ca2+ binding in the 7TMD sites. Requirement for Leu606 within CaR Linker Region for Cell Surface Expression and Function—The alignment of several family 3 GPCRs including CaR, mGluR1, mGluR5, V2R2, T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 linker region amino acid sequences identify the presence of only four identical and/or highly conserved amino acid residues within the nine-amino acid linker sequences in these receptors (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the properties of these conserved residues, Ile603, Phe605, Leu606, and Trp608 within the CaR linker peptide were mutated to alanines. These individual single point mutants probed the importance of each of these conserved residues within the nine amino acids in the linker sequence of the CaR. The [Ca2+]o saturation curves of the I603A mutant receptor showed somewhat reduced maximal response, and F605A and W608A mutant receptors yielded similar maximal responses with calculated EC50 values for [Ca2+]o ranging from 4.2 to 5.7 mm (Fig. 4, A–C, Table 1). In contrast, the L606A mutant displayed markedly attenuated [Ca2+]o-elicited response with a maximal response diminished to 31% of the wild type response at 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4B, Table 1). The shape of [Ca2+]o saturation curve of L606A changed to hyperbolic from the steeply sigmoidal saturation profile of the wild type CaR. Immunoblot experiments confirmed that the highly reduced functional response of L606A was due to deficiencies in cell surface expression of this mutant as seen by the presence of little or none of the cell surface-expressed 150-kDa forms compared with the wild type and other mutant receptors tested (Fig. 4D). These observations indicate that a severe constraint on the amino acid side chain at this 606 position may be critical for the cell surface expression of the CaR. Alanine at this position possibly provides a less bulky side chain and perhaps failed to produce a critical Van der Waals contact provided by a leucine residue at position 606. To evaluate the importance of Leu606, we next engineered three point mutants, L606F, L606I, and L606V, in which the replaced amino acids (Phe, Ile, and Val) preserved the hydrophobicity but changed the length of the side chains of these amino acids. Because of similarities between the side chains of the aliphatic amino acids Leu, Ile, and Val, we believed the Ile and Val substitution mutants would fold and function normally at the cell surface. Phe has a rigid aromatic group on the side chain but like Leu is hydrophobic with similar side chain length, so we predicted this mutant may also be functional. As opposed to the L606A receptor, mutants replacing Leu at position 606 with Phe, Ile, and Val exhibited increased sensitivity to [Ca2+]o with maximal responses similar to the wild type CaR (Fig. 5, A–C, Table 1). Both the L606I and L606V mutant receptors exhibited substantial increases in sensitivity to [Ca2+]o (EC50 values of 3.0 and 2.7 mm, respectively, versus wild type CaR EC50 value 4.7 mm) with left-shifted dose-response curves. The response of the L606F receptor was also left-shifted but less activating with an EC50 value of 4.4 mm (Table 1). Immunoblot analysis and Endo-H treatment that qualitatively determined the cell surface levels of each receptor based on the intensity of the Endo-H resistant 150-kDa band (Fig. 5D) indicated that gain-of-function activities of L606V, L606F, and L606I mutants were not due to significantly higher cell surface expression of these receptors as compared with the wild type CaR, but indeed are due to the changes in signal transmission activities. We next evaluated the functional responses of the L606I, L606V, and L606A mutants in HeLa cells by transiently expressing the receptor constructs in these cells. Both L606I and L606V mutant receptors showed activating effects and L606A receptor showed a highly reduced response in PI assay (produced as a supplemental data). The findings confirm that signaling phenotypes of these mutant receptors are determined by structural changes within the receptors and not by other HEK293 cell-specific phenomenon. The transmission of an activating signal from the VFTM recognition of agonist ligands in a family 3 GPCR presents a constraint not present in the major family 1 GPCR structures. Whereas studies of ECD-deleted CaR and mGluR5 receptor constructs have revealed 7TMD-contained activating site(s) for so-called allosteric ligands (15Ray K. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Goudet C. Gaven F. Kniazeff J. Vol C. Liu J. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Acher F. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), indicating that these receptors may retain the activation mechanism(s) found in the homologous 7TMD structures of the family 1 GPCRs, the intact structures must undergo additional conformational transitions involving the ECD structures. In this report, we examined the peptide linker region connecting the ECD to the 7TMD of a prototypical member of the family 3 GPCR, the CaR, to explore whether this sequence plays a role in the activation of the 7TMD upon binding of ligand in the extracellular VFTM of this receptor. Two general mechanisms have been proposed for the transmission of this signal illustrated in Fig. 1A: 1) through direct contacts of the ECD with exo-loops of the 7TMD with the linker acting solely to constrain the spatial separation of ECD and 7TMD or 2) through the peptide linker between the ECD and the 7TMD with the transmission of the signal dependent on the conformational transitions transmitted through the linker. Results obtained from experiments with the GABAB receptor in which a random-coiled sequence was introduced into the linker region suggested that the conformation of the linker was not essential to GABAB receptor activation (11Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results for the CaR would appear to be entirely discrepant implicating a more fundamental role for the CaR linker region. Either deletion of the linker sequence or replacing it with an unrelated sequence abolished cell surface expression of the CaR receptor constructs. Similarly, insertion of an additional sequence, including the homologous sequence from mGluR1, abrogated receptor processing and, hence, [Ca2+]o-mediated signaling. The one alteration that was well tolerated was replacement of the nine-amino acid CaR linker sequence with the corresponding sequence from mGluR1, resulting in a receptor with diminished cell surface expression but which retained [Ca2+]o-induced response via the VFTM. This result echoes findings from the exchange of ECD structures among family 3 GPCRs with successful expression and signaling of regulated chimeric receptors only obtained for CaR ECD/mGluR1 7TMD exchanges (19Hammerland L.G.

Whereas the chimeric receptor Gly-link9ins with an insertion of a nine-amino acid long random coil Gly-peptide expressed poorly at the cell surface, by selecting a stably transformed clone of HEK293 that expressed sufficient Gly-link9ins receptor, we found no response to [Ca2+]o but activation by the allosteric agonist NPS-R568 alone or in combination with Ca2+. This phenotype mimics what we have previously reported for an ECD-deleted construct, T903-Rhoc, which revealed the 7TMD sites for two positive allosteric agonists NPS-R568 and Calindol and also for Ca2+ (15Ray K.

These results suggest that [Ca2+]o-activated VFTM of the Gly-link9ins mutant receptor did not transmit the activation signal to the 7TMD for G-protein signaling. These observations would seem to refute the role of the linker sequence as only a “tether” and they reveal a significant structural constraint upon this region of the CaR. Interestingly, replacement of the nine residues of the CaR peptide linker with the mGluR1 linker sequence without changing linker length produced a receptor with very similar phenotype as the wild type CaR. Our examination of the four conserved amino acid residues within this sequence identified Leu606 as essential for CaR signaling. Replacing Leu with hydrophobic amino acids Val and Ile produced functional receptors at the cell surface with enhanced [Ca2+]o sensitivity, whereas Phe replacement at this position produced only a modestly activating phenotype. Identification of these activating mutations at Leu606 of the CaR eliminates a passive tether model and implies a critical role for the conformation of the linker region. In contrast to these activating mutations, transfection of HEK293 cells with a CaR construct with Ala substitution at this position produced cells with dramatically decreased surface-expressed receptors and impaired [Ca2+]o-induced signaling response. Whereas it seems likely that the L606A mutant failed to fold correctly and remained intracellularly trapped, we cannot rule out the alternative that this mutation generated a constitutively active CaR mutant form that is internalized rapidly leading to significant loss of receptors at the cell surface. It is interesting to note that a true constitutively active CaR mutant receptor has not been reported yet and it is quite possible that such CaR mutants may rapidly internalize and degrade or that their expression may be toxic to the cells. Our data then suggest that the analysis of the family 3 GPCR signaling must consider at least two distinct types of regulation based upon the receptor structures. Signaling of GABAB receptor subunits appear to be mediated mostly by direct contacts between the ECD and 7TMD (11Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These receptor subunits, in contrast to CaR and mGluR1, form heterodimers with the predominant dimeric interface encoded in a extended carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil intracellular structure but the ECDs do not contain the NCD (6Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). CaR and mGluRs form homodimers structures with disulfide linkages in the extracellular ECD structures. Our data for the CaR strongly favors a peptide-linker mechanism of activation of this family 3 GPCR that may apply to other VFTM/NCD containing family 3 GPCRs. Our data cannot discriminate between a mechanism in which a direct interaction of the ligand-bound ECD with the exo-loops of the 7TMD requires a conformational rearrangement in the peptide linker during the activation process from one in which the conformational transition of the ECD produced upon ligand binding is transmitted by the linker region conformational rearrangement. The three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic structural analyses of the mGluR1 VFTM indicate that the closed conformation of this VFTM dimeric structure brings the carboxyl-terminal portions of the monomer VFTMs into closer apposition, which may produce the conformational rearrangement of the dimeric 7TMD structures via the linker regions (12Kunishima N. Shimada H. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Whether this produces a torsional transmission of the conformation or specific binding contacts between the linker sequence and the ECD and/or 7TMD require more refined structures and/or models for the intact receptors. We believe these differences seen in the linker properties between the GABAB receptor and the CaR in the activation processes may be applicable to other members of this receptor family and further research to test the generality of these results will be revealing.
