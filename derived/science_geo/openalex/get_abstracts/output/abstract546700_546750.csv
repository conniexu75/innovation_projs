https://openalex.org/W2174049393,"DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells. Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2177188076,"FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) prevent autoimmunity by limiting the effector activity of T cells that have escaped thymic negative selection or peripheral inactivation. Despite the information available about molecular factors mediating the suppressive function of Treg cells, the relevant cellular events in intact tissues remain largely unexplored, and whether Treg cells prevent activation of self-specific T cells or primarily limit damage from such cells has not been determined. Here we use multiplex, quantitative imaging in mice to show that, within secondary lymphoid tissues, highly suppressive Treg cells expressing phosphorylated STAT5 exist in discrete clusters with rare IL-2-positive T cells that are activated by self-antigens. This local IL-2 induction of STAT5 phosphorylation in Treg cells is part of a feedback circuit that limits further autoimmune responses. Inducible ablation of T cell receptor expression by Treg cells reduces their regulatory capacity and disrupts their localization in clusters, resulting in uncontrolled effector T cell responses. Our data thus reveal that autoreactive T cells are activated to cytokine production on a regular basis, with physically co-clustering T cell receptor-stimulated Treg cells responding in a negative feedback manner to suppress incipient autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2177129405,"RNA polymerase III (Pol III), the largest eukaryote polymerase yet characterized, transcribes structured small non-coding RNAs; here cryo-electron microscopy structures of budding yeast Pol III allow building of an atomic-level model of the complete 17-subunit complex, both unbound and while elongating RNA. Transcription of genes encoding small structured RNAs such as transfer RNAs, spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA and ribosomal 5S RNA is carried out by RNA polymerase III (Pol III), the largest yet structurally least characterized eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol III elongating complex at 3.9 Å resolution and the apo Pol III enzyme in two different conformations at 4.6 and 4.7 Å resolution, respectively, which allow the building of a 17-subunit atomic model of Pol III. The reconstructions reveal the precise orientation of the C82–C34–C31 heterotrimer in close proximity to the stalk. The C53–C37 heterodimer positions residues involved in transcription termination close to the non-template DNA strand. In the apo Pol III structures, the stalk adopts different orientations coupled with closed and open conformations of the clamp. Our results provide novel insights into Pol III-specific transcription and the adaptation of Pol III towards its small transcriptional targets. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes structured small non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and spliceosomal RNAs. It is the largest eukaryote polymerase, yet the least characterized structurally. Here Christoph Müller and colleagues determine the cryo-electron microscopy structures of budding yeast Pol III and build an atomic-level model of the complete 17-subunit complex, in both unbound and elongating conformations. The results allow a detailed comparison with the Pol I and Pol II enzymes and explain the adaptation of this polymerase towards its specific targets."
https://openalex.org/W2195799296,"Copy number variations have been frequently associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. MECP2 duplication syndrome is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males and is characterized by autism, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, anxiety, epilepsy, recurrent respiratory tract infections and early death. The broad range of deficits caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) overexpression poses a daunting challenge to traditional biochemical-pathway-based therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we sought strategies that directly target MeCP2 and are amenable to translation into clinical therapy. The first question that we addressed was whether the neurological dysfunction is reversible after symptoms set in. Reversal of phenotypes in adult symptomatic mice has been demonstrated in some models of monogenic loss-of-function neurological disorders, including loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome, indicating that, at least in some cases, the neuroanatomy may remain sufficiently intact so that correction of the molecular dysfunction underlying these disorders can restore healthy physiology. Given the absence of neurodegeneration in MECP2 duplication syndrome, we propose that restoration of normal MeCP2 levels in MECP2 duplication adult mice would rescue their phenotype. By generating and characterizing a conditional Mecp2-overexpressing mouse model, here we show that correction of MeCP2 levels largely reverses the behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological deficits. We also reduced MeCP2 using an antisense oligonucleotide strategy, which has greater translational potential. Antisense oligonucleotides are small, modified nucleic acids that can selectively hybridize with messenger RNA transcribed from a target gene and silence it, and have been successfully used to correct deficits in different mouse models. We find that antisense oligonucleotide treatment induces a broad phenotypic rescue in adult symptomatic transgenic MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG), and corrected MECP2 levels in lymphoblastoid cells from MECP2 duplication patients in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2177627135,"Postnatal maturation of the immune system is largely driven by exposure to microbes, and thus the nature of intestinal colonization may be associated with development of childhood diseases that may persist into adulthood. We investigated whether antepartum antibiotic (ATB) therapy can increase offspring susceptibility to experimental colitis through alteration of the gut microbiota.Pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were treated with cefazolin at 160 mg/kg body weight or with saline starting six days before due date. At 7 weeks, fecal samples were collected from male offspring after which they received 4% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 5 days. Disease activity index, histology, colonic IL-6, IL-1β and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. The V3-V4 region of colonic and fecal bacterial 16S rRNA was sequenced. Alpha-, beta-diversity and differences at the phylum and genus levels were determined, while functional pathways of classified bacteria were predicted.ATB influenced fecal bacterial composition and hence bacterial functional pathways before induction of colitis. After induction of colitis, ATB increased onset of clinical disease, histologic score, and colonic IL-6. In addition, ATB decreased fecal microbial richness, changed fecal and colon microbial composition, which was accompanied by a modification of microbial functional pathways. Also, several taxa were associated with ATB at lower taxonomical levels.The results support the hypothesis that antepartum antibiotics modulate offspring intestinal bacterial colonization and increase susceptibility to develop colonic inflammation in a murine model of colitis, and may guide future interventions to restore physiologic intestinal colonization in offspring born by antibiotic-exposed mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2174247606,"T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling has a key role in determining T-cell fate. Precursor cells expressing TCRs within a certain low-affinity range for complexes of self-peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) undergo positive selection and differentiate into naive T cells expressing a highly diverse self-MHC-restricted TCR repertoire. In contrast, precursors displaying TCRs with a high affinity for 'self' are either eliminated through TCR-agonist-induced apoptosis (negative selection) or restrained by regulatory T (Treg) cells, whose differentiation and function are controlled by the X-chromosome-encoded transcription factor Foxp3 (reviewed in ref. 2). Foxp3 is expressed in a fraction of self-reactive T cells that escape negative selection in response to agonist-driven TCR signals combined with interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor signalling. In addition to Treg cells, TCR-agonist-driven selection results in the generation of several other specialized T-cell lineages such as natural killer T cells and innate mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Although the latter exhibit a restricted TCR repertoire, Treg cells display a highly diverse collection of TCRs. Here we explore in mice whether a specialized mechanism enables agonist-driven selection of Treg cells with a diverse TCR repertoire, and the importance this holds for self-tolerance. We show that the intronic Foxp3 enhancer conserved noncoding sequence 3 (CNS3) acts as an epigenetic switch that confers a poised state to the Foxp3 promoter in precursor cells to make Treg cell lineage commitment responsive to a broad range of TCR stimuli, particularly to suboptimal ones. CNS3-dependent expansion of the TCR repertoire enables Treg cells to control self-reactive T cells effectively, especially when thymic negative selection is genetically impaired. Our findings highlight the complementary roles of these two main mechanisms of self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2178716668,"Abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought and extreme temperatures affect nitrogen (N) uptake and assimilation in plants. However, little is known about the regulation of N pathway genes at transcriptional level under abiotic stress conditions in Brassica juncea. In the present work, genes encoding nitrate transporters (NRT), ammonium transporters (AMT), nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), asparagines synthetase (ASN) were cloned from Brassica juncea L. var. Varuna. The deduced protein sequences were analyzed to predict their subcellular localization, which confirmed localization of all the proteins in their respective cellular organelles. The protein sequences were also subjected to conserved domain identification, which confirmed presence of characteristic domains in all the proteins, indicating their putative functions. Moreover, expression of these genes was studied after 1h and 24h of salt (150 mM NaCl), osmotic (250 mM Mannitol), cold (4°C) and heat (42°C) stresses. Most of the genes encoding nitrate transporters and enzymes responsible for N assimilation and remobilization were found to be downregulated under abiotic stresses. The expression of BjAMT1.2, BjAMT2, BjGS1.1, BjGDH1 and BjASN2 was downregulated after 1hr, while expression of BjNRT1.1, BjNRT2.1, BjNiR1, BjAMT2, BjGDH1 and BjASN2 was downregulated after 24h of all the stress treatments. However, expression of BjNRT1.1, BjNRT1.5 and BjGDH2 was upregulated after 1h of all stress treatments, while no gene was found to be upregulated after 24h of stress treatments, commonly. These observations indicate that expression of most of the genes is adversely affected under abiotic stress conditions, particularly under prolonged stress exposure (24h), which may be one of the reasons of reduction in plant growth and development under abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2260642016,"Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a thiol protein that functions as an antioxidant, regulator of cellular peroxide concentrations, and sensor of redox signals. Its redox cycle is widely accepted to involve oxidation by a peroxide and reduction by thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase. Interactions of Prx2 with other thiols are not well characterized. Here we show that the active site Cys residues of Prx2 form stable mixed disulfides with glutathione (GSH). Glutathionylation was reversed by glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), and GSH plus Grx1 was able to support the peroxidase activity of Prx2. Prx2 became glutathionylated when its disulfide was incubated with GSH and when the reduced protein was treated with H2O2 and GSH. The latter reaction occurred via the sulfenic acid, which reacted sufficiently rapidly (k = 500 m(-1) s(-1)) for physiological concentrations of GSH to inhibit Prx disulfide formation and protect against hyperoxidation to the sulfinic acid. Glutathionylated Prx2 was detected in erythrocytes from Grx1 knock-out mice after peroxide challenge. We conclude that Prx2 glutathionylation is a favorable reaction that can occur in cells under oxidative stress and may have a role in redox signaling. GSH/Grx1 provide an alternative mechanism to thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase for Prx2 recycling."

https://openalex.org/W2181242709,"MFAP4 (microfibrillar-associated protein 4) is an extracellular glycoprotein found in elastic fibers without a clearly defined role in elastic fiber assembly. In the present study, we characterized molecular interactions between MFAP4 and elastic fiber components. We established that MFAP4 primarily assembles into trimeric and hexameric structures of homodimers. Binding analysis revealed that MFAP4 specifically binds tropoelastin and fibrillin-1 and -2, as well as the elastin cross-linking amino acid desmosine, and that it co-localizes with fibrillin-1-positive fibers in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis disclosed residues Phe241 and Ser203 in MFAP4 as being crucial for type I collagen, elastin, and tropoelastin binding. Furthermore, we found that MFAP4 actively promotes tropoelastin self-assembly. In conclusion, our data identify MFAP4 as a new ligand of microfibrils and tropoelastin involved in proper elastic fiber organization.

In conclusion, our data identify MFAP4 as a new ligand of microfibrils and tropoelastin involved in proper elastic fiber organization. Elastic fibers are key extracellular matrix structural elements of connective tissues that undergo repeated stretch, such as large arteries and the lung (1Wagenseil J.E. Mecham R.P. New insights into elastic fiber assembly.Birth Defects Res. C. Embryo Today. 2007; 81: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The fibers consist of two major components: an amorphous elastin core surrounded by a sheath of fibrillin-rich microfibrils (2Baldwin A.K. Simpson A. Steer R. Cain S.A. Kielty C.M. Elastic fibres in health and disease.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2013; 15: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Elastin is a highly hydrophobic polymer of the soluble precursor tropoelastin (3Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Biochemistry of tropoelastin.Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Tropoelastin is known to undergo a self-assembly process known as coacervation (4Yeo G.C. Keeley F.W. Weiss A.S. Coacervation of tropoelastin.Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 2011; 167: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), often believed to be a first step in the process of elastic fiber maturation. Because of the high content of lysine residues within the tropoelastin sequence, its assembly into a polymeric form is stabilized by formation of desmosine cross-links, catalyzed by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) 3The abbreviations used are: LOX, lysyl oxidase; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FReD, fibrinogen-related domain; MAGP, microfibril-associated glycoprotein; Pn, postnatal day n; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBST, TBS with 0.05% Tween; TL5A, tachylectin 5A. enzyme family (5Bedell-Hogan D.

Microfibrils, the other major component of elastic fibers, provide the structural scaffold for the deposition of elastin globules. They consist primarily of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, large glycoproteins with a high degree of homology (6Ramirez F. Sakai L.Y. Biogenesis and function of fibrillin assemblies.Cell Tissue Res. 2010; 339: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Apart from fibrillins, numerous accessory proteins have been shown to associate with microfibrils or elastin and promote formation of mature fibers, including fibulins and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) (7Rock M.J.

The ligand-binding site, designated S1, is described in all the proteins and is located in close proximity to the calcium-binding site. MFAP4 has been reported to form homodimeric structures that further oligomerize, but its definite oligomerization pattern has not been established (20Lausen M. Lynch N. Schlosser A. Tornoe I.

Indeed, MFAP4 has been found to interact with fibrillin-1 and promote elastic fiber formation in in vitro dermal skin fibroblast cultures (26Kasamatsu S. Hachiya A. Fujimura T. Sriwiriyanont P.

In this study, we aimed to verify and further characterize the oligomerization pattern of MFAP4 and its molecular interactions with well established elastic fiber components such as tropoelastin, fibrillin-1 and -2, and LOX. We also used site-directed mutagenesis to determine amino acid positions critical for the ligand-binding properties of MFAP4 based on the sequence alignments of the predicted S1 binding site of MFAP4 and structural homologs. Finally, we explored the role of MFAP4 in the process of tropoelastin coacervation. DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed using the DNASTAR Lasergene v6 package. The sequence alignment of the FReD in MFAP4, l-ficolin, FIBCD1, and tachylectin 5A (TL5A) was conducted using the ClustalW method within the package.

In addition, several genetically modified versions of rMFAP4 containing selected point mutations within the FReD sequence were created using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and the plasmid containing the rMFAP4 as a template (Table 1). Expression vectors containing the desired mutations were transformed into competent cells using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purification of the rMFAP4-coding plasmids was performed using GeneJETTM plasmid miniprep kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All the constructs were sequenced using primers T7 and bovine growth hormone terminator reverse primer (both provided by Eurofins MWG Operon) and the online web service supplied by Eurofins MWG Operon. The constructs were further analyzed for presence of desired mutations and absence of additional mutations using SeqManTM II DNASTAR Lasergene v6.TABLE 1Primer sequences used for site-directed mutagenesis of human recombinant MFAP4Base changeBase positionAmino acid changePrimer sequencesT/G632S203AForward: 5′-CTGCGCAGCTCTCGCCTCAGGAGCCTT-3′Reverse: 5′-AAGGCTCCTGAGGCGAGAGCTGCGCAG-3′C/A633S203YForward: 5′-CTGCGCAGCTCTCTACTCAGGAGCCTTCT-3′Reverse: 5′-AGAAGGCTCCTGAGTAGAGAGCTGCGCAG-3′TT/GC746–747F241AForward: 5′-GGCCCAGTGGAAGGGCGCCTACTACTCCCTCAAA-3′Reverse: 5′-TTTGAGGGAGTAGTAGGCGCCCTTCCACTGGGCC-3′TC/GG746–747F241WForward: 5′-GCCCAGTGGAAGGGCTGGTACTACTCCCTCAAAC-3′Reverse: 5′-GTTTGAGGGAGTAGTACCAGCCCTTCCACTGGGC-3′A/C597D191AForward: 5′-TACCTTCGACCGGGCCCAGGACCTCTTTG-3′Reverse: 5′-CAAAGAGGTCCTGGGCCCGGTCGAAGGTA-3′A/C603D193AForward: 5′-GACCGGGACCAGGCCCTCTTTGTGCAG-3′Reverse: 5′-CTGCACAAAGAGGGCCTGGTCCCGGTC-3′A/C, A/C597, 603D191A/D193AForward: 5′-CCTTCGACCGGGCCCAGGCCCTCTTTGTGCA-3′Reverse: 5′-TGCACAAAGAGGGCCTGGGCCCGGTCGAAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab The expression and purification of MFAP4 variants was performed as described previously (25Schlosser A.

Purified WT rMFAP4 was concentrated using a Vivaspin 6 ultrafiltration spin column, 10-kDa cut-off (GE Healthcare), and the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The purity of the concentrated protein was tested by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining using SimplyBlueTM SafeStain (Invitrogen). The concentration of WT rMFAP4 was ∼0.7 mg/ml. Gel permeation chromatography of WT rMFAP4 and MFAP4 mutant forms was conducted on a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The elution profile was fitted with two Gaussian curves. The Stokes radius of WT rMFAP4 was determined from its elution position relative to the elution position of proteins of known Stokes radius (thyroglobulin, ferritin, aldolase, conalbumin, and ovalbumin) (33Laue T.M.

Macromolecules were pelleted and incubated with 31 ng/ml WT rMFAP4 or purified mutant MFAP4 variants (diluted in TBST-Ca or TBST containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 ml of total volume) overnight at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed with TBST-Ca containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Bound protein was eluted from the insoluble fraction by boiling the samples in SDS-PAGE buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 8% (w/v) SDS, 25% (v/v) 4× lower Tris, pH 8.8, 0.002% bromophenol blue) and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE buffer with 0.6 m DTT in the reduced samples or 0.02 m iodoacetamide in the nonreduced samples. The samples were boiled for 1 min and finally alkylated by the addition of 1.4 m iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 90 mm.

While behavioural evidence suggests individual recognition is widespread, the cues that animals use to recognise individuals are established in only a handful of systems. Here, we use digital models to demonstrate that facial features are the visual cue used for individual recognition in the social fish Neolamprologus pulcher. Focal fish were exposed to digital images showing four different combinations of familiar and unfamiliar face and body colorations. Focal fish attended to digital models with unfamiliar faces longer and from a further distance to the model than to models with familiar faces. These results strongly suggest that fish can distinguish individuals accurately using facial colour patterns. Our observations also suggest that fish are able to rapidly (≤ 0.5 sec) discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, a speed of recognition comparable to primates including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2178145018,"Aims To assess the associations between types of cannabis control policies at country level and prevalence of adolescent cannabis use. Setting, Participants and Design Multilevel logistic regressions were performed on 172,894 adolescents 15 year of age who participated in the 2001/2002, 2005/2006, or 2009/2010 cross-sectional Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey in 38 European and North American countries. Measures Self-reported cannabis use status was classified into ever use in life time, use in past year, and regular use. Country-level cannabis control policies were categorized into a dichotomous measure (whether or not liberalized) as well as 4 detailed types (full prohibition, depenalization, decriminalization, and partial prohibition). Control variables included individual-level sociodemographic characteristics and country-level economic characteristics. Findings Considerable intra-class correlations (.15-.19) were found at country level. With respect to the dichotomized cannabis control policy, adolescents were more likely to ever use cannabis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, p = .001), use in past year (OR = 1.09, p = .007), and use regularly (OR = 1.26, p = .004). Although boys were substantially more likely to use cannabis, the correlation between cannabis liberalization and cannabis use was smaller in boys than in girls. With respect to detailed types of policies, depenalization was associated with higher odds of past-year use (OR = 1.14, p = .013) and regular use (OR = 1.23, p = .038), and partial prohibition was associated with higher odds of regular use (OR = 2.39, p = .016). The correlation between cannabis liberalization and regular use was only significant after the policy had been introduced for more than 5 years. Conclusions Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms."
https://openalex.org/W2176396750,"Knowledge about the types of nests built by dinosaurs can provide insight into the evolution of nesting and reproductive behaviors among archosaurs. However, the low preservation potential of their nesting materials and nesting structures means that most information can only be gleaned indirectly through comparison with extant archosaurs. Two general nest types are recognized among living archosaurs: 1) covered nests, in which eggs are incubated while fully covered by nesting material (as in crocodylians and megapodes), and 2) open nests, in which eggs are exposed in the nest and brooded (as in most birds). Previously, dinosaur nest types had been inferred by estimating the water vapor conductance (i.e., diffusive capacity) of their eggs, based on the premise that high conductance corresponds to covered nests and low conductance to open nests. However, a lack of statistical rigor and inconsistencies in this method render its application problematic and its validity questionable. As an alternative we propose a statistically rigorous approach to infer nest type based on large datasets of eggshell porosity and egg mass compiled for over 120 extant archosaur species and 29 archosaur extinct taxa/ootaxa. The presence of a strong correlation between eggshell porosity and nest type among extant archosaurs indicates that eggshell porosity can be used as a proxy for nest type, and thus discriminant analyses can help predict nest type in extinct taxa. Our results suggest that: 1) covered nests are likely the primitive condition for dinosaurs (and probably archosaurs), and 2) open nests first evolved among non-avian theropods more derived than Lourinhanosaurus and were likely widespread in non-avian maniraptorans, well before the appearance of birds. Although taphonomic evidence suggests that basal open nesters (i.e., oviraptorosaurs and troodontids) were potentially the first dinosaurs to brood their clutches, they still partially buried their eggs in sediment. Open nests with fully exposed eggs only became widespread among Euornithes. A potential co-evolution of open nests and brooding behavior among maniraptorans may have freed theropods from the ground-based restrictions inherent to covered nests and allowed the exploitation of alternate nesting locations. These changes in nesting styles and behaviors thus may have played a role in the evolutionary success of maniraptorans (including birds)."
https://openalex.org/W2178377291,"Satellite tagging data for short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) were used to identify core insular foraging regions off the Kona (west) Coast of Hawai'i Island. Ship-based active acoustic surveys and oceanographic model output were used in generalized additive models (GAMs) and mixed models to characterize the oceanography of these regions and to examine relationships between whale density and the environment. The regions of highest density for pilot whales and Blainville's beaked whales were located between the 1000 and 2500 m isobaths and the 250 and 2000 m isobaths, respectively. Both species were associated with slope waters, but given the topography of the area, the horizontal distribution of beaked whales was narrower and located in shallower waters than that of pilot whales. The key oceanographic parameters characterizing the foraging regions were bathymetry, temperature at depth, and a high density of midwater micronekton scattering at 70 kHz in 400-650 m depths that likely represent the island-associated deep mesopelagic boundary community and serve as prey for the prey of the whales. Thus, our results suggest that off the Kona Coast, and potentially around other main Hawaiian Islands, the deep mesopelagic boundary community is key to a food web that supports insular cetacean populations."
https://openalex.org/W2174198505,"Ice-free cryopreservation, known as vitrification, is an appealing approach for banking of adherent cells and tissues because it prevents dissociation and morphological damage that may result from ice crystal formation. However, current vitrification methods are often limited by the cytotoxicity of the concentrated cryoprotective agent (CPA) solutions that are required to suppress ice formation. Recently, we described a mathematical strategy for identifying minimally toxic CPA equilibration procedures based on the minimization of a toxicity cost function. Here we provide direct experimental support for the feasibility of these methods when applied to adherent endothelial cells. We first developed a concentration- and temperature-dependent toxicity cost function by exposing the cells to a range of glycerol concentrations at 21°C and 37°C, and fitting the resulting viability data to a first order cell death model. This cost function was then numerically minimized in our state constrained optimization routine to determine addition and removal procedures for 17 molal (mol/kg water) glycerol solutions. Using these predicted optimal procedures, we obtained 81% recovery after exposure to vitrification solutions, as well as successful vitrification with the relatively slow cooling and warming rates of 50°C/min and 130°C/min. In comparison, conventional multistep CPA equilibration procedures resulted in much lower cell yields of about 10%. Our results demonstrate the potential for rational design of minimally toxic vitrification procedures and pave the way for extension of our optimization approach to other adherent cell types as well as more complex systems such as tissues and organs."
https://openalex.org/W2179262479,"Introduction Multiple scoring systems have been proposed for prostate MRI reporting. We sought to review the clinical impact of the new Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v2 (PI-RADS) and compare those results to our proposed Simplified Qualitative System (SQS) score with respect to detection of prostate cancers and clinically significant prostate cancers. Methods All patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) had their images interpreted using PI-RADS v1 and SQS score. PI-RADS v2 was calculated from prospectively collected data points. Patients with positive mpMRIs were then referred by their urologists for enrollment in an IRB-approved prospective phase III trial of mpMRI-Ultrasound (MR/TRUS) fusion biopsy of suspicious lesions. Standard 12-core biopsy was performed at the same setting. Clinical data were collected prospectively. Results 1060 patients were imaged using mpMRI at our institution during the study period. 341 participants were then referred to the trial. 312 participants underwent MR/TRUS fusion biopsy of 452 lesions and were included in the analysis. 202 participants had biopsy-proven cancer (64.7%) and 206 (45.6%) lesions were positive for cancer. Distribution of cancer detected at each score produced a Gaussian distribution for SQS while PI-RADS demonstrates a negatively skewed curve with 82.1% of cases being scored as a 4 or 5. Patient-level data demonstrated AUC of 0.702 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.73) for PI-RADS and 0.762 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.81) for SQS (p< 0.0001) with respect to the detection of prostate cancer. The analysis for clinically significant prostate cancer at a per lesion level resulted in an AUC of 0.725 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.76) and 0.829 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.87) for the PI-RADS and SQS score, respectively (p< 0.0001). Conclusions mpMRI is a useful tool in the workup of patients at risk for prostate cancer, and serves as a platform to guide further evaluation with MR/TRUS fusion biopsy. SQS score provided a more normal distribution of scores and yielded a higher AUC than PI-RADS v2. However until our findings are validated, we recommend reporting of detailed sequence-specific findings. This will allow for prospectively collected data to be utilized in determining the impact of ongoing changes to these scoring systems as our understanding of mpMRI interpretation evolves."

https://openalex.org/W2179153408,"Periodontitis is the most frequently diagnosed health problem in cats yet little is known about the bacterial species important for the disease. The objective of this study was to identify bacterial species associated with health, gingivitis or mild periodontitis (<25% attachment loss) in feline plaque. Knowledge of these species is a first step in understanding the potential for improving oral health of cats via dietary interventions that alter the proportions of influential species. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 92 cats with healthy gingiva, gingivitis or mild periodontitis. Pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA from these plaque samples generated more than one million reads and identified a total of 267 operational taxonomic units after bioinformatic and statistical analysis. Porphyromonas was the most abundant genus in all gingival health categories, particularly in health along with Moraxella and Fusobacteria. The Peptostreptococcaceae were the most abundant family in gingivitis and mild periodontitis. Logistic regression analysis identified species from various genera that were significantly associated with health, gingivitis or mild periodontitis. The species identified were very similar to those observed in canine plaque in the corresponding health and disease states. Such similarities were not observed between cat and human at the bacterial species level but with disease progression similarities did emerge at the phylum level. This suggests that interventions targeted at human pathogenic species will not be effective for use in cats but there is more potential for commonalities in interventions for cats and dogs."

The selected strain was then applied to a mouse model to evaluate its protective function against copper intoxication in vivo. The experimental mice were divided into an intervention group and a therapy group; mice in the intervention group received co-administration of CCFM8246 and a copper ion solution by gavage, while mice in the therapy group were treated with CCFM8246 after 4 weeks of copper exposure. In both two groups, mice treated with copper alone and that treated with neither CCFM8246 nor copper served as positive and negative controls, respectively. At the end of the experimental period, the copper content in feces and tissues, the activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum, and oxidation stress indices in liver and kidney tissue were determined. Learning and memory ability was evaluated by Morris water maze experiments. The results indicated that treatment with CCFM8246 significantly increased the copper content in feces to promote copper excretion, reduce the accumulation of copper in tissues, reverse oxidative stress induced by copper exposure, recover the ALT and AST in serum and improve the spatial memory of mice."

A cross-sectional serologic survey was conducted to estimate the WNV seroprevalence and assess the ratio of infection to neuroinvasive disease. A stratified left-over sampling methodology was used including age and residence strata. A total of 3,962 serum samples was collected and tested for WNV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). All positive samples were further tested by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and WNV Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. WNV IgG antibodies were detected in 82 samples and 61 were also positive in PRNT representing a weighted seroprevalence of 2.1% (95% C.I.: 1.7-2.6) and 1.5% (95% C.I.: 1.2-2.0), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that seroprevalence was associated with age and residence. The overall ratio of neuroinvasive disease to infected persons was estimated at 1:376 (95% C.I.: 1:421-1:338), while the elderly people had the highest ratio.

To explore whether the etiology of breast cancer is different from the known risk factors from studies in Western countries, we conducted a nested case-control study using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).All medical conditions based on the first three digits of the ICD-9 and a list of medical conditions based on literature review were retrieved for each case and control. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the associations between medical conditions and breast cancer risks were estimated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for occupation, number of breast cancer screening, and the average number of outpatient visits prior the diagnosis. The associations were also estimated for younger (<50 years old) and older subjects separately.The analyses included 4,884 breast cancer cases and 19,536 age-matched controls. Prior breast diseases (OR, 95% CI: 2.47, 2.26-2.71), obesity (1.43, 1.04-1.96), endometriosis (1.44, 1.15-1.80), uterine leiomyoma (1.20, 1.03-1.40), hypertensive diseases (1.14, 1.05-1.25), and disorders in lipid metabolism (1.13, 1.04-1.24) were associated with increased breast cancer risk. No heterogeneity was observed between age groups (<50 and ≥50 years old).In addition to benign breast diseases, obesity, endometriosis, uterine leiomyoma, hypertensive diseases, and disorders of lipid metabolism were associated with a subsequent breast cancer risk.Our results suggest that estrogen related factors may play an important role in breast cancer risks in the Taiwanese female population."
https://openalex.org/W2174387013,"Biodiversity is rapidly declining globally. One strategy to help to conserve species is to breed species in captivity and release them into suitable habitats. The way that reintroduced animals explore new habitats and/or disperse from the release site is rarely studied in detail and represents key information for the success of reintroduction projects. The European bison (Bison bonasus L. 1758) was the largest surviving herbivore of the post-glacial megafauna in Europe before it became extinct in the wild, surviving only in captivity since 1919. We investigated the exploration behavior of a herd of European bison reintroduced into the Rothaargebirge, a commercial forest in low range mountain intensively used and densely populated by humans, in the first six months after release. We focused on three questions: (1) how did the European bison move and utilize the habitat on a daily basis, (2) how did the animals explore the new environment, and (3) did their habitat preferences change over time. The European bison dispersed away from their previous enclosure at an average rate of 539 m/month, with their areas of daily use ranging from 70 to 173 ha, their movement ranging from 3.6 km to 5.2 km per day, and their day-to-day use of areas ranged between 389 and 900 m. We could identify three major exploration bouts, when the animals entered and explored areas previously unknown to them. During the birthing phase, the European bison reduced daily walking distances, and the adult bull segregated from the herd for 58 days. Around rut, roaming behavior of the herd increased slightly. The animals preferred spruce forest, wind thrown areas and grassland, all of which are food abundant habitat types, and they avoided beech forest. Habitat preference differed slightly between phases of the study period, probably due to phenological cycles. After six months, the complete summer home range was 42.5 km2. Our study shows that a small free-ranging herd of European bison can live in an area intensively used by humans and describes in detail the initial roaming behavior and habitat utilization of the animals."
https://openalex.org/W2176047313,"Disconnected (disco)-interacting protein 2 homolog A is a member of the DIP2 protein family encoded by Dip2a gene. Dip2a expression pattern has never been systematically studied. Functions of Dip2a in embryonic development and adult are not known. To investigate Dip2a gene expression and function in embryo and adult, a Dip2a-LacZ mouse model was generated by insertion of β-Gal cDNA after Dip2a promoter using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Dip2a-LacZ mouse was designed to be a lacZ reporter mouse as well as a Dip2a knockout mouse. Heterozygous mice were used to study endogenous Dip2a expression and homozygotes to study DIP2A-associated structure and function. LacZ staining indicated that Dip2a is broadly expressed in neuronal, reproductive and vascular tissues, as well as in heart, kidney, liver and lung. Results demonstrate that Dip2a is expressed in ectoderm-derived tissues in developing embryos. Adult tissues showed rich staining in neurons, mesenchymal, endothelial, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by cell types. The expression pattern highly overlaps with FSTL1 and supports previous report that DIP2A to be potential receptor of FSTL1 and its protective roles of cardiomyocytes. Broad and intense embryonic and adult expression of Dip2a has implied their multiple structural and physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W2187531420,"The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact binary stars) have led to a well established phenomenology. Relativistic jets are not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra, although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar outflows. Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (ULS) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the spectra show blueshifted, broad Hα emission lines, characteristic of baryonic jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs, and an origin from a black hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's soft X-rays. Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS challenges canonical theories of jet formation, but might be explained by a long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick outflows."
https://openalex.org/W2177210358,"UBE2W ubiquitinates N termini of proteins rather than internal lysine residues, showing a preference for substrates with intrinsically disordered N termini. The in vivo functions of this intriguing E2, however, remain unknown. We generated Ube2w germ line KO mice that proved to be susceptible to early postnatal lethality without obvious developmental abnormalities. Although the basis of early death is uncertain, several organ systems manifest changes in Ube2w KO mice. Newborn Ube2w KO mice often show altered epidermal maturation with reduced expression of differentiation markers. Mirroring higher UBE2W expression levels in testis and thymus, Ube2w KO mice showed a disproportionate decrease in weight of these two organs (~50%), suggesting a functional role for UBE2W in the immune and male reproductive systems. Indeed, Ube2w KO mice displayed sustained neutrophilia accompanied by increased G-CSF signaling and testicular vacuolation associated with decreased fertility. Proteomic analysis of a vulnerable organ, presymptomatic testis, showed a preferential accumulation of disordered proteins in the absence of UBE2W, consistent with the view that UBE2W preferentially targets disordered polypeptides. These mice further allowed us to establish that UBE2W is ubiquitously expressed as a single isoform localized to the cytoplasm and that the absence of UBE2W does not alter cell viability in response to various stressors. Our results establish that UBE2W is an important, albeit not essential, protein for early postnatal survival and normal functioning of multiple organ systems."
https://openalex.org/W2294500908,"This study investigated the exposure of jaguar populations and domestic animals to smooth Brucella, Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii in the Cerrado, Pantanal and Amazon biomes of Brazil. Between February 2000 and January 2010, serum samples from 31 jaguars (Panthera onca), 1,245 cattle (Bos taurus), 168 domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and 29 domestic cats (Felis catus) were collected and analysed by rose bengal test for smooth Brucella, microscopic agglutination test for Leptospira spp. and modified agglutination test for T. gondii. Cattle populations from all sites (9.88%) were exposed to smooth Brucella, but only one jaguar from Cerrado was exposed to this agent. Jaguars captured in the Cerrado (60.0%) and in the Pantanal (45.5%) were seropositive for different serovars of Leptospira spp., cattle (72.18%) and domestic dogs (13.1%) from the three sites and one domestic cat from Pantanal were also seropositive for the agent. The most prevalent serotype of Leptospira spp. identified in jaguars from the Cerrado (Grippotyphosa) and the Pantanal (Pomona) biomes were distinct from those found in the domestic animals sampled. Jaguars (100%), domestic dogs (38.28%) and domestic cats (82.76%) from the three areas were exposed to T. gondii. Our results show that brucellosis and leptospirosis could have been transmitted to jaguars by domestic animals; and jaguars probably play an important role in the maintenance of T. gondii in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2174125587,"Objectives In epidemiological research, major studies have focused on theoretical models; however, few methods of visual analysis have been used to display the patterns of disease distribution. Design For this study, a method combining the space-time cube (STC) with space-time scan statistics (STSS) was used to analyze the pattern of incidence of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in Guangdong Province from May 2008 to March 2009. In this research, STC was used to display the spatiotemporal pattern of incidence of HFMD, and STSS were used to detect the local aggregations of the disease. Setting The hand-foot-mouth disease data were obtained from Guangdong Province from May 2008 to March 2009, with a total of 68,130 cases. Results The STC analysis revealed a differential pattern of HFMD incidence among different months and cities and also showed that the population density and average precipitation are correlated with the incidence of HFMD. The STSS analysis revealed that the most likely aggregation includes the Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan populations, which are the most developed regions in Guangdong Province. Conclusion Both STC and STSS are efficient tools for the exploratory data analysis of disease transmission. STC clearly displays the spatiotemporal patterns of disease. Using the maximum likelihood ratio, the STSS model precisely locates the most likely aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2176620983,"Cutaneous antigen presenting cells (APCs) are critical for the induction and regulation of skin immune responses. The human skin contains phenotypically and functionally distinct APCs subsets that are present at two separated locations. While CD1ahigh LCs form a dense network in the epidermis, the CD14+ and CD1a+ APCs reside in the dermal compartment. A better understanding of the biology of human skin APC subsets is necessary for the improvement of vaccine strategies that use the skin as administration route. In particular, progress in the characterization of uptake and activatory receptors will certainly improve APC-targeting strategies in vaccination. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the expression and function of glycan-binding and pattern-recognition receptors in skin APC subsets. The results demonstrate that under steady state conditions human CD1a+ dermal dendritic cells (DCs) were phenotypically most mature as measured by the expression of CD83 and CD86, whereas the CD14+ cells showed a higher expression of the CLRs DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and DCIR and had potent antigen uptake capacity. Furthermore, steady state LCs showed superior antigen cross-presentation as compared to the dermal APC subsets. Our results also demonstrate that the TLR3 ligand polyribosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (pI:C) was the most potent stimulator of cytokine production by both LCs and dDCs. These studies warrant further exploration of human CD1a+ dDCs and LCs as target cells for cancer vaccination to induce anti-tumor immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2177831371,"Background With new testing technologies, task-shifting and rapid scale-up of HIV testing services in high HIV prevalence countries, assuring quality of HIV testing is paramount. This study aimed to explore various cadres of providers’ experiences in providing HIV testing services and their understanding of elements that impact on quality of service in Zambia. Methods Sixteen in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with HIV testing service providers including lay counselors, nurses and laboratory personnel at purposively selected HIV testing sites at a national reference hospital in Lusaka. Qualitative content analysis was adopted for data analysis. Results Lay counselors and nurses reported confidentiality and privacy to be greatly compromised due to limited space in both in- and out-patient settings. Difficulties in upholding consent were reported in provider-initiated testing in in-patient settings. The providers identified non-adherence to testing procedures, high workload and inadequate training and supervision as key elements impacting on quality of testing. Difficulties related to testing varied by sub-groups of providers: lay counselors, in finger pricking and obtaining adequate volumes of specimen; non-laboratory providers in general, in interpreting invalid, false-negative and false-positive results. The providers had been participating in a recently established national HIV quality assurance program, i.e. proficiency testing, but rarely received site supervisory visits. Conclusion Task-shifting coupled with policy shifts in service provision has seriously challenged HIV testing quality, protection of confidentiality and the process of informed consent. Ways to better protect confidentiality and informed consent need careful attention. Training, supervision and quality assurance need strengthening tailored to the needs of the different cadres of providers."
https://openalex.org/W2234359016,"Many cells, including murine airway epithelial cells, respond to a variety of inflammatory stimuli by synthesizing leukocyte-adhesive hyaluronan (HA) cables that remain attached to their cell surfaces. This study shows that air-liquid interface cultures of murine airway epithelial cells (AECs) also actively synthesize and release a majority of their HA onto their ciliated apical surfaces to form a heavy chain hyaluronan (HC-HA) matrix in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. These matrices do not resemble the rope-like HA cables but occur in distinct sheets or rafts that can capture and embed leukocytes from cell suspensions. The HC-HA modification involves the transfer of heavy chains from the inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) proteoglycan, which has two heavy chains (HC1 and HC2) on its chondroitin sulfate chain. The transesterification transfer of HCs from chondroitin sulfate to HA is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-induced gene 6 (TSG-6), which is up-regulated in inflammatory reactions. Because the AEC cultures do not have TSG-6 nor serum, the source of IαI, assays for HCs and TSG-6 were done. The results show that AECs synthesize TSG-6 and their own heavy chain donor (pre-IαI) with a single heavy chain 3 (HC3), which are also constitutively expressed by human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. These leukocyte adhesive HC3-HA structures were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage of naïve mice and were observed on their apical ciliated surfaces. Thus, these leukocyte-adhesive HA rafts are now identified as HC3-HA complexes that could be part of a host defense mechanism filling some important gaps in our current understanding of murine airway epithelial biology and secretions.

HA is normally formed as an unmodified structure but is uniquely modified during inflammation (1Papakonstantinou E. Karakiulakis G.

This modification involves the transfer of heavy chains (HC) from inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) to form HC-HA complexes mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced protein-6 (Tnfaip6), also known as TNFα-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) (4Milner C.M.

IαI is a proteoglycan produced by liver hepatocytes and released into the circulation. It is composed of the trypsin inhibitor bikunin with heavy chain 1 (HC1) and heavy chain 2 (HC2) that are covalently bound by ester linkages to bikunin via its single chondroitin sulfate chain. During inflammation, IαI can ingress into extracellular tissue spaces as a consequence of increased vascular permeability where it serves as a heavy chain donor. TSG-6 is expressed in stimulated cells and catalyzes the transfer of HC1 and HC2 from IαI to HA, forming the HC-HA complexes (5Milner C.M. Tongsoongnoen W. Rugg M.S. Day A.J.

Leukocytes can bind to HA cables at 4 °C and rapidly phagocytose the matrix at a physiological temperature of 37 °C. Recently, we found that transfer of HCs to form these HA matrices resulted in more pronounced cable formation that promotes greater leukocyte adhesion (22Lauer M.E. Cheng G. Swaidani S.

In all cell types studied to date, the leukocyte-adhesive HA cables synthesized by these cells remain attached to the cell surface. However, although airway epithelial cells (AECs) also form HA cables on their cell surface in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli (23Lauer M.E. Erzurum S.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Vasanji A.

These matrices do not resemble the HA cables but occur in distinct sheets, or rafts, of HA that are leukocyte-adhesive. Thus, a HA raft with HC-HA structure present in respiratory secretions raises a number of important questions regarding the role it has in inflammatory processes.

Glant (Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL), and 4–6-week-old female TSG-6−/− mice were used. Wild type controls on a BALB/c background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and used for preparing airway epithelial cell cultures and for collecting bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Basement membranes were previously generated by applying Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells onto a reconstituted collagen substrate laid on the surface of the porous membranes of 12-well tissue culture transwell inserts (353180; Falcon) (23Lauer M.E.

However, contraction of the collagen substrate by the AECs can create an imperfection in which some AECs can grow into the collagen layer as shown in the lower right of Fig. 3D and Fig. 1B. We have solved this problem by adding MDCK cells straight onto the porous membrane of the transwell insert. After reaching confluence, the MDCK cells were removed by detergent lysis using PBS with 0.5% IGEPAL® CA-630 (I8896; Sigma) leaving behind a native basement membrane on the transwell surfaces. The AECs grew more uniformly in the absence of the collagen layer (not shown) making a better culture model for differentiated AECs. However, the close attachment of the AECs to the transwell via the basement membrane, unlike the collagen substrate model, prevents detachment of the AEC layer for making vertical sections for microscopy.FIGURE 1.HA rafts are loosely attached to the apical surface of murine airway epithelia in vivo and on AEC lift cultures in vitro. One representative image out of three of the paraffin-embedded section of a murine airway epithelium in vivo (A) and a day 10 differentiated air/liquid AEC culture in vitro (B) were stained for HA with a fluorescent conjugate of a biotinylated HA-binding protein (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and for endoplasmic reticulum (red) with an antibody against KDEL. The arrows indicate the apical HA rafts. HA is also apparent in the basal areas with most of it in the underlying connective tissue in vivo.

Apical washes were collected by gently washing the apical surface of AEC cultures with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per insert of a 12-well plate. Washes were then frozen at −80 °C until the time of use. HA contents in the apical washes and in equivalent proportions of basal media from identical inserts were measured by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis as previously described (25Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Microanalysis of enzyme digests of hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The DNA contents from the identical inserts used in this experiment were measured at the end of their differentiation (day 10) and used for normalization purposes. In addition, the hyaluronan to chondroitin sulfate content ratios in the apical washes and basal media collected from each time point were used for further verification of our normalization. HCs were determined in BAL samples and in apical washes of day 10 air/liquid interface cultures of primary differentiated AECs by treatment with or without Streptomyces hyaluronidase (0.5 turbidity reducing unit (TRU)/ml; 100740–1; Seikagaku, East Falmouth, MA) overnight at 37 °C. The supernatants were then analyzed by Western blotting. Mice were euthanized by using isoflurane or pentobarbitol. BALs were obtained by cannulating the trachea with a 24 gauge-feeding needle and lavaging the lungs with 600 μl of PBS. The typical BAL fluid returned was 400–500 μl. A 100-μl aliquot of the collected BAL was transferred to a glass slide via cytospin and left to air dry completely before processing for immunohistochemistry. Samples were electrophoresed on 4–5% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted using Bio-Rad PVDF membranes and the Trans-Blot Turbo System. In Fig. 4, A and B, cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). All blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk and probed overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against HC1 (SC-33944; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HC2 (SC-21978; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HC3 (SC- 21979; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), bikunin (a kind gift from Anthony Day, University of Manchester, UK), and IαI (A0301; Dako Cytomation, Denmark). Biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG was used as secondary antibody (705–065-147; Jackson ImmunoResearch) to generate the blot in Fig. 7B (HC-3). Blots were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by treatment with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (P0397; Dako Cytomation) for 1 h at room temperature. TSG-6 was assessed using a biotinylated anti-mouse TSG-6 antibody (BAF2326; R&D Systems, Inc.). Recombinant mouse TSG-6 (2326-TS; R&D systems, Inc.) was used as a positive control for the TSG-6 antibody. All blots were developed using the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (RPN2232, Amersham Biosciences), and detected protein band intensities were measured using ImageJ software (imagej.nih.gov).FIGURE 7.Murine AECs make their own HC3 donor as HC3-bikunin, a member of the PαI/IαI family. A, PCR products produced using primers for the three heavy chain subtypes (HC1–3 as listed in Table 1) were prepared from mRNA isolated from day 10 unstimulated murine AECs and then separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with 3% ethidium bromide. β-Actin mRNA production was used as the housekeeping gene. One representative gel of three is shown. B, Western blots of AEC lysates demonstrate the presence of HC3 protein using a HC3 antibody (blot on the left). Western blots with antisera to HC1 and HC2 were negative (data not shown). A biotinylated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) was used after the primary antibody application followed by a streptavidin-HRP (1:2000 dilution). The detected band has a molecular mass of 132 kDa, equivalent to that of pre-IαI (with one HC) of the IαI (with two HCs) family. The blot in the right also labeled the Mr 132 band when it was probed with an antibody to bikunin, the core protein of IαI, providing evidence for the pre-IαI member of the family that is HC3-bikunin. This was done in replicates of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aliquots of BAL or apical washes from AECs were transferred to a glass slide via cytospins and air-dried completely. Samples were then fixed with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and air-dried for 1 h. Paraffin-embedded sections of lung tissue were previously fixed overnight in 10% formalin. The sections and methanol fixed cytospins of BAL and apical washes of AECs were rehydrated in PBS for 30 min and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. HA was labeled with a HA-biotinylated-binding protein (5 μg/ml; 385911; EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) in blocking solution and then with streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:500, product S11223; Invitrogen). These slides were simultaneously incubated with a mixture of antibodies to HC1, HC2, and HC3 using Alexa Fluor® 594 donkey anti-mouse secondary (1: 200; product A11058; Invitrogen) or anti-CD44 (1:250; product C7923, Sigma) or anti-KDEL (PA1-013; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied to the apical surface of the samples followed by coverslip application before visualizing using fluorescent microscopy. RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (74104; Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared using Superscript First-strand Synthesis System (11904–018; Invitrogen). Primers used are listed in Table 1. The PCR conditions were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 1 min. These conditions were used for all primers. PCR products were run on 3% ethidium bromide gels (E1510; Sigma) and 1% agarose gels (SeaKem® HGT-agarose, product 50041; Lonza).TABLE 1The sequences of the PCR amplification primersName of primersPrimer sequenceExpected PCR productβ-Actin5′-GGTCATCACTATTGGCAACG-3′133 bp5′-ACGGATGTCAACGTCACACT-3′Heavy chain 15′-TTCTCAGCCCTTAGAGATGGTG-3′5′-GAGTGGCAACTTTGAGTCTATGG-3′100 bpHeavy chain 25′-GGTGATAGAGAATGATGCTGGA-3′5′-CAACCTTGGTGCCATAATACAG-3′101 bpHeavy chain 35′-CCCAGAAAGATTACAGGAAGGA-3′5′-TCGGTATGGACACCATCAATTA-3′100 bpTSG-65′-CTCCATATGGCTTGAACAAGCAGC-3′5′-ACCACCTTCAAATTCACATACG-3′112 bp Open table in a new tab Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.; n is indicated in the figure legends in representative experiments. HA is located on the apical surfaces (white arrows) of murine AECs as distinct clumps or HA rafts (green) that can be seen both in vivo on a normal WT epithelium (Fig. 1A) and on an air/liquid day 10 AEC culture in vitro (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the air/liquid AEC culture model closely resembles its in vivo counterpart, as previously shown (23Lauer M.E. Erzurum S.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Vasanji A. Drazba J. Wang A. Fulop C. Hascall V.C. Differentiated murine airway epithelial cells synthesize a leukocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26283-26296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it represents a compatible model to study the HA rafts that murine AECs make. The apical surfaces of air/liquid AEC cultures were gently washed during their course of differentiation over 10 days and analyzed for HA (Fig. 2A) in comparison to that in basal media. The purpose of that was to be able to determine the time point where cells reached a steady state in HA production, which is day 10 after lift. HA contents were then measured in apical washes, basal media, and cell layers (Fig. 2B). The results indicate that the vast majority of the HA synthesized by murine AECs is shown to be on their surface (Fig. 1B), is loosely attached, and only small amounts are present in the basal medium. We did not see a significant difference in the HA synthesized apically between wild type and TSG-6 null AECs in vitro. This implies that the synthesis of this loosely attached HA on the apical surface of murine AECs, which also appears to be present in vivo (Fig. 1A), may be a normal process of airway epithelial biology, although it may be modified during periods of stress and inflammatory stimuli. HA cables are formed at the cell surface of a variety of cells including AECs (21Wang A. de la Motte C. Lauer M. Hascall V. Hyaluronan matrices in pathobiological processes.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1412-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) during inflammatory processes. These structures are known to function as a ligand for inflammatory cells (20de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Mononuclear leukocytes bind to specific hyaluronan structures on colon mucosal smooth muscle cells treated with polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid: inter-α-trypsin inhibitor is crucial to structure and function.Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the majority of the apical HA produced by AECs can be released into the extracellular space as HA rafts. To investigate whether these rafts are also leukocyte-adhesive, we incubated the apical washes of day 10 AEC cultures with a human cell line of monocytic U937 cells for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, an aliquot was transferred to a slide via cytospin and stained for CD44, a HA receptor. Multiple clusters of U937 cells were embedded in the HA rafts as shown in (Fig. 3A–C). Furthermore, similar clusters of U937 cells were observed when they were added to the apical surface of an AEC culture (Fig. 3D). This indicates that the HA rafts released by the AECs are also leukocyte-adhesive, similar to the HA cables that are known to form in other pathologies. However, in this case, they are not being formed in response to a pathological stimulus. The CD44 antibody used in all of our experiments is specific to human CD44 and stains only for CD44 on the cell surface of the human U937 cells and not on the murine epithelial cells. This explains the negative staining of CD44 on the cell surface of murine AECs. One possible explanation for the HA adhesiveness to leukocytes is due to a HA modification that normally occurs during inflammations, namely the transfer of HCs from IαI to form HC-HA complexes, which is mediated by TSG-6 (11Zhao M.

Apical washes of day 10 AEC cultures were collected at the indicated times (2–48 h) after replacing the medium on day 10. They were then treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (specific for HA) and analyzed for HCs by Western blots (Fig. 4A). The accumulation of HCs at ∼85 kDa over the time course is apparent. This band was not present in the absence of the hyaluronidase digestion as shown in the analysis of a day 12 apical wash (Fig. 4C). This provides evidence that monocyte binding is due to a large extent by the presence of HCs (11Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K.

Its capacity as an analgesic drug or in combinations thereof to reduce the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalational anesthetics represents an objective measure of this effect during general anesthesia. In this study, the effect of acetaminophen with and without morphine or tramadol was evaluated on the isoflurane MAC.Forty-eight male Wistar rats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen. MACISO was determined from alveolar gas samples at the time of tail clamping without the drug, after administering acetaminophen (300 mg/kg), morphine (3 mg/kg), tramadol (10 mg/kg), acetaminophen (300 mg/kg) + morphine (3 mg/kg), and acetaminophen (300 mg/kg) + tramadol (10 mg/kg).The control and acetaminophen groups did not present statistically significant differences (p = 0.98). The values determined for MACISO after treatment with acetaminophen + morphine, acetaminophen + tramadol, morphine, and tramadol were 0.98% ± 0.04%, 0.99% ± 0.009%, 0.97% ± 0.02%, and 0.99% ± 0.01%, respectively.The administration of acetaminophen did not reduce the MAC of isoflurane and did not potentiate the reduction in MACISO by morphine and tramadol in rats, and therefore does not present a sparing effect of morphine or tramadol in rats anesthetized with isoflurane."
https://openalex.org/W2178616890,"In this paper we demonstrate the use of network analysis to characterise patterns of clustering in spatio-temporal events. Such clustering is of both theoretical and practical importance in the study of crime, and forms the basis for a number of preventative strategies. However, existing analytical methods show only that clustering is present in data, while offering little insight into the nature of the patterns present. Here, we show how the classification of pairs of events as close in space and time can be used to define a network, thereby generalising previous approaches. The application of graph-theoretic techniques to these networks can then offer significantly deeper insight into the structure of the data than previously possible. In particular, we focus on the identification of network motifs, which have clear interpretation in terms of spatio-temporal behaviour. Statistical analysis is complicated by the nature of the underlying data, and we provide a method by which appropriate randomised graphs can be generated. Two datasets are used as case studies: maritime piracy at the global scale, and residential burglary in an urban area. In both cases, the same significant 3-vertex motif is found; this result suggests that incidents tend to occur not just in pairs, but in fact in larger groups within a restricted spatio-temporal domain. In the 4-vertex case, different motifs are found to be significant in each case, suggesting that this technique is capable of discriminating between clustering patterns at a finer granularity than previously possible."
https://openalex.org/W2172457455,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the main protein involved in the formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), it is the principal mediator of the reverse cholesterol transfer (RCT) pathway and provides cardio-protection. In addition to functional wild-type apoA-I, several variants have been shown to associate with hereditary amyloidosis. In this study we have performed biophysical and biochemical analyses of the structure and functional properties of the A164S variant of apoA-I (1:500 in the Danish general population), which is the first known mutation of apoA-I that leads to an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction and mortality without associated low HDL cholesterol levels. Despite the fact that epidemiologically IHD is associated with low plasma levels of HDL, the A164S mutation is linked to normal plasma levels of lipids, HDL and apoA-I, suggesting impaired functionality of this variant. Using biophysical techniques (e.g., circular dichroism spectroscopy and electron microscopy) to determine secondary structure, stability and pro-amyloidogenic property of the lipid free A164S apoA-I variant, our observations suggest similarity in structural properties between apoA-I WT and apoA-I A164S. However, the A164S apoA-I variant exhibits lower binding affinity to lipids but forms similar sized HDL particles to those produced by WT."
https://openalex.org/W2174766725,"Like many developing countries, Mali has few sources of mortality data. High quality mortality estimates are available from household surveys, such as the demographic and health surveys (DHS), approximately every five years, making it difficult to track progress in reducing mortality. The Rapid Mortality Monitoring (RMM) project in Mali aimed to address this issue by testing a community-based approach to measuring under-five mortality on a yearly basis.Seventy-eight community-based workers (relais) were identified in 20 villages comprising approximately 5,300 households. The relais reported pregnancies, births, and under-five deaths from July, 2012 to November, 2013. Data were double-entered, reconciled, cleaned, and analyzed monthly. In November-December 2013, we administered a full pregnancy history (FPH) to women of reproductive age in a census of the households in the project villages. We assessed the completeness of the counts of births and deaths, and the validity of under-five, infant, and neonatal mortality rates from the community-based method against the retrospective FPH for two rolling twelve-month periods. Monthly reporting by relais was high, with reports on pregnancies, births, and deaths consistently provided from all 78 relais catchment areas. Relais reported 1,660 live births and 276 under-five deaths from July, 2012 to November, 2013. The under-five mortality rate calculated from the relais data was similar to that estimated using the validation survey, where the overall ratios of the community-based to FPH-based mortality rates for the reporting periods were 100.4 (95% CI: 80.4, 120.5) and 100.8 (95% CI: 79.5, 122.0).On a small scale, the community-based method in Mali produced estimates of annualized under-five mortality rates that were consistent with those obtained from a FPH. The community-based method should be considered for scale-up in Mali, with appropriate measures to ensure community engagement, data quality, and cross-validation with comparable FPHs."
https://openalex.org/W2177742114,"Asthma is one of the most common of medical illnesses and is treated in part by drugs that activate the beta-2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) to dilate obstructed airways. Such drugs include long acting beta agonists (LABAs) that are paradoxically linked to excess asthma-related mortality. Here we show that LABAs such as salmeterol and structurally related β2-AR drugs such as formoterol and carvedilol, but not short-acting agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol, promote exaggerated asthma-like allergic airway disease and enhanced airway constriction in mice. We demonstrate that salmeterol aberrantly promotes activation of the allergic disease-related transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in multiple mouse and human cells. A novel inhibitor of STAT6, PM-242H, inhibited initiation of allergic disease induced by airway fungal challenge, reversed established allergic airway disease in mice, and blocked salmeterol-dependent enhanced allergic airway disease. Thus, structurally related β2-AR ligands aberrantly activate STAT6 and promote allergic airway disease. This untoward pharmacological property likely explains adverse outcomes observed with LABAs, which may be overcome by agents that antagonize STAT6."

Therefore we generated mice in which MR expression can be silenced during adulthood by administration of doxycycline (Dox). Using a lentiviral approach, we obtained two lines of transgenic mice harboring a construct that allows for regulatable MR inactivation by RNAi and concomitant expression of eGFP. MR mRNA levels in heart and kidney of inducible MR knock-down mice were unaltered in the absence of Dox, confirming the tightness of the system. In contrast, two weeks after Dox administration MR expression was significantly diminished in a variety of tissues. In the kidney, this resulted in lower mRNA levels of selected target genes, which was accompanied by strongly increased serum aldosterone and plasma renin levels as well as by elevated sodium excretion. In the healthy heart, gene expression and the amount of collagen were unchanged despite MR levels being significantly reduced. After transverse aortic constriction, however, cardiac hypertrophy and progressive heart failure were attenuated by MR silencing, fibrosis was unaffected and mRNA levels of a subset of genes reduced. Taken together, we believe that this mouse model is a useful tool to investigate the role of the MR in pathophysiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2180762926,"Most low- and middle-income countries lack fully functional civil registration systems. Measures of under-five mortality are typically derived from periodic household surveys collecting detailed information from women on births and child deaths. However, such surveys are expensive and are not appropriate for monitoring short-term changes in child mortality. We explored and tested the validity of two new analysis methods for less-expensive summary histories of births and child deaths for such monitoring in five African countries.The first method we explored uses individual-level survey data on births and child deaths to impute full birth histories from an earlier survey onto summary histories from a more recent survey. The second method uses cohort changes between two surveys in the average number of children born and the number of children dead by single year of age to estimate under-five mortality for the inter-survey period. The first method produces acceptable annual estimates of under-five mortality for two out of six applications to available data sets; the second method produced an acceptable estimate in only one of five applications, though none of the applications used ideal data sets.The methods we tested were not able to produce consistently good quality estimates of annual under-five mortality from summary birth history data. The key problem we identified was not with the methods themselves, but with the underlying quality of the summary birth histories. If summary birth histories are to be included in general household surveys, considerable emphasis must be placed on quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2277786033,"Dysfunctions of approach and avoidance motivation play an important role in depression, which in turn may affect cognitive control, i.e., the ability to regulate thoughts and action to achieve internal goals. We use a novel experimental paradigm, i.e. a computer simulated driving-task, to study the impact of depression on cognitive control by measuring approach and avoidance actions in continuous time. In this task, 39 subjects with minimal to severe depression symptoms were instructed to use a joystick to move a virtual car as quickly as possible to a target point without crossing a stop-sign or crashing into a wall. We recorded their continuous actions on a joystick and found that depression 1) leads to further stopping distance to task target; and 2) increases the magnitude of late deceleration (avoidance) but not early acceleration (approach), which was only observed in the stop-sign condition. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that depressed individuals have greater avoidance motivation near stopping target, but are minimally affected by approach motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2291635614,"Many of the brain structures involved in performing real movements also have increased activity during imagined movements or during motor observation, and this could be the neural substrate underlying the effects of motor imagery in motor learning or motor rehabilitation. In the absence of any objective physiological method of measurement, it is currently impossible to be sure that the patient is indeed performing the task as instructed. Eye gaze recording during a motor imagery task could be a possible way to ""spy"" on the activity an individual is really engaged in. The aim of the present study was to compare the pattern of eye movement metrics during motor observation, visual and kinesthetic motor imagery (VI, KI), target fixation, and mental calculation. Twenty-two healthy subjects (16 females and 6 males), were required to perform tests in five conditions using imagery in the Box and Block Test tasks following the procedure described by Liepert et al. Eye movements were analysed by a non-invasive oculometric measure (SMI RED250 system). Two parameters describing gaze pattern were calculated: the index of ocular mobility (saccade duration over saccade + fixation duration) and the number of midline crossings (i.e. the number of times the subjects gaze crossed the midline of the screen when performing the different tasks). Both parameters were significantly different between visual imagery and kinesthesic imagery, visual imagery and mental calculation, and visual imagery and target fixation. For the first time we were able to show that eye movement patterns are different during VI and KI tasks. Our results suggest gaze metric parameters could be used as an objective unobtrusive approach to assess engagement in a motor imagery task. Further studies should define how oculomotor parameters could be used as an indicator of the rehabilitation task a patient is engaged in."
https://openalex.org/W2244737759,"Because of minimal data available on folate analysis in dried matrix spots (DMSs), we combined the advantages of stable isotope dilution assays followed by LC-MS/MS analysis with DMS sampling to develop a reliable method for the quantitation of plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid in dried blood spots (DBSs) and dried plasma spots (DPSs) as well as for the quantitation of whole blood 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid in DBSs. We focused on two diagnostically conclusive parameters exhibited by the plasma and whole blood 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid levels that reflect both temporary and long-term folate status. The method is performed using the [2H4]-labeled isotopologue of the vitamin as the internal standard, and three steps are required for the extraction procedure. Elution of the punched out matrix spots was performed using stabilization buffer including Triton X-100 in a standardized ultrasonication treatment followed by enzymatic digestion (whole blood only) and solid-phase extraction with SAX cartridges. This method is sensitive enough to quantify 27 nmol/L whole blood 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid in DBSs and 6.3 and 4.4 nmol/L plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid in DBSs and DPSs, respectively. The unprecedented accurate quantification of plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid in DBSs was achieved by thermal treatment prior to ultrasonication, inhibiting plasma conjugase activity. Mass screenings are more feasible and easier to facilitate for this method in terms of sample collection and storage compared with conventional clinical sampling for the assessment of folate status."
https://openalex.org/W2173808377,"Trapping is a common sampling technique used to estimate fundamental population metrics of animal species such as abundance, survival and distribution. However, capture success for any trapping method can be heavily influenced by individuals’ behavioural plasticity, which in turn affects the accuracy of any population estimates derived from the data. Funnel trapping is one of the most common methods for sampling aquatic vertebrates, although, apart from fish studies, almost nothing is known about the effects of behavioural plasticity on trapping success. We used a full factorial experiment to investigate the effects that two common environmental parameters (predator presence and vegetation density) have on the trapping success of tadpoles. We estimated that the odds of tadpoles being captured in traps was 4.3 times higher when predators were absent compared to present and 2.1 times higher when vegetation density was high compared to low, using odds ratios based on fitted model means. The odds of tadpoles being detected in traps were also 2.9 times higher in predator-free environments. These results indicate that common environmental factors can trigger behavioural plasticity in tadpoles that biases trapping success. We issue a warning to researchers and surveyors that trapping biases may be commonplace when conducting surveys such as these, and urge caution in interpreting data without consideration of important environmental factors present in the study system. Left unconsidered, trapping biases in capture success have the potential to lead to incorrect interpretations of data sets, and misdirection of limited resources for managing species."
https://openalex.org/W2188036736,"In the petals of some species of flowers, programmed cell death (PCD) begins earlier in mesophyll cells than in epidermal cells. However, PCD progression in each cell type has not been characterized in detail. We separately constructed a time course of biochemical signs and expression patterns of PCD-associated genes in epidermal and mesophyll cells in Lilium cv. Yelloween petals. Before visible signs of senescence could be observed, we found signs of PCD, including DNA degradation and decreased protein content in mesophyll cells only. In these cells, the total proteinase activity increased on the day after anthesis. Within 3 days after anthesis, the protein content decreased by 61.8%, and 22.8% of mesophyll cells was lost. A second peak of proteinase activity was observed on day 6, and the number of mesophyll cells decreased again from days 4 to 7. These biochemical and morphological results suggest that PCD progressed in steps during flower life in the mesophyll cells. PCD began in epidermal cells on day 5, in temporal synchrony with the time course of visible senescence. In the mesophyll cells, the KDEL-tailed cysteine proteinase (LoCYP) and S1/P1 nuclease (LoNUC) genes were upregulated before petal wilting, earlier than in epidermal cells. In contrast, relative to that in the mesophyll cells, the expression of the SAG12 cysteine proteinase homolog (LoSAG12) drastically increased in epidermal cells in the final stage of senescence. These results suggest that multiple PCD-associated genes differentially contribute to the time lag of PCD progression between epidermal and mesophyll cells of lily petals."
https://openalex.org/W2184620792,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells undergoing sporulation form prospore membranes to surround their meiotic nuclei. The prospore membranes ultimately become the plasma membranes of the new cells. The putative phospholipase Spo1 and the tandem Pleckstrin Homology domain protein Spo71 have previously been shown to be required for prospore membrane development, along with the constitutively expressed Vps13 involved in vacuolar sorting. Here, we utilize genetic analysis, and find that SPO73 is required for proper prospore membrane shape and, like SPO71, is necessary for prospore membrane elongation. Additionally, similar to SPO71, loss of SPO73 partially suppresses spo1Δ. Spo73 localizes to prospore membranes and complexes with Spo71.

https://openalex.org/W2292326197,"High Resolution Melting (HRM) following PCR has been used to identify DNA genotypes. Fluorescent dyes bounded to double strand DNA lose their fluorescence with increasing temperature, yielding different signatures for different genotypes. Recent software tools have been made available to aid in the distinction of different genotypes, but they are not fully automated, used only for research purposes, or require some level of interaction or confirmation from an analyst.We describe a fully automated machine learning software algorithm that classifies unknown genotypes. Dynamic melt curves are transformed to multidimensional clusters of points whereby a training set is used to establish the distribution of genotype clusters. Subsequently, probabilistic and statistical methods were used to classify the genotypes of unknown DNA samples on 4 different assays (40 VKORC1, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 samples in triplicate, and 49 MTHFR c.665C>T samples in triplicate) run on the Roche LC480. Melt curves of each of the triplicates were genotyped separately.Automated genotyping called 100% of VKORC1, CYP2C9*3 and MTHFR c.665C>T samples correctly. 97.5% of CYP2C9*2 melt curves were genotyped correctly with the remaining 2.5% given a no call due to the inability to decipher 3 melt curves in close proximity as either homozygous mutant or wild-type with greater than 99.5% posterior probability.We demonstrate the ability to fully automate DNA genotyping from HRM curves systematically and accurately without requiring any user interpretation or interaction with the data. Visualization of genotype clusters and quantification of the expected misclassification rate is also available to provide feedback to assay scientists and engineers as changes are made to the assay or instrument."
https://openalex.org/W2172356561,"Rapid diagnosis for time-sensitive illnesses such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and septic shock is essential for successful treatment. Much attention has therefore focused on new strategies for rapid and objective diagnosis, such as Point-of-Care Tests (PoCT) for blood biomarkers. Here we use a biomimicry-based approach to demonstrate a new diagnostic platform, based on enzymes tethered to nanoparticles (NPs). As proof of principle, we use oriented immobilization of pyruvate kinase (PK) and luciferase (Luc) on silica NPs to achieve rapid and sensitive detection of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a clinically relevant biomarker for multiple diseases ranging from acute brain injuries to lung cancer. We hypothesize that an approach capitalizing on the speed and catalytic nature of enzymatic reactions would enable fast and sensitive biomarker detection, suitable for PoCT devices.We performed in-vitro, animal model, and human subject studies. First, the efficiency of coupled enzyme activities when tethered to NPs versus when in solution was tested, demonstrating a highly sensitive and rapid detection of physiological and pathological concentrations of NSE. Next, in rat stroke models the enzyme-based assay was able in minutes to show a statistically significant increase in NSE levels in samples taken 1 hour before and 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours after occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery. Finally, using the tethered enzyme assay for detection of NSE in samples from 20 geriatric human patients, we show that our data match well (r = 0.815) with the current gold standard for biomarker detection, ELISA-with a major difference being that we achieve detection in 10 minutes as opposed to the several hours required for traditional ELISA.Oriented enzyme immobilization conferred more efficient coupled activity, and thus higher assay sensitivity, than non-tethered enzymes. Together, our findings provide proof of concept for using oriented immobilization of active enzymes on NPs as the basis for a highly rapid and sensitive biomarker detection platform. This addresses a key challenge in developing a PoCT platform for time sensitive and difficult to diagnose pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2464334832,"Understanding the role of genetics in disease has become a central part of medical research. Non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) in coding regions of human genes frequently lead to pathological phenotypes. Beyond single variations, the individual combination of nsSNVs may add to pathogenic processes. We developed a multiscale pipeline to systematically analyze the existence of quantitative effects of multiple nsSNVs and gene combinations in single individuals on pathogenicity. Based on this pipeline, we detected in a data set of 842 nsSNVs discovered in 76 genes related to cardiomyopathies, associated nsSNV combinations in seven genes present in at least 70% of all 639 patient samples, but not in a control cohort of healthy humans. Structural analyses of these revealed primarily an influence on the protein stability. For amino acid substitutions located at the protein surface, we generally observed a proximity to putative binding pockets. To computationally analyze cumulative effects and their impact, pathogenicity methods are currently being developed. Our approach supports this process, as shown on the example of a cardiac phenotype but can be likewise applied to other diseases such as cancer."

Prothrombinase is composed of a catalytic subunit, factor Xa (fXa), and a regulatory subunit, factor Va (fVa), assembled on a membrane surface in the presence of divalent metal ions. We constructed, expressed, and purified several mutated recombinant FII (rFII) molecules within the previously determined fVa-dependent binding site for fXa (amino acid region 473–487 of FII). rFII molecules bearing overlapping deletions within this significant region first established the minimal stretch of amino acids required for the fVa-dependent recognition exosite for fXa in prothrombinase within the amino acid sequence Ser478–Val479–Leu480–Gln481–Val482. Single, double, and triple point mutations within this stretch of rFII allowed for the identification of Leu480 and Gln481 as the two essential amino acids responsible for the enhanced activation of FII by prothrombinase. Unanticipated results demonstrated that although recombinant wild type α-thrombin and rIIaS478A were able to induce clotting and activate factor V and factor VIII with rates similar to the plasma-derived molecule, rIIaSLQ→AAA with mutations S478A/L480A/Q481A was deficient in clotting activity and unable to efficiently activate the pro-cofactors.

Concurrent with the appearance of excess fVa during clotting and in the presence of a procoagulant surface, the order of cleavages is reversed, and initial cleavage at Arg320 generates a transient enzymatically active intermediate, meizothrombin, that has much higher catalytic efficiency than IIa toward chromogenic substrates usually employed to assess IIa activity (18Krishnaswamy S.

Meizothrombin is next cleaved at Arg271 resulting in the generation of IIa and fragment 1·2 (meizothrombin pathway). Although efficient cleavage at each site requires the presence of phospholipids, initial cleavage at Arg320 is entirely fVa-dependent. In the absence of fVa, the two activation cleavage sites are not readily available, and FII is activated at a slow non-physiological rate by membrane-bound fXa alone. Interactions between fXa and FII are known to exist in the presence and absence of fVa; however, the enhanced activity of fXa within prothrombinase toward both activating cleavage sites is controlled solely by the membrane-bound non-enzymatic cofactor (3Mann K.G.

Consequently, the innate process of coagulation rests on specific molecular interactions involved in the fVa-dependent activation of FII by prothrombinase. In relation to fXa alone, the relative rate of IIa formation by prothrombinase is increased by 300,000-fold because of the increase in the rates of both FII cleavages. This increase is mainly associated with a large (3,000-fold) increase in the kcat value of fXa within prothrombinase with a 100-fold decrease in the Km value of the enzyme (16Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. The role of phospholipids and factor Va in the prothrombinase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This substantial increase in enzymatic activity resulting in rapid and physiologically relevant IIa generation at the place of vascular injury is credited through precise and unique interactions of the cofactor with specific amino acids affiliated with both membrane-bound fXa and membrane-bound FII as recently demonstrated (27Shim J.Y.

Accordingly, the introduction of the non-enzymatic cofactor into prothrombinase equips the organism's coagulation artillery necessary for the explosive arrest of vasculature bleeding.

Hockin M.F. Mann K.G. Everse S.J. The crystal structure of activated protein C-inactivated bovine factor Va: implications for cofactor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Molecular dynamics simulations and structural analyses.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13082-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the crucial interaction of the acidic hirudin-like COOH-terminal portion of the heavy chain of the cofactor with FII required for efficient IIa formation was initially ignored because it was missing from the crystal structure of the cofactor (51Adams T.E. Hockin M.F. Mann K.G. Everse S.J. The crystal structure of activated protein C-inactivated bovine factor Va: implications for cofactor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8918-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This interaction was further discounted without providing any solid evidence (53Toso R. Camire R.M.

A very recent model of prothrombinase using as a template the crystal structure of prothrombinase from the snake venom of Pseudonaja textilis verified and established the critical role of the acidic COOH-terminal region of fVa heavy chain for optimal rates of FII cleavage at two spatially distinct sites by prothrombinase resulting in timely IIa formation at the place of vascular injury (27Shim J.Y.

Additional studies with several recombinant prethrombin-1 molecules, where seven critical basic amino acids within (pro)exosite I were individually changed to glutamic acid, confirmed the interaction of (pro)exosite I with fVa acidic regions (50Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Proexosite-1 on prothrombin is a factor Va-dependent recognition site for the prothrombinase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Notably, the data revealed that although mutated prethrombin-1 is a poor substrate for prothrombinase, the same molecule was activated by membrane-bound fXa alone with similar rates as wild type prethrombin-1. Supplementary to these studies, Yegneswaran et al. (56Yegneswaran S. Mesters R.M. Fernández J.A. Griffin J.H. Prothrombin residues 473–487 contribute to factor Va binding in the prothrombinase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49019-49025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), utilizing synthetic peptide derived from a highly conserved region of FII, postulated the existence of an fVa-dependent binding exosite for fXa within the sequence 473–487 of FII (chymotrypsin numbering 149D-163 (4Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. The refined 1.9 A crystal structure of human α-thrombin: interaction with d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone and significance of the Tyr-Pro-Pro-Trp insertion segment.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar)) that is in close spatial arrangement to (pro)exosite I. The same authors have also identified an fVa-independent site for fXa on prothrombin (amino acids 557–571) (57Yegneswaran S. Mesters R.M. Griffin J.H. Identification of distinct sequences in human blood coagulation factor Xa and prothrombin essential for substrate and cofactor recognition in the prothrombinase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to identify and investigate the identity and role of the minimum required amino acid stretch within sequence 473–487 of FII that is conserved in a wide range of mammalian species and regulates peptide bond specificity and FII activation by prothrombinase in an fVa-dependent manner. Our findings identify for the first time two specific amino acids within FII that have a dual role. They are required for efficient fVa-dependent tethering of fXa needed for timely FII cleavage at Arg320 and IIa formation, while also serving an important role in directing efficient cleavage of IIa's physiological substrates. The latter is a prerequisite for expression of optimal physiological IIa activity.

Epithelial longitudinal muscles of polyps were unaffected by blebbistatin, as polyps contracted when challenged with a pulse of KCl. Latrunculin B, which sequesters G actin preventing F actin assembly, caused stolons to retract, exposing focal adhesions where the tip epithelial cells adhere to the substratum. These results are consistent with earlier suggestions that non-muscle myosin II provides the motive force for stolon tip pulsations and further suggest that tip oscillations are functionally coupled to hydrorhizal axial muscle contraction."
