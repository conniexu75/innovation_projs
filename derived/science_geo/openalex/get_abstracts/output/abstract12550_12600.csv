https://openalex.org/W2085064863,"Ten percent digestion of isolated nuclei by pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I preferentially removes globin DNA sequences from nuclei obtained from chick red blood cells but not from nuclei obtained from fibroblasts, from brain, or from a population of red blood cell precursors. Moreover, the nontranscribed ovalbumin sequences in nuclei isolated from red blood cells and fibroblasts are retained after mild deoxyribonuclease I digestion. This suggests that active genes are preferentially digested by deoxyribonuclease I. In contrast, treatment of red cell nuclei with staphylococcal nuclease results in no preferential digestion of active globin genes. When the 11S monomers obtained after staphylococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei are then digested with deoxyribonuclease I, the active globin genes are again preferentially digested. The results indicate that active genes are probably associated with histones in a subunit conformation in which the associated DNA is particularly sensitive to digestion by deoxyribonuclease I."
https://openalex.org/W1980878261,"We have described a formal model for pattern regulation in epimorphic fields in which positional information is specified in terms of polar coordinates in two dimensions. We propose that cells within epimorphic fields behave according to two simple rules, the shortest intercalation rule and the complete circle rule, for both of which there is direct experimental evidence. It is possible to understand a large number of different behaviors of epimorphic fields as a straight-forward consequence of these two rules, and the model therefore provides a context in which to view many of the results of experimental embryology. Although we have confined our discussion to cockroach legs, the imaginal disks of Drosophila, and regenerating and developing amphibian limbs, the fact that the model can explain regulative behavior in such evolutionarily diverse animals suggests that it may have general applicability to epimorphic fields. The predictions which the model makes should make it possible to assess its applicability to other developing systems, and to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved."
https://openalex.org/W2061144747,"When their growth is arrested in culture, susceptible 3T3 fibroblasts differentiate into adipose cells. Different clones form adipose cells with different frequency, depending upon the proportion of susceptible cells they contain. In cultures grown from small inocula, the fat cells appear in clusters formed by colonies of susceptible cells. Study of these clusters indicates the infrequent occurrence of cellular transitions from insusceptible to susceptible state. Beginning with a clone converting to adipose cells with a vary low frequency, it has been possible, by serial selection, to generate subclones which convert with a high frequency. This evolution is due to spontaneous heritable changes affecting susceptibility to the adipose conversion. Presumably, they involve the control of triglyceride synthesis. Early stages of the adipose conversion may be recognized in stained cultures. When triglyceride first begins to accumulate, the highly extended and flattened processes of the cells are probably similar to those of nonfatty cells in the same cultures. As the adipose conversion proceeds, the processes thicken and retract; the cells eventually acquire the rounded shape of the more mature adipose cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036766833,"The small molecular weight RNAs of the HeLa cell have been located in specific subcellular fractions. SnA is located in the nucleolus and is partially bonded to nucleolar 28S RNA. SnD, the most abundant of the small nuclear RNAs, is partially released from the nucleus when the nuclear preparation is briefly warmed. SnF is released from the nuclei when chromatin is digested with the micrococcal nuclease and not when pancreatic DNAase is used. The remainder of the small nuclear species remain in the nucleus following the digestion of chromatin and are concluded to be elements of the ""nuclear skeleton."" SnK is found predominantly in the cytoplasm, but migrates quantitatively to the nuclear fraction in the presence of high levels of actinomycin D. ScL is totally cytoplasmic and is partially bound to cell membranes. It is the 7S RNA found in oncornavirus virions. All the small nuclear RNAs appear initially in the cytoplasmic fraction before fixation in the nucleus. Two short-lived cytoplasmic species behave kinetically as precursors to the stable nuclear RNAs."

By electron microscopy, using a lysosomal marker, these parasitic protozoa were seen to multiply within host cell phagolysosomes. The survival mechanism of this intracellular parasite is based apparently upon resistance to macrophage lysosomal enzymic digestion."
https://openalex.org/W2070407528,"Virus-specific RNA was prepared from cells early after adenovirus type 2 infection and fractionated by hybridization to specific fragments of viral DNA. The viral mRNA was used to program cell-free protein synthesis, and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis. The genes for the early polypeptides of apparent molecular weight 44,000, 15,000, 72,000, 15,500, 19,000, and 11,000 daltons were located, respectively, between positions 0–4.1, 4.1–16.7, 58.5–70.7, 75.9–83.4, 89.7–98.6, and 89.7–98.6 of the conventional adenovirus DNA map. The polypeptide of molecular weight 72,000 daltons was shown to be the single-strand DNA-binding protein described by others. RNAs from three different adeno-transformed cell lines each program the synthesis in vitro of predominantly the 15K polypeptide, as well as variable amounts of the polypeptide of molecular weight 44,000 daltons. The genes for these two polypeptides are located in the portion of DNA known to be required for transformation of rodent cells by adenovirus."

Features in common with the cat and the monkey visual cortex include a precise topographic organization, a high degree of binocular interaction, and selectivity for orientation, direction of movement, and binocular disparity of straight-line contours."
https://openalex.org/W2050114343,Calcium fluxes of human neutrophils measured in the presence of chemotactically active serum showed a marked stimulation of calcium-45 uptake from the media. Chemotactically inactive serum did not cause an influx of calcium. The magnitude of the calcium influx due to activated serum is sufficient to trigger contractile systems previously described in muscle cells. Lanthanum chloride inhibited the chemotactic response of human neutrophils to activated serum. Lanthanum in concentrations that suppressed chemotaxis also inhibited the calcium influx caused by activated serum. Lanthanum in concentrations that suppressed chemotaxis also inhibited the calcium influx caused by activated serum. The data support a direct role of calcium influx in chemotaxis of neutrophils.
https://openalex.org/W2073414382,"A virus-coded low molecular weight RNA (5.2S), which migrates slightly faster on polyacrylamide gels than the well characterized adenovirus-specific 5.5S RNA, has been isolated from cells infected with adenovirus type 2. Hybridization-competition experiments and RNA fingerprints indicate that the two virus-associated (VA) RNAs differ in their primary structures. The gene for 5.2S RNA is located to the right of the gene for 5.5S RNA, on the I strand of a DNA segment which extends between positions 30.3 and 32.2 on the map of adenovirus type 2 DNA. Both 5.5S and 5.2S RNA can be detected early after infection and also in the presence of cytosine-arabinoside or cycloheximide. After the onset of viral DNA replication, the synthesis of 5.2S RNA levels off, whereas 5.5S RNA is synthesized in increasing amounts. Both 5.2S and 5.5S RNAs are synthesized in isolated nuclei by an enzyme which resembles RNA polymerase III in its sensitivity to alpha-amanitin. In isolated nuclei, both RNA species are labeled with beta-32P-labeled GTP, which suggests that they are initiated at separate promotor sites."
https://openalex.org/W2029282244,"We have analyzed the sequence complexity and diversity of poly(A)-containing mRNA derived from two highly differentiated chicken tissues. Two independent approaches were used in our analyses. The first involves the annealing of cDNA copies of mRNA to a vast excess of the template RNA; the second procedure uses hybridization between highly radioactive single-copy genomic DNA and mRNA. The results obtained using these two experimental approaches are in good accord and reveal the presence of 12,000-15,000 diverse mRNA species in both chicken liver and oviduct. In both cell types, the kinetics of annealing of cDNA to its template mRNA demonstrate discrete frequency classes with most of the different mRNA species present in fewer than 10 copies per cell. 70% of oviduct mRNA, however, consists of about 10 abundant RNA species, which probably are responsible for the synthesis of the egg white proteins. The diversity of mRNA species in chicken liver and oviduct was further studied by heterologous annealing reactions between cDNA or single-copy genomic DNA and a vast excess of mRNA. These studies demonstrate that 85% of the different mRNA sequences detected are present in both liver and oviduct, and suggest that the vast majority of the information expressed as mRNA is required for the maintenance of cellular functions common to all tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2076163707,"A purified toxin (the B5 fraction) from black widow spider venom added to the solution on one side of a lipid bilayer membrane interacts irreversibly with the membrane to produce a continuous, linear rise of membrane conductance with time. Conductances greater than 10(-4) reciprocal ohm per square centimeter can eventually be attained without any loss of membrane stability. Membranes treated with toxin are ideally selective for alkali cations over anions and are substantially permeable to calcium ion. These effects of the toxin result from the formation of permanent channels in the membrane of uniform conductance, 3.6 X 10(-10) reciprocal ohm (in 0.1 molar potassium chloride), that remain open almost all the time. Both the divalent cation permeability and the smaller conductances at low pH of toxin-treated membranes suggest that there is negative charge (possibly from carboxyl groups) associated with the channels. We discuss the possible relation of the action of this toxin on lipid bilayer membranes to its ability to stimulate massive transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and to produce profound morphological changes on tissue cultured neurons."

Consequent upon this binding, C3b no longer functions in either the classical or alternative pathways. This C3b inhibitory activity is a property of a protein previously designated beta 1H on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2051373425,"A kinetic analysis of the labeling of the methylated components of messenger RNA and heterogeneous nuclear RNA in mouse L cells indicates that the 5' terminal cap I structures (m7GpppXmpYp) of mRNA are derived from 5' terminal cap structures of hnRNA. Most of the hnRNA caps are conserved during processing, whereas only a portion of the internal m6A residues in hnRNA are conserved. The cap II structures (m7GpppXmpYmpZp), which constitute the 5' termini of some mRNAs, arise by a ""secondary"" methylation that occurs after the mRNAs have entered the cytoplasm. This secondary methylation is apparently restricted to a particular subclass of mRNAs having a high frequency of pyrimidine nucleotides at position Y, a composition at position X which differs from that of the bulk of the cap I-terminated mRNAs, and a relatively slow rate of turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2094799747,"Organ cultures of liver from untreated male Xenopus respond to 17 beta-estradiol in the culture medium by synthesizing and secreting the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin. Vitellogenin synthesis, as a primary response, is first detectable on the fourth day of culture, and comprises up to 12% of the protein synthesized on the eighth day. Estradiol is required during the lag period of 4 days. Tissue from male Xenopus injected with 1 mg of estradiol 30 days before the start of culture responds more rapidly and to a greater extent to estradiol in the medium than tissue from uninjected males. During such a secondary response, vitellogenin is first detectable in the medium on the second day of culture, and becomes up to 24% of the protein synthesized on day 6. The rate of amino acid incorporation into total protein also increases in response to estradiol, but the rate of synthesis of albumin decreases rapidly in culture whether or not estradiol is present, in both the primary and secondary responses. A maximal response is seen with 10(-8) M estradiol. Progesterone, testosterone, dexamethasone, and insulin neither induce vitellogenin synthesis in culture nor modify the response to estradiol. DNA synthesis inhibitors do not prevent the response to estradiol in vitro, suggesting that cell division is not required for the initial response leading to vitellogenin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2031347517,"Nuclei isolated from human cells productively infected with adenovirus 2 have been shown to synthesize four low molecular weight RNA species which hybridize efficiently to viral DNA. One species corresponds to the 5.5S or VA RNA ( Ohe et al., 1969 Ohe K. Weissman S.M. Cooke N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5320-5332 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar ), and is designated V156. The other three species are novel and have been designated V200, V140, and V130, since they are approximately 200, 140, and 130 nucleotides in length, respectively. These viral RNAs retain their distinct electrophoretic properties after denaturation with formamide. RNA species with electrophoretic mobilities similar to those of the V200, V156, and V140 RNAs have been found in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells at late times after adenovirus infection. In isolated nuclei, the V200, V156, V140, and V130 RNAs are all synthesized by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III, since synthesis is sensitive to high but not to low concentrations of α-amanitin. The synthesis of these low molecular weight RNAs continues for a prolonged period of time in isolated nuclei, suggesting that reinitiation occurs. Adenovirus 2 DNA fragments obtained by digestion with restriction endonucleases Eco RI and Sma I were used to map the location of the DNA sequences which encode the RNAs. All the low molecular weight RNAs hybridized to a region of the genome between 0.18 and 0.38 fractional lengths from the left end of the adenovirus genome, suggesting that the respective DNA sequences are clustered. Other nonviral low molecular weight RNAs are synthesized in nuclei isolated from infected cells. These include the cellular 5S rRNA species which was monitored by its hybridization to purified 5S DNA from Xenopus laevis."
https://openalex.org/W2070312298,"Specific removal of sialic acid from cultured heart cells with purified neuraminidase increases cellular calcium exchangeability. Potassium exchange is unaffected or slightly decreased. Sialic acid removal also permits lanthanum, normally restricted to the cellular surface, to enter the cells and displace more than 80 percent of cellular calcium. The results indicate a specific role of cellular surface components in the control of calcium exchangeability in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2163512464,"The relationship between cell proliferation and the amount and diversity of polyribosome-associated poly(A)-containing messenger RNA [poly(A)+mRNA] has been investigated using a cloned AKR-mouse embryo cell culture system. The following results were obtained. First, an early response to the stimulation of proliferation of AKR-2B cells in culture is a rapid increase in the rate of accumulation of polyribosomal poly(A)+ mRNA. This results in a large increase in the total poly(A)+ mRNA content of rapidly proliferating cells compared to that found in resting cells. Second, the total amount of unique DNA sequence contributing to the poly(A)+ mRNA populations of both growing and resting cells is not detectably different. This corresponds to 9000-11,000 diverse gene equivalents of DNA and represents the transcription of 0.8–0.9% of the haploid mouse genome. Third, most of the increased poly(A)+ mRNA content of growing cells (>90%) reflects an increased rate of production of polysomal mRNA species which are also found in resting cells. Fourth, growing cells appear to contain some species of poly(A)+ mRNA which are either absent or present in very low concentrations in non-growing cells. Within the limits of detection, however, all species of poly(A)+ mRNA present in non-growing cells are also present in growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003641552,"Total RNA from Drosophila imaginal discs, labeled under conditions of heat shock, is analyzed by hybridization in situ to salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Grain densities over the hybridizing bands are compared, showing that the response to heat shock is similar for several disc types and fly stocks. Alteration of the culture medium used for labeling during heat shock results in the specific induction (in discs, salvary glands, or fat body) of one of the heat-shock loci to a level far beyond that normally seen. We discuss the implications of this specific induction regarding the mechanism of response. We also discuss the observed difference between transcription labeling of salivary gland chromosomes and labeling by in situ hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W2038526791,"The 5' leads to 3' polarity of the 40S precursor rRNA molecule relative to the location of the 18S and 28S RNA regions in the precursor has been reinvestigated. Fragments of rDNA derived by the restriction endonuclease EcoRI and cloned in E. coli were partially digested with the exonuclease induced by bacteriophage lambda and with exonuclease III from E. coli. The resulting rDNA fragments with single-stranded tails were hybridized separately with 18S and 28S rRNA, and the formation of the hybrid was monitored by determination of radioactivity and by electron microscopy. Since the location of the EcoRI sites in rDNA is known, and the specificity of the two exonucleases for 5' and 3' ends of DNA strands has been established, the hybridization of the different partially digested rDNA fragments with either 18S or 28S rRNA could be interpreted in terms of polarity of the coding strand of rDNA, and consequently of the RNA (see models in Figure 1). The results supports the following model for the rRNA precursor moleculre: 5' end-transcribed space-18S gene-transcribed space-28S gene-3' end."
https://openalex.org/W2048013101,"We present evidence that the poly(A) sequence at the 3′ end of ovalbumin mRNA has an effect on its translational efficiency in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free system. Polynucleotide phosphorylase has been used to remove selectively the poly(A) while leaving the rest of the molecule intact. It is shown that the stability of the mRNA in a cell-free system is not appreciably affected by this procedure. Measurements of the size of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes, rate of peptide elongation, and number of rounds of translation per messenger show a generally reduced efficiency for deadenylated mRNA compared to native mRNA. No comparable difference was observed in experiments with a wheat germ cell-free system, which gives few rounds of translation per mRNA. This indicates that the effect results from a lowering of the efficiency of reinitiation on deadenylated mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2072906956,"Cutoff spatial frequencies for sine-wave gratings were measured at four orientations for 100 Caucasian and 24 Chinese subjects, all of whom were raised in carpentered environments. For the Caucasian subjects, average acuity for horizontal and vertical gratings was superior to that for obliques by about one-quarter of an octave. However, about 10 percent of subjects failed to show the effect. The Chinese subjects showed an anisotropy of about one-eighth of an octave. The carpentered environment explanation of orientation anisotropy cannot, in its present form, account for the wide variety of response patterns obtained, nor the differences between Chinese and Caucasian subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2056599830,"We have studied the maturation of T4 polyheads, the aberrant tubular structures related to the capsid of T4 bacteriophage. Conditions have been found under which more than 95% of the major head protein (P23) undergoes the same cleavage that occurs during development of the normal capsid. The concomitant structural changes in the polyheads have been followed using electron microscope image filtering techniques. As a result of the cleavage, a radical transformation of the hexagonal lattice occurs, involving a 10-15% expansion in the lattice dimensions. However, a metastable intermediate state similar to the uncleaved structure has been observed immediately after cleavage of the protein subunits. Some kind of additional physical stimulus seems to be required to trigger the major structural change, which appears to be highly cooperative."
https://openalex.org/W2067159565,"The characteristic hepatocellular changes resulting from phenobarbital administration in vivo, namely an increase in the levels of cytochrome P-450 and proliferation of membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, have been demonstrated in primary cultures of nonreplicating hepatocytes on floating collagen membranes. Addition of methylcholanthrene to the medium resulted in an increase in cytochrome P-448 within 48 hours, whereas the phenobarbital induction of P-450 required 5 days. These results demonstrate that responses induced in adult liver cells in vivo by phenobarbital can be reporoduced in cultured hepatocytes, contrary to previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W2012510578,"A technique is proposed for the monitoring of certain xenobiotic pollutants in suspect aquatic enviornments by fish bile analysis. Bile removed from rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) exposed to nine different radioactive compounds in vivo contained concentrations of radioactivity greater than those in the surrounding water. Bile-to-water radioactivity ratios as high as 10,000: 1 were found after 24-hour exposures. The results of these experiments suggest that analysis of bile of wild or caged fish from a suspect site may be useful as a qualitative monitoring aid for certain types of xenobiotics in water."
https://openalex.org/W2071497156,"Addition of cortisol (10-6 to 10-8M) and related glucocorticoid congeners to cultures of rat parathyroid glands stimulated dose-related increases in parathyroid hormone secretion; the addition of deoxycorticosterone or cortexolone was without effect. Cortexolone, however, inhibited the stimulatory activity of cortisol when both were added to the culture medium. This direct stimulatory effect of cortisol on parathyroid gland secretion may account in part for the increased concentration of parathyroid hormone in the serum of cortisol-treated animals."
https://openalex.org/W2164889233,"During differentiation of embryonic chick skeletal muscle in culture, elaboration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and acetylcholinesterase occurs shortly after myoblast fusion. During further development, AChR was found to decrease markedly on the myotube surface, while acetylcholinesterase continued to increase. Surface distribution of AChR, as followed by autoradiography using 125I-α-bungarotoxin, was homogeneous in newly fused myotubes. With further differentiation, clusters of AChR appeared on the surface of the myotubes, and their subsequent disappearance paralleled a decrease in overall AChR levels. Quantitative autoradiography showed a reduction of over 75% in the density of AChR on the surface of well differentiated, cross-striated myotubes. Thus the appearance of AChR on the cell surface, its condensation into clusters, and finally its depletion seem to be sequential events in the differentiation of skeletal muscle in culture in the absence of direct neuronal influence."

https://openalex.org/W2011226777,"A steady decrease of extractable [14C]parathion residues in soils over a 1-month incubation period was accompanied by an increase of unextractable, bound 14C-labeled residues, resulting finally in total recoveries of extracted plus bound residues of 80 to 87 percent of the applied radiocarbon. Soils containing bound residues were nontoxic to fruit flies. Binding of 14C-labeled residues was related to the activity of soil microorganisms; soil sterilization resulted in a reduction of binding by 58 to 84 percent. Under flooded (anaerobic) conditions, the binding of compounds labeled with 14C doubled, and parathion was reduced to aminoparathion. Reinoculation of sterilized flooded soil fully reinstated the binding capacity. [14C]Aminoparathion was preferentially bound to soil, since its binding within 2 hours was 30 times greater than that of [14C]parathion. Because of the existence of formerly ""unseen,"" unextractable residues, the concept of ""persistent"" and ""nonpersistent"" pesticide residues might have to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2089944487,"About 85-90% of cytoplasmic protein synthesized by young reticulocytes is globin, and about 10% is a polypeptide (I) of molecular weight 64,000 daltons. Maturation of reticulocytes is accompanied by selective reduction in the synthesis of polypeptide I, relative to globin; mature reticulocytes synthesize globin at a high level but make no detectable polypeptide I. Studies in which RNA from young and old reticulocytes was translated in a wheat germ cell-free extract showed that reduction in synthesis of polypeptide I was correlated with a reduction in the amount of translatable mRNA for this protein. Differential destruction of mRNA thus is an important factor in determining the types of proteins made during the final stages of erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973055726,"Administration of 4-aminopyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine decreased serum cholesterol levels in the rat to less than 5 milligrams per deciliter. Coincident with this change, there was a 2.1 - to 16.0-fold increase in the rate of sterol synthesis in seven extrahepatic tissues. This suggests that cholesterol carried in serum lipoproteins plays a major role in regulating sterol synthesis in many extrahepatic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2033967561,"Temperature-sensitive ts A1S9 mouse L cells synthesize DNA apparently normally for 6–8 hr upon incubation at 38.5°C. Thereafter, these cells are able to perform limited polydeoxyribonucleotide chain synthesis at the high temperature, but are unable to convert newly replicated small single-strand segments of DNA (of the order of molecular weight 106 daltons) to large molecular weight chromosomal DNA. Data obtained are compatible with a model which suggests that ts A1S9 cells are able to carry out most individual reactions of DNA synthesis at the high temperature, but are temperature-sensitive in a protein which participates in the joining of small DNA segments to make chromosomal DNA strands. When cells are reincubated at a permissive temperature, after the temperature-sensitive lesion has been established, they recover the latter capability several hours before they are able once again to synthesize DNA at normal rates."
https://openalex.org/W2045951304,"Antibodies elicited in rabbits by chromatin and by purified histone H2B have been used to study the structure of chromatin by immunoelectron microscopy. Chromatin spread on grids reveals a structure of closely packed spherical particles with an average diameter of 104 A, arranged either in clusters or in linear arrays of beads, some of which have a supercoil-like arrangement. No DNA strings connecting the beads could be observed. Upon antibody binding, the diameter of the particles increases up to 300 A. This size is compatible with a model where one layer of gamma globulin molecules 110 A long encircles a sphere of chromatin 100 A in diameter. The presence of rabbit gamma globulins on the enlarged beads has been verified by the addition of ferritin-labeled goat anti-rabbit gamma globulins. Anti-chromatin sera which react with nonhistone proteins but not with free histones or DNA react with more than 95% of the beads; this suggests that most of the beads contain nonhistone proteins. Since the number of nonhistone proteins is large, it is improbable that each sphere contains a full complement of these proteins. We therefore suggest that the various chromatin spheres contain different types of nonhistone proteins. About 90% of the chromatin spheres reacted with antibodies to histone H2B, suggesting the most of the chromatin beads contain this type of histone."
https://openalex.org/W2011348160,"Field recordings of electric organ discharges and catches of Marcusenius cyprinoides showed that these electric fish form groups and move about in schools. The role electric organ discharges in group cohesion was investigated by comparing interactions in groups of intact and operated, electrically silent fish. The absence of electric organ dischares reduced locomotor activity and resulted in the disappearance of two behaviors: parallel lineup and single file swimming. Electric signals are considered part of a schooling mechanism that aids the fish in maintaining group cohesion in their turbid enviornment and during migration at night."
https://openalex.org/W2132626441,"The number of genes specifying human γ-globin has been determined directly by hybridization of complementary DNA to total human DNA. The complementary DNA was enriched in sequences specific for γ-globin genes by transcribing globin mRNA isolated from fetal reticulocytes with viral reverse transcriptase, and collecting the material which does not back-hybridize to adult globin mRNA. When hybridized in cDNA excess to DNA, very similar values are found for γ-gene number as for β-gene number, suggesting two or at most three γ-globin genes per haploid human genome. This indicates that the non-Mendelian ratios of γ-chain mutants found in heterozygotes are due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation rather than to gene dosage. The number of each major human globin gene has now been determined directly by molelcular methods."

We have also found that the concentration of dopamine increases in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep, and suggest that this may be related to the subsequent appearance of paradoxical sleep. These data raise new questions on the hippocampal role in the sleep-wakefulness cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2081025952,"Amal, an alpha-amanitin-resistant mutant of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, contains an RNA polymerase activity which elutes from DEAE-Sephadex at a salt concentration characteristic of an RNA polymerase II, but which is not sensitive to alpha-amanitin at levels where the polymerase II of wild-type cells is strongly inhibited. This result suggests that Amal owes its amanitin-resistant phenotype to a mutation affecting one of its genes for RNA polymerase II. To test this hypothesis, we purified the enzyme from Amal and then compared its properties with those of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme is indeed a polymerase II, and is over 600 times less sensitive to alpha-amanitin and more thermolabile than the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2020072050,"A technique for efficient cytochalasin-induced enucleation was used to prepare ""karyoplasts""--nuclei surrounded by a thin shell of cytoplasm and an outer cell membrane. Methods for estimating the quantity of cytoplasm remaining in karyoplasts indicated that they contained less than 10% of the amount found in whole cells. Procedures for separating karyoplasts from contaminating cytoplasmic fragments and whole cells are also described. Freshly prepared L-cell karyoplasts were unable to adhere to and spread upon a surface. However, after incubation for several days, about 30% of the karyoplasts regained these abilities to some degree. A portion of the regenerating karyoplasts were then observed to divide. These events were confirmed and recorded by time-lapse cinematography. In addition, by culturing karyoplasts under appropriate conditions, clones were isolated."
https://openalex.org/W2090258879,"A method has been developed for the isolation of fibroin gene transcripts from total RNA of the silkworm Bombyx mori. It is based on affinity chromatography using Sephadex-bound polynucleotides capable of selectively hybridizing with fibroin mRNA sequences. In vivo pulse labeling of the posterior silk gland for periods of 10-35 min produces labeled heterogeneous nuclear RNA of high molecular weight (greater 40S). Fibroin gene transcripts can be selected from the total hnRNA population by two consecutive passages through the affinity column. Analysis of the column-bound material in denaturing polyacrylamide-agarose gels reveals that the size of pulse-labeled fibroin mRNA is essentially the same (within 5%) as that of mature cytoplasmic mRNA. This holds true for pulses as short as 6 min, where even nascent mRNA can be observed. However, a small shoulder of material is present on the heavy side of the pulse-labeled mRNA, which could be indicative of an extremely short-lived precurosr species. The purified pulse-labeled mRNA (10 min incorporation) has been further analyzed by chromatography in oligo(dT)-cellulose. The data show that the mRNA is polyadenylated within a few minutes after synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2153544028,"Some quantitative parameters of the intranuclear metabolism and export to the cytoplasm of Balbiani ring 1 and 2 RNA molecules in salivary gland cells of Chironomus tentans have been determined. Growing RNA chains in the Balbiani rings attain uniform labeling with RNA precursors after 20 min of incorporation. The specific activity of 75S RNA released from the Balbiani rings into the nuclear sap increases rapidly and reaches a maximum level between 90 and 180 min of labeling. After 20 min, labeled 75S RNA enters the cytoplasm and accumulates at a linear rate. However, only a small proportion of the RNA produced at the Balbiani ring loci can subsequently be recovered in the nuclear sap (14–17%) or cytoplasm (4–7%) as 75S RNA; presumably the remainder is degraded entirely. Experiments using inhibitors of elongation (actinomycin D) or initiation (5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) revealed that no significant quntity of the 75S RNA transcribed can be chased into the cytoplasm. Both the kinetics of entry of labeled 75S RNA into the cytoplasm—that is, a constant rate of increase after a brief lag—and chase data are incompatible with a precursor-product relationship between the great majority of nuclear 75S RNA and cytoplasmic 75S RNA with messenger characteristics. The results are discussed in relation to the possibility that a post-transcriptional control mechanism is operating in these cells."

The changes are revealed by conventional staining for light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. L cells grow indefinitely on combinations of equal concentrations of glucose and galactose, xylose, or mannose. There appear to be no significant differences in growth rate on glucose compared to the combinations of sugars cited. Cells subcultured from glucose to the combinations while undergoing rapid multiplication show marked morphologic changes by light and scanning electron microscopy within 36 hr. Of particular note are the loss of microvilli; flattening of the cells; assumption of polygonal shape; prominence of nuclei and nucleoli; and changes in the structure and distribution of filopodia. Virtually all cells in the population exhibit the changes noted."

Hot spots were found. Therefore, hot spot development is not dependent on prior contact with nerve processes."
https://openalex.org/W1482445001,"The results of a series of light scattering experiments of the reaction of inositol hexaphosphate (at pH 7.0) over 6 orders of magnitude of concentration (10(-8) to 10(-2) M) with carboxyhemoglobin indicates that there is a shift in the tetramer-dimer equilibrium towards the tetramer, reaching a maximum effect at 0.1 mM inositol hexaphosphate. Raising the phosphate concentration beyond this latter value promotes dissociation to dimers. However, in this range some of the dissociation of carboxyhemoglobin was undoubtedly due to the increase in ionic strength from the inositol hexaphosphate ion. If the effect of ionic strength is allowed for by classical Debye-Huckel theory, one- and possibly two-phosphate binding sites per dimer can be detected. (Approximate association constant is 8000 M-1 for a single site at 0.1 ionic strength). The location of such sites is considered to lie near the dissociable plane of the hemoglobin tetramer and possibly to include half of the residues that bind inositol hexaphosphate in the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W2003578407,"We have isolated variants of Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts with decreased sensitivity to the toxic proline analog, L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZCA). Resistance to AZCA is a stable characteristic of these cell lines since it is maintained after 40 generations in nonselective medium. Two AZCA-resistant cell lines overproduce and excrete more proline than wild-type cells. Furthermore, AZCA rapidly inhibits the synthesis of proline from glutamic acid in wild-type but not the resistant cell lines. These studies suggest that resistance to AZCA in these cell lines is due to an alteration in some component of the proline biosynthetic pathway, possibly a regulatory site that is inhibited by AZCA."
https://openalex.org/W1979809819,Drosophila pseudoobscura females show a positive bias toward mating with males whose proportion in the population is low. They can perform this discrimination even when three strains of males are present. The olfactory recognition required for this discrimination entails a hierarchically ordered recognition system and a natural unit of olfactory strength.

Microfluorometric spectra of the plexus show nerve fibers that contain norepinephrine and impinge on satellite cells. Cells containing serotonin occur occasionally on longitudinal muscle outside the myenteric plexus."
https://openalex.org/W1548048838,"Abstract Large single crystals of iron-containing superoxide dismutase from Pseudomonas ovalis were prepared from 50% saturated ammonium sulfate solution, at pH 4.5, on gentle evaporation of the solvent at 4 degrees. The crystals were monoclinic, space group P2, with unit cell dimensions a = 81.9 A, b = 49.0 A, c = 61.0 A, and beta = 106 degrees. Considerations of cell volume and protein molecular weight indicated 1 molecule of superoxide dismutase in the assymmetric unit, the smallest number reported so far for superoxide dismutases."
