https://openalex.org/W2107979967,"Brain and thyroid tissue contain membrane-bound colchicine-binding activity that is not due to contamination by loosely bound cytoplasmic tubulin. This activity can be solubilized to the extent of 80 to 90% by treatment with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 with retention of colchicine binding. Extracts so obtained contain a prominent protein band in disc gel electrophoresis that co-migrates with tubulin. Membranes, and the solubilized protein therefrom, exhibit ligand binding properties like tubulin; for colchicine the KA is approximately 1 X 10(6) M-1 in brain and approximately 0.6 X 10(6) M-1 in thyroid; for vinblastine the KA is approximately 8 X 10(6) M-1 for both tissues; and for podophyllotoxin the Ki is approximately 2 X 10(-6) M for both tissues. Displacement by analogues of colchicine is of the same order as for soluble tubulin. Although membrane-bound colchicine-binding activity shows greater thermal stability and a higher optimum binding temperature (54 degrees versus 37 degrees) than soluble tubulin, this appears to be the result of the membrane environment since the solubilized binding activity behaves like the soluble tubulin. Antibody against soluble brain tubulin reacts with membranes and solubulized colchicine-binding activity from both brain and thyroid gland. We conclude that brain and thyroid membrane preparations contain firmly bound tubulin or a very similar protein."

An immune affinity column extraction technique was used to purify partially a substance from human urine which was similar to the mouse hormone in both its biological activity and immunoreactivity.

https://openalex.org/W1601614334,"The distribution of alanine aminotransferase isozymes in several tissues from several species has been studied. In glycolytic tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, cytosolic alanine aminotransferase was the predominant form. In gluconeogenic tissues, such as liver and kidney, the concentration of the cytosolic alanine aminotransferase was much more variable; its presence, however, may be correlated with the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the same compartment. The particulate enzyme was found associated only with the matrix of the mitochondria. It was present only in those gluconeogenic tissues that can utilize alanine for glucose production, e.g. rat liver and pig liver and kidney; it was absent from rat kidney which cannot convert alanine to glucose. These observations, together with the kinetic parameters of the two isozymes, suggest that in vivo, mitochondrial alanine aminotransferase is involved in the conversion of alanine to pyruvate, while the cytosolic isoenzyme is mainly involved in the formation of alanine from pyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1584501944,"A complementary DNA synthesized from ovalbumin mRNA was used in hybridization experiments to study the early effect of estrogen and progesterone on the accumulation of ovalbumin mRNA sequences in the chick oviduct. Chicks treated with estrogen withdrawn from the hormone maintain a steady level of 60 molecules of ovalbumin mRNA per tubular gland cell, at least 80% of which are localized in the cytoplasm. After estrogen administration, there is a 3- to 4-hour lag before a rapid increase in the number of ovalbumin mRNA sequences and a parallel increase in ovalbumin synthesis. Progesterone causes a more rapid increase in both ovalbumin mRNA sequences and ovalbumin synthesis with a lag period of only 90 min. The hybridization results demonstrate that both estrogen and pregesterone affect the amount of ovalbumin mRNA per cell. The 3-hour lag period seen with estrogen appears to be caused by some event after the binding of the estrogen receptor to chromatin but prior to change in the rate of transcription of the ovalbumin gene."

https://openalex.org/W2014000284,The key to understanding species variation in neuroendocrine controlling mechanisms lies in understanding the constraints that have given rise to diverse reproductive patterns. Recent research clearly shows that species evolving under different constraints exhibit different patterns of reproduction and have fundamentally different neuroendocrine mechanisms controlling reproduction. Diversity can be exploited profitably by those interested in the fundamental nature of biobehavioral mechanisms. The comparative approach also promises to increase our understanding of broader intellectual and theoretical issues in behavioral endocrinology.
https://openalex.org/W1601803010,"When intact rat heart mitochondria were pulsed with 150 nmol of CaCl2/mg of mitochondrial protein, only a marginal stimulation of the rate of oxygen consumption was observed. This result was obtained with mitochondria isolated in either the presence or absence of nagarse. In contrast, rat liver mitochondria under similar conditions demonstrated a rapid, reversible burst of respiration associated with energy-linked calcium accumulation. Direct analysis of calcium retention using 45Ca and Millipore filtration indicated that calcium was accumulated by heart mitochondria under the above conditions via a unique energy-dependent process. The rate of translocation by heart mitochondria was less than that of liver mitochondria; likewise the release of bound calcium back into the medium was also retarded. These results suggest that the slower accumulation and release of calcium is characteristic of heart mitochondria. The amound of calcium bound was independent of penetrant anions at low calcium concentrations. Above 100 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein, the total calcium bound was increased by the presence of inorganic phosphate. Under nonrespiring conditions, a biphasic Scatchard plot indicative of binding sites with different affinities for Ca2+ was observed. The extrapolated constants are 7.5 nmol/mg bound with an apparent half-saturation value of 75 muM and 42.5 nmol/mg bound with half-saturation at 1.15 mM. The response of the reduced State 4 cytochrome b to pulsed additions of Ca2+ was used to calculate an energy-dependent half-saturation constant of 40 muM. When the concentration of free calcium was stabilized at low levels with Ca2+-EGTA buffers, the spectrophotometrically determined binding constant decreased two orders of magnitude to an apparent affinity of 4.16 X 10(-7) M. Primary of calcium transport over oxidative phosphorylation was not observed with heart mitochondria. The phosphorylation of ADP competed with Ca2+ accumulation, depressed the rates of cation transport, and altered the profile of respiration-linked H+ movements. Consistent with these result was the observation that with liver mitochondrial the magnitude of the cytochrome b oxidation-reduction shift was greater for Ca2+ than for ADP, whereas calcium responses never surpassed the ADP response in heart mitochondria. Furthermore, Mg2+ ingibited calcium accumulation by heart mitochondria while having only a slight effect upon calcium transport in liver mitochondria. The unique energetics of heart mitochondrial calcium transport are discussed relative to the regulated flux of cations during the cardiac excitation-relaxation cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1572694798,"The influence of amino acids on D-glucose transport was studied in isolated vesicles of brush border membrane from rat small intestine. It is demonstrated that: (a) Uptake of D-glucose by the membranes is inhibited by simultaneous flow of L- and D-alanine into the vesicles. (b) Addition of L-alanine to membranes pre-equilibrated with D-glucose causes efflux of this sugar. (c) The influence of amino acids on D-glucose is dependent on the presence of Na+. (d) The ionophorous agents monactin and valinomycin are able to prevent the transport interaction of D-glucose and amino acids. Monactin is effective in the presence of Na+ without further addition of other cations, while valinomycin is effective only with added K+, in accordance with the known specificity of these antibiotics. (e) The inhibitory effect increases with L-alanine concentration up to about 50 mM after which it levels off. The experiments provide evident that the Na+-dependent sugar and amino acid fluxes across the brush border membrane are coupled electrically."
https://openalex.org/W1561679936,"The normal human granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein, transcobalamin I, and transcobalamin III, have been labeled with 125I-labeled N-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate and utilized for plasma clearance studies performed with rabbits. Both moieties of 125I-labeled granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein-[57Co]vitamin B12 were cleared rapidly from the plasma (is less than 90% by 5 min) by the liver. After 30 min, the bulk of the 125I reappeared in the plasma in small molecular weight (less than 1000) form and was rapidly excreted in the urine. After 60 min the bulk of the [57Co]vitamin B12 reappeared in the plasma bound to rabbit transcobalamin II and was subsequently taken up by a variety of tissues. Approximately 15% of the 125I-labeled granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein-[57Co-a1vitamin B12 was excreted intact into the bile during the period from 10 to 80 min after injection. The hepatic uptake of the protein-vitamin B12 complex was blocked by the prior injection of desialyzed fetuin but not by native fetuin. Similar results were obtained with 125I-labeled transcobalamin III-[57Co]vitamin B12. Approximately 90% of both moieties of 125I-labeled transcobalamin I-[57Co]vitamin B12 had prolonged plasma survivals similar to that of 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin. After treatment with neuraminadase, both moieties of the 125I-labeled transcobalamin I-[57Co]vitamin B12 complex were cleared rapidly from the plasma by the liver in a manner that was indistinguishable from that observed in the case of untreated granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein and transcobalamin III. These observations indicate that desialyzed transcobalamin I and the native forms of the granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein and transcobalamin III are cleared from plasma by the mechanism elucidated by Ashwell and Morell (Ashwell, G., and Morell A. G. (1974) Adv. Enzymol. 41, 99-128) that is capable of clearing a wide variety of asialoglycoproteins. These observations have implications concerning the function of the human R-type vitamin B12-binding proteins, the nature of the enterohepatic circulation of vitamin B12, the biological significance of the mechanism described by Ashwell and Morell, and the etiology of the increased plasma concentration of human R-type protein that occurs frequently in chronic myelogenous leukemia and occasionally in hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1588544209,"1-5-D-Gluconolactone is a competitive inhibitor of both sucrase and isomaltase. Substitution of the 1H and 2H at C1 of the glucosyl moiety in p-CL-phenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside leads to a decrease in kcat of both sucrase and isomaltase, the k1H/k2H ranging between 1.14 and 1.20. Treatment of the association constants and of the kcat values for a number of p-substituted phenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosides on the basis of the Hammet-Hansch equation has allowed the estimation of the importance of hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity as well as of the magnitude of the p values for both substrate-enzyme interaction and catalysis in both sucrase and isomaltase. The magnitude of the secondary deuterium effect as well as the low values of p in both sucrase and isomlatase are strongly indicative of the rate-limiting step going through the formation of an oxocarbonium ion. In conjunction with other observations reported previously, the data presented here led to the suggestion of the main lines of a reaction mechanism for the two glucosidases: prptonation of the glycosidic oxygen is followed by the liberation of the aglycone with formation of an oxocarbonium ion, which is temporarily stabilized by a carboxylate group."
https://openalex.org/W1990255685,"Adult female rats receiving long-term estrogen treatment displayed the species-typical motor pattern of ejaculation during copulation. This hormone treatment produced pituitary hypertrophy and concomitant pressure damage to brain areas dorsal to the pituitary, but did not cause clitoral hypertrophy. The demonstration of the ejaculatory pattern in perinatally untreated female rats indicates that the potential for the expression of the ejaculatory or ""orgasmic"" pattern is not dependent on exogenous androgen at any stage of development and is more widely represented among female mammals than previously believed."

https://openalex.org/W1530009124,"Actin purified from amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum polymerizes into filaments at 24 degrees upon addition of KCl, as judged by a change in optical density at 232 nm and by electron microscopy. The rate and extent of formation of this supramolecular assembly and the optimal KCl concentrations (0.1 M) for assembly are similar to those of striated muscle actin. The apparent equilibrium constant for the monomer-polymer transition is 1.3 muM for both Dictyostelium and muscle actin. Although assembly of highly purified Dictyostelium actin monomers into individual actin filaments resembles that of muscle actin, Dictyostelium actin but not muscle actin was observed to assemble into two-dimensional nets in 10 mM CaCl2. The Dictyostelium actin also forms filament bundles which are 0.1 mum in diameter and which assemble in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2. These bundles formed from partially purified Dictyostelium actin preparations but not from highly purified preparations, suggesting that their formation may depend on the presence of another component. These actin bundles reconstituted in vitro resemble the actin-containing bundles found in situ by microscopy in many non-muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1485459446,"Beta-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) has been purified from the livers of C57BL/6J mice. The enzyme migrated as a single band of protein on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight of the denatured and reduced enzyme was 63,000. The native form of beta-galactosidase appeared to be a tetramer of 240,000 at pH 5.0, which was reversibly dissociated at alkaline pH to a dimer with apparent molecular weight of 113,000. Multiple charge isomers of beta-galactosidase were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ion exchange chromatography. Treatment of beta-galactosidase with neuraminidase markedly reduced its electrophoretic mobility. Purified enzyme as well as crude liver extract hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-fucoside at one-tenth the rate of hydrolysis of the beta-galactoside. Antiserum to the purified enzyme precipitated the major portion of beta-galactosidase activity of mouse liver, brain, and kidney. This antiserum cross-reacts with beta-galactosidases from rat and Chinese hamster, but not with human, porcine, or bovine beta-galactosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1526269152,"A previous study from our laboratory suggested that 3-bromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 1,4-bisphosphate is an affinity label for spinach ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase. To identify the essential residues that react with the reagent we have isolated and characterized the labeled peptides that are present in tryptic digests of inactivated enzyme but lacking in digests of the substrate-protected enzyme. Peptides representing two sites of modification have been obtained from the inactivated carboxylase. Both sites of reaction have been identified as lysyl residues based on the conversion of the derivatives to free lysine by oxidation with sodium metaperiodate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoretic experiments show that both essential lysyl residues are contained within the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase. In addition to lysyl residues, sulfhydryl groups of the carboxylase are also modified, but their modification seems to play little role in the inactivation process. The carboxylase modified in the presence of substrate contains sulfhydryl derivatives but is essentially lacking in lysyl derivatives. By comparing the profiles from ion exchange chromatography of labeled peptides in digests of inactivated and substrate-protected enzyme, we conclude that the same sulfhydryl groups are modified in the absence and presence of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1604773022,"Ovalbumin messenger RNA was purified from hen oviduct by immunoprecipitation of polysomes and oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Two steps were introduced to improve the separation of mRNA and rRNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose. First, aggregates of mRNA and rRNA were dissociated by heating at 65degrees for 10 min before chromatography. Second, elution of the mRNA was achieved by stepwise increases in temperature rather than by lowering the ionic strength. Ovalbumin mRNA activity was eluted primarily in RNA fractions eluting between 45degrees and 55degrees. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the ovalbumin mRNA thus obtained was essentiallyyy free of rRNA. The poly(A) content of various thermally eluted fractions was assayed by two methods. In the first (Favre, A., Bertazzoni, V., Berns, A.J.M., and Bloemendal, H. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 56, 273-280), the increase in fluorescence intensity of bound ethidium bromide was used to follow the formation of double-stranded RNA during titration of the mRNA with poly(U). In the second (Bishop, J. O., Rosbash, M., and Evans, D. (1974) J. Mol. Biol. 85, 75-86), poly(A) content was derived from the radioactivity remaining acid-insoluble after annealing mRNA fractions with [3H]poly(U) and treating with ribonuclease A. Both methods indicated that ovalbumin mRNA fractions eluting at higher temperatures contained greater amounts of poly(A). Values ranged from 44 to 248 mol of AMP/mol of mRNA, assuming 2200 total nucleotide residues for ovalbumin mRNA (Shapiro, D. J., and Schimke, R. T. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1759-1764). Translational specific activities in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system were essentiall constant for all fractions. From the binding of ethidium bromide it could be estimated that approximately 50% of the nucleotide residues in ovalbumin mRNA are base-paired."
https://openalex.org/W1584995205,"Transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III have been purified approximately 6,000,000- and 3,000,000-fold, respectively, from normal human plasma using a purification scheme consisting of immunoadsorption, dialysis against 7.5 M guanidine HCl to remove endogenous vitamin B12, and affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose. The two proteins were separated from each other subsequently by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The vitamin B12-binding protein present in granulocytes obtained from normal subjects has been purified approximately 5000-fold using affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose as the sole purification technique. The final preparations of all three proteins were homogeneous based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III belong to the R-typed class of vitamin B12-binding proteins and are indistinguishable from each other, and from the human granulocyte, milk, and saliva R-type vitamin B12-binding proteins, when studied by immunodiffusion with rabbit anti-human milk vitamin B12-binding protein sera. The carbohydrate compositions, expressed as moles of carbohydrate per mole of vitamin B12, of transcobalamin I, transcobalamin III, and the normal granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein, respectively, are: sialic acid, 18, 11, 11; fucose, 9, 20, 24; galactose, 41, 51, 46; mannose, 24, 22, 20; galactosamine, 2, 2, 2; and glucosamine, 46, 54, 46. The high sialic acid content of transcobalamin I appears to account for the fact that this protein elutes after transcobalamin III and the normal granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein during chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. This observation provides support for the hypothesis that differences among the R-type vitamin B12-binding proteins are due to differences in carbohydrate content. The similarities in carbohydrate composition and other properties of transcobalamin III and the granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein provide support for the hypothesis that human plasma transcobalamin III is derived from granulocytes. The differences observed between transcobalamin I and the normal granulocyte vitamin B12-binding protein suggest that transcobalamin I may not be derived from granulocytes."

Utilizing this differential permeability, we have loaded intact erythrocytes with NAP-[35S]taurine in the dark at 37degrees, cooled them to 0 degrees, washed them free of external NAP-[35S]taurine in the dark and cold, and photolyzed them, resulting in labeling of hemoglobin and of proteins on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. These experiments complement those previously reported on the labeling of the external surface of the membranes with this reagent (Staros, J. V., and Richards, F. M. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 2720-2726)."
https://openalex.org/W1649286415,"The nature of the energy store causing rapid superstoichiometric leads to H+/2e minus ejection and leads to Ca2+/2e minus uptake ratios in rat liver mitochondria pulsed with Ca2+ has been investigated. The extent and the rate of the initial fast superstoichiometric phase of H plus ejection were greatly reduced by oligomycin and other ATPase inhibitors; the subsequent shoichiometric phase was unaffected. No such inhibition was seen with atractyloside. Similarly, the initial fast phase of Ca2+ uptake was reduced in extent by oligomycin, whereas the slower stoichiometric phase was unaffected. Moreover, the ATP content of mitochondria previously incubated with succinate decreased by about 80% within 5 s after pulsing with Ca2+. The energy store for superstoichiometric Ca2+ uptake and H plus injection is thus identified as endogenous ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1631195916,"Carbamylation of the NH2-terminal residues of the beta chains on hemoglobin (alpha2beta2c) leads to a reduced but still significant binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, but has no effect on the oxygen-linked binding of chloride or phosphate, both of which are thought to bind to some of the same residues as the organic phosphate. Studies by others have shown that the binding of inorganic anions is not diminished in either horse hemoglobin or in hemoglobin Little Rock, in which four of the six other binding sites (histidine residues) for organic phosphates are replaced by glutamine residues. We suggest, therefore, that lysines 82 of the beta chains, which are the remaining 2 residues in the binding crevice for the organic phosphate, and which are invariant in the known sequences of mammalian hemoglobins, may be the primary binding site for inorganic anions. The extent of inhibition of gelation by increasing ionic strength is identical for the hybrids alpha2beta2, alpha2cbeta2, and alpha2beta2c of hemoglobin S. These results indicate the NH2-terminal residues of the chains are not involved in primary electrostatic interactions during aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin S."
https://openalex.org/W1518598430,"Homogeneous estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.62) was prepared from human placenta by affinity chromatography and the steroid binding site was studied with affinity-labeling techniques. 16alpha-Bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether and the tritated compound were synthesized by condensation of estriol 3-methyl ether with bromoacetic acid or [2-3H]bromoacetic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 16alpha-Bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether is stable in 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 25 degrees, for at least 24 hours. It alkylates cysteine, histidine, methionine, lysine, and tryptophan under physiological conditions. The steroid is a substrate of estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase, thus it must bind at the steroid binding site. The inactivation of estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase by 150-fold molar concentrations of 16alpha-bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether follows pseudo-first order kinetics with a half-time of 1.5 hours. Estradiol-17beta, NADH, and NADPH slow the rate of inactivation. 2-Mercaptoethanol in molar concentrations 50-fold that of 16alpha-bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether stops the inactivation, but does not reverse it. 16alpha-Bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether alkylates both NADH and NADPH; the presence of small amounts of enzyme markedly increases the rate of this alkylation. When the enzyme is inactivated with 16alpha-[2-3H]bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether, amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates reveals 3-carboxymethylhistidine and 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine. Comparison of 28 and 51% inactivated samples indicates that, as inactivation proceeds, the total amount of 3-carboxymethylhistidine decreases, while 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine increases, suggesting that the former is converted to the latter by a second alkylation step. When the enzyme is inactivated in the presence of a large excess of NADPH, only 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine is found. From the present study it is concluded that estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase has a histidyl residue present in the catalytic region of the active site as does the previously studied 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase."

Species A comprised 80% of the protein in thyroglobulin of 0.04% iodine and 13% in thyroglobulin of 0.68% iodine content. Species C showed the opposite relationship, comprising 10% of the low and 70% of the high iodine thyroglobulin. Species B was relatively independent of the iodine content and represented approximately 20% of the protein. Iodine analysis of these proteins showed species A to be lowest and species C highest. It appears that the subunit composition of thyroglobulin depends on the degree of iodination and that species A should be the only one present in the absence of iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1604321626,"2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-mannopyranosyl phosphate, free of the alpha anomer, was coupled with citronellol and dolichol in the presence of triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride to give, after chromatographic purification and deacetylation, the respective polyisoprenyl beta-D-mannopyranosyl phosphates. These compounds were compared with the previously synthesized alpha anomers by means of their chromatographic properties, spectra, optical rotations, and hydrolysis reactions when treated with acid and alkali. To characterize the compounds resulting from these treatments, and to determine the mechanism of the alkaline hydrolysis, beta-D-mannopyranosyl phosphate was converted into beta-D-mannonpyranose 1,2-phosphate, and hence into D-mannose 2-phosphate, obtained as a mixture of alpha and beta anomers, characterized by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and elemental analysis.

Jack bean alpha-mannosidase, which converted citronellyl alpha-D-mannopyranosyl phosphate, but not its beta anomer, to citronellyl phosphate and D-mannose, was effective in releasing D-[14C]mannose from dolichyl alpha-D-[14C]manopyranosyl phosphate in the presence of detergent. In contrast, alpha-mannosidase did not cause any significant release from the pancreatic dolichyl D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate. Alkali treatment (0.1 M NaOH in propanol at 65 and 90 degrees) degraded both dolichyl D-[14C]mannosyl phosphates with the formation of water-soluble 14C-labeled products. The pattern of 14C-labeled breakdown products formed from the synthetic dolichyl alpha-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate differed from that obtained from the pancreatic dolichyl D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate. Dolichyl alpha-D-[14C]mannopyranosyl phosphate yielded several 14C-labeled products, including a trace of D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate, and an acidic fraction which appeared to result from degradation of D-[14C]mannose. The pancreatic dolichyl D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate gave various products, depending on the temperature of the reaction: at 90 degrees, 20 to 30% of the radioactivity was found in D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate and the rest in acidic breakdown products; at 65 degrees, about two-thirds of the radioactivity was recovered in a compound which behaved as D-MANNOSE 2-PHOSPHATE, A Product characteristic of a beta-linked D-mannosyl residue. It is concluded that the pancreatic compound is dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate."

This affinity labeling steroid inactivates 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in an irreversible and time-dependent manner which follows pseudo-first order kinetics with a t1/2 value of 4.6 hours. 2alpha-[2-3H]Bromoacetoxyprogesterone was synthesized and used to radiolabel the enzyme active site. Amino acid analysis of the acid hydrolysate of the radiolabeled enzyme supports a mechanism whereby the steroid moiety delivers the alkylating group to the steroid binding site of the enzyme where it reacts with a methionyl residue. Both 2alpha- and 11alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone alkylate a methionyl residue at the active site of 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The enzyme was inactivated with a mixture containing both 2alpha-[2-3H]Bromoacetoxyprogesterone and 11alpha-2[2-14C]bromoacetoxyprogesterone. Following degradation of separate aliquots of the radiolabeled enzyme by cyanogen bromide or trypsin, the protein fragments were separated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Resolution of peptides carrying the 3H label from those possessing the 14C label demonstrates that 2alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone and 11alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone each label a different methionine at the steroid binding site of 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1763464225,"In extracts from both growing and differentiating (spherulating) plasmodia of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, high aminopeptidase activities were found. The specificity of the aminopeptidases changed during differentiation with a higher relative activity towards hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acids. This change in specificity was found to be the result of a shift in the isoenzyme spectrum during differentiation as was tested by isoelectric focusing in sucrose gradients. Three different classes of isoenzymes were found: one band which was present in both growing and differentiating cultures; two bands which were found only in growing cultures; and four bands which were detectable only in differentiating plasmodia. If cycloheximide was applied during the induction of differentiation, only one band, the one present in both types of plasmodia, was found in the isoelectric focusing. Density labeling experiments using deuterated amino acids revealed that the bands which are present in differentiated plasmodia only are synthesized de novo during this differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1577463701,"Bovine glomerular basement membrane was extracted with 6 M guanidinium chloride and the soluble material fractionated on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column in 1% Na dodecyl-SO4. A single component was obtained by reduction of a selected column fraction with 2-mercaptoethanol followed by chromatography on an analytical Bio-Gel A-1.5m column and shown to be homogenous by electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. It consists of 90% protein and 8.6% carbohydrate by weight. The amino acid composition is characterized by the presence of low amounts of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, and substantial amounts of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, half-cystine, and glycine. It contains all the monosaccharide constituents present in the whole basement membrane indicating the presence of both heteropolysaccharide and disaccharide units; the presence of the latter unit was demonstrated unequivocally by ion exchange chromatography. The component contains 1 heteropolysaccharide unit and 4 dissaccharide units/molecule of Mr equals 70,000. The molecular weight of component VII was determined by several methods. Molecular weight values of 68,000 +/- 3,000 and 72,000 +/- 2,000 were determined in 6 M guanidinium chloride by the methods of sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration chromatography, respectively, and values of 136,000 +/- 3,100 and 140,000 +/- 2,000 were determined in 1% Na dodecyl-SO4 by the methods of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that component VII assumes a random coil conformation in 6 M guanidinium chloride and a more disordered conformation in 1% Na dodecyl-SO4 than standard proteins used in calibration of polyacrylamide gels and gel filtration column. These results indicate that the minimal molecular weight of component VII is about 70,000 and that the anomalous behavior in Na dodecyl-SO4 is due in part to its conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1481654951,"Radiometric methods for the assay of deoxycorticosterone 11beta-hydroxylase and for the determination of NADP on a microscale were developed. The determination of NADP was based on the quantitative conversion of 6-phospho[1-14C]gluconate to 14CO2 by the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Using these methods NADPH oxidase activity of the adrenodoxin reductase-adrenodoxin system as well as kinetic properties of deoxycorticosterone 11beta-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450) were investigated. The NADPH oxidase activity observed in the presence of adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, and O2, but in the absence of cytochrome P-450 and deoxycorticosterone, were functions of O2 and adrenodoxin concentrations and represented the autooxidation of reduced adrenodoxin which resulted in the production of H2O2. Due to the rapid autooxidizability of reduced adrenodoxin, only a small fraction of electrons conveyed from NADPH to adrenodoxin by way of adrenodoxin reductase was utilized for the deoxycorticosterone 11beta-hydroxylase reaction under the conditions employed."

https://openalex.org/W1663588906,"The subunit structure and amino acid composition of xylose isomerase from Streptomyces albus have been examined. A native molecular weight of 165,000 determined by sedimentation equilibrium was reduced to 43,000 when the protein was treated with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. No further reduction in molecular weight was observed when potential disulfide bridges of xylose isomerase were reduced and alkylated, indicating that the protein was devoid of interchain disulfide bonds. NH2-terminal analysis using [3H]dansyl chloride showed 0.86 residues of methionine per Mr equals 41,500 unit. Analysis of the native protein with an automated protein sequenator revealed the presence of only one degradable polypeptide chain. Fractionation of the soluble tryptic peptides of S-[14C]carboxymethyl xylose isomerase by ion exchange chromatography and one-dimensional paper electrophoresis yielded 37 to 43 peptides. When the acid-insoluble tryptic peptides were dissolved and analyzed using gel filtration techniques, and additional four peptides were found. A unique radioactive tryptic peptide containing S-carboxymethylcysteine was found among the soluble peptides, confirming cysteine as the limiting amino acid residue in the amino acid composition of xylose isomerase. On the basis of its lysine and arginine content, the number of tryptic peptides is consistent with the hypothesis that the native xylose isomerase is a tetramer of four very similar or identical subunits of Mr equals 41,500, associated by noncovalent bonds."

https://openalex.org/W70714145,"The amino acid sequence for vitamin D-dependent bovine intestinal calcium binding protein has been established. It contains 85 amino acids in a single chain and lacks cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, and arginine. The NH2-terminal lysine is blocked by an N-acetyl group. Enzymatic digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin yielded a number of peptides which were purified by two-dimensional high voltage paper electrophoresis. These peptides were examined by end group analysis and sequenced by the dansyl procedure. The absence of tryptophan permitted by a single cleavage of the molecule by N-bromosuccinimide at the tyrosine residue at position 8 and the larger fragment was subjected to automated Edman degradation. By these means, the following sequence was established: N-Ac-Lys-Gln-Ser-Pro-Leu-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ser-Ile-Gln-Lys-Glu-Ile-Glu-Lys-Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-Gln-Leu-Leu-Val-Ser-Val-Gln-Lys-Ala-Gly-Asp-Lys-Glu-Ser-Leu-Gln-Pro-Leu-Phe-Thr-Leu-Leu-Lys-Ser-Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Asn-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ser-Gln-Asn-Gly-Pro-Asp-Leu-Ls7-Ser-Gly-Pro-Gly-Asn-Asp-Leu-Glu-Glu-Lys-Gly-Thr-Asp-Val-Phe-Ser-Leu-Lys-Gln. Microheterogeneity may exist in the molecule at residue 76 in which position threonine may be replaced by serine. Comparison of the sequence of calcium-binding protein to the test sequence of Tufty and Kretsinger ((1975) Science 187, 167-169) proposed to identify E-F hands in muscle proteins suggests that intestinal calcium-binding protein may likewise contain one or possibly two E-F hands which could account for calcium-binding property. Dayhoff alignment scores, however, calculated for calcium-binding protein against nine E-F hands in muscle proteins parvalbumin, troponin and alkali light chains do not indicate that intestinal calcium-binding protein is homologous to these muscle protein chains."

https://openalex.org/W1602033160,"The heme derivative 2,4-diacetyldeuterohemin deuterated in the methyl groups of the acetyl moieties was reconstituted with sperm whale apomyoglobin and the two labeled methyl groups in the protein environment were observed by deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results were compared to the free hemin form as the dimethyl ester in chloroform and in a pyridine-water mixture, as well as in the zinc complex form. Under most conditions the two methyl resonances overlie each other to a large degree. Resonance width at half-height is of the order of 25 Hz for the protein and approximately one-third as much for the free hemin at 16 degrees and is little affected by conversion to paramagnetic derivatives. Chemical shifts for the oxy- and carbonmonoxymyoglobins are very similar. In cyanoferrimyoglobin a positive pseudo-contact contribution of 3.04 ppm was computed to explain a relative upfield shift offset in part by a small negative contact shift contribution. The cyanoferrimyoglobin resonance was sensitive to the presence of phosphate buffer as well as to cyclopropane. The aquoferrimyoglobin form shows distinct resonances for the two methyl groups, with the downfield resonance considerably broadened. The expected effects of temperature on chemical shift were observed, the paramagnetic derivatives showing an effect and carbonmonoxymyoglobin showing none. The relaxation behavior was gauged from the line widths and from measurements of spin-lattice relaxation time, T1. The effective rotational correlation time is of the order of 50 ps for the liganded myoglobin forms. The temperature dependence of the line widths may imply an increased retational freedom with increasing temperature. The broadening observed in the aquoferrimyoglobin case is indicative of restricted internal rotational motion of one of the methyl groups. The method is suitable for probing the more mobile structures in proteins and retains its value in the neighborhood of paramagnetic centers."

https://openalex.org/W1526223603,"Abstract Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase monomers are converted to catalytically active tetramers in the presence of monovalent cations. The stoichiometry of the reaction is 4M + 2C+ in equilibrium M4C2(2+). A positive deltaS compensates for an unfavorable positive deltaH so that the overall reaction is exergonic. Both deltaH and deltaS become more positive as the temperature is increased. Association of subunits of the enzyme prepared from Clostridium cylindrosporum is second order with respect to monomer concentration, consistent with a rate-determining dimerization step. Activation parameters for this step at 20 degrees are: deltaG, 12.6 kcal mol-1; deltaH, 12.5 kcal mol-1; deltaS, -05 e.u. The rate-limiting step for the cation-dependent association of Clostridium acidi-urici monomers is believed to be a conformational alteration since first order kinetics is observed. The Eyring plot of the kinetic data obtained for the C. acidi-urici system has a sharp break at 15 degrees. Activation parameters for cation-induced association at 20 degrees are: deltaG, 21.5 kcal mol-1; deltaH, 14.0 kcal mol-1; deltaS, -26.6 e.u."
https://openalex.org/W1619049040,"Using galactose oxidase as well as beta-galactosidase to produce modifications of the galactose units, the functional significance of these carbohydrate residues on the coagulant activity of bovine Factor V glycoprotein was evaluated. Incubation of native Factor V with galactose oxidase or hydrolysis of asialo-Factor V with beta-galactosidase results in a loss of Factor V activity. The inactivation of Factor V by oxidation of galactose moieties is partially reversible upon reduction of the newly formed aldehyde groups with sodium borohydride. The extent of reversal depends upon the degree of inactivation achieved. Thus, Factor V which retained 30% of the original activity following galactose oxidation returns to 75% of the original coagulant activity upon borohydride reduction; but, after destruction of 85% of the original activity treatment with borohydride returns to about 30%. In the initial stages of the inactivation of Factor V by treatment with galactose oxidase, the loss of Factor V coagulant activity is directly proportional to the moles of galactose oxidized. However, as the reaction progresses, the rate of galactose oxidation exceeds the rate of loss of Factor V activity. Moreover, galactose oxidation continues even after complete inactivation of Factor V. These results suggest that the galactose residues most susceptible to attack by galactose oxidase are those necessary for the activity of this coagulant protein. Only 15 galactose residues/mol of Factor V are susceptible to galactose oxidase prior to removal of sialic acid. In contrast, 37 galactose residues/mol of Factor V are found after acid hydrolysis. These results suggest that Factor V glycoprotein contains more than one type of sialyl-galactose linkages, the C2,3 or C2,4 linkages susceptible to oxidation in the native protein and the C2,6 linkage which is resistant. Native Factor V binds with diarachidonyl lecithin forming an active complex of lower buoyant density, while the Factor V oxidized with galactose oxidase does not. The Factor V-phospholipid complex is protected from inactivation by galactose oxidase. Moreover, lipid binding diminishes the extent of oxidation of galactose residues. Certain galactose groups are essential for coagulant activity probably because they are required for binding to phospholipid, a prerequisite to Factor V action."
https://openalex.org/W1586031216,"Dissociation of mixed trypsin (bovine plus porcine trypsin) complexes with chicken ovoinhibitor was used to investigate the nonequivalence of the two binding sites for trypsin on the inhibitor. Previous work has shown that 1 mol of trypsin dissociates much more rapidly than the 2nd from unmixed trypsin complexes, those containing 2 mol of one kind of trypsin, bovine or porcine, per mol of inhibitor. However, only approximately 0.5 to 0.6 mol of trypsin dissociated in the rapid step from the mixed trypsin complexes, those containing 1 mol each of bovine and porcine trypsin. Rates of the slow dissociation steps for the two types of complexes did not differ appreciably from each other. A general dissociation scheme is proposed, in which each of the 2:1 complexes can lose a trypsin molecule from either in two parrallel first order reactions, producing two different 1:1 complexes, which subsequently dissociate to yield free ovoinhibitor and a second trypsin molecule. In this scheme, both the earlier results with unmixed trypsin complexes and the preponderance (approximately 3:1) of slow dissociation from the mixed trypsin complexes can be rationalized if bovine trypsin is retained preferentially at one of the two trypsin binding sites on chicken ovoinhibitor, and porcine trypsin at the other. That is, one site allows rapid dissociation of porcine trypsin and slow dissociation of bovine trypsin, whereas the other allows rapid dissociation of bovine trypsin and slow dissociation of porcine trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1576850500,"This investigation studied the substrate protein interaction of the alpha, beta elimination reaction in tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1). The results of this work are 2-fold. (a) The presence of multiple enzyme sites was found to be related to the observed kinetic patterns of inhibition. Indole analogues caused competitive inhibition in the tryptophanase reaction and noncompetitive inhibition in the dehydratase reaction. Inhibition patterns of alanine for these activities were reserved. (b) Under some conditions, compounds which bind presumably at the indole site modified the spectral and fluorescent characteristics of the enzyme. The addition of anthranilate to the enzyme resulted in a broad absorption band around 350 nm. This absorption band was distinct from that formed by alanine addition. Based on absorption data, both of these compounds could be bound simultaneously. The optical activity of tryptophanase was reported for the first time. Indole analogues caused greater conformational alterations in the circular dichroism spectra than 3-carbon analogues. The calculated anisotrophy factors, as well as fluorescent quenching data, suggest a more direct interaction between indole analogues and pyridoxal-P than between 3-carbon compounds that the coenzyme. It is proposed that the indole site is the dominant recognition site. The data are consistent with the three-dimensional aspects of space-filling models of Schiff's bases evaluated in terms of multiple site binding."
https://openalex.org/W1535898016,"The products of the hydrolysis of sucrose and palatinose by the sucrase-isomaltase complex from rabbit small intestine were investigated by persilylation followed by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. If the hydrolysis is carried out in H218O, the heavy oxygen is found exclusively at the Ci of the alpha-glucopyranose formed. The 18O enrichment equals that of the incubation medium. The oxygen exchange between the monosaccharides and water is not accelerated by the sucrase-isomaltase complex. These observations show that the bond split by the sucarse and the isomaltase moiety of the complex is the one between glucosyl-Ci and the glucosyl oxygen. They agree with the mechanism proposed for these carbohydrases in the accompanying paper (Cogoli, A., and Semenza, G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7802-7809) involving the formation of an oxocarbonium ion."
