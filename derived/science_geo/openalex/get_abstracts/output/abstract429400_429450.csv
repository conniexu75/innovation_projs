https://openalex.org/W2134471382,"Despite recent insights into melanoma genetics, systematic surveys for driver mutations are challenged by an abundance of passenger mutations caused by carcinogenic UV light exposure. We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which—RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19—harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy. Finally, the spectrum of driver mutations provided unequivocal genomic evidence for a direct mutagenic role of UV light in melanoma pathogenesis.

Landscape of driver mutations by exon sequencing of 121 melanoma tumor/normal pairs Method for detecting genes with driver mutations in high-mutation-rate setting PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2 are significantly mutated melanoma genes Signature spectrum of UV mutagenesis accounts for 46% of driver mutations found In recent years, much has been learned about the molecular basis of melanoma genesis, progression, and response to therapy. BRAF V600 mutations (present in 50% of melanomas) predict clinical efficacy of RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib; activating KIT aberrations may predict response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib, and some NRAS mutant tumors may exhibit sensitivity to MEK inhibition (reviewed in Flaherty et al., 2012Flaherty K.T.

Other melanoma gene mutations that offer therapeutic insights include CDNK2A deletions, MITF amplification/alteration resulting in dysregulation of “druggable” antiapoptotic proteins, and PTEN disruption leading to PI3 kinase/AKT activation (reviewed in Chin et al., 2006Chin L.

Genet. 2011; 43: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and the lack of identified driver mutations in the subtype without NRAS or BRAF mutation suggest that genetic understanding of this malignancy remains incomplete. Although the potential of comprehensive genome sequencing for melanoma gene discovery is recognized, there is also increasing appreciation for the confounding impact of high mutational load due to UV mutagenesis. In particular, cutaneous melanomas exhibit markedly elevated base mutation rates compared to nearly all other solid tumors (Berger et al., 2012Berger M.F. Hodis E. Heffernan T.P. Deribe Y.L. Lawrence M.S. Protopopov A. Ivanova E. Watson I.R. Nickerson E.

Bignell G.R. et al.A comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a human cancer genome.Nature. 2010; 463: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), which is almost entirely attributable to increased abundance of the cytidine to thymidine (C > T) transitions characteristic of a UV-light-induced mutational signature. Highly elevated somatic mutation rates that vary across genomic loci may limit the ability of statistical approaches that assume uniformity of the basal mutation rate to distinguish genes harboring “driver” mutations (i.e., mutations that confer or at some point conferred a fitness advantage to the tumor cell) from those with “passenger” mutations (i.e., mutations that never conferred a fitness advantage). Although methods to account for this mutation rate heterogeneity are an active area of research (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S. Keats J.J. Cibulskis K. Sougnez C. Schinzel A.C.

USA. 2012; 109: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), rigorous approaches to address this challenge in melanoma have been lacking. A related question pertains to the tumorigenic effects of UV-induced DNA damage at the nucleotide level. Epidemiological and experimental data have established a causal role for intense UV exposure during development (e.g., blistering sunburns early in life) in melanoma genesis (reviewed in Garibyan and Fisher, 2010Garibyan L. Fisher D.E. How sunlight causes melanoma.Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2010; 12: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Several model systems have also linked UV-dependent tumorigenic effects to modulation of signaling pathways (e.g., enhanced gamma interferon secretion [Zaidi et al., 2011Zaidi M.R. Davis S. Noonan F.P. Graff-Cherry C. Hawley T.S. Walker R.L. Feigenbaum L. Fuchs E. Lyakh L. Young H.A. et al.Interferon-γ links ultraviolet radiation to melanomagenesis in mice.Nature. 2011; 469: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar] and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway [Dérijard et al., 1994Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. JNK1: a protein kinase stimulated by UV light and Ha-Ras that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain.Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar]), thus supporting a nonmutagenic role in melanoma. Conversely, evidence for a direct UV mutagenic effect in melanoma pathogenesis has been more equivocal. For example, the recurrent base mutations that produce oncogenic NRAS and BRAF mutations are not C > T transitions indicative of UV mutagenesis. Definitive resolution of this question requires demonstration of driver mutations that are directly attributable to UV-induced damage in melanoma. To analyze whole-exome sequencing data from 121 melanoma tumor/normal pairs, we have employed a statistical approach that infers positive selection at each gene locus based on exon/intron mutational distributions, as well as the predicted functional impact of each mutation. This approach enabled both discovery of several new cancer genes with functionally consequential (and plausibly actionable) mutations and identification of numerous driver mutations directly attributable to UV mutagenesis. In the aggregate, these results offer a comprehensive view of the landscape of driver coding mutations in human melanoma. Solution-phase hybrid capture and whole-exome sequencing were performed on paired tumor and normal genomic DNA obtained from 135 patients with melanoma (Tables S1 and S2 available online). 103-fold mean target coverage was achieved, with 87% of bases covered at least 14-fold in the tumor and 8-fold in the normal—the threshold which offers 80% power to detect mutations with an allelic fraction of 0.3 (Carter et al., 2012Carter S.L. Cibulskis K. Helman E. McKenna A. Shen H. Zack T. Laird P.W. Onofrio R.C. Winckler W. Weir B.A. et al.Absolute quantification of somatic DNA alterations in human cancer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). A set of 121 tumor/normal pairs (15 primary tumors, 30 metastatic samples, and 76 short-term cultures derived from metastatic tumor tissue [Table S1]) were qualified for analysis. Altogether, this sample collection comprised 95 melanomas of cutaneous, 5 of acral, 2 of mucosal, 1 of uveal, and 18 of unknown primary origin. Somatic copy-number aberration profiles identified expected melanoma alterations (Curtin et al., 2005Curtin J.A. Fridlyand J. Kageshita T. Patel H.N. Busam K.J. Kutzner H. Cho K.H. Aiba S.

Across all samples, 86,813 coding mutations were detected at a 2:1 ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous events, which is consistent with a high passenger mutation load (Table S4). The median sample mutation rate was 14.4 coding mutations per megabase (lower-upper quartile range: 8.0–24.9). As expected, this rate was higher than that reported for any other tumor type, including lung cancer (Lee et al., 2010Lee W. Jiang Z. Liu J. Haverty P.M. Guan Y. Stinson J. Yue P. Zhang Y. Pant K.P.

Accordingly, 13,905 genes harbored a nonsilent mutation in at least one tumor, 9,782 genes were thus mutated in two or more tumors, 515 genes were mutated in >10% of tumors, and 78 genes were mutated in >20% of tumors (Figure S1B). In genes mutated in >10% and >20% of samples, 85.5% and 85.2% of nonsilent coding mutations resulted from YC > YT transitions, respectively, suggesting that many high-frequency melanoma gene mutations may derive from UV-associated passenger events. We next sought to identify genes showing statistical evidence for positive selection for nonsilent mutations, which is a challenging task in the context of melanoma’s high and heterogeneous basal mutation rate. To illustrate the problem introduced by regional heterogeneity in basal mutation rates, we defined significantly mutated genes by using a standard analytical approach that assumes a uniform basal mutation rate across the exome (controlling for trinucleotide context), as published previously (Ding et al., 2008Ding L.

This analysis produced a long list of genes (n = 544) with nonsilent mutation frequencies exceeding the exomic average, thus considered “significantly” mutated (Figure S1C). Many of these genes showed high silent mutation rates (correlation of significance rank with silent mutation rate: R = 0.29, p < 2.2 × 10−16, Pearson’s; Figure S1D), suggesting locally elevated basal mutation rates. Furthermore, numerous genes were found to have minimal expression levels in melanoma based on cross-cohort analysis of published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (correlation of significance rank with expression level: R = −0.08 and p = 4.4 × 10−16) (Berger et al., 2010Berger M.F. Levin J.Z. Vijayendran K. Sivachenko A. Adiconis X. Maguire J. Johnson L.A. Robinson J. Verhaak R.G. Sougnez C. et al.Integrative analysis of the melanoma transcriptome.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which is consistent with published studies showing that genes with lower expression levels tend to harbor increased somatic mutation rates (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S. Keats J.J. Cibulskis K. Sougnez C. Schinzel A.C. Harview C.L. Brunet J.P. Ahmann G.J. Adli M. et al.Initial genome sequencing and analysis of multiple myeloma.Nature. 2011; 471: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar; Pleasance et al., 2010Pleasance E.D. Cheetham R.K. Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Humphray S.J. Greenman C.D. Varela I. Lin M.L. Ordóñez G.R. Bignell G.R. et al.A comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a human cancer genome.Nature. 2010; 463: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). We also observed an anticorrelation between gene expression and mutation rate in our data (R = −0.10 and p = 4.4 × 10−16). Together, these results highlighted the challenge of detecting positive selection in the setting of variable basal mutation rates. Such loci may accumulate frequent somatic mutations unrelated to positive selection but were nonetheless deemed significant by statistical approaches that assume uniform basal mutation rates. Conversely, genes present in loci with low basal mutation rates may accumulate few mutations. Here, evidence of positive selection will only become apparent after accounting for this reduced mutation rate. The high mutational burden linked to UV exposure further exacerbates this problem in melanoma by making heterogeneity in locus-specific mutation rates even more pronounced. To more accurately ascertain positive selection in melanoma genomes, we leveraged sequence data from flanking intronic regions and other untranslated (UTR) DNA segments that are captured alongside exonic targets during hybrid selection to define the local base mutation rate. We reasoned that any DNA sequence situated immediately adjacent to an exon is likely subjected to similar mutagenic and repair processes as the exonic sequence. Indeed, gene-specific intronic and exonic mutation rates correlated in our data set across several orders of magnitude (R = 0.35 and p < 2.2 × 10−16; Figure S1E). However, unlike nonsilent mutations in their exonic counterparts, mutations in intronic and UTR sequences are more likely to exist under neutral selective pressure. Thus, mutation data obtained from these flanking regions should offer a means by which locus-specific mutation rates might be inferred. A gene that contains a high frequency of nonsilent exonic mutations and a low frequency of synonymous or intronic/UTR mutations exhibits presumptive evidence of positive selection during tumor evolution. Such a mutational pattern may signify the presence of bona fide driver mutations in melanoma. On the other hand, a gene with a high frequency of both nonsilent exonic mutations and synonymous, intronic, and/or UTR mutations is less likely to contain mutations that experienced positive selection during tumorigenesis (Figure 1A). Based on these principles, a null model of the distribution of all mutations across the gene (exon, intron, and UTR) may be generated by random permutation of the locations of all observed mutations (Figure 1B). This null model is computed per sample, as the locus basal mutation rate may vary across samples. A permutation test may then be performed to assess the statistical significance of any set-wide observation in the gene compared to the null model generated from all individual sample null models. Employing this framework, we assessed the statistical significance of the set-wide “functional mutation burden”: the number of samples harboring a nonsilent mutation of predicted functional consequence (Adzhubei et al., 2010Adzhubei I.A. Schmidt S. Peshkin L. Ramensky V.E. Gerasimova A. Bork P. Kondrashov A.S. Sunyaev S.R. A method and server for predicting damaging missense mutations.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9354) Google Scholar). Eleven genes were found to harbor a statistically significant functional mutation burden (q ≤ 0.2; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Methodol. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and S1F and Table S5). These included six well-known cancer genes (BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, p16INK4a [transcript of the CDKN2A gene locus], and MAP2K1) and five new candidates (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, and STK19). Manual review and mass spectrometric genotyping of observed mutations at these loci confirmed high nonsynonymous:synonymous mutation ratios and low rates of silent mutations (Figure 1C and Tables S5 and S6). Contrary to the output from the initial significance analysis (described above), an overall bias toward lowly expressed genes was no longer evident (R = −0.04 and p = 6.2 × 10−6). As a control, we performed an analogous assessment of the “synonymous mutation burden,” and no genes were identified as statistically significant by this analysis (Figure 1C and Table S7). Thus, the incorporation of exonic and nonexonic mutational data identified multiple loci that showed evidence of positive selection and hence may contain genes that harbor driver mutations. The five novel candidate genes harboring putative somatic driver mutations (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, and STK19) had not previously been recognized as significantly mutated in melanoma. PPP6C encodes for the catalytic subunit of the heterotrimeric PP6 protein phosphatase complex (Stefansson et al., 2008Stefansson B. Ohama T. Daugherty A.E. Brautigan D.L. Protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunits composed of ankyrin repeat domains.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1442-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Reports have implicated PPP6C as a tumor suppressor due to its role in regulation of cell cycle and mitosis. PP6 negatively regulates levels of the melanoma oncogene CCND1 during G1 phase of the cell cycle (Stefansson and Brautigan, 2007Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Protein phosphatase PP6 N terminal domain restricts G1 to S phase progression in human cancer cells.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is the major T-loop phosphatase for the mitotic kinase, Aurora A (AurA), which is amplified in a number of human cancers (Lens et al., 2010Lens S.M. Voest E.E. Medema R.H. Shared and separate functions of polo-like kinases and aurora kinases in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 825-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar; Zeng et al., 2010Zeng K. Bastos R.N. Barr F.A. Gruneberg U. Protein phosphatase 6 regulates mitotic spindle formation by controlling the T-loop phosphorylation state of Aurora A bound to its activator TPX2.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1315-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the discovery set of 121 tumor/normal pairs, 11 melanomas (9%) harbored nonsynonymous PPP6C mutations, 10 of which were predicted to be homozygous events based on high mutant allele frequencies. 60% of these PPP6C mutations clustered within a 12 amino acid region flanking an arginine at codon 264 (four R264C mutations, two S270L mutations, and one P259S mutation; Figure 2A). When mapped onto the structure of the PP2A catalytic subunit (∼60% sequence homology to PPP6C; Figures 2A and S2A), the PPP6C mutations localized to highly conserved regions. In particular, R264 participates in multiple salt bridge interactions at the interface between the catalytic and regulatory subunits (Cho and Xu, 2007Cho U.S. Xu W. Crystal structure of a protein phosphatase 2A heterotrimeric holoenzyme.Nature. 2007; 445: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The PPP6C R264C mutation was found at a frequency of 3% in an extension set of 63 melanoma samples (Table S8). Homozygous hot spot (defined as same amino acid change in >3% of samples in the discovery set of 121) mutations in R264 and nearby residues may result in altered interactions between the PPP6C catalytic subunit and its regulatory partners. The clustered mutation pattern and relative paucity of nonsense mutations or frameshift indels are characteristic of gain-of-function mutations, suggesting that dysregulation of this protein phosphatase’s function may contribute to melanoma biology.Figure S2Schematic Representation and Structure of Significantly Mutated Genes, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Color-coded sequence alignment of PP2A and PPP6C.(B) Domains and crystallographic model of MAP2K1 with mapped non-silent somatic mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Color-coded sequence alignment of PP2A and PPP6C. (B) Domains and crystallographic model of MAP2K1 with mapped non-silent somatic mutations. Mutations in STK19 (a predicted kinase with unknown function) exhibited a hot spot pattern in melanoma. Six nonsynonymous STK19 mutations were detected in five tumors (4%) in the discovery set (Figure 2B), four of which were located at D89 (D89N) with an immediately adjacent additional mutation (P90L). D89N mutation showed a consistent frequency (5%) in a melanoma extension set of 59 tumors (Table S8). The pattern and significance of its somatic hot spot point mutations are strong genomic evidence in support of STK19 as a cancer gene. In contrast, TACC1 and SNX31 exhibited a distributed pattern of mutational events. SNX31 encodes the poorly characterized protein sorting nexin 31. Mutations tended to occur within the protein and lipid interaction band4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM)-like domain of SNX31 (Figure 2C), with one mutation in the domain occurring in two separate melanoma cases and over 60% of nonsilent mutations occurring in a 48 residue window in this 440 residue protein. SNX31 has been reported to bind active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-loaded H-Ras, but not inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-loaded H-Ras, likely through its FERM-like domain (Ghai et al., 2011Ghai R. Mobli M. Norwood S.J. Bugarcic A. Teasdale R.D. King G.F. Collins B.M. Phox homology band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin-like proteins function as molecular scaffolds that interact with cargo receptors and Ras GTPases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7763-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which suggests a potential role for SNX31 as a Ras effector protein. TACC1, encoding transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 1, has been reported to stimulate the Ras and PI3K pathways and to promote transformation in mice upon overexpression (Cully et al., 2005Cully M. Shiu J. Piekorz R.P. Muller W.J. Done S.J. Mak T.W. Transforming acidic coiled coil 1 promotes transformation and mammary tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TACC1 is mutated in eight melanomas (7%) in the discovery set, with mutations occurring predominately near the C terminus of the protein, in or near the conserved TACC domain (Figure 2D). TACC1 is known to interact with AurA (Conte et al., 2003Conte N. Delaval B. Ginestier C. Ferrand A. Isnardon D. Larroque C. Prigent C. Séraphin B. Jacquemier J. Birnbaum D.

Hernandez-Verdun D. Prigent C. Birnbaum D. Aurora B -TACC1 protein complex in cytokinesis.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4516-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which is notable in the context of PPP6C’s function as an AurA phosphatase (Zeng et al., 2010Zeng K. Bastos R.N. Barr F.A. Gruneberg U. Protein phosphatase 6 regulates mitotic spindle formation by controlling the T-loop phosphorylation state of Aurora A bound to its activator TPX2.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1315-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, 5% of discovery set melanomas harbored nonsilent mutations in RAC1, a RAS-related member of the Rho subfamily of GTPases. RAC1 functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states through large conformation changes near the nucleotide-binding site, localized to the switch I and II regions. Its best-characterized function is regulation of cytoskeleton rearrangement, and thus it plays important roles in cellular adhesion, migration, and invasion (Jaffe and Hall, 2005Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Rho GTPases: biochemistry and biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). Overexpression has been reported in a number of malignancies (Karlsson et al., 2009Karlsson R. Pedersen E.D. Wang Z. Brakebusch C. Rho GTPase function in tumorigenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1796: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). RAC1 mutations in our melanomas exhibited a hot spot pattern, with all six mutations effecting the same nucleotide change (Figure 3A). This c.85C > T transition, resulting in a P29S amino acid change, is the most frequent hot spot mutation after those in BRAF and NRAS (Table S9). Including verification data from two independent extension sets (n = 59 and n = 175), the prevalence of RAC1 P29S hot spot mutation in melanoma was validated to be 3.9% (14/355 patients; Tables S8 and S10). In addition, mutations in homologous residues in RAC2 (P29L) and RHOT1 (P30L) were also found (Figure 3B), highlighting the importance of the P29 residue as a possible codon targeted by hot spot mutations in Rho family GTPases. We also observed a known RAS family-activating mutation (G12D) (reviewed in Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003Malumbres M. Barbacid M. RAS oncogenes: the first 30 years.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) in a gene encoding for another Rho family GTPase member, CDC42 (Figure 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2012753533,"Most mutations in cancer genomes are thought to be acquired after the initiating event, which may cause genomic instability and drive clonal evolution. However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is “captured” as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.

Recurrent chromosomal structural variations (e.g., t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), t(9;21), t(9;11), del5, del7, etc.) are established diagnostic and prognostic markers, suggesting that acquired genetic abnormalities play an essential role in leukemogenesis (Betz and Hess, 2010Betz B.L. Hess J.L. Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis in the 21st century.Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2010; 134: 1427-1433PubMed Google Scholar). However, nearly 50% of AML cases have a normal karyotype (NK), and many of these lack recurrent structural abnormalities, even with high density comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or SNP arrays (Bullinger et al., 2010Bullinger L.

Targeted sequencing efforts have identified several mutations that carry diagnostic and prognostic information, including mutations in FLT3, NPM1, KIT, CEBPA, and TET2 (reviewed in (Bacher et al., 2010Bacher U.

Med. 2009; 361: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Despite these efforts, more than 25% of AML patients carry no mutations in the known leukemia-associated genes (Shen et al., 2011Shen Y. Zhu Y.M. Fan X. Shi J.Y. Wang Q.R. Yan X.J. Gu Z.H. Wang Y.Y.

Furthermore, defining the molecular consequences of recurring mutations (e.g., whether a mutation is an initiating or a cooperating event) has been challenging. PML-RARA is one of the best-characterized leukemia-initiating mutations. This fusion gene results from t(15;17)(q22;21) and is associated exclusively with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, FAB M3 AML) (Allford et al., 1999Allford S. Grimwade D. Langabeer S. Duprez E.

Its expression is diagnostic of this single type of leukemia with unique clinical features (Sanz et al., 2009Sanz M.A. Grimwade D. Tallman M.S. Lowenberg B. Fenaux P. Estey E.H. Naoe T. Lengfelder E.

Its presence predicts a near universal therapeutic response to a targeted agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is abrogated by mutations that inhibit ATRA binding to PML-RARA (Imaizumi et al., 1998Imaizumi M.

Early myeloid expression of PML-RARA results in leukemia with promyelocytic features in multiple mouse models of the disease, although long latency (which can be shortened by radiation, alkylator treatment, or FLT3 ITD coexpression), suggests that PML-RARA requires cooperating events to cause leukemia (Funk et al., 2008Funk R.K.

We chose to compare 12 genomes from patients with FAB M3 AML (where the initiating event is known) to 12 genomes from patients with AML without maturation (FAB M1) with normal cytogenetics, where the initiating event is less clear for most patients. In this and previous studies, we have demonstrated that AML genomes generally contain hundreds of mutations, that the total number of mutations per AML genome is related to the age of the patient, and that nearly all AML cells in the samples contain all of the mutations (although very few of these mutations are recurrent in AML or other malignancies) (Ding et al., 2012Ding L.

We show here that clonally derived hematopoietic cells from normal individuals also accumulate mutations as a function of age. This suggests that most of the mutations present in AML genomes were already present in the hematopoietic cell that was ""transformed"" by the initiating mutation; nearly all of these preexisting mutations are probably benign and irrelevant for pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that M1 and M3 genomes have similar numbers of total mutations and that M1 genomes contain unique mutations (e.g., DNMT3A, NPM1, IDH1, or TET2) that almost never occur in M3 cases. In addition, there are many mutations that are shared between the two subtypes (e.g., FLT3 ITD), suggesting that these mutations can cooperate with a variety of initiating mutations. Because the data are comprehensive for all 24 genomes, it also allows us to estimate the minimum number of recurring mutations that may be responsible for the pathogenesis of AML. We subjected 12 cases of NK M1 AML and 12 cases of t(15;17)-positive M3 AML to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (case descriptions provided in Extended Experimental Procedures, summarized in Table S1 and Figure S1 available online). To identify somatic, AML-associated mutations, we subjected both the bone marrow (leukemic tissue) and skin (normal tissue) to WGS (average haploid coverage 28x, Figure 1A and Table S2); the mutations in the AML1 and AML2 genomes have been previously reported and deposited in dbGaP (Ding et al., 2012Ding L.

Because of the prevalence of false-positive calls in WGS (between 20%–50%, depending on the stringency of type I errors tolerated), we validated all single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs) identified in tiers 1, 2, or 3 (which contain the nonrepetitive portion of the genome (see Mardis et al., 2009Mardis E.R.

All subsequent analysis relies on these validated data and not on the primary genome discovery sequence. An average coverage of 972 reads per somatic variant was obtained at validation. We observed a higher validation frequency in tier 1 than in tier 2 and 3 (mean frequency 0.5 versus 0.35 and 0.29, p < 0.002 and p < 0.0001, respectively; Table S2), which may reflect the lower guanine and cytosine content and increased uniqueness of tier 1. Numbers of mutations and validation frequencies were similar across all tiers in M1 versus M3 genomes (Figures 1C–1E and Table S2). These data yielded a total of 10,563 validated somatic variants for the 24 genomes (average 440/genome) (Tables S2, S3, and S4). Indels were less frequent than SNVs in M1 and M3 AML (M1: average 19.1 per genome, range 4–45; M3: average 20.3 per genome, range 4–56), and occurred proportionally less often in tier 1 (average 1.4 per genome, range 0–4). Of these total somatic mutations, 319 occurred in the coding regions of 287 unique genes; an average of 10 somatic mutations had translational consequences in each genome (Table S3). A fusion event between PML and RARA was identified in all 12 M3 AML cases (Table S5). Only 43 additional structural variants (translocations, insertions, deletions, and inversions) were identified (median 2 per genome, range 0–8, Table S5). The t(15;17) breakpoints occurred in exon 5 and introns 3 and 5 of PML and within RARA intron 2 in all cases, as expected; two cases were associated with large deletions that are predicted to result in PML-RARA expression without reciprocal RARA-PML expression (Figure S2). None of the other structural variations found by WGS were identified with metaphase cytogenetics; most are predicted to be cryptic when examined by routine cytogenetics. The others may exist in minor leukemic subclones that were not otherwise detected, or in cells that did not expand during preparation for cytogenetic studies.Figure 1Coverage and Number of Validated SNVs by Tier per GenomeShow full caption(A) Gigabase pairs of sequence obtained for each genome assessed by whole-genome sequencing.(B) Mean number of reads obtained for each variant assessed per genome during validation.(C and D) Number of tier 1, 2, 3, and total variants validated in each sample.(E) Total number of validated SNVs by tier in M1 AML (red) versus M3 AML (blue) cases.(F) Total number of validated SNVs per genome in nonredundant regions (tier 1, 2, and 3) versus age of patient; M1 AML (red), M3 AML (blue).

The total number of validated SNVs per genome increased in proportion to patient age, in both M1 and M3 AML genomes (Figure 1F). We also observed that somatic AML mutations were widely distributed throughout the genome; in all 24 cases, the number of SNVs in each tier was directly proportional to the amount of the genome present in that tier (SNVs per Mb: tier 1: 0.264 ± 0.024; tier 2: 0.283 ± 0.026; tier 3: 0.283 ± 0.024, p < 0.91) (Figure 2A) and these mutations were distributed across all chromosomes (Figure 2B). However, with this sample size, modestly increased mutational frequency within small regions of the genome cannot be excluded (Figures 2C and 2D). The mutational spectrum was dominated by C>T/A>G transitions, and was similar for M1 and M3 cases (Figure 2E). Tier 1 mutations favored C>T/A>G transitions, probably due to an increased proportion of methylated cytosine nucleotides in tier 1, which is associated with increased susceptibility to deamination and subsequent transition mutations (Figure 2F) (Pfeifer, 2006Pfeifer G.P. Mutagenesis at methylated CpG sequences.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 301: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For this study, skin samples were obtained when the patients presented with leukemia. As expected, we observed low-level contamination of leukemic variants in the skin samples, which was proportional to the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count at the time of skin collection (Figures S3A–S3C). M3 AML cases usually had very low leukemia contamination in the skin (often completely absent), although we observed two outlier cases.

Clusters of mutations with similar variant allele frequencies within individual cases provide evidence of a single founding clone in both M1 and M3 samples (Ding et al., 2012Ding L. Ley T.J. Larson D.E. Miller C.A. Koboldt D.C. Welch J.S. Ritchey J.K. Young M.A. Lamprecht T. McLellan M.D. et al.Clonal evolution in relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia revealed by whole-genome sequencing.Nature. 2012; 481: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Using kernel density analysis, we identified one to four clusters of mutations (representing the founding clone in all cases, with or without additional subclones derived from the founding clone) in each genome (Figures 3A–3D); the clusters were independent of the number of read counts for each SNV. In cases with subclones, the number of variants specific to each subclone was relatively small (an average of 40.4 SNVs per subclone [range 6–110]); SNVs in subclones represented only 14% of the total SNVs per genome (range 2%–33%). Because each genome’s founding clone contains heterozygous SNVs that appear to be present in nearly all of the cells in the sample, subclones must also contain all of the SNVs in the founding clone. For example, the average variant frequency of heterozygous SNVs in the founding clone of AML13 (Figure 3D) is 44%, suggesting that 88% of the cells in the sample contain these heterozygous mutations; therefore, the subclones with average variant allele frequencies of 12%, 22%, and 32% must also contain the mutations found in the founding clone. Genomes with two or more mutation clusters displayed a similar standard deviation of variant frequencies within separate clusters (Figure 3E). However, genomes with a single cluster tended to have an increased standard deviation of the variant frequency within that cluster, suggesting that overlapping subclones may exist in these samples that are below this level of resolution. There was a trend toward more subclones in M3 cases (M1 average, 1.5 clones/genome; M3 average, 2.2 clones/genome; p = 0.04) (Figure 3F). Several pieces of data sugges"

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1998983498,"RIP1 and RIP3 kinases are central players in TNF-induced programmed necrosis. Here, we report that the RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) of RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the assembly of heterodimeric filamentous structures. The fibrils exhibit classical characteristics of β-amyloids, as shown by Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) binding, circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR. Structured amyloid cores are mapped in RIP1 and RIP3 that are flanked by regions of mobility. The endogenous RIP1/RIP3 complex isolated from necrotic cells binds ThT, is ultrastable, and has a fibrillar core structure, whereas necrosis is partially inhibited by ThT, CR, and another amyloid dye, HBX. Mutations in the RHIMs of RIP1 and RIP3 that are defective in the interaction compromise cluster formation, kinase activation, and programmed necrosis in vivo. The current study provides insight into the structural changes that occur when RIP kinases are triggered to execute different signaling outcomes and expands the realm of amyloids to complex formation and signaling."

A microfluidic system was used for highly parallel sample processing and to minimize nonspecific amplification. High-density genotyping results from 91 single cells were used to create a personal recombination map, which was consistent with population-wide data at low resolution but revealed significant differences from pedigree data at higher resolution. We used the data to test for meiotic drive and found evidence for gene conversion.

This methodological approach allowed us to separate the synthesis of nascent transcripts from transcript processing and the accumulation of mature mRNAs. In addition to documenting the subcellular locations of coding and noncoding transcripts, the results provide a high-resolution view of the relationship between defined promoter and chromatin properties and the temporal regulation of diverse classes of coexpressed genes.

Their response involves widespread changes in gene expression that are often tailored to the stimulus. Some inducible genes encode proteins that help polarize the subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses, whereas others encode effector molecules that protect the host from the insult. Microbial pathogens have acquired mechanisms to subvert immune responses, and deregulated inflammation has been associated with numerous diseases ranging from inflammatory autoimmune disorders to atherosclerosis and cancer. A major challenge has been to elucidate the molecular circuitry that regulates an inflammatory gene program, with the ultimate aim of selectively altering the response to diminish disease pathology while maintaining antimicrobial immunity (Medzhitov and Horng, 2009Medzhitov R. Horng T. Transcriptional control of the inflammatory response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar; Smale, 2010Smale S.T. Selective transcription in response to an inflammatory stimulus.Cell. 2010; 140: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To understand the transcriptional response to an inflammatory stimulus, several studies have focused on the regulatory properties of primary response genes, which are rapidly induced in the absence of new protein synthesis (reviewed in Fowler et al., 2011Fowler T. Sen R. Roy A.L. Regulation of primary response genes.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 348-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Primary response genes induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) usually contain CpG island promoters. Such genes are associated with RNA polymerase II in unstimulated cells and possess histone tail modifications commonly found at the promoters of actively transcribed genes (Hargreaves et al., 2009Hargreaves D.C.

These genes can be activated by inducible transcription factors in the absence of SWI/SNF-dependent nucleosome remodeling (Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T.

A unifying model for the selective regulation of inducible transcription by CpG islands and nucleosome remodeling.Cell. 2009; 138: 114-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Rapid transcriptional induction may also be facilitated by the active release of polymerase molecules that have initiated transcription in unstimulated cells but are paused near the transcription start site (TSS) (Nechaev and Adelman, 2011Nechaev S. Adelman K. Pol II waiting in the starting gates: regulating the transition from transcription initiation into productive elongation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1809: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Paused polymerase molecules can be released by signal-dependent recruitment of P-TEFb, phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II on serine 2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD), and release of the NELF repressor. Although some genes are regulated by pausing in close proximity to the TSS, others are reported to be efficiently transcribed into precursor transcripts, with inducible P-TEFb recruitment regulating the efficiency of transcript processing (Adelman et al., 2009Adelman K. Kennedy M.A. Nechaev S. Gilchrist D.A. Muse G.W. Chinenov Y. Rogatsky I. Immediate mediators of the inflammatory response are poised for gene activation through RNA polymerase II stalling.Proc. Natl.

In contrast to the features described above, many secondary response genes and some primary response genes require SWI/SNF-dependent nucleosome remodeling for their induction (Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2006Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T.

Sen R. Roy A.L. Regulation of primary response genes.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 348-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These genes often lack CpG islands and are inaccessible to nucleases in unstimulated cells. Prior to stimulation, they also lack histone modifications characteristic of active genes. The remodeling requirement may facilitate highly selective regulation by imposing an additional barrier to activation. A major long-term goal is to elucidate the precise network of events that coordinates the complex, temporally ordered gene expression cascade induced by an inflammatory stimulus. Progress toward this goal has been made primarily through the use of microarrays to examine temporal changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, followed by efforts to connect transcription factors and signaling pathways to clusters of coregulated genes (Ramsey et al., 2008Ramsey S.A.

However, temporal changes in mRNA levels can diverge considerably from temporal changes in transcription. For example, a lag period can follow the maximal activation of transcription before the peak mRNA level is reached (Hao and Baltimore, 2009Hao S. Baltimore D. The stability of mRNA influences the temporal order of the induction of genes encoding inflammatory molecules.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar; Rabani et al., 2011Rabani M. Levin J.Z. Fan L. Adiconis X. Raychowdhury R. Garber M. Gnirke A. Nusbaum C. Hacohen N.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Microarrays also tend to underestimate the magnitudes of changes in mRNA levels, further limiting efforts to examine transcriptional cascades (Marioni et al., 2008Marioni J.C. Mason C.E. Mane S.M. Stephens M. Gilad Y. RNA-seq: an assessment of technical reproducibility and comparison with gene expression arrays.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as an improved method for examining transcriptomes. Although this method is usually used to study mRNAs, three strategies have been described for the analysis of nascent transcripts, thereby allowing dynamic changes in transcription to be distinguished from changes in mRNA levels. First, the genome-wide nuclear run-on (GRO-seq) involves the incubation of nuclei with labeled nucleoside triphosphates, followed by high-throughput sequencing of complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from the labeled nascent transcripts (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar; Hah et al., 2011Hah N.

A rapid, extensive, and transient transcriptional response to estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells.Cell. 2011; 145: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In a second method, native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), ternary complexes containing RNA polymerase, the DNA template, and the nascent transcript are isolated by crosslinking, chromatin fragmentation, and polymerase immunoprecipitation, followed by high-throughput sequencing of cDNAs (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Finally, metabolic labeling has been used to monitor the fate of nascent transcripts (Friedel and Dölken, 2009Friedel C.C. Dölken L. Metabolic tagging and purification of nascent RNA: implications for transcriptomics.Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, and references therein). This method was recently employed to characterize clusters of coexpressed genes in mouse dendritic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Rabani et al., 2011Rabani M. Levin J.Z. Fan L. Adiconis X. Raychowdhury R. Garber M. Gnirke A. Nusbaum C. Hacohen N. Friedman N. et al.Metabolic labeling of RNA uncovers principles of RNA production and degradation dynamics in mammalian cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Here, we describe RNA-seq analysis of biochemically fractionated chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic, and cytoplasmic transcripts from unstimulated and stimulated macrophages. Like the three methods described above, this method provides basic information about nascent transcription. However, the results have provided several additional insights of broad relevance concerning the dynamic regulation of RNA processing and transport and have allowed us to define, at high resolution, the properties of specific classes of coexpressed genes activated by an inflammatory stimulus. Inflammatory gene transcription was studied in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with lipid A (the active component of LPS) for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. We fractionated cells (Wuarin and Schibler, 1994Wuarin J. Schibler U. Physical isolation of nascent RNA chains transcribed by RNA polymerase II: evidence for cotranscriptional splicing.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7219-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to isolate chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic, and cytoplasmic transcripts as done previously to analyze nascent transcripts from individual genes (Dye et al., 2006Dye M.J.

Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons.RNA. 2009; 15: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In pilot studies, the purity of the chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm was assessed by western blot analysis of β-tubulin, SNRP70, and histone H3, respectively (Figure S1A available online). To facilitate the analysis of nascent transcripts, an oligo-deoxythymine (dT) purification step was omitted during the isolation of RNA from the three fractions. However, in separate experiments, an oligo dT resin was used to isolate polyadenylated RNA from whole-cell macrophage lysates. Random primed, strand-specific cDNA libraries prepared from the RNA populations were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Inspection of the aligned reads for individual genes provided strong support for the notion that the transcripts in the chromatin samples were newly transcribed. First, as illustrated for the inducible Nfkb1 gene (Figure 1A), the reads from the chromatin samples were broadly distributed across both the exons and introns of many genes, whereas in nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic samples, exon reads were strongly enriched. Reads were not observed at genomic regions flanking transcription units, demonstrating that the reads were derived from RNA rather than from DNA. Reads from oligo-dT-selected RNA showed a similar pattern of exon enrichment (Figure S1B). Also, transcript levels for inducible genes increased at earlier time points in the chromatin samples than in the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic samples (see Figure 1B for Nfkb1) or the mRNA (Figure S1C). This finding suggests that an analysis of chromatin transcripts provides a more accurate view of the kinetics of transcriptional induction than is provided by mRNA analyses. We divided 10,020 expressed RefSeq genes (reads per kilobase per millions of mapped reads (RPKM) >1 in at least one of the three fractions) into 12 clusters based on their transcript profiles in the three subcellular fractions and five time points (Figure 2A). Most lipid-A-induced genes were found in clusters 1–3 (Figures 2A and 2B). Transcriptional downregulation was detected in clusters 4–6 (Figures 2A and 2B). Surprisingly, far more genes were downregulated than upregulated (Figure 2C). However, the average magnitude of downregulation in two clusters (clusters 4 and 6) was only slightly >2-fold in the chromatin sample (Figure 2B). It is noteworthy that reduced transcript levels were observed in the chromatin samples at earlier time points than in the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic samples (Figures 2A and 2C). This difference is presumably due to the time required for pre-existing mRNAs to decay. The remaining clusters showed little change in transcript levels during the time course (Figures 2A and 2B, clusters 7–12). The cluster analysis also reveals extensive variability in the distribution of transcripts between the chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm (Figure 2A). Although we cannot accurately calculate the percentage of transcripts for a gene in each of the three fractions, relative differences are apparent. Cluster 7, for example, contains abundant transcripts in the chromatin, with much lower transcript levels in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm relative to the other clusters. This cluster is dominated by annotated and unannotated noncoding transcripts and micro RNA (miRNA) precursors. (The analysis excluded transcripts shorter than 400 nucleotides and therefore excluded mature miRNAs and many miRNA precursors.) Some noncoding RNAs, such as Xist, are highly enriched in the chromatin because they function at this location (Figure S2). Examples of other noncoding RNAs in cluster 7 are Neat1 and Malat1/Neat2 (Figure S2). Further mining of the data sets may provide insights into the subcellular locations at which many noncoding RNAs function. Cluster 7 also includes transcripts from constitutive protein-coding genes that may be highly unstable and therefore present at low levels in the cytoplasm (e.g., Leng8 in Figure S2). Cluster 11, by contrast, contains abundant cytoplasmic transcripts, with fewer transcripts in the chromatin and nucleoplasm. This cluster includes genes that are likely to encode highly stable mRNAs, such as Actb (β-actin) and Tuba (α-tubulin). Clusters 8 and 9 contain genes whose transcripts are more abundant in the nucleoplasmic fraction than in the chromatin or cytoplasm. Many genes in these clusters encode proteins that would be expected to be translated by ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; see Chen et al., 2011Chen Q. Jagannathan S. Reid D.W. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. Hierarchical regulation of mRNA partitioning between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2646-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, their enrichment in this fraction is likely due to the copurification of ER-associated transcripts with the nuclear envelope. Further analysis of individual transcripts or clusters of transcripts enriched in different subcellular fractions is likely to provide important insights into the role of RNA stability in gene regulation at a genome-wide scale, the functions of specific noncoding RNAs, and possibly other facets of RNA dynamics. For this analysis, we focused on lipid-A-induced genes. An examination of reads for ∼26,000 RefSeq genes (normalized as RPKM) revealed changes in chromatin-associated transcript abundance through the time course (Figure S3A). By examining genes with a read coverage of at least 1 RPKM at one of the stimulated time points, we found 560 genes that were induced in the chromatin samples at least 5-fold during the 2 hr stimulation period. 246 genes were induced between 5- and 10-fold, 247 between 10- and 100-fold, and 67 more than 100-fold (Figure S3B). Peak chromatin transcript values were reached at the 15 min time point for only 16 genes, with 145, 94, and 304 genes reaching their highest levels at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively (Figure S3C). We also determined the time point at which each gene exhibited its maximum fold increase, or “ramp,” relative to the preceding time point. Although only 16 genes exhibited their peak chromatin transcript level at the 15 min time point, 154 genes showed maximum ramp values within 15 min of stimulation (Figure S3C). To examine the reproducibility of the data sets, Pearson correlation values (R values) were determined for chromatin-associated transcripts from two independent experiments performed several months apart with macrophages from different mice (Figure S4). R values derived from a comparison of RPKMs for inducible genes equaled or exceeded 0.94 at each time point (Figure S4A). Hierarchical clustering showed that each time point correlated more closely with the corresponding time point from the second experiment than with any of the other time points (Figure S4B). Similar results were obtained when all expressed genes or all RefSeq genes were examined rather than all induced genes (Figures S4C–S4F). The 560 lipid-A-induced genes were clustered into six classes, A–F, on the basis of the temporal profiles of their chromatin-associated transcripts (Figures 3A and 3B ). We further subdivided class A into classes A1 and A2 to highlight, in class A1, the 16 genes that exhibited peak chromatin transcript levels at the 15 min time point in the two experiments. Interestingly, 10 of these 16 genes encode proteins that directly regulate gene expression: transcription factors (Fos, FosB, Jun, Atf3, Egr1, Egr3, and Nr4a1 [NUR77]), transcriptional coregulators (Nfkbid [IκBNS] and Btg2), and an RNA-binding protein (Zfp36 [TTP]). The other six participate in diverse functions (Ppp1r15a, Plk3, Pmaip1, Ier2, Gdf15, and Fabp4). Class A2 is largely composed of transiently induced genes that exhibit maximal chromatin transcripts 30 min poststimulation. Most class B genes peak at 60 min, with substantial decreases by 120 min. Class C genes, like class A2 genes, are induced early and usually peak at the 30 min time point, but unlike the transient induction of class A2 genes, transcription of class C genes is sustained. Classes D, E, and F exhibit increasingly later induction of chromatin-associated transcripts (Figure 3B). To monitor the progression of transcripts from the chromatin to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, we visualized the profiles of individual genes and analyzed complete coexpression classes. Nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic transcripts (and mRNAs) largely followed the same temporal profile as the chromatin transcripts but with a clearly detectable delay (Figures 3B and S5). These data are consistent with those obtained by metabolic labeling (Rabani et al., 2011Rabani M. Levin J.Z. Fan L. Adiconis X. Raychowdhury R. Garber M. Gnirke A. Nusbaum C. Hacohen N. Friedman N. et al.Metabolic labeling of RNA uncovers principles of RNA production and degradation dynamics in mammalian cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription appears to be a dominant regulator of mRNA expression kinetics. We have been unable to identify genes that exhibit large changes in mRNA levels without corresponding changes in nascent transcripts, which would be suggestive of regulation primarily at the level of mRNA stability. Our ability to define gene classes from the temporal profiles of nascent transcripts allowed us to examine promoter and chromatin properties within each class. Previous studies suggested that rapidly induced genes frequently contain CpG island promoters, whereas secondary response genes and primary response genes induced with delayed kinetics usually contain low CpG (LCG) promoters (Hargreaves et al., 2009Hargreaves D.C.

Consistent with these studies, 88%, 84%, and 71% of genes in classes A1, A2, and B contain CpG island promoters (Figures 4A and 4B ). Interestingly, however, 36%–58% of genes in the remaining classes also contain CpG island promoters, which is higher than predicted from the previous studies of limited numbers of genes. It is noteworthy that a high prevalence of CpG island promoters correlated more closely with transient induction than with rapid induction. That is, classes A1, A2, and B contain a much higher percentage of CpG island promoters than class C (Figure 4B); class C is induced as rapidly as class A2 and more rapidly than class B, but class C transcription is sustained, which is in contrast to the transient induction of classes A1, A2, and B. In unstimulated cells, inducible CpG island promoters often assemble into chromatin with features commonly associated with transcriptionally active genes, and it has been suggested that this property facilitates rapid transcriptional induction (Hargreaves et al., 2009Hargreaves D.C.

Consistent with this hypothesis, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), a mark found at the promoters of active genes, was generally higher at CpG island promoters than at LCG promoters in unstimulated cells (Figures 4A and 4C; chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from De Santa et al., 2009De Santa F.

It is noteworthy, however, that this active chromatin mark was enriched at CpG island promoters in all classes. Similarly, RNA polymerase II association was more prevalent in unstimulated cells at CpG island promoters than at LCG promoters in all of the classes (Figures 4A and 4C). An examination of the repressive histone H3K27me3 modification revealed association with a small fraction of promoters within all classes (Figure 4A). Interestingly, this repressive mark appears to be most prevalent in CpG island promoters that exhibit relatively low levels of the H3K4me3 mark. Together, these results confirm that rapidly induced genes frequently contain CpG island promoters, high levels of H3K4me3, and RNA polymerase II association in unstimulated cells. However, these features were also found in many genes with delayed induction kinetics. A more detailed examination of the distinct regulatory capabilities conferred by CpG island and LCG promoters is presented below. It has been proposed that rapidly induced genes with active chromatin features in unstimulated cells are transcribed at relatively high levels prior to cell stimulation but that the elevated transcription does not lead to elevated mRNA levels because transcription elongation and RNA processing are inefficient prior to stimulation (Hargreaves et al., 2009Hargreaves D.C.

The RNA-seq analysis of chromatin-associated transcripts allowed us to test this hypothesis. An examination of RPKMs revealed that basal nascent transcript levels span more than three orders of magnitude within most classes (Figure 5A). The median basal RPKMs were similar for classes A2–F, whereas the median RPKM for the 16 genes in class A1 was moderately higher. The significance of this higher median value is difficult to determine due to the small size of class A1. Little difference was observed between genes containing CpG island promoters and LCG promoters (Figure 5A).

However, the functional significance of the vast majority of these modifications remains unknown. To address this problem, we compiled nearly 200,000 phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites from 11 eukaryotic species, including 2,500 newly identified ubiquitylation sites for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed methods to prioritize the functional relevance of these PTMs by predicting those that likely participate in cross-regulatory events, regulate domain activity, or mediate protein-protein interactions. PTM conservation within domain families identifies regulatory ""hot spots"" that overlap with functionally important regions, a concept that we experimentally validated on the HSP70 domain family. Finally, our analysis of the evolution of PTM regulation highlights potential routes for neutral drift in regulatory interactions and suggests that only a fraction of modification sites are likely to have a significant biological role."
https://openalex.org/W2128561457,"Background Autophagy is a basic cellular homeostatic process important to cell fate decisions under conditions of stress. Dysregulation of autophagy impacts numerous human diseases including cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. This study investigates the role of autophagy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods Human lung tissues from patients with IPF were analyzed for autophagy markers and modulating proteins using western blotting, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. To study the effects of TGF-β1 on autophagy, human lung fibroblasts were monitored by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting. In vivo experiments were done using the bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model. Results Lung tissues from IPF patients demonstrate evidence of decreased autophagic activity as assessed by LC3, p62 protein expression and immunofluorescence, and numbers of autophagosomes. TGF-β1 inhibits autophagy in fibroblasts in vitro at least in part via activation of mTORC1; expression of TIGAR is also increased in response to TGF-β1. In the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, rapamycin treatment is antifibrotic, and rapamycin also decreases expression of á-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin by fibroblasts in vitro. Inhibition of key regulators of autophagy, LC3 and beclin-1, leads to the opposite effect on fibroblast expression of á-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin. Conclusion Autophagy is not induced in pulmonary fibrosis despite activation of pathways known to promote autophagy. Impairment of autophagy by TGF-β1 may represent a mechanism for the promotion of fibrogenesis in IPF."

However, little is known about molecular interactions within the complex and the trajectory of tropomyosin movement between its ""open"" and ""closed"" positions on the actin filament. Here, we report the 8 Å resolution structure of the rigor (nucleotide-free) actin-tropomyosin-myosin complex determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The pseudoatomic model of the complex, obtained from fitting crystal structures into the map, defines the large interface involving two adjacent actin monomers and one tropomyosin pseudorepeat per myosin contact. Severe forms of hereditary myopathies are linked to mutations that critically perturb this interface. Myosin binding results in a 23 Å shift of tropomyosin along actin. Complex domain motions occur in myosin, but not in actin. Based on our results, we propose a structural model for the tropomyosin-dependent modulation of myosin binding to actin."

Here, we show Flamingo (Fmi) and Frizzled (Fz) 8, members of noncanonical Wnt signaling, both express in and functionally maintain quiescent long-term HSCs. Fmi regulates Fz8 distribution at the interface between HSCs and N-cadherin(+) osteoblasts (N-cad(+)OBs that enrich osteoprogenitors) in the niche. We further found that N-cad(+)OBs predominantly express noncanonical Wnt ligands and inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling under homeostasis. Under stress, noncanonical Wnt signaling is attenuated and canonical Wnt signaling is enhanced in activation of HSCs. Mechanistically, noncanonical Wnt signaling mediated by Fz8 suppresses the Ca(2+)-NFAT- IFNγ pathway, directly or indirectly through the CDC42-CK1α complex and also antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that noncanonical Wnt signaling maintains quiescent long-term HSCs through Fmi and Fz8 interaction in the niche."
https://openalex.org/W2053655346,"NusG homologs regulate transcription and coupled processes in all living organisms. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) two-domain paralogs NusG and RfaH have conformationally identical N-terminal domains (NTDs) but dramatically different carboxy-terminal domains (CTDs), a β barrel in NusG and an α hairpin in RfaH. Both NTDs interact with elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) to reduce pausing. In NusG, NTD and CTD are completely independent, and NusG-CTD interacts with termination factor Rho or ribosomal protein S10. In contrast, RfaH-CTD makes extensive contacts with RfaH-NTD to mask an RNAP-binding site therein. Upon RfaH interaction with its DNA target, the operon polarity suppressor (ops) DNA, RfaH-CTD is released, allowing RfaH-NTD to bind to RNAP. Here, we show that the released RfaH-CTD completely refolds from an all-α to an all-β conformation identical to that of NusG-CTD. As a consequence, RfaH-CTD binding to S10 is enabled and translation of RfaH-controlled operons is strongly potentiated. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2134405228,"Coastal salt marshes are highly sensitive wetland ecosystems that can sustain long-term impacts from anthropogenic events such as oil spills. In this study, we examined the microbial communities of a Gulf of Mexico coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of petroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Total hydrocarbon concentrations in salt marsh sediments were highest in June and July 2010 and decreased in September 2010. Coupled PhyloChip and GeoChip microarray analyses demonstrated that the microbial community structure and function of the extant salt marsh hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations changed significantly during the study. The relative richness and abundance of phyla containing previously described hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria) increased in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments and then decreased once hydrocarbons were below detection. Firmicutes, however, continued to increase in relative richness and abundance after hydrocarbon concentrations were below detection. Functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation were enriched in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments then declined significantly (p<0.05) once hydrocarbon concentrations decreased. A greater decrease in hydrocarbon concentrations among marsh grass sediments compared to inlet sediments (lacking marsh grass) suggests that the marsh rhizosphere microbial communities could also be contributing to hydrocarbon degradation. The results of this study provide a comprehensive view of microbial community structural and functional dynamics within perturbed salt marsh ecosystems."

Here we describe the identification of 49 soybean transcription factors by microarray analysis as being inducible by salinity stress. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR-based expression assay confirmed the salinity stress inducibility of 45 of these 49 transcription factors, and showed that ten of them were up-regulated when seedlings were exposed to the demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine. Salinity stress was shown to affect the methylation status of four of these ten transcription factors (one MYB, one b-ZIP and two AP2/DREB family members) using a combination of bisulfite sequencing and DNA methylation-sensitive DNA gel blot analysis. ChIP analysis indicated that the activation of three of the four DNA methylated transcription factors was correlated with an increased level of histone H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation, and/or a reduced level of H3K9 demethylation in various parts of the promoter or coding regions. Our results suggest a critical role for some transcription factors' activation/repression by DNA methylation and/or histone modifications in soybean tolerance to salinity stress."
https://openalex.org/W2031482957,"The tracking of small avian migrants has only recently become possible by the use of small light-level geolocators, allowing the reconstruction of whole migration routes, as well as timing and speed of migration and identification of wintering areas. Such information is crucial for evaluating theories about migration strategies and pinpointing critical areas for migrants of potential conservation value. Here we report data about migration in the common swift, a highly aerial and long-distance migrating species for which only limited information based on ringing recoveries about migration routes and wintering areas is available. Six individuals were successfully tracked throughout a complete migration cycle from Sweden to Africa and back. The autumn migration followed a similar route in all individuals, with an initial southward movement through Europe followed by a more southwest-bound course through Western Sahara to Sub-Saharan stopovers, before a south-eastward approach to the final wintering areas in the Congo basin. After approximately six months at wintering sites, which shifted in three of the individuals, spring migration commenced in late April towards a restricted stopover area in West Africa in all but one individual that migrated directly towards north from the wintering area. The first part of spring migration involved a crossing of the Gulf of Guinea in those individuals that visited West Africa. Spring migration was generally wind assisted within Africa, while through Europe variable or head winds were encountered. The average detour at about 50% could be explained by the existence of key feeding sites and wind patterns. The common swift adopts a mixed fly-and-forage strategy, facilitated by its favourable aerodynamic design allowing for efficient use of fuel. This strategy allowed swifts to reach average migration speeds well above 300 km/day in spring, which is higher than possible for similar sized passerines. This study demonstrates that new technology may drastically change our views about migration routes and strategies in small birds, as well as showing the unexpected use of very limited geographical areas during migration that may have important consequences for conservation strategies for migrants."

Its efficacy in reducing cholesterol and blood pressure is uncertain. Methods We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of a Polypill among individuals aged 50+ without a history of cardiovascular disease and compared the reductions with those predicted from published estimates of the effects of the individual drugs. Participants took the Polypill (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 40 mg) each evening for 12 weeks and a placebo each evening for 12 weeks in random sequence. The mean within-person differences in blood pressure and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at the end of each 12 week period were determined. Results 84 out of 86 participants completed both treatment periods. The mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 17.9 mmHg (95% CI, 15.7–20.1) on the Polypill, diastolic blood pressure by 9.8 mmHg (8.1–11.5), and LDL cholesterol by 1.4 mmol/L (1.2–1.6), reductions of 12%, 11%, and 39% respectively. The results were almost identical to those predicted; 18.4 mmHg, 9.7 mmHg, and 1.4 mmol/L respectively. Conclusion The Polypill resulted in the predicted reductions in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Long term reductions of this magnitude would have a substantial effect in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN36672232"
https://openalex.org/W2041815095,"In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into chromatin by canonical histone proteins. The specialized histone H3 variant CENP-A provides an epigenetic and structural basis for chromosome segregation by replacing H3 at centromeres. Unlike exclusively octameric canonical H3 nucleosomes, CENP-A nucleosomes have been shown to exist as octamers, hexamers, and tetramers. An intriguing possibility reconciling these observations is that CENP-A nucleosomes cycle between octamers and tetramers in vivo. We tested this hypothesis by tracking CENP-A nucleosomal components, structure, chromatin folding, and covalent modifications across the human cell cycle. We report that CENP-A nucleosomes alter from tetramers to octamers before replication and revert to tetramers after replication. These structural transitions are accompanied by reversible chaperone binding, chromatin fiber folding changes, and previously undescribed modifications within the histone fold domains of CENP-A and H4. Our results reveal a cyclical nature to CENP-A nucleosome structure and have implications for the maintenance of epigenetic memory after centromere replication."
https://openalex.org/W2138498907,"Caspase proteases are principal mediators of apoptosis, where they cleave hundreds of proteins. Phosphorylation also plays an important role in apoptosis, although the extent to which proteolytic and phosphorylation pathways crosstalk during programmed cell death remains poorly understood. Using a quantitative proteomic platform that integrates phosphorylation sites into the topographical maps of proteins, we identify a cohort of over 500 apoptosis-specific phosphorylation events and show that they are enriched on cleaved proteins and clustered around sites of caspase proteolysis. We find that caspase cleavage can expose new sites for phosphorylation, and, conversely, that phosphorylation at the +3 position of cleavage sites can directly promote substrate proteolysis by caspase-8. This study provides a global portrait of the apoptotic phosphoproteome, revealing heretofore unrecognized forms of functional crosstalk between phosphorylation and caspase proteolytic pathways that lead to enhanced rates of protein cleavage and the unveiling of new sites for phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2026652437,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Cerebral edema, the abnormal accumulation of fluid within the brain parenchyma, contributes to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and is a common life-threatening neurological complication following TBI. Unfortunately, neurosurgical approaches to alleviate increased ICP remain controversial and medical therapies are lacking due in part to the absence of viable drug targets. In the present study, genetic inhibition (P2X7−/− mice) of the purinergic P2x7 receptor attenuated the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and reduced cerebral edema following controlled cortical impact, as compared to wild-type mice. Similarly, brilliant blue G (BBG), a clinically non-toxic P2X7 inhibitor, inhibited IL-1β expression, limited edemic development, and improved neurobehavioral outcomes after TBI. The beneficial effects of BBG followed either prophylactic administration via the drinking water for one week prior to injury or via an intravenous bolus administration up to four hours after TBI, suggesting a clinically-implementable therapeutic window. Notably, P2X7 localized within astrocytic end feet and administration of BBG decreased the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a reactive astrocyte marker, and attenuated the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4), an astrocytic water channel that promotes cellular edema. Together, these data implicate P2X7 as a novel therapeutic target to prevent secondary neurological injury after TBI, a finding that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2062277409,"The centromere is a specialized chromosomal structure that regulates chromosome segregation. Centromeres are marked by a histone H3 variant. In budding yeast, the histone H3 variant Cse4 is present in a single centromeric nucleosome. Experimental evidence supports several different models for the structure of centromeric nucleosomes. To investigate Cse4 copy number in live yeast, we developed a method coupling fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and calibrated imaging. We find that centromeric nucleosomes have one copy of Cse4 during most of the cell cycle, whereas two copies are detected at anaphase. The proposal of an anaphase-coupled structural change is supported by Cse4-Cse4 interactions, incorporation of Cse4, and the absence of Scm3 in anaphase. Nucleosome reconstitution and ChIP suggests both Cse4 structures contain H2A/H2B. The increase in Cse4 intensity and deposition at anaphase are also observed in Candida albicans. Our experimental evidence supports a cell-cycle-coupled oscillation of centromeric nucleosome structure in yeast."

The marker density, however, is not very satisfactory especially in the context of large genome size (2800 Mb/1C) and 20 linkage groups (LGs). Therefore, using marker segregation data for 10 RILs and one BC population from the international groundnut community, with the help of common markers across different populations, a reference consensus genetic map has been developed. This map is comprised of 897 marker loci including 895 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 2 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) loci distributed on 20 LGs (a01–a10 and b01–b10) spanning a map distance of 3, 863.6 cM with an average map density of 4.4 cM. The highest numbers of markers (70) were integrated on a01 and the least number of markers (21) on b09. The marker density, however, was lowest (6.4 cM) on a08 and highest (2.5 cM) on a01. The reference consensus map has been divided into 20 cM long 203 BINs. These BINs carry 1 (a10_02, a10_08 and a10_09) to 20 (a10_04) loci with an average of 4 marker loci per BIN. Although the polymorphism information content (PIC) value was available for 526 markers in 190 BINs, 36 and 111 BINs have at least one marker with >0.70 and >0.50 PIC values, respectively. This information will be useful for selecting highly informative and uniformly distributed markers for developing new genetic maps, background selection and diversity analysis. Most importantly, this reference consensus map will serve as a reliable reference for aligning new genetic and physical maps, performing QTL analysis in a multi-populations design, evaluating the genetic background effect on QTL expression, and serving other genetic and molecular breeding activities in groundnut."

Aerobic interval training (AIT), walking/running four times four minutes at 85–95% of peak heart rate, has proven to be effective in increasing peak oxygen uptake in coronary heart disease patients. As some patients do not attend organized rehabilitation programs, home-based exercise should be an alternative. We investigated whether AIT could be performed effectively at home, and compared the effects on peak oxygen uptake with that observed after a standard care, four-week residential rehabilitation. Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized to residential rehabilitation or home-based AIT. At six months follow-up, peak oxygen uptake increased 4.6 (±2.7) and 3.9 (±3.6) mL·kg−1 min−1 (both p<0.005, non-significant between-group difference) after residential rehabilitation and AIT, respectively. Quality of life increased significantly in both groups, with no statistical significant difference between groups. We found no evidence for a different treatment effect between patients randomized to home-based AIT compared to patients attending organized rehabilitation (95% confidence interval −1.8, 3.5). AIT patients reported good adherence to exercise training. Even though these first data indicate positive effects of home-based AIT in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, more studies are needed to provide supporting evidence for the application of this rehabilitation strategy.

Socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS associated with recent (<2 years) HIV testing were identified using gender-specific univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Among women, differential effects of barriers to testing according to test circumstance (whether they have been offered for a prenatal test or not) were assessed through interaction tests.Recent HIV testing was reported by 6.1% of men and 9.5% of women (including 4.6% as part of antenatal care). Among men, having a low socioeconomic status, having a low HIV-related knowledge level and being employed [compared to those inactive: adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.87] were associated with lower proportions of recent HIV testing. Among women without a prenatal HIV testing offer, living outside the capital (aOR 0.38; CI 0.19-0.77) and reporting a unique lifetime sexual partner constituted additional barriers to HIV testing. By contrast, among women recently offered to be tested in prenatal care, none of these variables was found to be associated with recent HIV testing.Various dimensions of individuals' characteristics constituted significant barriers to HIV testing in Côte d'Ivoire in 2005, with gender specificities. Such barriers are substantially reduced when testing was proposed in the framework of antenatal care. This suggests that provider-initiated testing strategies may help overcome individual barriers to HIV testing."

https://openalex.org/W2102043950,"Background Although gestural communication is widespread in primates, few studies focused on the cognitive processes underlying gestures produced by monkeys. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study asked whether red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) trained to produce visually based requesting gestures modify their gestural behavior in response to human’s attentional states. The experimenter held a food item and displayed five different attentional states that differed on the basis of body, head and gaze orientation; mangabeys had to request food by extending an arm toward the food item (begging gesture). Mangabeys were sensitive, at least to some extent, to the human’s attentional state. They reacted to some postural cues of a human recipient: they gestured more and faster when both the body and the head of the experimenter were oriented toward them than when they were oriented away. However, they did not seem to use gaze cues to recognize an attentive human: monkeys begged at similar levels regardless of the experimenter’s eyes state. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that mangabeys lowered their production of begging gestures when these could not be perceived by the human who had to respond to it. This finding provides important evidence that acquired begging gestures of monkeys might be used intentionally."

Despite the central role of mast cells in allergic disease little is known about the effect of lactobacilli on the function of these cells. To address this we assessed changes in rat mast cell activation following oral treatment with a strain of Lactobacillus known to attenuate allergic responses in animal models. Sprague Dawley rats were fed with L.rhamnosus JB-1 (1×109) or vehicle control for 9 days. Mediator release from peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) was determined in response to a range of stimuli. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) was used to assess mast cell responses in vivo. The Ca2+ activated K+ channel (KCa3.1) current, identified as critical to mast cell degranulation, was monitored by whole cell patch-clamp. L.rhamnosus JB-1 treatment lead to significant inhibition of mast cell mediator release in response to a range of stimuli including IgE mediated activation. Furthermore, the PCA response was significantly reduced in treated rats. Patch-clamp studies revealed that RPMC from treated animals were much less responsive to the KCa3.1 opener, DCEBIO. These studies demonstrate that Ingestion of L.rhamnosus JB-1 leads to mast cell stabilization in rats and identify KCa3.1 as an immunomodulatory target for certain lactobacilli. Thus the systemic effects of certain candidate probiotics may include mast cell stabilization and such actions could contribute to the beneficial effect of these organisms in allergic and other inflammatory disorders."

Aims To quantify the volume, type and costs, in a United Kingdom primary care setting, of healthcare resources used by individuals diagnosed with CD up to ten years before and after diagnosis, and to estimate medical costs associated with CD. Methods A cohort of 3,646 CD cases and a parallel cohort of 32,973 matched controls, extracted from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) over the period 1987–2005 were used i) to evaluate the impact of diagnosis on the average resource use and costs of cases; ii) to assess direct healthcare costs due to CD by comparing average resource use and costs incurred by cases vs. controls. Results Average annual healthcare costs per patient increased by £310 (95% CI £299, £320) after diagnosis. CD cases experienced higher healthcare costs than controls both before diagnosis (mean difference £91; 95% CI: £86, £97) and after diagnosis (mean difference £354; 95% CI: £347, £361). These differences were driven mainly by higher test and referral costs before diagnosis, and by increased prescription costs after diagnosis. Conclusions This study shows significant additional primary care costs associated with coeliac disease. It provides novel evidence that will assist researchers evaluating interventions in this area, and will challenge policymakers, clinicians, researchers and the public to develop strategies that maximise the health benefits of the resources associated with this disease."

Synoptic data available from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) indicate that this region harbours some of the highest densities of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus found in the North Atlantic during winter. Examination of large-scale climatic and oceanographic data suggests that little auks favour patches of high copepod abundance in areas where air temperature ranges from 0°C to 5°C. These results greatly advance our understanding of animal responses to extreme environmental constraints, and highlight that information on habitat preference is key to identifying critical areas for marine conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2011655870,"Aberrant growth of blood vessels in the eye forms the basis of many incapacitating diseases and currently the majority of patients respond to anti-angiogenic therapies based on blocking the principal angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). While highly successful, new therapeutic targets are critical for the increasing number of individuals susceptible to retina-related pathologies in our increasingly aging population. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell surface peptidase that is absent on normal tissue vasculature but is highly expressed on the neovasculature of most solid tumors, where we have previously shown to regulate angiogenic endothelial cell invasion. Because pathologic angiogenic responses are often triggered by distinct signals, we sought to determine if PSMA also contributes to the pathologic angiogenesis provoked by hypoxia of the retina, which underlies many debilitating retinopathies.Using a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, we found that while developmental angiogenesis is normal in PSMA null mice, hypoxic challenge resulted in decreased retinal vascular pathology when compared to wild type mice as assessed by avascular area and numbers of vascular tufts/glomeruli. The vessels formed in the PSMA null mice were more organized and highly perfused, suggesting a more 'normal' phenotype. Importantly, the decrease in angiogenesis was not due to an impaired hypoxic response as levels of pro-angiogenic factors are comparable; indicating that PSMA regulation of angiogenesis is independent of VEGF. Furthermore, both systemic and intravitreal administration of a PSMA inhibitor in wild type mice undergoing OIR mimicked the PSMA null phenotype resulting in improved retinal vasculature.Our data indicate that PSMA plays a VEGF-independent role in retinal angiogenesis and that the lack of or inhibition of PSMA may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of angiogenesis-based ocular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2081434656,"Previous research reveals that a more 'African' appearance has significant social consequences, yielding more negative first impressions and harsher criminal sentencing of Black or White individuals. This study is the first to systematically assess the relative contribution of skin tone and facial metrics to White, Black, and Korean perceivers' ratings of the racial prototypicality of faces from the same three groups. Our results revealed that the relative contribution of metrics and skin tone depended on both perceiver race and face race. White perceivers' racial prototypicality ratings were less responsive to variations in skin tone than were Black or Korean perceivers' ratings. White perceivers ratings' also were more responsive to facial metrics than to skin tone, while the reverse was true for Black perceivers. Additionally, across all perceiver groups, skin tone had a more consistent impact than metrics on racial prototypicality ratings of White faces, with the reverse for Korean faces. For Black faces, the relative impact varied with perceiver race: skin tone had a more consistent impact than metrics for Black and Korean perceivers, with the reverse for White perceivers. These results have significant implications for predicting who will experience racial prototypicality biases and from whom."
https://openalex.org/W1995177115,"We hypothesized that interindividual differences in motor activities during chewing and/or swallowing were determining factors for the transfer of volatile aroma from the in-mouth air cavity (IMAC) toward the olfactory mucosa. In our first experiment, we looked for changes in IMAC volume after saliva deglutition in 12 healthy subjects. The mean IMAC volume was measured after empty deglutition using an acoustic pharyngometer device. Based on the time course of the IMAC volume after swallowing, we discerned two groups of subjects. The first group displayed a small, constant IMAC volume (2.26 mL ±0.62) that corresponded to a high tongue position. The second group displayed a progressive increase in IMAC (from 6.82 mL ±2.37 to 22.82 mL ±3.04) that corresponded to a progressive lowering of the tongue to its resting position. In our second experiment, we investigated the relationship between IMAC volume changes after deglutition and the level of aroma release at the nostril. For this purpose, the release of menthone was measured at the nostril level in 25 subjects who consumed similar amounts of a mint tablet. The subjects were separated into two groups corresponding to two levels of menthone release: high (H) and low (L). The mean volume of IMAC was measured during and after empty deglutition. Group H displayed a small, constant amplitude of IMAC volume change after deglutition, while Group L displayed a progressive increase in IMAC. It is likely that Group H continuously released the aroma through the veloglossal isthmus as the mint was consumed, while Group L trapped the aroma in the oral cavity and then released it into the nasal cavity upon swallowing. These results show that the in vivo aroma release profile in humans depends closely on the different motor patterns at work during empty deglutition."
https://openalex.org/W1978720299,"Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of target genes, including CYP2B and 3A. Phenobarbital activates CAR, at least in part, in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. However, the precise mechanisms underlying phenobarbital activation of AMPK are still unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that phenobarbital administration to mice decreases hepatic miR-122, a liver-enriched microRNA involved in both hepatic differentiation and function. The time-course change in the phenobarbital-mediated down-regulation of miR-122 was inversely correlated with AMPK activation. Phenobarbital decreased primary miR-122 to approximately 25% of the basal level as early as 1 h and suppressed transactivity of mir-122 promoter in HuH-7 cells, suggesting that the down-regulation occurred at the transcriptional level. AMPK activation by metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribonucleoside had no evident effect on miR-122 levels. An inhibitory RNA specific for miR-122 increased activated AMPK and CAR-mediated trancactivation of the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module in HepG2 cells. Conversely, the reporter activity induced by the ectopic CAR was almost completely suppressed by co-transfection with the miR-122 mimic RNA. GFP-tagged CAR was expressed in the cytoplasm in addition to the nucleus in the majority of HuH-7 cells in which miR-122 was highly expressed. Co-transfection of the mimic or the inhibitor RNA for miR-122 further increased or decreased, respectively, the number of cells that expressed GFP-CAR in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results suggest that phenobarbital-mediated down-regulation of miR-122 is an early and important event in the AMPK-dependent CAR activation and transactivation of its target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2033382437,"Accurate vocal production relies on several factors including sensory feedback and the ability to predict future challenges to the control processes. Repetitive patterns of perturbations in sensory feedback by themselves elicit implicit expectations in the vocal control system regarding the timing, quality and direction of perturbations. In the present study, the predictability of voice pitch-shifted auditory feedback was experimentally manipulated. A block of trials where all pitch-shift stimuli were upward, and therefore predictable was contrasted against an unpredictable block of trials in which the stimulus direction was randomized between upward and downward pitch-shifts. It was found that predictable perturbations in voice auditory feedback led to a reduction in the proportion of compensatory vocal responses, which might be indicative of a reduction in vocal control. The predictable perturbations also led to a reduction in the magnitude of the N1 component of cortical Event Related Potentials (ERP) that was associated with the reflexive compensations to the perturbations. We hypothesize that formation of expectancy in our study is accompanied by involuntary allocation of attentional resources occurring as a result of habituation or learning, that in turn trigger limited and controlled exploration-related motor variability in the vocal control system."
https://openalex.org/W1986184464,"Background The spread of insect-resistance transgenes from genetically engineered (GE) rice to its coexisting weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea) populations via gene flow creates a major concern for commercial GE rice cultivation. Transgene flow to weedy rice seems unavoidable. Therefore, characterization of potential fitness effect brought by the transgenes is essential to assess environmental consequences caused by crop-weed transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings Field performance of fitness-related traits was assessed in advanced hybrid progeny of F4 generation derived from a cross between an insect-resistant transgenic (Bt/CpTI) rice line and a weedy strain. The performance of transgene-positive hybrid progeny was compared with the transgene-negative progeny and weedy parent in pure and mixed planting of transgenic and nontransgenic plants under environmental conditions with natural vs. low insect pressure. Results showed that under natural insect pressure the insect-resistant transgenes could effectively suppress target insects and bring significantly increased fitness to transgenic plants in pure planting, compared with nontransgenic plants (including weedy parent). In contrast, no significant differences in fitness were detected under low insect pressure. However, such increase in fitness was not detected in the mixed planting of transgenic and nontransgenic plants due to significantly reduced insect pressure. Conclusions/Significance Insect-resistance transgenes may have limited fitness advantages to hybrid progeny resulted from crop-weed transgene flow owning to the significantly reduced ambient target insect pressure when an insect-resistant GE crop is grown. Given that the extensive cultivation of an insect-resistant GE crop will ultimately reduce the target insect pressure, the rapid spread of insect-resistance transgenes in weedy populations in commercial GE crop fields may be not likely to happen."
https://openalex.org/W2084914745,"The lawful continuous linear relation between movement time and task difficulty (i.e., index of difficulty; ID) in a goal-directed rapid aiming task (Fitts’ law) has been recently challenged in reciprocal performance. Specifically, a discontinuity was observed at critical ID and was attributed to a transition between two distinct dynamic regimes that occurs with increasing difficulty. In the present paper, we show that such a discontinuity is also present in discrete aiming when ID is manipulated via target width (experiment 1) but not via target distance (experiment 2). Fitts’ law’s discontinuity appears, therefore, to be a suitable indicator of the underlying functional adaptations of the neuro-muscular-skeletal system to task properties/requirements, independently of reciprocal or discrete nature of the task. These findings open new perspectives to the study of dynamic regimes involved in discrete aiming and sensori-motor mechanisms underlying the speed-accuracy trade-off."
https://openalex.org/W2024133022,"It has been hypothesized that increased HIV acquisition in uncircumcised men may relate to a more thinly keratinized inner foreskin. However, published data are contradictory and potentially confounded by medical indications for circumcision. We tested the hypothesis that the inner foreskin was more thinly keratinized than the outer foreskin using tissues from 19 healthy, HIV-uninfected men undergoing routine prophylactic circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. Sections from 3 foreskin anatomic sites (inner, outer, and frenar band) were snap-frozen separately. Two independent laboratories each separately stained, imaged, and measured keratin thicknesses in a blinded fashion. There was no significant difference in keratin thickness between the inner (mean = 14.67±7.48 µm) and outer (mean = 13.30±8.49 µm) foreskin, or between the inner foreskin and the frenar band (mean = 16.91±12.42 µm). While the frenar band showed the greatest intra-individual heterogeneity in keratin thickness, there was substantial inter-individual variation seen in all regions. Measurements made by the two laboratories showed high correlation (r = 0.741, 95% CI, 0.533–0.864). We conclude that, despite inter- and intra-individual variability, keratin thickness was similar in the inner and outer foreskin of healthy Ugandan men, and that reduced keratin thickness is not likely to make the inner foreskin more susceptible to HIV acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2089355473,"Destructive host-feeding is common in hymenopteran parasitoids. Such feeding may be restricted to host stages not preferred for oviposition. However, whether this is a fixed strategy or can vary according to resource levels or parasitoid needs is less clear. We tested the trade-off between host feeding and oviposition on two whitefly parasitoids under varying host densities. Females of two aphelinid parasitoids, Eretmocerus hayati and Encarsia sophia were exposed to nine different densities of their whitefly host, Bemisia tabaci, in single-instar tests to identify their functional response. Mixed-instar host choice tests were also conducted by exposing whiteflies at four densities to the parasitoids. We hypothesized that the parasitoid females can detect different host densities, and decide on oviposition vs. host-feeding accordingly. The results showed that both Er. hayati and En. sophia females tended to increase both oviposition and host-feeding with increased host density within a certain range. Oviposition reached a plateau at lower host density than host-feeding in Er. hayati, while En. sophia reached its oviposition plateau at higher densities. At low densities, Er. hayati parasitized most on first and second (the optimal ones), and fed most on third nymphal instars (the suboptimal one) of the whitefly host as theory predicts, while at high densities, both parasitism and host-feeding occurred on first and second instars which are preferred for oviposition. En. sophia parasitized most on third and fourth (the optimal ones), while fed on first instars (the suboptimal one) at low densities, and utilized third and fourth instars for both at high densities. In conclusion, oviposition vs. host-feeding strategy of parasitoid females was found to vary at different host densities. The balance between reserving optimal hosts for oviposition or using them for host-feeding depended on parasitoid life history and the availability of host resources."
https://openalex.org/W2009584071,"Human albumin has recently been demonstrated to protect brain neurons from injury in rat ischemic brain. However, there is no information available about whether human albumin can prevent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression of dopaminergic (DA) neurons induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxicity that is most commonly used to create a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, two microliters of 1.25% human albumin were stereotaxically injected into the right striatum of rats one day before or 7 days after the 6-OHDA lesion in the same side. D-Amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry was measured 7 days, 3 and 10 weeks after 6-OHDA lesion. We observed that intrastriatal administration of human albumin significantly reduced the degree of rotational asymmetry. The number of TH-immunoreactive neurons present in the substantia nigra was greater in 6-OHDA lesioned rats following human albumin-treatment than non-human albumin treatment. TH-immunoreactivity in the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum was also significantly increased in the human albumin-treated rats. To examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of human albumin, we challenged PC12 cells with 6-OHDA as an in vitro model of PD. Incubation with human albumin prevented 6-OHDA-induced reduction of cell viability in PC12 cell cultures, as measured by MTT assay. Furthermore, human albumin reduced 6-OHDA-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in cultured PC12 cells, as assessed by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showed that human albumin inhibited 6-OHDA-induced activation of JNK, c-Jun, ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling in PC12 cultures challenged with 6-OHDA. Human albumin may protect against 6-OHDA toxicity by influencing MAPK pathway followed by anti-ROS formation and anti-apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2024005241,"Temporal allocation of attention is often investigated with a paradigm in which two relevant target items are presented in a rapid sequence of irrelevant distractors. The term Attentional Blink (AB) denotes a transient impairment of awareness for the second of these two target items when presented close in time. Experimental studies reported that the AB is reduced when the second target is emotionally significant, suggesting a modulation of attention allocation. The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the influence of target-distractor similarity on AB magnitude for faces with emotional expressions under conditions of limited attention in a series of six rapid serial visual presentation experiments. The task on the first target was either to discriminate the gender of a neutral face (Experiments 1, 3–6) or an indoor/outdoor visual scene (Experiment 2). The task on the second target required either the detection of emotional expressions (Experiments 1–5) or the detection of a face (Experiment 6). The AB was minimal or absent when targets could be easily discriminated from each other. Three successive experiments revealed that insufficient masking and target-distractor similarity could account for the observed immunity of faces against the AB in the first two experiments. An AB was present but not increased when the facial expression was irrelevant to the task suggesting that target-distractor similarity plays a more important role in eliciting an AB than the attentional set demanded by the specific task. In line with previous work, emotional faces were less affected by the AB."
https://openalex.org/W1967254771,"Prion replication is believed to consist of two components, a growth or elongation of infectious isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) particles and their fragmentation, a process that provides new replication centers. The current study introduced an experimental approach that employs Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification with beads (PMCAb) and relies on a series of kinetic experiments for assessing elongation rates of PrPSc particles. Four prion strains including two strains with short incubation times to disease (263K and Hyper) and two strains with very long incubation times (SSLOW and LOTSS) were tested. The elongation rate of brain-derived PrPSc was found to be strain-specific. Strains with short incubation times had higher rates than strains with long incubation times. Surprisingly, the strain-specific elongation rates increased substantially for all four strains after they were subjected to six rounds of serial PMCAb. In parallel to an increase in elongation rates, the percentages of diglycosylated PrP glycoforms increased in PMCAb-derived PrPSc comparing to those of brain-derived PrPSc. These results suggest that PMCAb selects the same molecular features regardless of strain initial characteristics and that convergent evolution of PrPSc properties occurred during in vitro amplification. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that each prion strain is comprised of a variety of conformers or ‘quasi-species’ and that change in the prion replication environment gives selective advantage to those conformers that replicate most effectively under specific environment."
https://openalex.org/W2001544000,"Bacterial genomic islands are often flanked by tRNA genes, which act as sites for the integration of foreign DNA into the host chromosome. For example, Bacillus cereus ATCC14579 contains a pathogenicity island flanked by a predicted pseudo-tRNA, tRNA(Other), which does not function in translation. Deletion of tRNA(Other) led to significant changes in cell wall morphology and antibiotic resistance and was accompanied by changes in the expression of numerous genes involved in oxidative stress responses, several of which contain significant complementarities to sequences surrounding tRNA(Other). This suggested that tRNA(Other) might be expressed as part of a larger RNA, and RACE analysis subsequently confirmed the existence of several RNA species that significantly extend both the 3' and 5'-ends of tRNA(Other). tRNA(Other) expression levels were found to be responsive to changes in extracellular iron concentration, consistent with the presence of three putative ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites in the 5' leader region of one of these larger RNAs. Taken together with previous data, this study now suggests that tRNA(Other) may function by providing a tRNA-like structural element within a larger regulatory RNA. These findings illustrate that while integration of genomic islands often leaves tRNA genes intact and functional, in other instances inactivation may generate tRNA-like elements that are then recruited to other functions in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2037299387,"We effortlessly perform reach movements to objects in different directions and depths. However, how networks of cortical neurons compute reach depth from binocular visual inputs remains largely unknown. To bridge the gap between behavior and neurophysiology, we trained a feed-forward artificial neural network to uncover potential mechanisms that might underlie the 3D transformation of reach depth. Our physiologically-inspired 4-layer network receives distributed 3D visual inputs (1(st) layer) along with eye, head and vergence signals. The desired motor plan was coded in a population (3(rd) layer) that we read out (4(th) layer) using an optimal linear estimator. After training, our network was able to reproduce all known single-unit recording evidence on depth coding in the parietal cortex. Network analyses predict the presence of eye/head and vergence changes of depth tuning, pointing towards a gain-modulation mechanism of depth transformation. In addition, reach depth was computed directly from eye-centered (relative) visual distances, without explicit absolute depth coding. We suggest that these effects should be observable in parietal and pre-motor areas."
https://openalex.org/W2104706617,"K-RAS mutation poses a particularly difficult problem for cancer therapy. Activating mutations in K-RAS are common in cancers of the lung, pancreas, and colon and are associated with poor response to therapy. As such, targeted therapies that abrogate K-RAS-induced oncogenicity would be of tremendous value.We searched for small molecule kinase inhibitors that preferentially affect the growth of colorectal cancer cells expressing mutant K-RAS. The mechanism of action of one inhibitor was explored using chemical and genetic approaches.We identified BAY61-3606 as an inhibitor of proliferation in colorectal cancer cells expressing mutant forms of K-RAS, but not in isogenic cells expressing wild-type K-RAS. In addition to its anti-proliferative effects in mutant cells, BAY61-3606 exhibited a distinct biological property in wild-type cells in that it conferred sensitivity to inhibition of RAF. In this context, BAY61-3606 acted by inhibiting MAP4K2 (GCK), which normally activates NFκβ signaling in wild-type cells in response to inhibition of RAF. As a result of MAP4K2 inhibition, wild-type cells became sensitive to AZ-628, a RAF inhibitor, when also treated with BAY61-3606.These studies indicate that BAY61-3606 exerts distinct biological activities in different genetic contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2138113748,"Dystocia is a major problem for the dairy cattle industry, and the observed high rates of this condition stem from genetic selection to increase subsequent milk production of the calving female. Because smaller birth size does not adversely affect subsequent milk production, selecting for cows with a smaller birth size would reduce dystocia rates and be beneficial for both the cattle and the farmers. To identify genes that regulate birth weight, we conducted a genome-wide association study using 1151 microsatellite markers and identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with birth weight: A-326G in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of solute carrier family 44, member 5 (SLC44A5). Cows with higher birth weights carried the A polymorphism in the SLC44A5 5′ UTR, and the presence of the A polymorphism correlated with a high rate of dystocia. Luciferase assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assays revealed that SLC44A5 transcripts with the A polymorphism are expressed at lower levels than those carrying the G polymorphism. SLC44A5 encodes a choline transporter-like protein, and choline is a component of the major phospholipids of cell membranes. Uptake studies in HeLa cells demonstrated that SLC44A5 knockdown reduces choline efflux, whereas SLC44A5 overexpression resulted in the opposite effect. Furthermore, cell viability assays indicated that SLC44A5 knockdown increased cell proliferation, whereas SLC44A5 overexpression repressed proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that calves with reduced SLC44A5 expression are larger due to enhanced cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control birth weight in Holsteins and suggests that SLC44A5 may serve as a potential target for preventing dystocia."
https://openalex.org/W2011423738,"Background Rem2 is a small monomeric GTP-binding protein of the RGK family, whose known functions are modulation of calcium channel currents and alterations of cytoskeletal architecture. Rem2 is the only RGK protein found predominantly in the brain, where it has been linked to synaptic development. We wished to determine the effect of neuronal activity on the subcellular distribution of Rem2 and its interacting partners. Results We show that Rem2 undergoes activity-and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR)-dependent translocation in rat hippocampal neurons. This redistribution of Rem2, from a diffuse pattern to one that is highly punctate, is dependent on Ca2+ influx, on binding to calmodulin (CaM), and also involves an auto-inhibitory domain within the Rem2 distal C-terminus region. We found that Rem2 can bind to Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKII) a in Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data reveal a spatial and temporal correlation between NMDAR-dependent clustering of Rem2 and CaMKII in neurons, indicating co-assembly and co-trafficking in neurons. Finally, we show that inhibiting CaMKII aggregation in neurons and HEK cells reduces Rem2 clustering, and that Rem2 affects the baseline distribution of CaMKII in HEK cells. Conclusions Our data suggest a novel function for Rem2 in co-trafficking with CaMKII, and thus potentially expose a role in neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1987060974,"We developed a marker based infinitesimal model for quantitative trait analysis. In contrast to the classical infinitesimal model, we now have new information about the segregation of every individual locus of the entire genome. Under this new model, we propose that the genetic effect of an individual locus is a function of the genome location (a continuous quantity). The overall genetic value of an individual is the weighted integral of the genetic effect function along the genome. Numerical integration is performed to find the integral, which requires partitioning the entire genome into a finite number of bins. Each bin may contain many markers. The integral is approximated by the weighted sum of all the bin effects. We now turn the problem of marker analysis into bin analysis so that the model dimension has decreased from a virtual infinity to a finite number of bins. This new approach can efficiently handle virtually unlimited number of markers without marker selection. The marker based infinitesimal model requires high linkage disequilibrium of all markers within a bin. For populations with low or no linkage disequilibrium, we develop an adaptive infinitesimal model. Both the original and the adaptive models are tested using simulated data as well as beef cattle data. The simulated data analysis shows that there is always an optimal number of bins at which the predictability of the bin model is much greater than the original marker analysis. Result of the beef cattle data analysis indicates that the bin model can increase the predictability from 10% (multiple marker analysis) to 33% (multiple bin analysis). The marker based infinitesimal model paves a way towards the solution of genetic mapping and genomic selection using the whole genome sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W2021527959,"Translation initiation of picornavirus RNA is driven by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element located upstream of the initiator codon. RNA structure organization as well as RNA-protein interaction plays a fundamental role in internal initiation. IRES activity has been mainly analyzed in the context of reporter genes, lacking regions of the viral genome potentially affecting translation efficiency. With the aim to understand the vulnerability of the IRES and translation start region to small molecules in the context of the viral genome, we designed a set of customized RNase-resistant 2′O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (2′OMe AONs) based on RNA structure data. These AONs were then used to monitor their capacity to interfere viral RNA translation, and thus, to inhibit virus yield. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) RNA translation can be initiated at two in-frame AUG codons. We show here that a 2′OMe AON complementary to AUG2 inhibited viral multiplication more efficiently than the one that targeted AUG1. Furthermore, the response of the viral RNA to AONs targeting the IRES region denoted important differences between tissue culture cells and cell-free systems, reinforcing the need to analyze viral RNA response in living cells. Importantly, we have identified four specific motifs within the IRES element that are targets for viral inhibitors both in tissue culture cells and in cell-free systems. The identified targets define accessible regions to small molecules, which disturb either the RNA structural organization or the RNA-protein interactions needed to initiate translation in FMDV RNA."

These organelles play an essential role in apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species; in addition, mtDNA also reveals the history of populations and ancient human migration. All these events and variations in the mitochondrial genome are thought to cause some cancers, including prostate cancer, and also help us to group individuals into common origin groups. The aim of the present study is to analyze the different haplogroups and variations in the sequence in the mitochondrial genome of a southern European population consisting of subjects affected (n = 239) and non-affected (n = 150) by sporadic prostate cancer.Using primer extension analysis and DNA sequencing, we identified the nine major European haplogroups and CR polymorphisms. The frequencies of the haplogroups did not differ between patients and control cohorts, whereas the CR polymorphism T16356C was significantly higher in patients with PC compared to the controls (p = 0.029). PSA, staging, and Gleason score were associated with none of the nine major European haplogroups. The CR polymorphisms G16129A (p = 0.007) and T16224C (p = 0.022) were significantly associated with Gleason score, whereas T16311C (p = 0.046) was linked with T-stage.Our results do not suggest that mtDNA haplogroups could be involved in sporadic prostate cancer etiology and pathogenesis as previous studies performed in middle Europe population. Although some significant associations have been obtained in studying CR polymorphisms, further studies should be performed to validate these results."
