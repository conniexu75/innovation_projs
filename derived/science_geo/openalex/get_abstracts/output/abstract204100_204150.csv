With the sodium electrode and the thermocouple psychrometer, interaction between ions and Carbowax is shown to lead to a slight dissociation of the latter."

https://openalex.org/W2061426711,The return of acetylcholinesterase activity was studied in several cholinergic structures in the cat after irreversible inactivation by diisopropylfluoro-phosphate. It was found that enzymic activity returned uniformly along the hypoglossal and cervical sympathetic nerve trunks. No evidence for somatoaxonal convection of enzyme was obtained.

A transient inhibition of beef liver catalase occurs. Indirect evidence suggests that the observed enzyme inhibition is caused by peroxides present in the smoke."

https://openalex.org/W2010533264,"EARLIER investigations on the relations of the electrolyte content of organs to hypertension in the rat have shown that only the increase of the potassium content of the vessel wall is characteristic of hypertension1. In the carotic strip of cow in vitro, potassium produces a rise in tension which lasts so long as the potassium concentration of the bath solution is not altered. Simultaneously with the penetration of potassium into the muscle fibre a rise in tension2, viscosity and dynamic elasticity modulus3 occurs. It may be concluded from this that the potassium which entered the muscle fibre discharges certain proteins and so increases the mechanical tension."

https://openalex.org/W1989657850,"When infant developmental quotients are compared with children's intelligence quotients, it appears that most subnormality is manifested only at the later age. This phenomenon has been cited as evidence that environment chiefly determines intelligence, but the argument is circular. A helpful approach to the nature-nurture problem is afforded by the geneticists' concept of reaction norms or ""reaction repertoires."""
https://openalex.org/W177596610,"The deoxyribonucleic acids of the Escherichia coli bacteriophage T2, T4, and T6 contain the pyrimidine nucleotide deoxy- 5-hydroxymethylcytidylic acid and derivatives with one or two glucosyl groups substituted on the 5-hydroxymethyl group (1-3). In order to study the possible role of the triphosphates of these nucleotides in the biosynthesis of the phage deoxyribonucleic acid, we have prepared the triphosphates of the two compounds which predominate in T2 deoxyribonucleic acid, deoxy-5-hydroxymethylcytidine triphosphate and deoxy-5-monoglucosyl hydroxymethylcytidine triphosphate. These preparations required an expedient, large scale preparation of the deoxyribonucleic acid of T2 phage, isolation of the required nucleoside monophosphates, and synthesis of the di- and triphosphates by the procedure of Clark et al. (4). In the course of this investigation, a convenient method was discovered for the preparation of crystalline deoxy-5-hydroxymethylcytidine monophosphate. This paper describes these procedures in detail."

The growth rate of Bacillus anthracis, in the septicemic phase, was the same in both normal and immunized animals; however, the number of bacilli per milliliter of blood at death was decreased by 75 percent in immunized animals. Neither the enhancement of virulence by treatment with egg yolk nor the size of the challenge dose affected the growth rate or the number of bacilli per milliliter of blood at death. Mean time to death for the treatments tested varied from approximately 20 to 100 hours. Nonimmunized animals challenged with a strain of low virulence had a terminal number of bacilli per milliliter of blood and a growth rate in the blood the same as that for the highly virulent strain."

https://openalex.org/W2009257051,"IT has been found that infants who develop into adults with the following phenotype: red cells Le (a − b +), ABH secretor, Les (a + b +)*, go through a phase in which the red-cell phenotype is Le (a + b +), and the secretions, as in the adult, contain ABH, Lea and Leb. We have been able to establish that during the phase in which Lea substance is detectable on the red cells of these infants, it is also detectable in their serum. In the adult with Le (a − b +) red cells, although Leb substance is present in serum, Lea substance is not detectable although it is found in the water-soluble secretions. Our observations are summarized in Table 1."

It was found not to be a specific product of developing cysts. Instead, its effects are duplicated by a number of reagents which have only a high water content in common. The hypothesis that the volatile factor is water was experimentally confirmed."
