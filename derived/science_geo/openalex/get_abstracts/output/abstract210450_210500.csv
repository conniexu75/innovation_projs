https://openalex.org/W1987149126,"When DL-tryptophan-2-C(14) was incubated with washed cells or cell-free preparations of Pseudomonas savastanoi, two radioactive metabolites were formed. One was identified as indoleacetamide and the second, indoleacetic acid. The amount of indoleacetamide in the reaction mixture increased rapidly during the early stages of incubation; it reached a peak after 15 minutes and declined steadily there-after. Indoleacetic acid, on the other hand, accumulated slowly throughout the incubation period. Cell-free preparations preferentially utilize the L-isomer of tryptophan for the synthesis of indoleacetamide and indoleacetic acid. The results of these experiments suggest, therefore, that P. savastanoi synthesizes indoleacetic acid by the following reactions: L-tryptophan--> indoleacetamide-->indoleacetic acid."

Changes in the evoked potentials have been related to perceptual phenomena varying as a function of the interval between flashes. Evoked potentials to paired stimuli, which gave rise to perceptual interactions, could be approximated by algebraic summation of the responses to the stimuli when presented separately."

As seen with the electron microscope it resembles a crystal; moreover, its high degree of birefringence suggests crystallinity. Isolated particles can be caused to emit a luminescent flash that resembles the flash emitted by the dinoflagellate, Gonyaulax polyedra. The particles are referred to as ""scintillons""."

https://openalex.org/W1986949970,Highly inbred strain 2 guinea pigs can produce antibodies to portions of the insulin molecule to which strain 13 guinea pigs cannot produce antibodies. Such differences were not observable within either strain. Consequently it is probable that genetic factors regulate antibody production with respect to the determinant groups toward which antibodies are directed.

https://openalex.org/W1981863472,"Rats receiving occasional brief electric shocks pressed a bar, which caused them to be injected with amobarbital sodium, more frequently than the control rats to which they were yoked and which were injected when their partners pressed but whose own bar activated only a recorder. This differential effect was not shown by pairs run without shocks."

HANAHAN From the Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle 5, Washington (Received for publication, March 11, 1963) Since the discovery by Carter, Smith, and Jones (1) in 1958 that cr-glyceryl ether analogues of phospholipids occur in nature, many other reports of their presence have appeared in the litera- ture (24). Until recently, however, all reported findings in- dicated concentrations of these lipids that were quite low. The work of Hanahan and Watts (5) and of Thompson and Hanahan (6) dealing with the bovine erythrocyte and bovine bone marrow, respectively, shows that in both of these sources the glyceryl ether lipid levels assume significant proportions, making up from 10 to 15 mole per cent of the total phospholipid fraction. In view of these findings it seemed important to investigate other organisms for their glyceryl ether content. This paper presents data showing that two species of terrestrial slug, At-ion ater and Ariolimax columbianus, contain cw-glyceryl ether phos- pholipids in higher levels than have been found in any other form of life."

https://openalex.org/W2060844715,"TRANSOVAJRIAJL passage in ticks has been investigated for several viruses of the tick-borne encephalitis complex. Russian workers have reported that Russian spring–summer encephalitis virus can pass transovarially in Ixodes persulcatus, I. ricinus, Dermacentor silvarum and Haemaphysalis concinna1. Benda2, working with Ixodes ricinus and the European strain of tick-borne encephalitis in Czechoslovakia, demonstrated transovarial transmission in only 6 per cent of ticks, while Smorodintsev3 in the U.S.S.R. reported that it occurred in 5–25 per cent of ticks. In an investigation confirming transovarial transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus in I. ricinus, Rehacek4 found that it occurred in 2 per cent of ticks infected by feeding and in 20 per cent of ticks infected by inoculation after feeding. Laboratory studies with a third member of the complex, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and its vector Haemaphysalis spinigera are reported here."

https://openalex.org/W2022832415,"IT is becoming increasingly clear that if we wish to understand the biological evolution of man we must examine in detail the selective pressures and breeding structures of human populations which are in different stages of cultural development. Crow1 suggested a relatively simple method for measuring selection intensity in man. This communication describes the results obtained with Crow's method collected from among the Caingang Indians living in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil."

https://openalex.org/W2008812906,"The activity of purified deoxycytidylate deaminase obtained from chick-embryo extracts is dependent upon the presence of deoxycytidine triphosphate and magnesium ions. The stability of the enzyme at 37 degrees C is markedly enhanced by deoxycytidine triphosphate, and less so by the other deoxyribonucleotides. The inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate, urea, and deoxythymidine triphosphate, is reversed by deoxycytidine triphosphate. This reversal suggests that the regulation of enzyme activity is effected through configurational changes in the enzyme structure."

https://openalex.org/W2002360735,"A multinucleated endosteum was observed in the long bones of chick embryos aged 14 to 17 days. The endosteum appears to be responsible for extensive bone resorption; the bulk of the diaphyseal bone is almost completely replaced during this particular 3-day interval. Eventually, the endosteum appears to be transformed into numerous individual osteoclasts. Both the endosteum and the osteoclasts are found almost entirely on the medial surfaces of the innermost bone spicules and they seem to destroy collagen by extracellular proteolysis."

Using ion exchange chromatography on ‘Dowex 1’, the dimers of both pyrimidines-2-14C were prepared in chromatographic homogeneous forms. Kecently, it was established by us that thymine dimer is easily split into thymine monomer by irradiation with high-energy electrons4."
https://openalex.org/W2047573398,"In the presence of Ringer's solution containing a high concentration of potassium ions, the incorporation of P32-orthophosphate into adenosine triphosphate and other organophosphates of the desheathed sciatic nerve of the bullfrog was inhibited by more than 75 percent. In calcium-free Ringer's solution containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, the inhibition was about 30 percent. Both solutions depolarized the nerves, and the depolarization probably interfered with the mechanisms of phosphate transfer rather than directly with phosphorylation. The inhibition may have been a consequence of the decreased adsorption of phosphates which occurs at the excitable surface during depolarization."
