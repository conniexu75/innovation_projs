https://openalex.org/W1971589776,"We show that expression of the iso-1-cytochrome c gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CYC1, is tightly regulated by levels of intracellular heme. Expression is reduced at least 200-fold in cells grown under conditions of heme deficiency. Studies on the regulation of a CYC1-lacZ fused gene and direct determination of mRNA levels indicate that this control is transcriptional. Furthermore, we show that the heme regulatory site in the CYC1 promoter region is an upstream activation site (UASc) centered about 275 bp upstream from the region of transcriptional initiation. The latter region is required for optimal transcription and contains three TATA box sequences and six prominent mRNA initiation sites that span 34 bp. Substitution of the UASc with the UAS of the yeast GAL10 gene results in activation of the normal set of CYC1 transcripts. In this case, however, transcription is independent of regulation by heme, suggesting that in the wild-type, heme controls initiation per se and not translation or mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2056744253,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the FBJ-MuSV proviral DNA and the cellular homolog (c-fos) of its oncogene (v-fos) have been determined. The 4026 nucleotide long FBJ-MuSV proviral DNA contains two long terminal repeats, a substitution of 1639 nucleotides of mouse cellular DNA (v-fos) and the 3′ end of the env gene derived from FBJ-MuLV. The sequences of the parental FBJ-MuLV and the cellular c-fos (mouse) gene share five of five nucleotides at the 5′ end and ten of 11 nucleotides at the 3′ end of the v-fos substitution. When compared with the v-fos sequences, the c-fos gene contains four discontinuous regions, three of which are flanked by sequences characteristic of introns. Direct sequence analysis of c-fos (mouse) RNA by primer extension demonstrates that the fourth discontinuity is due to a 104 bp deletion in the v-fos gene. As a consequence of the deletion, the predicted v-fos and c-fos gene products differ at their C termini."

These antibodies were characterized by their ability to immunoprecipitate solubilized receptors labeled with 125I-insulin or 125I-somatomedin-C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of unlabeled insulin or somatomedin-C. alpha IR-1 preferentially immunoprecipitates insulin receptors and also less effectively immunoprecipitates somatomedin-C receptors, while alpha IR-2 and alph IR-3 preferentially immunoprecipitate somatomedin-C receptors, but may also weakly immunoprecipitate insulin receptors. These three monoclonal antibodies, as well as A410, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, were used to immunoprecipitate insulin and somatomedin-C receptors from solubilized human lymphoid (IM-9) cells and human placenta membranes that had been 125I-labeled with lactoperoxidase. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that both receptors are composed of alpha and beta subunits. The beta subunit of the insulin receptor (immunoprecipitated by alpha IR-1 and A410) has a slightly more rapid mobility than the corresponding subunit of the somatomedin-C receptor (immunoprecipitated by alpha IR-2 and alpha IR-3). Interestingly, the alpha subunit of the placenta somatomedin-C receptor has a slightly faster mobility than its counterpart from IM-9 cells. Immunoprecipitation of receptor that had been reduced and denatured to generate isolated subunits indicates that alpha IR-2 and alpha IR-3 interact with the alpha subunit of the somatomedin-C receptor while A410 interacts with both subunits of the insulin receptor. alpha IR-1 failed to react with reduced and denatured receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1506008139,"The richest source of receptors for the organic calcium channel blocker [3H]nitrendipine in muscle is the transverse tubule membrane. The tubular membrane preparation binds [3H]nitrendipine with a high affinity and has a very high number of [3H]nitrendipine binding sites. For example, for the transverse tubule membrane preparation from rabbit muscle, the dissociation constant of the nitrendipine-receptor complex is 1.8 +/- 0.3 nM and the maximum binding capacity Bmax = 50 +/- 6 pmol/mg of protein. Similar results have been found with a membrane preparation from frog muscle. The dissociation constant found at equilibrium is near that determined from the ratio of rate constants for association (kappa 1) and dissociation (kappa-1). Binding of [3H] nitrendipine is pH-dependent and reveals the presence of an essential ionizable group with a pK of 5.4 on the nitrendipine receptor. The binding is destroyed by proteases showing that the receptor is a protein. Three different classes of Ca2+ channel blockers inhibit [3H]nitrendipine to its specific site. (i) The dihydropyridine analogs of nitrendipine which are competitive inhibitors of [3H]nitrendipine. These molecules form tight complexes with the nitrendipine receptor with dissociation constants between 1.4 and 4.0 nM. (ii) Other antiarrhythmic molecules like verapamil, amiodarone, bepridil, and F13004 which are noncompetitive inhibitors of [3H]nitrendipine binding with dissociation constants between 0.2 and 1 microM. (iii) Divalent cations like Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ which are noncompetitive inhibitors of [3H]nitrendipine binding with the following rank order of potency: Ni+ (K0.5 = 1.8 mM) greater than Co2+ (K0.5 = 2.7 mM) greater than Mn2+ (K0.5 = 4.8 mM) greater than Ca2+ (K0.5 = 65 mM)."

https://openalex.org/W1967953985,"Adenosine receptors were made visible on light microscopy by autoradiography with tritiated cyclohexyladenosine. In the cerebellum, adenosine receptors were absent in Weaver mice, which lack granule cells, and were displaced in Reeler mice, which have displacements of granule cells. Thus, adenosine receptors appear to be located on the axon terminals of excitatory granule cells in the cerebellum. Removal of one eye of a rat depleted adenosine receptors in the contralateral superior colliculus, suggesting that the receptors occur on axon terminals of excitatory projections from retinal ganglion cells. The presence of adenosine receptors on excitatory axon terminals may explain synaptic inhibition by adenosine and the behavioral effects of xanthines."

In voltage-clamped larval muscle fibers, Sh affects the transient A current, whereas Eag reduces the delayed rectification and, to a lesser extent, the A current."
https://openalex.org/W2092079970,"In order to investigate the functions of stimulus recognition, signal transduction, and adaptation, the aspartate receptor gene for bacterial chemotaxis in Salmonella typhimurium has been sequenced and modified. A carboxyl-terminal truncated receptor was shown to bind aspartate and to transmit a signal to change motility behavior. However, the truncated receptor showed greatly reduced methyl-accepting capacity, and did not allow adaptation to the sensory stimulation. The separation of receptor functions by alteration of primary structure emphasizes that the receptor is directly involved in adaptation and is not solely a device for transmitting a signal across a membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2075786946,"We studied the dynamics of site-specific recombination by the resolvase encoded by the Escherichia coli transposon Tn3. The pure enzyme recombined supercoiled plasmids containing two directly repeated recombination sites, called res sites. Resolvase is the first strictly site-specific topoisomerase. It relaxed only plasmids containing directly repeated res sites; substrates with zero, one or two inverted sites were inert. Even when the proximity of res sites was ensured by catenation of plasmids with a single site, neither relaxation nor recombination occurred. The two circular products of recombination were catenanes interlinked only once. These properties of resolvase require that the path of the DNA between res sites be clearly defined and that strand exchange occur with a unique geometry. A model in which one subunit of a dimeric resolvase is bound at one res site, while the other searches along adjacent DNA until it encounters the second site, would account for the ability of resolvase to distinguish intramolecular from intermolecular sites, to sense the relative orientation of sites and to produce singly interlinked catenanes. Because resolvase is a type 1 topoisomerase, we infer that it makes the required duplex bDNA breaks of recombination one strand at a time."

Measurements of the ouabain-sensitive QO2 in the presence of nystatin, the tissue sodium and potassium contents of the tubules in suspension, and the sodium- and potassium-dependent adenosinetriphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) activity of lysed tubule membranes indicated that the effect of amiloride was due to a direct inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity of the proximal tubule."

https://openalex.org/W1536669364,"A DNA topoisomerase activity, copurifying with poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase from calf thymus, is greater than 95% inhibited if extensive poly(ADP-ribosylation) is allowed to occur. The inhibited DNA topoisomerase, which has drastically different elution properties on hydroxylapatite, can be reactivated by mild alkaline treatment. These results are consistent with a poly(ADP-ribosylation) of the DNA topoisomerase and covalent attachment of the poly(ADP-ribose) moieties to the topoisomerase by alkali-labile bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1561974014,"BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts have an amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake mechanism which is hardly detectable under normal physiological conditions. The activity of this Na+ transport system can be increased to a large extent by treatments that decrease the internal pH such as loss of intracellular NH4+ as NH3 or incubation with nigericin in the presence of a low external K+ concentration. These treatments have made possible an analysis of the interaction of the Na+/H+ antiport with amiloride and of the external pH dependence of the system. The addition of fetal bovine serum to quiescent 3T3 cells stimulates the initial rate of the amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake by only 50%. However, after treatment of the cells with ammonia or nigericin, serum produces a 40-fold stimulation of the rate of the amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake. Control experiments show that serum does not stimulate the activity of the Na+/H+ antiport by an indirect mechanism involving a depolarization of the membrane or a modification of the internal Ca2+ concentration. It is suggested that some serum component directly interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger to modify its catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1969030789,"The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) frequently causes death by predisposing the host to acute infections by other pathogens rather than by inducing leukemia. In a previous study, cats infected with FeLV were found to have prolonged homograft rejection responses but there was no evidence that the humoral immune response was impaired. In the present study, the humoral response to the synthetic multichain polypeptide (L-tyrosine-L-glutamic acid)-poly-DL-alanine-poly-L-lysine, denoted (T.G)AL, was found to be significantly depressed in healthy cats that were naturally infected with FeLV compared to uninfected controls. In cats with persistent FeLV viremia the major antibody response to (T.G)AL, normally seen at days 9 to 14 after immunization, was both delayed and greatly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2088533484,"A synthetic analog of bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH), [tyrosine-34] bPTH-(7-34)NH2, was found to inhibit parathyroid hormone action in vivo. When the analog and parathyroid hormone were infused simultaneously to rats at a molar ratio of 200 to 1, the analog inhibited the excretion of urinary phosphate and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. When infused alone at the same dose rate, the analog was devoid of agonist activity. The compound was prepared by following design principles developed for inhibitors of parathyroid hormone, and is believed to be the first antagonist of parathyroid hormone that is effective in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2078667630,"Avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) induces both erythroblastosis and fibrosarcomas in susceptible birds. A locus, v-erbB, within the viral genome has been implicated in AEV-mediated oncogenesis. We report here the detection and partial characterization of the protein product of the v-erbB oncogene in AEV-transformed cells. We obtained the antisera necessary for our analysis by expressing a portion of the molecularly cloned v-erbB locus in Escherichia coli and immunizing rabbits with the resulting bacterial erbB polypeptide. Antisera directed against the bacterial polypeptide reacted with v-erbB proteins obtained from virus-infected avian cells. By three criteria--tunicamycin inhibition, lectin binding and metabolic labeling with radioactive sugar precursors--the product of the v-erbB gene appears to be a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1483645952,"Human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) binds specifically and with high affinity to receptors on the surface of cultured fibroblasts (GM-258). At 37 degrees C about 50% of the receptor-bound IFN-gamma was rapidly internalized (t 1/2 = 4-5 min) by these cells. Following an initial lag of 15-30 min, internalized IFN-gamma was continuously degraded over a period of at least 8 h. The total uptake of IFN-gamma over this time period was found to exceed by 5 times the number of occupied IFN receptors present on the surface of these cells, suggesting that either there is a large intracellular pool of IFN-gamma receptors, or that receptors are recycled during the course of incubation. Cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml) inhibited uptake only after the first 2 h of incubation and then only moderately. It is therefore unlikely that de novo receptor synthesis plays a major role in the observed uptake process. Both sodium azide (15 mM) and methylamine (20 mM) inhibited both the uptake and degradation of IFN-gamma at all times up to 6 h. While uptake was only slightly reduced in the presence of chloroquine (25 microM), degradation was markedly inhibited, suggesting that degradation occurs intracellularly, probably within lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1567035837,"A subcellular particulate fraction from normal neutrophils that was enriched in NADPH-dependent O-.2-generating activity (Gabig, T. G., Schervish, E. W., and Santinga, J. T. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4114-4119) has been further characterized. This preparation contained 0.25 +/- 0.02 nmol of flavin adenine dinucleotide/mg of protein and 0.28 +/- 0.01 nmol of cytochrome b/mg of protein. Measurable amounts of riboflavin or flavin mononucleotide were not present. The flavoprotein was completely resolved from the cytochrome b by selective bile salt extraction of the particulate oxidase fraction. The identical subcellular particulate fraction was studied in the neutrophils from two male patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The neutrophil oxidase fraction from one of the chronic granulomatous disease patients had a cytochrome b component that was spectrally abnormal, but a normal content of flavin adenine dinucleotide. The fraction from this patient's neutrophils corresponding to the resolved flavoprotein from normal cells had fluorescence excitation and emission spectra that were identical to the normal flavoprotein. The neutrophil oxidase fraction from the second chronic granulomatous disease patient had a quantitatively and spectrally normal cytochrome b but less than 8% of the normal amount of flavin adenine dinucleotide. The fraction from the latter patient's neutrophils corresponding to the resolved flavoprotein from normal cells had no detectable flavoprotein by fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy. It is postulated that these two patients represent distinct mutants in two separate components of the neutrophil NADPH-dependent O-.2-generating oxidase system, flavoprotein and cytochrome b."

This transforming gene was identified as the activated homolog of the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus onc gene, v-kis. The finding that a defined carcinogen reproducibly leads to activation of kis as a transforming gene should be of value in elucidating the role of oncogenes in the neoplastic process."
https://openalex.org/W1591608688,"Rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase was phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP plus fructose-6-P or [2-32P]fructose-2,6-P2. The radioactivity co-migrated with homogeneous 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase during sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc gel electrophoresis and the phosphoenzyme was acid-labile and base-stable. Hydrolysis of the phosphate group from phosphoenzyme prepared with either donor and the hydrolysis of their tryptic phosphopeptides depended on pH similarly. The pH dependence suggested that phosphate was linked to the N3 of a histidine residue. Co-electrophoresis and co-chromatography of alkaline hydrolysates of the labeled phosphoenzyme prepared from either substrate allowed the definitive identification of 3-phosphohistidine in the degradation products. Modification of the enzyme with diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated both the phosphotransferase and phosphohydrolase activities and suppressed the phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP and fructose-6-P or by fructose-2,6-P2. Trypsin digestion of the phosphoenzyme formed upon incubation with ATP or fructose-2,6-P2 yielded an identical phosphopeptide after high pressure liquid chromatography. All the above data are consistent with this enzyme catalyzing both phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase reactions with the mediation of phosphohistidine in the reaction scheme(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1547148420,"A new fluorescent intracellular pH indicator is described (quene 1) which is related to the tetracarboxylate Ca2+ indicator based on the quinoline fluorophor (quin 2). Quene 1 has excitation and emission maxima at 390 and 530 nm, respectively, and shows a 30-fold increase in fluorescence between pH 5 and 9 with a pK alpha of 7.3. The fluorescence is insensitive to Ca2+ and Mg2+ at free concentrations up to 10(-4) M and to the proportions of Na+ and K+ at total concentrations of Na+ and K+ from 100 to 200 mM. The indicator is loaded into thymocytes using the tetraacetoxymethyl ester derivative which is hydrolyzed in the cells to give the tetracarboxylate anion. Intracellular pH can be measured at intracellular quene 1 concentrations of approximately 0.1 mM and quene 1 does not perturb glycolysis or the ATP level in resting cells at concentrations up to 0.8 mM. The intracellular pH of mouse thymocytes indicated by quene 1 is 7.15 +/- 0.04 and it is insensitive to the concentration of Ca2+ or Mg2+ in the extracellular medium. The intracellular pH decreased when the pH of the medium was lowered by addition of HCl, but was insensitive to NaOH at extracellular pH values up to 8.0. Rapid transient changes in intracellular pH are induced by NH4Cl, NaCO2CH3, or HCO3-/CO2. The thymocytes showed no early changes (within 30 min) in intracellular pH in response to mitogenic concentrations of lectins or 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2117100593,"Antibodies prepared against chemically synthesized peptides predicted from the DNA sequence have been used to detect human mitochondrial gene products. In particular, antibodies directed against either the NH2-terminal decapeptide or the COOH-terminal undecapeptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) were both very effective in immunoprecipitating the previously identified COII polypeptide from an SDS lysate of mitochondria from HeLa cells. Similarly, antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal nonapeptide of the putative polypeptide encoded in the unidentified reading frame A6L, which overlaps the ATPase 6 gene, immunoprecipitated specifically a component (#25) of the HeLa cell mitochondrial translation products; antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal octa-peptide also precipitated protein 25, although less efficiently. The size of protein 25, as estimated from its electrophoretic mobility, is compatible with its being the unidentified reading frame A6L product. Furthermore, a fingerprinting analysis of this protein after trypsin digestion has given results consistent with this identification."
https://openalex.org/W1655422738,"The human insulin gene or the corresponding cDNA has been inserted into the early region of a simian virus 40 vector in which all SV40 splice junctions were deleted while the early promoter and polyadenylation regions remained intact. The expression of insulin-coding sequences was tested in permissive monkey COS cells. The insulin cDNA was transcribed from the early promoter to produce a stable polyadenylated RNA which was translated, and immunoreactive human proinsulin accumulated in the medium. Thus RNA splicing is not obligatory for insulin expression in this system. The genomic insulin transcript was also initiated from the SV40 promoter and terminated at the SV40 polyadenylation site. S1 endonuclease mapping revealed that the transcript is processed via two alternative splicing pathways within the insulin gene. About one-third of the total transcripts are processed normally with removal of the two insulin-specific introns. This transcript is apparently translated normally since immunoreactive proinsulin accumulates in the medium. About two-thirds of the transcripts are processed via an alternative splicing pathway involving a new splice acceptor site located within the coding region of the insulin gene. This results in a codon frameshift such that translation would produce a novel chimeric peptide containing the insulin NH2-terminal B chain, but a different COOH terminus containing human and SV40 sequences. A peptide of the predicted size is detected in the COS cell extract."
https://openalex.org/W1594234105,"[adenine-U-14C]ADP-ribose-agmatine and [adenine-U-14C ))ADP-ribose-histone were synthesized by an NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase from [14C]NAD and agmatine and histone, respectively. The pseudo-first order rate constants for breakdown of the two components either in 0.4 N NaOH or in 0.4 M neutral hydroxylamine were identical. Hydroxylamine treatment of [14C]ADP-ribose-agmatine or [32P]ADP-ribose-histone yielded a single radioactive product which was separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and identified as ADP-ribose-hydroxamate by the formation of a ferric chloride complex. Hydrolysis of ADP-ribose-hydroxamate with snake venom phosphodiesterase resulted in the formation of 5'-AMP, consistent with the presence of a pyrophosphate bond. Incubation of ADP-ribose-[14C]agmatine, synthesized by the ADP-ribosyltransferase from NAD and [14C]agmatine, with 0.4 M neutral hydroxylamine resulted in the release of [14C]agmatine rather than phosphoribosyl[14C]agmatine. In addition, neither NAD nor ADP-ribose reacts with hydroxylamine; i.e. there was no evidence of nucleophilic attack by hydroxylamine at the pyrophosphate bond. The ADP-ribosyl-protein linkage formed by the NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase is considerably more stable to hydroxylamine than is the ADP-ribose-glutamate bond. The presence of ADP-ribose-arginine and ADP-ribose-glutamate synthesized by the ADP-ribosyltransferase and poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, respectively, may be the chemical basis for the hydroxylamine-stable and hydroxylamine-labile bonds described by Hilz (Hilz, H. (1981) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 362, 1415-1425)."
https://openalex.org/W1495650500,"The adenylate cyclase-coupled beta 2-adrenergic receptor of the frog erythrocyte has served as a useful model system for elucidating the mechanisms of catecholamine-induced densensitization. In this system, it has been previously demonstrated that agonist-induced refractoriness is associated with sequestration of the beta-adrenergic receptors in vesicles away from the cell surface and from their effector unit, the adenylate cyclase system (Stadel, J.M., Strulovici, B., Nambi, P., Lavin, T.N., Briggs, M.M., Caron, M.G., and Lefkowitz, R.J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3032-3038). These internalized beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be structurally intact as assessed by photoaffinity labeling, but their functional status has previously been unknown. In the present studies, we sought to assess the functionality of the sequestered vesicular receptors by fusing them to Xenopus laevis erythrocytes. This cell is suitable for such studies, since it has almost no detectable beta-adrenergic receptor or catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, but contains prostaglandin E1-stimulable adenylate cyclase. Fusion of beta-adrenergic receptor-containing vesicles from desensitized frog erythrocytes with X. laevis erythrocytes results in a 30-fold stimulation of the hybrid adenylate cyclase by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. This effect was entirely blocked by the beta-antagonist propranolol. The catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity established in the vesicle-Xenopus hybrids showed the characteristic agonist potency series of the donor frog erythrocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Fusion of vesicles from desensitized frog erythrocytes in which the beta-adrenergic receptors had been inactivated with the group specific reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or of vesicles derived from control frog erythrocytes, which contain low amounts of beta-adrenergic receptor, did not establish catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in the hybrids. These data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptors internalized during desensitization retain their functionality when recoupled to an adenylate cyclase system from a different source. The functional uncoupling of these receptors during desensitization is thus more likely due to their sequestration away from the other components of the adenylate cyclase than to any alterations in the receptors themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1591537023,"In previous studies from this laboratory (Yu, M.W., Tolson, N. W., and Guroff, G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10481-10492) nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 cells was shown to increase the phosphorylation of a specific nonhistone nuclear protein. In the present work these whole-cell observations have been pursued and a cell-free system developed, based on the detergent treatment devised by Lenk et al. (Lenk, R., Ransom, L., Kaufmann, Y., and Penman, S. (1977) Cell 10, 67-78), in order to explore the nerve growth factor-sensitive phosphorylation system in biochemical detail. Using this preparation it has been shown that treatment of the whole cells with nerve growth factor for 30 min or more leads to a marked increase in the subsequent cell-free phosphorylation of the same nonhistone nuclear protein. A characterization of this phosphorylation indicates that it is quite labile to heat and to structural disruption, that it prefers ATP as phosphate donor, and that it requires Mg2+, but is inhibited by high Mg2+ levels as well as by certain other divalent cations. The site of phosphorylation appears to be on serine residues of the protein, as was the phosphorylation observed previously in whole cells. The use of various inhibitors and stimulators suggests that the kinase catalyzing this phosphorylation is not cAMP-dependent, nor is it similar to protein kinase C or casein kinase. The increased phosphorylation produced by nerve growth factor is not transient, the stimulation being constant for at least 3 days in the continuous presence of nerve growth factor. Increases in the phosphorylation of the same nuclear protein can be seen upon treatment of the cells with other effectors such as epidermal growth factor and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the latter in spite of the fact that cAMP-dependence could not be established in the cell-free system. Finally, a similar system, with a similar stimulation of phosphorylation due to nerve growth factor treatment, can be prepared from sympathetic ganglia from neonatal animals."
https://openalex.org/W1569794721,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is phosphorylated in vitro by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation reaction incorporates 1 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme and is greatly stimulated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate acts upon fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, not on the protein kinase. The phosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase lowers its activity by about 50%. The characteristics of the phosphorylation reaction in vitro show that this modification is responsible for the inactivation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1538597108,"We assessed the roles of intrabacterial catalase and superoxide dismutase in the resistance of Escherichia coli to killing by neutrophils. E. coli in which the synthesis of superoxide dismutase and catalase were induced by paraquat 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively, did not resist killing by neutrophils. When bacteria were allowed to recover from the toxicity of paraquat for 1 h on ice and for 30 min at 37 degrees C, they still failed to resist killing by neutrophils. Induction of the synthesis of catalase 9-fold by growth in the presence of phenazine methosulfate did not render E. coli resistant to killing by either neutrophils or by H2O2 itself. The lack of protection by intrabacterial catalase from killing by neutrophils could not be attributed to an impermeable bacterial membrane; the evolution of O2 from H2O2 was no less rapid in suspensions of E. coli than in lysates. The failure of intrabacterial catalase or superoxide dismutase to protect bacteria from killing by neutrophils might indicate either that the flux of O-2 and H2O2 in the phagosome is too great for the intrabacterial enzymes to alter or that the site of injury is at the bacterial surface."

Plastocyanin, a protein having a negative charge of about -7, yields a bimolecular rate constant with native ferrocytochrome c of 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 S-1, which decreases with the modified cytochromes c to a minimum of 7.5 x 10(5) M-1 S-1 for the CDNP-lysine 13 derivative. Conversely azurin, a protein with an overall negative charge of only about -1 to -2, exhibits bimolecular rate constants with native ferrocytochrome c of 6.6 x 10(3) M-1 S-1 at pH 6.1 and 4.0 x 10(3) M-1 S-1 at pH 8.6, which increase upon modification of the cytochrome c to a maximum of 4.1 x 10(4) M-1 S-1 at pH 6.1 and 2.7 x 10(4) M-1 S-1 at pH 8.6, for the CDNP-cytochrome c modified at lysine 72. This behavior indicates that: 1) the reaction of cytochrome c occurs at a negatively charged site on plastocyanin, whereas azurin behaves as a positively charged reactant, the electrostatics governing to a large extent the relative reactivities of the modified cytochromes c; 2) in both cases the interaction domain on cytochrome c is located on the front surface of the protein and encompasses the solvent accessible edge of the heme prosthetic group, as is the case for all the reactions of cytochrome c with its mitochondrial protein redox partners, as well as for small inorganic redox complexes; and 3) the bimolecular rate constants for plastocyanin and azurin are orders of magnitude slower and the effects of lysine modifications far smaller than for the reactions with physiological systems, indicating that: (a) the electric fields generated by the reactants do not align them, prior to electron transfer, as effectively as for the physiological reaction partners of cytochrome c; and (b) there is an absence of a precise molecular fit between cytochrome c and the nonphysiological redox partners."
https://openalex.org/W1530332895,"We have isolated the structural genes for methionyl-tRNA synthetase (L-methionine:tRNAMet ligase, EC 6.1.1.10) and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (L-isoleucine:tRNAIle ligase, EC 6.1.1.5) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by transformation. Both genes exist in a single copy in the yeast genome and show no homology to either yeast mitochondrial or Escherichia coli DNA as judged by Southern analysis. The region corresponding to the DNA segment altered in mes1 or ils1-1 mutants was defined by transformation of synthetase mutants with subclones of the respective gene. Although the isolated fragment containing the methionyl-tRNA synthetase gene complements the mes1 mutation in yeast, it does not complement the analogous metG mutation in E. coli. A single transcript of about 3100 nucleotides codes for the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. This transcript is about 2-fold elevated in strains starved for isoleucine, histidine, or arginine as compared to wild type. It is regulated by the general control of amino acid biosynthesis, which affects several biosynthetic pathways. Two polyadenylated transcripts are homologous to the methionyl-tRNA synthetase gene. The major MES1 transcript is not affected by the general control or starvation for several different amino acids, including methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1518808888,"This report describes quantitative results of in vitro phosphorylation of the Rous sarcoma virus transforming gene product, pp60src, using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors. The Km values for the phosphorylation of pp60src by ATP and GTP were similar (10-36 and 25-36 microM, respectively) and the Vmax values were different (5-7 and 1.5-1.7 nmol min-1 mg-1 of pp60src, respectively). The radiolabeling of pp60src by [gamma-32P] ATP was inhibited by ADP and dATP at 20-fold higher concentrations by 75 and 83%, respectively. Other nucleotides served as weaker inhibitors under the same conditions. The radiolabeling of pp60src by [gamma-32P]GTP had lower specificity for this nucleotide, since ATP, dATP, ADP, dGTP, GDP, and TTP had at least a 50% inhibitory effect. The phosphorylated products of approximate Mr = 60,000 that were produced with ATP or GTP were shown to be the same protein molecule since they both could be immunoprecipitated with antibody raised against p60src produced by bacterial recombinants. Structural analysis revealed that the use of GTP resulted in phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on the COOH-terminal region of pp60src, apparently the same site which contains the tyrosine phosphorylated in infected cells. In contrast, the use of ATP resulted in phosphorylation of several additional tyrosine residues on the NH2-terminal region of the molecule. In thermolability studies, the t1/2 values for the phosphorylation of pp66src in preparations from wild type virus-infected chicken cells were 5.1 min for both ATP and GTP, whereas the t1/2 values for the phosphorylation of pp60src in preparations from temperature-sensitive transformation mutant-infected cells were 1.1 min for both phosphate donors. Similar observations were found with alpha-casein as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1606122936,"Amines with local anesthetic activity are typically also noncompetitive inhibitors of the agonist-induced increase in cation permeability mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Quinacrine is such an agent, and we have synthesized tritiated quinacrine mustard, a derivative capable of reacting with nucleophiles. Quinacrine mustard was reacted with receptor-rich membrane from torpedo electric tissue, excess reagent was removed by partition into liposomes, and the modified receptor was extracted and reconstituted with exogenous phospholipid. After reaction of the native membrane with 10 microM quinacrine mustard for 5 min, binding of cobratoxin to the acetylcholine binding sites is inhibited 15%; in contrast, receptor-mediated 86Rb uptake in the reconstituted vesicles is inhibited 70%. When the reaction with quinacrine mustard is carried out in the presence of 10 microM carbamylcholine or 10 microM d-tubocurarine, there is no block of the acetylcholine binding sites; nevertheless, the inhibition of Rb uptake is greater than that resulting from reaction in the absence of acetylcholine binding site ligands. Conversely, when the reaction is carried out in the presence of either 100 microM quinacrine or 100 microM proadifen (also a potent noncompetitive inhibitor), either with or without carbamylcholine or d-tubocurarine, the inhibition of 86Rb uptake is about 70% smaller. Under the same conditions that we used in the functional studies, quinacrine mustard reacts with the four types of chains that constitute the receptor complex, alpha 2 beta gamma delta. The presence of the acetylcholine binding site ligands, however, results in increased reaction with the alpha and beta chains, while the presence of the noncompetitive inhibitors, with or without the acetylcholine binding site ligands, results in decreased reaction with the alpha and beta chains. We conclude that the alpha and beta chains contribute to one or more functionally significant binding sites for noncompetitively inhibiting amines."
https://openalex.org/W1486510394,"Abstract The kinetics of oxidation of eight different singly substituted 4-carboxy-2,6-dinitrophenyl (CDNP) horse ferrocytochromes c, modified at lysine 7, 13, 25, 27, 60, 72, 86, or 87, and of one trinitrophenyl horse ferrocytochrome c, modified at lysine 13, by the 3- and 3+ inorganic complexes hexacyanoferrate(III) (Fe(CN)6(3-) ) and tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) (Co(phen)3(3+) ) have been characterized. The influence of the modified residues on the bimolecular rate constants for these reactions define the protein molecular surface involved. The site of electron exchange for both oxidants appears to be the solvent accessible edge of the heme prosthetic group or a closely related structure on the front surface of the molecule. The reaction with Fe(CN)6(3-) is most strongly influenced by modification of lysine 72, a residue to the left of the exposed heme edge. (CDNP lysine 72 cytochrome c yields a 3.6-fold decrease in the bimolecular rate constant, as compared to that for the native protein.) However, it is the region around lysine 27, to the right of the heme edge, that is most influential in the reaction with Co(phen)3(3+). (CDNP-lysine 27 cytochrome c exhibits a 7.3-fold increase in the rate constant, as compared to that for the native protein.) The kinetics of reaction of the CDNP-lysine 13, 60, 72, and 87 modified cytochromes c with Fe(CN)5(4-aminopyridine)2- as oxidant and Fe(CN)5(4-aminopyridine)3- and Fe(CN)5-(imidazole)3- as reductants have also been determined and further illustrate the influence of electrostatics on the kinetics of such protein-small molecule electron exchanges."

https://openalex.org/W1494505996,"Rat aldolase B mRNA was partially purified from liver polysomes by an immunochemical technique followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. Double-stranded cDNA, synthesized from this mRNA, was inserted into the PstI site of plasmid pBR322 employing the oligo(dC)-oligo(dG) tailing method. Clones containing aldolase B cDNA inserts were selected by colony hybridization using 32P-labeled purified mRNA as a specific probe. Several recombinant plasmids containing 600 to 1000 base pair inserts were isolated. Hybrid selection-translation experiments showed that they hybridize specifically with aldolase B mRNA. By overlapping restriction maps of several individual cDNA inserts, it was found that they spanned 1200 base pairs, which represented about 70% of the aldolase B mRNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was then determined and the sequence of 180 amino acids from the COOH terminus and the entire 3' untranslatable nucleotide sequence were clarified. Although the complete amino acid sequence of rat aldolase B has not yet been reported, it was found that several amino acids neighboring the COOH-terminal tyrosine obtained by carboxypeptidase digestion completely coincided with those determined from the cDNA sequence; i.e. -Ser-Leu-Phe-Thr-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Thr-Tyr. Furthermore, a putative active site peptide appeared and is extensively homologous to those of rabbit aldolases A and B."
https://openalex.org/W2114440601,"The termini of the 61 kb palindromic rDNA molecules of Physarum polycephalum possess a series of multiple inverted repeats in which are located specific single-strand gaps and tightly attached protein. After treating rDNA with S1 nuclease, we have cloned several 5 kb Eco RI terminal restriction fragments. Sequencing of more than 800 nucleotides from the end of one such clone reveals the presence of six to ten tandemly repeated units averaging 140 +/- 4 bp in length and flanked by Hae III sites. Each 140 nucleotide repeat unit can form thermodynamically stable hairpin structures based on complex internal palindromic components. When the specific gap sequence CCCTA is present, it is located near the apex of a hairpin component. These secondary structures are formed in growing plasmodia, as seen in electron micrographs of native rDNA molecules, which also reveal apparent recombination forms involving rDNA ends and noncontiguous DNA segments. Recombination initiated at terminal single-strand hairpin loops can result in genetic exchange of ribosomal gene sequences and can lead to completion of 5' nucleotide sequences at ends of newly replicated rDNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1529481244,"The relationship of protein glycosylation to compartmentalization and processing of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) glycoproteins has been examined in M1.54, a cloned line of MTV-infected rat hepatoma tissue culture cells. Previous work established that full maturation of MTV glycoproteins in this cell line requires dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid (Firestone, G. L., Payvar, F., and Yamamoto, K. R. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 300, 221-225). The ability to regulate production of the full complement of five mature membrane-associated and secreted viral glycoproteins from one initially synthesized precursor has been used to advantage in the present work. At concentrations of tunicamycin that specifically inhibit N-linked protein glycosylation, incorporation of [35S]methionine into total cellular and secreted protein is not detectably affected, MTV-specific mRNAs are produced normally, and the nonglycosylated form of the glycosylated viral precursor polyprotein accumulates within the cells. However, tunicamycin inhibits the site-specific cleavage of the glycosylated polyprotein and distribution of MTV polypeptides to the cell surface and extracellular fractions. Thus, when tunicamycin-treated cultures of M1.54 are exposed to dexamethasone and [35S]methionine, no labeled viral antigens are detected in the culture medium. Similarly, tunicamycin prevents the appearance of membrane-associated viral antigens that can be labeled externally by lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination and it protects the cells against the cytolytic effects of MTV-specific antiserum and complement. Taken together, these results are consistent with the view that while glycosylation of some proteins may be unessential for their compartmentalization and processing, it does appear to be correlated with proper maturation of others. The hormone-dependent maturation of MTV glycoproteins in M1.54 may be particularly useful for study of this latter class since glycosylation is stringently associated with their compartmentalization and cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1506116019,"The first component of human complement (C1) was reconstituted from equimolar concentrations of its purified subunits C1q, C1r, and C1s, in the presence of each of nine different metal ions for the purpose of studying the qualitative and quantitative nature of the metal ion requirement for C1 assembly and function. For C1 reconstituted with each metal ion, three assays characteristic of C1 were performed as follows: (1) spontaneous C1 activation in the absence of the regulatory protein C1-inhibitor was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis by simultaneously quantifying the specific proteolysis of the C1r and C1s subunits; (2) C1 activation induced by aggregated IgG in the presence of C1 inhibitor was similarly analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (3) formation of 16 S macromolecular C1 was determined in the analytical ultracentrifuge. For all experiments, trace metal contaminants were removed from buffers and proteins. All divalent cations tested from the first transition period of the periodic table (i.e. Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) effectively mediated the formation of functional macromolecular C1. Dose curves showed maximal C1 assembly and activation at ion concentrations of 30 to 50 microM for each of the above metal ions. However, when ion concentrations were increased above 50 microM, C1 assembly and activation became inhibited. The further to the right in the periodic table, the better inhibitor was the metal ion. Competition experiments indicated that the ion binding sites mediating inhibition are distinct from those promoting activation. Other metal ions that also effectively mediated C1 assembly and function were Cd2+ and Tb3+; however, Mg2+ and Ba2+ were ineffective. All metal ions that mediated C1 assembly and activation also promoted C2 consumption by C1 in normal human serum treated with aggregated IgG. In conclusion, the assembly and function of C1 can be mediated by numerous metal ions. In direct opposition to accepted theory, there is no specific requirement for calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1509415305,"What appears to be a mediator of insulin action has been successfully produced in rat adipocytes plasma membrane upon its treatment with insulin at concentrations of 50-200 microunits/ml. This apparent mediator, when isolated and presented to adipocyte cells, mimics insulin action in the lowering of hormonally stimulated cAMP levels as well as in stimulating lipogenesis and antilipolysis. The cAMP-lowering activity of such a mediator can be quantitated as insulin-activity equivalents. Insulin at 200 microunits/ml causes, in terms of insulin-activity equivalents, a generation of as much as 50 times more of insulin mediator. The magnitude of amplification is even greater when the amount of insulin bound to its receptor is taken into account in this calculation. The action of insulin in the generation of cAMP-lowering mediator is abolished by the insulin antibody. Inactive insulin analogs do not effectively generate such a mediator activity. On the other hand, while the cAMP-lowering action of insulin shown in the bioassay system is completely inhibited by the insulin antibody, the action of such a mediator is only slightly inhibited by the same antibody. The mediator has a low molecular weight and attributes that resemble a peptide. It can be separated from insulin in a Sephadex G-25 column and has a molecular size smaller than the insulin A-chain but larger than ATP. The molecular weight of this mediator is similar to the insulin mediators isolated by other investigators. In view of the fact that it is small in size and mimics several actions of insulin when used in extracellular situations, its theoretical, as well as practical, implications are substantial."
https://openalex.org/W1561441276,"The functional regions of the human insulin gene have been characterized by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The locations of the insulin promoter and cap site have been predicted from the sequence of the gene, and these assignments are consistent with the results of in vitro transcription experiments using HeLa cell extracts. For studies of intracellular expression, the human insulin gene including its promoter and two intervening sequences was inserted into the late region of the virus, SV40, in a construction that eliminates the major splice junction of the late SV40 region. Permissive CV1 monkey kidney cells were infected with this recombinant and a complementing helper virus. During the course of the infection, insulin gene transcripts accumulate at about one-third the level of SV40 late transcripts originated from the same promoter. Analysis of the RNAs containing insulin sequences showed that the insulin introns are excised with precision. Furthermore, the insulin promoter (cap site) and polyadenylation sites are recognized but are less efficiently employed than the viral late promoter and terminator. The mRNA is translated and immunoreactive human proinsulin is secreted into the extracellular medium."

Because one of the antiserums is directed to a tumor-specific surface antigen of HeLa cells, it appears that VSV specifically acquires such antigens during its passage through human tumor cells."
