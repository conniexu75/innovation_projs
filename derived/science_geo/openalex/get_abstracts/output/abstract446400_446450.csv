https://openalex.org/W2016991737,"SWI/SNF is a multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complex that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to reposition nucleosomes, thereby modulating gene expression. Accumulating evidence suggests that SWI/SNF functions as a tumor suppressor in some cancers. However, the spectrum of SWI/SNF mutations across human cancers has not been systematically investigated. Here, we mined whole-exome sequencing data from 24 published studies representing 669 cases from 18 neoplastic diagnoses. SWI/SNF mutations were widespread across diverse human cancers, with an excess of deleterious mutations, and an overall frequency approaching TP53 mutation. Mutations occurred most commonly in the SMARCA4 enzymatic subunit, and in subunits thought to confer functional specificity (ARID1A, ARID1B, PBRM1, and ARID2). SWI/SNF mutations were not mutually-exclusive of other mutated cancer genes, including TP53 and EZH2 (both previously linked to SWI/SNF). Our findings implicate SWI/SNF as an important but under-recognized tumor suppressor in diverse human cancers, and provide a key resource to guide future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2124633704,"Neutrophils are characterized by their distinct nuclear shape, which is thought to facilitate the transit of these cells through pore spaces less than one-fifth of their diameter. We used human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells as a model system to investigate the effect of nuclear shape in whole cell deformability. We probed neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells lacking expression of lamin B receptor, which fail to develop lobulated nuclei during granulopoiesis and present an in vitro model for Pelger-Huët anomaly; despite the circular morphology of their nuclei, the cells passed through micron-scale constrictions on similar timescales as scrambled controls. We then investigated the unique nuclear envelope composition of neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells, which may also impact their deformability; although lamin A is typically down-regulated during granulopoiesis, we genetically modified HL-60 cells to generate a subpopulation of cells with well defined levels of ectopic lamin A. The lamin A-overexpressing neutrophil-type cells showed similar functional characteristics as the mock controls, but they had an impaired ability to pass through micron-scale constrictions. Our results suggest that levels of lamin A have a marked effect on the ability of neutrophils to passage through micron-scale constrictions, whereas the unusual multilobed shape of the neutrophil nucleus is less essential."
https://openalex.org/W2008912793,"Abnormal use-dependent synaptic plasticity is universally accepted as the main physiological correlate of memory deficits in neurodegenerative disorders. It is unclear whether synaptic plasticity deficits take place during neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In EAE mice, we found significant alterations of synaptic plasticity rules in the hippocampus. When compared to control mice, in fact, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induction was favored over long-term depression (LTD) in EAE, as shown by a significant rightward shift in the frequency–synaptic response function. Notably, LTP induction was also enhanced in hippocampal slices from control mice following interleukin-1β (IL-1β) perfusion, and both EAE and IL-1β inhibited GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) without affecting glutamatergic transmission and AMPA/NMDA ratio. EAE was also associated with selective loss of GABAergic interneurons and with reduced gamma-frequency oscillations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Finally, we provided evidence that microglial activation in the EAE hippocampus was associated with IL-1β expression, and hippocampal slices from control mice incubated with activated microglia displayed alterations of GABAergic transmission similar to those seen in EAE brains, through a mechanism dependent on enhanced IL-1β signaling. These data may yield novel insights into the basis of cognitive deficits in EAE and possibly of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2057381259,"The brain is assumed to be a sterile organ in the absence of disease although the impact of immune disruption is uncertain in terms of brain microbial diversity or quantity. To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with α-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV- and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1−/− mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1−/− mice revealed a preponderance of α-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, α-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain’s microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into naïve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2001343915,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading fatal infectious diseases. The development of TB vaccines has been recognized as a major public health priority by the World Health Organization. In this study, three candidate antigens, ESAT-6 (6 kDa early secretory antigenic target) and Mtb72F (a fusion polyprotein from two TB antigens, Mtb32 and Mtb39) fused with cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) and LipY (a cell wall protein) were expressed in tobacco and/or lettuce chloroplasts to facilitate bioencapsulation/oral delivery. Site-specific transgene integration into the chloroplast genome was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In transplastomic leaves, CTB fusion proteins existed in soluble monomeric or multimeric forms of expected sizes and their expression levels varied depending upon the developmental stage and time of leaf harvest, with the highest-level of accumulation in mature leaves harvested at 6PM. The CTB-ESAT6 and CTB-Mtb72F expression levels reached up to 7.5% and 1.2% of total soluble protein respectively in mature tobacco leaves. Transplastomic CTB-ESAT6 lettuce plants accumulated up to 0.75% of total leaf protein. Western blot analysis of lyophilized lettuce leaves stored at room temperature for up to six months showed that the CTB-ESAT6 fusion protein was stable and preserved proper folding, disulfide bonds and assembly into pentamers for prolonged periods. Also, antigen concentration per gram of leaf tissue was increased 22 fold after lyophilization. Hemolysis assay with purified CTB-ESAT6 protein showed partial hemolysis of red blood cells and confirmed functionality of the ESAT-6 antigen. GM1-binding assay demonstrated that the CTB-ESAT6 fusion protein formed pentamers to bind with the GM1-ganglioside receptor. The expression of functional Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in transplastomic plants should facilitate development of a cost-effective and orally deliverable TB booster vaccine with potential for long-term storage at room temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of expression of TB vaccine antigens in chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2089792179,"The Drosophila fat body is a liver- and adipose-like tissue that stores fat and serves as a detoxifying and immune responsive organ. We have previously shown that a high sugar diet leads to elevated hemolymph glucose and systemic insulin resistance in developing larvae and adults. Here, we used stable isotope tracer feeding to demonstrate that rearing larvae on high sugar diets impaired the synthesis of esterified fatty acids from dietary glucose. Fat body lipid profiling revealed changes in both carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acid substituents, particularly in stored triglycerides. We tested the role of the fat body in larval tolerance of caloric excess. Our experiments demonstrated that lipogenesis was necessary for animals to tolerate high sugar feeding as tissue-specific loss of orthologs of carbohydrate response element-binding protein or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 resulted in lethality on high sugar diets. By contrast, increasing the fat content of the fat body by knockdown of king-tubby was associated with reduced hyperglycemia and improved growth and tolerance of high sugar diets. Our work supports a critical role for the fat body and the Drosophila carbohydrate response element-binding protein ortholog in metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2150566561,"Objective To assess the distribution of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in overweight and obese children. Methods Parasympathetic and sympathetic ANS function was assessed in children and adolescents with no evidence of impaired glucose metabolism by analysis of heart rate variability (low frequency power ln(LF), high frequency power, ln(HF); ln(LF/HF) ratio, ratio of longest RR interval during expiration to shortest interval during inspiration (E/I ratio), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD); sympathetic skin response (SSR); and quantitative pupillography (pupil diameter in darkness, light reflex amplitude, latency, constriction velocity, re-dilation velocity). The relationship of each ANS variable to the standard deviation score of body mass index (BMI-SDS) was assessed in a linear model considering age, gender and pubertal stage as co-variates and employing an F-statistic to compare the fit of nested models. Group comparisons between normal weight and obese children as well as an analysis of dependence on insulin resistance (as indexed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR) were performed for parameters shown to correlate with BMI-SDS. Statistical significance was set at 5%. Results Measurements were performed in 149 individuals (mean age 12.0 y; 90 obese 45 boys; 59 normal weight, 34 boys). E/I ratio (p = 0.003), ln(HF) (p = 0.03), pupil diameter in darkness (p = 0.01) were negatively correlated with BMI-SDS, whereas ln(LF/HF) was positively correlated (p = 0.05). Early re-dilation velocity was in trend negatively correlated to BMI-SDS (p = 0.08). None of the parameters that depended significantly on BMI-SDS was found to be significantly correlated with HOMA-IR. Conclusion These findings demonstrate extended ANS dysfunction in obese children and adolescents, affecting several organ systems. Both parasympathetic activity and sympathetic activity are reduced. The conspicuous pattern of ANS dysfunction raises the possibility that obesity may give rise to dysfunction of the peripheral autonomic nerves resembling that observed in normal-weight diabetic children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2081550061,"The internal state of an organism affects its choices. Previous studies in various non-human animals have demonstrated a complex, and in some cases non-monotonic, interaction between internal state and risk preferences. Our aim was to examine the systematic effects of deprivation on human decision-making across various reward types. Using both a non-parametric approach and a classical economic analysis, we asked whether the risk attitudes of human subjects towards money, food and water rewards would change as a function of their internal metabolic state. Our findings replicate some previous work suggesting that, on average, humans become more risk tolerant in their monetary decisions, as they get hungry. However, our specific approach allowed us to make two novel observations about the complex interaction between internal state and risk preferences. First, we found that the change in risk attitude induced by food deprivation is a general phenomenon, affecting attitudes towards both monetary and consumable rewards. But much more importantly, our data indicate that rather than each subject becoming more risk tolerant as previously hypothesized based on averaging across subjects, we found that as a population of human subjects becomes food deprived the heterogeneity of their risk attitudes collapses towards a fixed point. Thus subjects who show high-risk aversion while satiated shift towards moderate risk aversion when deprived but subjects who are risk tolerant become more risk averse. These findings demonstrate a more complicated interaction between internal state and risk preferences and raise some interesting implications for both day-to-day decisions and financial market structures."
https://openalex.org/W2022664428,"Persister cells (persisters) are transiently tolerant to antibiotics and usually constitute a small part of bacterial populations. Persisters remain dormant but are able to re-grow after antibiotic treatment. In this study we found that the frequency of persisters correlated to the level of protein aggregates accumulated in E. coli stationary-phase cultures. When 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid or an osmolyte (trehalose, betaine, glycerol or glucose) were added to the growth medium at low concentrations, proteins were prevented from aggregation and persister formation was inhibited. On the other hand, acetate or high concentrations of osmolytes enhanced protein aggregation and the generation of persisters. We demonstrated that in the E. coli stationary-phase cultures supplemented with MOPS or a selected osmolyte, the level of protein aggregates and persister frequency were not correlated with such physiological parameters as the extent of protein oxidation, culturability, ATP level or membrane integrity. The results described here may help to understand the mechanisms underlying persister formation."
https://openalex.org/W2055107205,"The gut microbiota plays a key role in the maintenance of healthy gut function as well as many other aspects of health. High-throughput sequence analyses have revealed the composition of the gut microbiota, showing that there is a core signature to the human gut microbiota, as well as variation in its composition between people. The gut microbiota of animals is also being investigated. We are interested in the relationship between bacterial taxa of the human gut microbiota and those in the gut microbiota of domestic and semi-wild animals. While it is clear that some human gut bacterial pathogens come from animals (showing that human--animal transmission occurs), the extent to which the usually non-pathogenic commensal taxa are shared between humans and animals has not been explored. To investigate this we compared the distal gut microbiota of humans, cattle and semi-captive chimpanzees in communities that are geographically sympatric in Uganda. The gut microbiotas of these three host species could be distinguished by the different proportions of bacterial taxa present. We defined multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by sequence similarity and found evidence that some OTUs were common between human, cattle and chimpanzees, with the largest number of shared OTUs occurring between chimpanzees and humans, as might be expected with their close physiological similarity. These results show the potential for the sharing of usually commensal bacterial taxa between humans and other animals. This suggests that further investigation of this phenomenon is needed to fully understand how it drives the composition of human and animal gut microbiotas."
https://openalex.org/W2093517374,"Aiming at an integrated and mechanistic view of the early biological effects of selected metals in the marine sentinel organism Mytilus galloprovincialis, we exposed mussels for 48 hours to 50, 100 and 200 nM solutions of equimolar Cd, Cu and Hg salts and measured cytological and molecular biomarkers in parallel. Focusing on the mussel gills, first target of toxic water contaminants and actively proliferating tissue, we detected significant dose-related increases of cells with micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities in the treated mussels, with differences in the bioconcentration of the three metals determined in the mussel flesh by atomic absorption spectrometry. Gene expression profiles, determined in the same individual gills in parallel, revealed some transcriptional changes at the 50 nM dose, and substantial increases of differentially expressed genes at the 100 and 200 nM doses, with roughly similar amounts of up- and down-regulated genes. The functional annotation of gill transcripts with consistent expression trends and significantly altered at least in one dose point disclosed the complexity of the induced cell response. The most evident transcriptional changes concerned protein synthesis and turnover, ion homeostasis, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and intracellular trafficking (transcript sequences denoting heat shock proteins, metal binding thioneins, sequestosome 1 and proteasome subunits, and GADD45 exemplify up-regulated genes while transcript sequences denoting actin, tubulins and the apoptosis inhibitor 1 exemplify down-regulated genes). Overall, nanomolar doses of co-occurring free metal ions have induced significant structural and functional changes in the mussel gills: the intensity of response to the stimulus measured in laboratory supports the additional validation of molecular markers of metal exposure to be used in Mussel Watch programs."
https://openalex.org/W2056398805,"Microfluidic flow assays (MFA) that measure shear dependent platelet function have potential clinical applications in the diagnosis and treatment of bleeding and thrombotic disorders. As a step towards clinical application, the objective of this study was to measure how phenotypic and genetic factors, as well as experimental conditions, affect the variability of platelet accumulation on type 1 collagen within a MFA. Whole blood was perfused over type 1 fibrillar collagen at wall shear rates of 150, 300, 750 and 1500 s−1 through four independent channels with a height of 50 µm and a width of 500 µm. The accumulation of platelets was characterized by the lag time to 1% platelet surface coverage (LagT), the rate of platelet accumulation (VPLT), and platelet surface coverage (SC). A cohort of normal donors was tested and the results were correlated to plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, platelet count, hematocrit, sex, and collagen receptors genotypes. VWF levels were the strongest determinant of platelet accumulation. VWF levels were positively correlated to VPLT and SC at all wall shear rates. A longer LagT for platelet accumulation at arterial shear rates compared to venous shear rates was attributed to the time required for plasma proteins to adsorb to collagen. There was no association between platelet accumulation and hematocrit or platelet count. Individuals with the AG genotype of the GP6 gene had lower platelet accumulation than individuals with the AA genotype at 150 s−1 and 300 s−1. Recalcified blood collected into sodium citrate and corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) resulted in diminished platelet accumulation compared to CTI alone, suggesting that citrate irreversibly diminishes platelet function. This study the largest association study of MFA in healthy donors (n = 104) and will likely set up the basis for the determination of the normal range of platelet responses in this type of assay."
https://openalex.org/W2031279996,"Ezrin is a member of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin family that provides a functional link between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. A correlation between ezrin overexpression and aggressive cancer behavior has been recently reported in various tumor types. However, its roles in the mechanisms underlying progression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are unclear.We used human tongue SCC and noncancerous tissue microarrays to immunohistochemically analyze the ezrin expression level and its relationship with proliferative activity. The human tongue SCC cell line HSC-3 was used to determine the effects of ezrin RNA interference (RNAi) on cancer cells during MTT; wound healing and invasion assays; immunofluorescence of the actin cytoskeleton; and western blotting of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and the active and total RhoA/Rac1/cdc42.Ezrin was overexpressed in 46.4% of the tumors examined in human tongue SCC tissue microarrays. Ezrin expression was correlated with the Ki-67 index. Ezrin depletion by RNAi in the HSC-3 cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and disturbed actin reorganization during podia formation. Its effects on RhoA/Rac1/cdc42 expression were not significant, whereas it enhanced E-cadherin and β-catenin expression and decreased N-cadherin expression.Ezrin is often overexpressed in primary tongue SCCs and may have an important role in their growth, migration, and invasiveness possibly via its relationship with the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and the cadherin switch. Thus, ezrin could be a therapeutic target in tongue SCC."
https://openalex.org/W1992188981,"The identification of multidrug resistant (MDR), extensively and totally drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), in vulnerable sites such as Mumbai, is a grave threat to the control of tuberculosis. The current study aimed at explaining the rapid expression of MDR in Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) compliant patients, represents the first study comparing global transcriptional profiles of 3 pairs of clinical Mtb isolates, collected longitudinally at initiation and completion of DOTS. While the isolates were drug susceptible (DS) at onset and MDR at completion of DOTS, they exhibited identical DNA fingerprints at both points of collection. The whole genome transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA from H37Rv and 3 locally predominant spoligotypes viz. MANU1, CAS and Beijing, hybridized on MTBv3 (BuG@S) microarray, and yielded 36, 98 and 45 differentially expressed genes respectively. Genes encoding transcription factors (sig, rpoB), cell wall biosynthesis (emb genes), protein synthesis (rpl) and additional central metabolic pathways (ppdK, pknH, pfkB) were found to be down regulated in the MDR isolates as compared to the DS isolate of the same genotype. Up regulation of drug efflux pumps, ABC transporters, trans-membrane proteins and stress response transcriptional factors (whiB) in the MDR isolates was observed. The data indicated that Mtb, without specific mutations in drug target genes may persist in the host due to additional mechanisms like drug efflux pumps and lowered rate of metabolism. Furthermore this population of Mtb, which also showed reduced DNA repair activity, would result in selection and stabilization of spontaneous mutations in drug target genes, causing selection of a MDR strain in the presence of drug pressures. Efflux pump such as drrA may play a significant role in increasing fitness of low level drug resistant cells and assist in survival of Mtb till acquisition of drug resistant mutations with least fitness cost."
https://openalex.org/W1989054750,"Background Although IARC clarifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) as possible human carcinogen, the debate on its health impact continues due to the inconsistent results. Genotoxic effect has been considered as a golden standard to determine if an environmental factor is a carcinogen, but the currently available data for RF-EMF remain controversial. As an environmental stimulus, the effect of RF-EMF on cellular DNA may be subtle. Therefore, more sensitive method and systematic research strategy are warranted to evaluate its genotoxicity. Objectives To determine whether RF-EMF does induce DNA damage and if the effect is cell-type dependent by adopting a more sensitive method γH2AX foci formation; and to investigate the biological consequences if RF-EMF does increase γH2AX foci formation. Methods Six different types of cells were intermittently exposed to GSM 1800 MHz RF-EMF at a specific absorption rate of 3.0 W/kg for 1 h or 24 h, then subjected to immunostaining with anti-γH2AX antibody. The biological consequences in γH2AX-elevated cell type were further explored with comet and TUNEL assays, flow cytometry, and cell growth assay. Results Exposure to RF-EMF for 24 h significantly induced γH2AX foci formation in Chinese hamster lung cells and Human skin fibroblasts (HSFs), but not the other cells. However, RF-EMF-elevated γH2AX foci formation in HSF cells did not result in detectable DNA fragmentation, sustainable cell cycle arrest, cell proliferation or viability change. RF-EMF exposure slightly but not significantly increased the cellular ROS level. Conclusions RF-EMF induces DNA damage in a cell type-dependent manner, but the elevated γH2AX foci formation in HSF cells does not result in significant cellular dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2011730969,"The increasing availability of human cardiac tissues for study are critically important in increasing our understanding of the impact of gender, age, and other parameters, such as medications and cardiac disease, on arrhythmia susceptibility. In this study, we aimed to compare the mRNA expression of 89 ion channel subunits, calcium handling proteins, and transcription factors important in cardiac conduction and arrhythmogenesis in the left atria (LA) and ventricles (LV) of failing and nonfailing human hearts of both genders. Total RNA samples, prepared from failing male (n = 9) and female (n = 7), and from nonfailing male (n = 9) and female (n = 9) hearts, were probed using custom-designed Taqman gene arrays. Analyses were performed to explore the relationships between gender, failure state, and chamber expression. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed chamber specific expression patterns, but failed to identify disease- or gender-dependent clustering. Gender-specific analysis showed lower expression levels in transcripts encoding for K(v)4.3, KChIP2, K(v)1.5, and K(ir)3.1 in the failing female as compared with the male LA. Analysis of LV transcripts, however, did not reveal significant differences based on gender. Overall, our data highlight the differential expression and transcriptional remodeling of ion channel subunits in the human heart as a function of gender and cardiac disease. Furthermore, the availability of such data sets will allow for the development of disease-, gender-, and, most importantly, patient-specific cardiac models, with the ability to utilize such information as mRNA expression to predict cardiac phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2088549918,"The ability to induce the reprogramming of somatic mammalian cells to a pluripotent state by the forced expression of specific transcription factors has helped redefine the rules of cell fate and plasticity, as well as open possibilities for disease modeling, drug screening and regenerative medicine. Here, we hypothesized that the non-viral forced expression of the four originally discovered defined factors (OKSM) in adult mice could result in in vivo reprogramming of cells in the transfected tissue in situ. We show that a single hydrodynamic tail-vein (HTV) injection of two plasmids encoding for Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc respectively, are highly expressed in the liver tissue of Balb/C adult mice. Hallmark pluripotency markers were upregulated within 24-48 h after injection, followed by down-regulation of all major hepatocellular markers. Generation of transcriptionally reprogrammed cells in vivo was further confirmed by positive staining of liver tissue sections for all major pluripotency markers in Balb/C mice and the Nanog-GFP reporter transgenic strain (TNG-A) with concomitant upregulation of GFP expression in situ. No signs of physiological or anatomical abnormalities or teratoma formation were observed in the liver examined up to 120 days. These findings indicate that virus-free expression of OKSM factors in vivo can transcriptionally reprogram cells in situ rapidly, efficiently and transiently, absent of host tissue damage or teratoma formation."
https://openalex.org/W2015984624,"This study was conducted to estimate the indirect costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (utilities) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in the United States (US), and to determine the impact of worsening mobility on these parameters. In collaboration with the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry we conducted a cross-sectional study of participants who completed the biannual update and supplemental spring 2010 survey. Demographic, employment status, income, mobility impairment, and health utility data were collected from a sample of registry participants who met the study criteria and agreed to participate in the supplemental Mobility Study. Mean annual indirect costs per participant in 2011US$ and mean utilities for the population and for cohorts reporting different levels of mobility impairment were estimated. Analyses included 3,484 to 3,611 participants, based on survey completeness. Thirty-seven percent of registrants were not working or attending school and 46.7% of these reported retiring early. Indirect costs per participant per year, not including informal caregiver cost, were estimated at $30,601±31,184. The largest relative increase in indirect costs occurred at earlier mobility impairment stages, regardless of the measure used. Participants’ mean utility score (0.73±0.18) was lower than that of a similarly aged sample from the general US population (0.87). As with indirect costs, larger decrements in utility were seen at earlier mobility impairment stages. These results suggest that mobility impairment may contribute to increases in indirect costs and declines in HRQoL in MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2091264850,"L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) are flavoproteins that catalyze the oxidative deamination of L-amino acids to a keto-acid along with the production of H2O2 and ammonia. Interleukin 4 induced gene 1 (IL4I1) is a secreted LAAO expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells stimulated by microbial derived products or interferons, which is endowed with immunoregulatory properties. It is the first LAAO described in mammalian innate immune cells. In this work, we show that this enzyme blocks the in vitro and in vivo growth of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. This antibiotic effect is primarily mediated by H2O2 production but is amplified by basification of the medium due to the accumulation of ammonia. The depletion of phenylalanine (the primary amino acid catabolized by IL4I1) may also participate in the in vivo inhibition of staphylococci growth. Thus, IL4I1 plays a distinct role compared to other antibacterial enzymes produced by mononuclear phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2025486498,"Organisms have been exposed to the geomagnetic field (GMF) throughout evolutionary history. Exposure to the hypomagnetic field (HMF) by deep magnetic shielding has recently been suggested to have a negative effect on the structure and function of the central nervous system, particularly during early development. Although changes in cell growth and differentiation have been observed in the HMF, the effects of the HMF on cell cycle progression still remain unclear. Here we show that continuous HMF exposure significantly increases the proliferation of human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. The acceleration of proliferation results from a forward shift of the cell cycle in G1-phase. The G2/M-phase progression is not affected in the HMF. Our data is the first to demonstrate that the HMF can stimulate the proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells by promoting cell cycle progression in the G1-phase. This provides a novel way to study the mechanism of cells in response to changes of environmental magnetic field including the GMF."
https://openalex.org/W2047189952,"Influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is a serious complication of influenza and is reported most frequently in Japan. This paper presents an assessment of the epidemiological characteristics of influenza A (H1N1) 2009-associated encephalopathy in comparison to seasonal IAE, based on Japanese national surveillance data of influenza-like illness (ILI) and IAE during flu seasons from 2004-2005 through 2009-2010. In each season before the pandemic, 34-55 IAE cases (mean 47.8; 95% confidence interval: 36.1-59.4) were reported, and these cases increased drastically to 331 during the 2009 pandemic (6.9-fold the previous seasons). Of the 331 IAE cases, 322 cases were reported as influenza A (H1N1) 2009-associated encephalopathy. The peaks of IAE were consistent with the peaks of the influenza epidemics and pandemics. A total of 570 cases of IAE (seasonal A, 170; seasonal B, 50; influenza A (H1N1) 2009, 322; unknown, 28) were reported over six seasons. The case fatality rate (CFR) ranged from 4.8 to 18.2% before the pandemic seasons and 3.6% in the 2009 pandemic season. The CFR of pandemic-IAE was 3.7%, which is lower than that of influenza A-/B-associated encephalopathy (12.9%, p<0.001; 14.0%, p = 0.002; respectively). The median age of IAE was 7 years during the pandemic, which is higher than that of influenza A-/B-associated encephalopathy (4, p<0.001; 4.5, p = 0.006; respectively). However, the number of pandemic-IAE cases per estimated ILI outpatients peaked in the 0-4-year age group and data both before and during the pandemic season showed a U-shape pattern. This suggests that the high incidence of influenza infection in the 0-4 year age group may lead to a high incidence of IAE in the same age group in a future influenza season. Further studies should include epidemiologic case definitions and clinical details of IAE to gain a more accurate understanding of the epidemiologic status of IAE."
https://openalex.org/W2165442096,"The assessment of a species’ habitat is a crucial issue in ecology and conservation. While the collection of habitat data has been boosted by the availability of remote sensing technologies, certain habitat types have yet to be collected through costly, on-ground surveys, limiting study over large areas. Cliffs are ecosystems that provide habitat for a rich biodiversity, especially raptors. Because of their principally vertical structure, however, cliffs are not easy to study by remote sensing technologies, posing a challenge for many researches and managers working with cliff-related biodiversity. We explore the feasibility of Google Street View, a freely available on-line tool, to remotely identify and assess the nesting habitat of two cliff-nesting vultures (the griffon vulture and the globally endangered Egyptian vulture) in northwestern Spain. Two main usefulness of Google Street View to ecologists and conservation biologists were evaluated: i) remotely identifying a species’ potential habitat and ii) extracting fine-scale habitat information. Google Street View imagery covered 49% (1,907 km) of the roads of our study area (7,000 km2). The potential visibility covered by on-ground surveys was significantly greater (mean: 97.4%) than that of Google Street View (48.1%). However, incorporating Google Street View to the vulture’s habitat survey would save, on average, 36% in time and 49.5% in funds with respect to the on-ground survey only. The ability of Google Street View to identify cliffs (overall accuracy = 100%) outperformed the classification maps derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) (62–95%). Nonetheless, high-performance DEM maps may be useful to compensate Google Street View coverage limitations. Through Google Street View we could examine 66% of the vultures’ nesting-cliffs existing in the study area (n = 148): 64% from griffon vultures and 65% from Egyptian vultures. It also allowed us the extraction of fine-scale features of cliffs. This World Wide Web-based methodology may be a useful, complementary tool to remotely map and assess the potential habitat of cliff-dependent biodiversity over large geographic areas, saving survey-related costs."
https://openalex.org/W2167154159,"We have investigated the features of single-span model membrane proteins based upon leader peptidase that determines whether the proteins insert by a YidC/Sec-independent, YidC-only, or YidC/Sec mechanism. We find that a protein with a highly hydrophobic transmembrane segment that inserts into the membrane by a YidC/Sec-independent mechanism becomes YidC-dependent if negatively charged residues are inserted into the translocated periplasmic domain or if the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segment is reduced by substituting polar residues for nonpolar ones. This suggests that charged residues in the translocated domain and the hydrophobicity within the transmembrane segment are important determinants of the insertion pathway. Strikingly, the addition of a positively charged residue to either the translocated region or the transmembrane region can switch the insertion requirements such that insertion requires both YidC and SecYEG. To test conclusions from the model protein studies, we confirmed that a positively charged residue is a SecYEG determinant for the endogenous proteins ATP synthase subunits a and b and the TatC subunit of the Tat translocase. These findings provide deeper insights into how pathways are selected for the insertion of proteins into the Escherichia coli inner membrane.

These findings provide deeper insights into how pathways are selected for the insertion of proteins into the Escherichia coli inner membrane. In Escherichia coli, inner membrane proteins generally require the YidC and SecYEG machineries to insert into the inner membrane (1Dalbey R.E. Wang P. Kuhn A. Assembly of bacterial inner membrane proteins.Annu. Rev.

For example, KdpD does not require YidC or SecYEG for insertion into the inner membrane (2Facey S.J. Kuhn A.

Struhalla G. van den Berg L. Kiefer D. Escherichia coli YidC is a membrane insertase for Sec-independent proteins.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These observations raise important questions about the features of membrane proteins that determine whether a protein inserts by a YidC/Sec-independent mechanism, by YidC only, or by both the YidC and the Sec pathway. Are translocase requirements connected to the overall hydrophobicity of TM helices of a substrate, or are the requirements related to charged residues within TM anchors or translocated domains, as observed in some cases (10Chen M. Xie K. Yuan J. Yi L. Facey S.J. Pradel N. Wu L.F. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Involvement of SecDF and YidC in the membrane insertion of M13 procoat mutants.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10741-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)? The membrane-protein substrate features that determine whether a protein requires YidC for insertion have been controversial. One possibility is that YidC is required for the insertion of proteins when negatively charged residues are present in the TM segments but not when positively charged residues are present (4Price C.E. Driessen A.J. Conserved negative charges in the transmembrane segments of subunit K of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase determine its dependence on YidC for membrane insertion.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3575-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that YidC is required for insertion of membrane proteins that have an unfavorable distribution of positively charged residues around the TM segments (5Gray A.N. Henderson-Frost J.M. Boyd D. Shirafi S. Niki H. Goldberg M.B. Unbalanced charge distribution as a determinant for dependence of a subset of Escherichia coli membrane proteins on the membrane insertase YidC.MBio. 2011; 2 (e00211): e00238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that YidC is required for insertion of proteins with a weakly hydrophobic TM segment, because increasing the hydrophobicity of the TM segment of the YidC-dependent Pf3 coat protein allows this protein to insert by the autonomous pathway (3Ernst S. Schönbauer A.K. Bär G. Börsch M. Kuhn A. YidC-driven membrane insertion of single fluorescent Pf3 coat proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 412: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To expand our understanding of the determinants of insertion pathway selection, we systematically examine in this paper the features of model single-span membrane proteins that determine which translocation pathway is required for membrane insertion. Although Price and Driessen (4Price C.E. Driessen A.J. Conserved negative charges in the transmembrane segments of subunit K of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase determine its dependence on YidC for membrane insertion.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3575-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) found that negative charges in two TM segments of NuoK determined the YidC dependence of NuoK, we show that the addition of a negative charge to a TM segment or periplasmic segment requires YidC, whereas the addition of a positive charge imposes a requirement for both YidC and SecYEG. In addition, although Gray et al. (5Gray A.N. Henderson-Frost J.M. Boyd D. Shirafi S. Niki H. Goldberg M.B. Unbalanced charge distribution as a determinant for dependence of a subset of Escherichia coli membrane proteins on the membrane insertase YidC.MBio. 2011; 2 (e00211): e00238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) observed that YidC is required for proteins that have a topology with an unfavorable positive inside rule, we find that charged residues within proteins that have a favorable positive inside rule are also YidC determinants. Looking beyond the model single-span proteins, we found that positively charged residues can also function as Sec determinants for the endogenous proteins subunits a and b of the ATP synthase and the TatC subunit of the twin-arginine translocase. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium azide, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and lysozyme were all purchased from Sigma. Proteinase K (protK) was purchased from Qiagen. IPTG was from Research Products International Corp. Trans-[35S]-label, a mixture of 85% [35S]methionione and 15% [35S]cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol, was from PerkinElmer.

DNA sequencing of the entire gene verified all mutations. Pf3-LepTM, subunit a-LepTM, Pf3-aTM, and a-aTM were cloned into the IPTG-inducible pMS119 vector. pMS119 was used to express these proteins in the JS7131 strain. The pLZ1 vector containing the RSF origin, T7/lacUV5 promoter, and kanamycin resistance was constructed in the previous study (33Zhu L. Klenner C. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E.

F0a and TatC genes were amplified from E. coli (K-12) genomic DNA and fused at the 3′-end of the DNA with a DNA fragment encoding the LepP2 domain (residues 223–323) of leader peptidase. The coding regions of F0a-LepP2 and TatC-LepP2 were subcloned into the expression vector pLZ1 using the restriction sites for the NcoI and EcoRI enzymes. JS7131, the E. coli YidC depletion strain, and MC1060 are from our collection. CM124, the SecE depletion strain, was received from Beth Traxler and has been described (34Traxler B. Murphy C.

JS7131 cells are cultured at 37 °C for 3 h in LB medium with 0.2% arabinose (YidC expression conditions) or 0.2% glucose (YidC depletion conditions) (27Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. YidC mediates membrane protein insertion in bacteria.Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The SecE depletion strain CM124 was cultured in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose (SecE depletion conditions) or 0.2% arabinose plus 0.4% glucose (SecE expression conditions) (34Traxler B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prior to induction of the plasmid-encoded proteins in JS7131 and CM124, the medium was exchanged into M9 medium (35Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 0.5% fructose and 50 μg/ml of each amino acid except methionine and shaken for 30 min at 37 °C. Expression of the constructs was induced by 1 mm IPTG (final concentration) for 3 min. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min and converted to spheroplasts (36Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. The proton motive force, acting on acidic residues, promotes translocation of amino-terminal domains of membrane proteins when the hydrophobicity of the translocation signal is low.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pulse-labeled cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended with spheroplast buffer (33 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 40% (m/v) sucrose). The resuspended cells were treated with 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and 5 μg/ml Lysozyme on ice for 15 min. An aliquot was then incubated with protK (0.75 mg/ml) for 1 h on ice, and then the protease reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 mm PMSF for 5 min. An equal volume of 20% (m/v) TCA buffer was added to the solution and incubated on ice for another 1 h. The total protein was then spun down at 14,000 × g for 10 min and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone. The protein pellet was then solubilized with Tris-SDS buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2% (m/v) SDS). The samples were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to leader peptidase, which precipitates the Lep derivatives, or precipitated with antiserum to OmpA. For the SecA-dependent studies, cells were treated with 3 mm (final concentration) sodium azide for 5 min prior to labeling. For the proton motive force (pmf)-dependent studies, the cells were pretreated with 50 μm (final concentration) CCCP for 45 s prior to labeling of the cells. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. E. coli strains Wam121, JS7131, and CM124 were grown for various times (Wam121 for 3 h, JS7131 for 3 h, and CM124 for 8 h) in the presence of arabinose or glucose at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)). After normalizing the cells to A600 of 1.2, the cell samples (1 ml) were pelleted, washed, and dissolved in 100 μl of SDS gel loading buffer, and 2 μl of the protein samples were loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Ffh and YidC were analyzed by a Western blot using the total protein. To analyze the protein expression of SecY, membrane vesicles were prepared from the 1 ml of cells grown in arabinose and glucose conditions, adjusted to A600 ∼1.2, respectively. The membrane vesicles were then solubilized in DDM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1% n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside) and the proteins resolved on the 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Antisera to Ffh, YidC, and SecY (each diluted 1:5000) and secondary antibody (goat-to-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000) were used for the Western blot. Supplemental Fig. S1 examines the YidC and Sec dependence of key mutants in which the H2 and H3 segments of the Lep domain were deleted. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the SecA and SRP dependence of key mutants. To examine the features of a membrane protein that determine which translocase is required, we studied four single-span model membrane proteins (Fig. 1A) based upon E. coli Lep. The model proteins differ only in the translocated N-terminal region (N-tail) or the TM segment. The constructs have two-part names; the first part represents the N-tail region, and the second represents the TM segment (Fig. 1B). The Pf3-LepTM construct contains the Pf3 coat periplasmic N-tail fused to Lep. To prevent translocation of Lep TM2, we introduced a single arginine after TM2, which has previously been demonstrated to prevent it from functioning as a TM segment (37Cao G. Dalbey R.E. Translocation of N-terminal tails across the plasma membrane.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Pf3-aTM and a-aTM constructs both contain TM1 of subunit a of the F1F0-ATP synthase (referred to here as F0a) but different N-tails; Pf3-aTM has the Pf3 N-tail fused to F0a TM1, and a-aTM has both F0a N-tail and the F0a TM1 domain. All of the constructs contain Lep residues 23–323 plus the Arg at the C terminus of TM2. These constructs simplify topology assays using protK, because only the N-tails are translocated. To assay the insertion pathways of the constructs, we used YidC- and SecE-depleted E. coli strains. YidC dependence of membrane insertion was assayed using the YidC depletion strain JS7131, which has the yidc gene under the control of the araBAD promoter (27Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. YidC mediates membrane protein insertion in bacteria.Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Membrane insertion was studied under YidC depletion conditions by growing the bacteria in growth medium supplemented with glucose. JS7131 cells expressing different protein constructs were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min under YidC expression (0.2% arabinose) and YidC depletion conditions (0.2% glucose). They were then analyzed by the protease accessibility assay (38Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. The role of the polar, carboxyl-terminal domain of Escherichia coli leader peptidase in its translocation across the plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13844-13849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JS7131 cells were converted to spheroplasts to allow access to the inner membrane and then treated with protK for 60 min. To determine the Sec dependence of the various constructs, we used CM124, the SecE depletion strain (34Traxler B. Murphy C. Insertion of the polytopic membrane protein MalF is dependent on the bacterial secretion machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is well established that proteins requiring the SecYEG machinery are strongly inhibited in this strain when SecE is depleted, whereas Sec-independent proteins are unaffected. CM124 cells expressing the model proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min under SecE depletion conditions (SecE−), and protease mapping was carried out as described for JS7131. For all experiments reported here, we used the protease degradation of OmpA as a positive control for efficiency of spheroplast formation because OmpA is not digestible in intact cells. It can, however, be digested from the periplasmic side of the membrane in properly prepared spheroplasts. OmpA was completely digested in all the protK+ studies, showing that the cells were converted to spheroplasts (Fig. 2A, right). These positive controls are included for all data presented in Fig. 2. Because of the possibility that the targeting pathway might differ among the model proteins, we first established that all were targeted via the SRP pathway. In bacteria, SRP is composed of the protein component Ffh and a 4.5 S RNA. To test whether SRP is required for targeting, we used Wam121, the SRP depletion strain. Wam121 contains Ffh under the control of the araBAD promoter similar to the depletion strains described earlier. As can be seen, Pf3-LepTM, a-aTM, a-LepTM, and Pf3-aTM insert efficiently under Ffh+ conditions (Fig. 2A). In contrast, insertion is inefficient under Ffh− conditions, indicating that SRP is required for membrane targeting and insertion of all model proteins. As a positive control, we confir"

Fossils of titanosaurians have been found on all continents and their remains are abundant in a number of Late Cretaceous sites. Nonetheless, the cranial anatomy of titanosaurians is still very poorly known. The Spanish latest Cretaceous locality of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of phylogenetically restricted characters with Ampelosaurus atacis from France such as a flat occipital region. However, it appears to differ from A. atacis in some traits such as the greater degree of dorsoventral compression and the presence of proatlas facets. The specimen is, therefore, provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp. It was CT scanned, and 3D renderings of the cranial endocast and inner-ear system were generated. Our investigation highlights that, although titanosaurs were derived sauropods with a successful evolutionary history, they present a remarkably modest level of paleoneurological organization. Compared with the condition in the basal titanosauriform Giraffatitan brancai, the labyrinth of Ampelosaurus sp. shows a reduced morphology. The latter feature is possibly related to a restricted range of head-turning movements."

A large number of proteins are dedicated to the regulation of the MT network. Tubulin polymerization promoting protein 1 (Tppp1) is a unique regulatory protein that modulates MT dynamics in two ways. First, it binds to tubulin heterodimers and promotes their incorporation into the growing microtubule filaments (1Hlavanda E. Kovács J. Oláh J. Orosz F. Medzihradszky K.F. Ovádi J.

Recent reports demonstrated that MT acetylation is important for the regulation of cell proliferation. Hdac6-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit high MT acetylation that promotes their resistance to oncogenic Ras and ErbB2 transformation (11Lee Y.S. Lim K.H. Guo X. Kawaguchi Y. Gao Y. Barrientos T. Ordentlich P. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Yao T.P. The cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6 is required for efficient oncogenic tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7561-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Additionally, knockdown of Hdac6 in a number of cancer cell lines inhibits their anchorage-independent proliferation (11Lee Y.S. Lim K.H. Guo X. Kawaguchi Y. Gao Y. Barrientos T. Ordentlich P.

Furthermore, overexpression of the tumor suppressor gene cylindromatosis, which inhibits Hdac6 activity, causes delays in the cell cycle (12Wickström S.A. Masoumi K.C. Khochbin S. Fässler R.

CYLD negatively regulates cell-cycle progression by inactivating HDAC6 and increasing the levels of acetylated tubulin.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of Hdac6 promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation (11Lee Y.S. Lim K.H. Guo X. Kawaguchi Y. Gao Y. Barrientos T. Ordentlich P. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Yao T.P.

Because Tppp1 is a regulator of Hdac6 activity, these previous studies imply its potential role in cell proliferation. Other important regulators of cell proliferation are the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). They are key cell cycle regulatory molecules that are activated transiently through binding to their complementary cyclins. Mitogenic stimulation during G1-phase leads to increased Cyclin D levels, which then interact with Cdk4 or Cdk6 to promote their activation (13Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K.

Cyclin D/Cdk4/6-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) results in its dissociation from Hdac and alleviates its inhibitory effect on the E2F transcription factor. This partially activates E2F-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of genes including cyclin E, cyclin A, and Cdk1. Increased cyclin E levels in cells promotes the formation and activation of the Cyclin E/Cdk2 complex at late G1-phase to drive cells into S-phase (15Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J.

Subsequent Cyclin A/Cdk2 and then Cyclin A/Cdk1 complex formation promotes the progression of cells through S- and G2-phases, respectively (16Pagano M. Draetta G. Jansen-Dürr P.

In this study, we investigated the role of Tppp1 in the regulation of cell proliferation. We hypothesized that Tppp1 regulates the transition of cells through the G1/S-phase and mitosis via its inhibition of Hdac6 activity as well as its modulation of MT polymerization. Furthermore, we explored possible mechanisms for Tppp1 regulation that have important consequences in cell proliferation.

Cells were treated with Y-27632 (10 μm, water solvent; Calbiochem), roscovitine (10 μm, dimethyl sulfoxide solvent; Sigma), or their solvents for 16 h prior to analyses. For synchronization, cells were arrested in G0/G1-phase by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS for 72 h; in S-phase by double thymidine block (2 mm; Sigma) for two 18-h incubations performed before and after a 9-h recovery; and G2/M-phase by a 16-h incubation with nocodazole (200 ng/ml; Sigma). Cell proliferation assays were conducted in a 6-well plate format. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to trypsinization and resuspension in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Total cell counts were performed with a hemacytometer and a light microscope. Three fields of each sample were counted. Proliferation results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, with a Bonferroni's post-test. Cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% (v/v) ethanol overnight at 4 °C. They were washed three times in PBS and incubated in the dark with propidium iodide (PI) staining buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml of RNase A, and 5 μg/ml of PI) for 30 min at 37 °C. For experiments analyzing the recovery of cells from a G2/M-phase arrest, cells were treated with nocodazole (200 ng/ml) for 16 h. After treatment, mitotic cells were harvested by shaking the flask (mitotic shake-off) and re-plated for the indicated time points followed by collection of the suspension and adherent cells for analysis. Cells plated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish for 24 h were incubated with 1 μg/ml of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 3 h, trypsinized, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed in PBS and incubated with ice-cold 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 n HCl on ice for 1 min followed by resuspension in DNA denaturing buffer (150 μm NaCl, 15 μm trisodium citrate dihydrate) at 90 °C for 5 min and on ice for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in BrdU staining buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) BSA) and incubated with 2 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-BrdU or anti-IgGκ isotype control, 20 μg/ml of RNase A, and 5 μg/ml of PI for 30 min at room temperature. The cells prepared above were analyzed with the FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Bioscience) using the CellQuest Pro software.

Tppp1 phosphorylation levels following cyclin/Cdk phosphorylation were calculated by compensating for fold-differences in complex activity, which were obtained by analysis of Rb protein phosphorylation. Log-phase HEK293T cells plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish were transfected with the appropriate DNA constructs 24 h prior to incubation with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media without phosphate and l-glutamine for 16 h. 10 μm Y-27632 or vehicle were added 1 h prior to the addition of 0.1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate for 6 h. Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation was evaluated by synchronizing the stable U2OS-FLAG-Tppp1 cell line in G0/G1-phase, S-phase, or G2/M-phase as described. Synchronized cells were incubated with 0.1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate 6 h prior to the conclusion of the treatment periods. Labeled cells were washed twice in cold PBS, harvested in metabolic labeling buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and lysed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Briefly, tubulin polymerization assays were performed using a Tubulin polymerization assay kit (catalogue number BK006P, Cytoskeleton). For immunofluorescence microscopy cells were fixed in 100% methanol and blocked in 10% FBS followed by incubations with primary and secondary antibodies as previously described (4Schofield A.V.

Chem. 2012; 287: 43620-43629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dynamic rearrangement of the microtubule network is imperative for the transition of cells through the cell cycle phases and ultimately for cell proliferation. We hypothesized that Tppp1, as a modulator of MT dynamics, regulates cell proliferation. Our studies revealed that overexpression of FLAG-Tppp1 in U2OS cells, resulting in a 7-fold increase in Tppp1 expression, significantly reduced the rate of cell proliferation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Tppp1 significantly increased cell proliferation compared with non-targeting siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Cell cycle checkpoints are important transitional stages whereby the ability of cells to commit to S-phase and mitosis is controlled. We therefore investigated whether the observed Tppp1-mediated regulation of cell proliferation is through its modulation of the G1/S-phase transition. Analysis of U2OS cells in S-phase by measurement of the incorporation of BrdU (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine) revealed that overexpression and knockdown of Tppp1 decreased (25.4 ± 3.8%) and increased (42.4 ± 4.2%) BrdU incorporation, respectively, compared with the control cells (36.5 ± 1.8% and 29.4 ± 4.7%) (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Tppp1 regulates the entry and/or transition of cells through S-phase. We previously established that Rock-mediated phosphorylation of Tppp1 prevents its interaction with Hdac6 to alleviate its deacetylase inhibitory activity (4Schofield A.V. Steel R. Bernard O. Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) protein controls microtubule dynamics in a novel signaling pathway that regulates cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 43620-43629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a major tubulin deacetylase, Hdac6 regulates the level of MT acetylation, which controls MT dynamics and ultimately determine cellular quiescence (11Lee Y.S. Lim K.H. Guo X. Kawaguchi Y. Gao Y. Barrientos T. Ordentlich P. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Yao T.P. The cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6 is required for efficient oncogenic tumorigenesis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7561-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Wickström S.A. Masoumi K.C. Khochbin S. Fässler R. Massoumi R. CYLD negatively regulates cell-cycle progression by inactivating HDAC6 and increasing the levels of acetylated tubulin.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated if the molecular mechanism responsible for Tppp1-mediated modulation of G1/S-phase is dependent on its Hdac6 regulatory activity. We analyzed the efficiency of U2OS cells that were stably expressing wild-type Tppp1, Rock phosphoinhibitory Tppp13Ala, Rock phosphomimetic Tppp13Glu, or vector to transit through the G1/S-phase boundary. These studies revealed that expression of the Tppp13Ala protein retards the entry of cells into S-phase, with 12 ± 2.5% of BrdU positive cells compared with 28.8 ± 6.4% of BrdU positive cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 2C). Conversely, expression of the phosphomimetic Tppp13Glu, abolished the Tppp1-mediated decreases in the G1/S-phase transition of cells, resulting in 28.6 ± 4.1% of BrdU positive cells (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggest that Tppp1-mediated regulation of the G1/S-phase transition is dependent on its Hdac6 regulatory activity. We establish here that Tppp1 overexpression reduces cell proliferation, whereas its down-regulation enhanced proliferation (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, we show that Tppp1-mediated inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition is dependent on its phosphorylation by Rock. Therefore, to investigate if Rock-Tppp1 signaling is sufficient to inhibit Tppp1-mediated reductions in cell proliferation we performed proliferation assays with U2OS cells stably expressing wild-type Tppp1, its Rock phospho-mutants, or vector control. We demonstrated that expression of all Tppp1 proteins reduced cell proliferation compared with the vector control (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that Rock phosphorylation of Tppp1 is not sufficient to inhibit its regulation of cell proliferation, thereby suggesting that its MT polymerization activity, which is retained when phosphorylated by Rock, is also important for its regulation of cell proliferation. Mitosis is dependent on dynamic morphological changes of the cell afforded by the MT network. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tppp1 might also be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation through modulation of mitotic progression. To study the role of Tppp1 in completion of mitosis we analyzed the G1-phase entry of cells that were arrested in mitosis by nocodazole (200 ng/ml) treatment. Overexpression of Tppp1 delayed the progression of cells from mitosis into the G1-phase compared with vector control cells (Fig. 3B), whereas knockdown of Tppp1 increased the rate of progression through mitosis (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we concluded that Tppp1 regulates cell proliferation via modulation of the G1/S-phase transition as well as the mitosis to G1-phase transition. Because Tppp1 activity is regulated by Rock signaling and it is phosphorylated on residues distinct from the Rock phosphorylation sites (5Hlavanda E. Klement E. Kókai E. Kovács J. Vincze O. Tökési N.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we tested if other kinase signaling pathways contribute to its role in the progression of cells through mitosis. We first investigated the level of Tppp1 phosphorylation during the cell cycle by analysis of cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate that were arrested in G0/G1-, S-, or G2/M-phase. These experiments revealed that Tppp1 phosphorylation was lowest at the G0/G1-phase, whereas it increased during S-phase and peaked at the G2/M-phase compared with an asynchronous cell population (Fig. 3D). Previous studies demonstrated that Rock activity was necessary for the transition of cells from G1- into S-phase (20Croft D.R. Olson M.F.

Biol. 2006; 26: 4612-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is likely to reflect the increase in Tppp1 phosphorylation at this stage. However, further increases in Tppp1 phosphorylation during the G2/M-phase suggest that it is subject to further kinase regulation. Cyclin/Cdks are the classical cell cycle regulatory complexes that phosphorylate a vast array of substrates including MT regulatory proteins (21Cassimeris L.

We first analyzed the ability of the Cyclin/Cdk complexes to phosphorylate Tppp1 in vitro. In vitro kinase assays with Cyclin D/Cdk4 (G1-phase), Cyclin E/Cdk2 (late G1-phase), Cyclin A/Cdk2 (S-phase), Cyclin A/Cdk1 (early G2-phase), and Cyclin B/Cdk1 (mitosis) showed that TPPP1 is a cyclin/Cdk1/2 substrate in vitro (Fig. 4A). Moreover, quantification of the level of Tppp1 phosphorylation relative to Cyclin/Cdk complex activities, which was obtained through analysis of their phosphorylation of the Rb (Fig. 4B), a known Cdk substrate, revealed that the highest level of Tppp1 phosphorylation was achieved in the presence of Cyclin B/Cdk1 (Fig. 4A, lower panel). We next tested if Tppp1 is also phosphorylated by Cdks in cells. Treatment of cells with the Cdk inhibitor roscovitine (10 μm) showed that inhibition of Cdk activity significantly reduced Tppp1 phosphorylation compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we establish that Tppp1 is a Cyclin/Cdk substrate in vitro and in cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis as well as phosphorylation kinetics experiments revealed that Cyclin B/Cdk1 phosphorylates Tppp1 on four serine/threonine residues in vitro (Fig. 4, D and E). A literature search of the Tppp1 amino acid sequence for residues that are part of minimal cyclin/Cdk consensus motifs (S/T-P) (25Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H.

We therefore generated single Tppp1 alanine substitution mutants and in vitro kinase assays showed that mutation of each of these sites reduced Tppp1 phosphorylation by Cyclin B/Cdk1 (Fig. 4G). Subsequent analysis of a quadruple Tppp1 alanine mutant (Tppp14Ala) confirmed that mutation of these sites abolished Tppp1 phosphorylation by Cyclin B/Cdk1 (Fig. 4H). Our initial investigation into the functional implications of the Cdk-Tppp1 signaling pathway revealed that Tppp1 phosphorylation by Cdk did not alter its interaction with Hdac6 or the level of acetylated MT in cells (Fig. 5, A–C). To examine the impact of Tppp1 phosphorylation by Cdk in vitro we performed tubulin polymerization assays (Fig. 5D) and visualized the amount of polymerized MTs in cells expressing wild-type Tppp1, Cdk phosphoinhibitory Tppp14Ala, Cdk phosphomimetic Tppp14Glu, or vector (Fig. 5E). These studies demonstrated that Tppp1 phosphorylation by Cdk inhibits its MT polymerization in vitro and reduces the level of MTs in cells. To further confirm that only Cdk phosphorylation of Tppp1 inhibits its MT polymerizing activity, we generated stable U2OS cell lines expressing the dual Rock and Cdk Tppp1 phosphoinhibitory and phosphomimetic proteins (Table 1). Analysis of MT levels in these cells by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that phosphorylation of Tppp1 by Cdk, irrelevant of its phosphorylation by Rock inhibited Tppp1-mediated increases in MT levels in cells (Fig. 5F). Therefore, we confirm that Cdk-Tppp1 signaling inhibits Tppp1-mediated MT polymerizing activity in vitro and in cells.TABLE 1Dual ROCK and Cdk phosphoinhibitory and phosphomimetic TPPP1 mutantsConstructMutant sitesMutant typeTppp13Ala/4AlaS32A/S107A/S159A-T14A/S18A/S45A/S160ADual phosphoinhibitoryTppp13Ala/4GluS32A/S107A/S159A-T14E/S18E/S45E/S160ERock phosphoinhibitory/Cdk phosphomimeticTppp13Glu/4AlaS32E/S107E/S159E-T14A/S18A/S45A/S160ARock phosphomimetic/Cdk phosphoinhibitoryTppp13Glu/4GluS32E/S107E/S159E-T14E/S18E/S45E/S160EDual phosphomimetic Open table in a new tab Our results thus far suggest that Rock-mediated phosphorylation of Tppp1 relieves its inhibitory effect on G1/S-phase progression (Fig. 2). To rule out the possibility that Tppp1-mediated MT polymerization is also contributing to its inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition, we analyzed the level of BrdU in cells expressing the dual Rock and Cdk phospho-site Tppp1 mutants displayed in Table 1. Analysis of BrdU incorporation in cells revealed that expression of wild-type Tppp1 (25.4 ± 2.71%), Tppp13Ala/4Ala (12.1 ± 2.12%), or Tppp13Ala/4Glu (15.2 ± 1.24%) significantly decreased the level of cellular BrdU compared with the vector expressing cells (36.5 ± 1.06%) (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, expression of Tppp13Glu/4Ala (35.2 ± 2.36%) or Tppp13Glu/4Glu (36.6 ± 1.36%) did not alter BrdU levels. Therefore, we conclude that Tppp1 retards the G1/S-phase transition only via its Hdac6 inhibitory activity. To confirm that Tppp1-mediated inhibition of Hdac6 activity and its inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition is the result of increased microtubule acetylation, we analyzed the level of MT acetylation in these cell lines by immunoblotting (Fig. 6C) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6D). The results show that increases and decreases in the number of cells in S-phase correlates with increased and decreased Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock and is dependent on its regulation of MT acetylation. Therefore, our results clearly show that Tppp1-mediated inhibition of Hdac6 activity and the resulting increase in MT acetylation is the only Tppp1 function necessary for the inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition. To investigate the impact of Rock- and Cdk-mediated Tppp1 phosphorylation on its regulation of the mitosis to G1-phase transition, we analyzed the recovery of cells arrested in the G2/M-phase with nocodazole treatment. Our results revealed that inhibition of Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock and/or Cdk delayed the transition of cells into the G1-phase compared with vector control cells (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock or Cdk increases the rate of entry of cells into the G1-phase compared with wild-type Tppp1 expressing cells, suggesting that loss of its Hdac6 regulatory or MT polymerizing function partially inhibits its modulation of mitosis to G1-phase transition. In contrast, expression of the dual Rock/Cdk phosphomimetic Tppp1 mutant (Tppp13Glu/4Glu) showed no difference in the transition of cells into G1-phase compared with the vector control. Therefore, we concluded that Tppp1 phosphorylation by both Rock and Cdk is necessary to inhibit its Hdac6 regulatory and MT polymerizing activities, respectively, to enable cells to re-enter the G1-phase. To confirm that Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock and Cdk suppresses its cell proliferation effect, we performed proliferation assays with the cell lines described above. These results confirmed that neither Rock (Tppp13Glu/4Ala) nor Cdk phosphorylation (Tppp13Ala/4Glu) of Tppp1 alone was sufficient to alleviate its inhibition of cell proliferation. However, the proliferation of cells expressing the dual Tppp1 phosphomimetic mutant (Tppp13Glu/4Glu) was similar to that of the vector expressing cells (Fig. 7B), therefore confirming that Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock and Cdk is required to modulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle. Our study establishes that Tppp1 reduces cell proliferation through inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition and the progression of cells into G1 from G2/M-phase. We demonstrate here that Rock-mediated Tppp1 phosphorylation inhibits its regulation of the G1/S-phase transition, whereas Rock- and Cdk-mediated phosphorylation are necessary to inhibit its mitotic regulatory activity. Therefore, our findings reveal that temporal cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Tppp1, which inhibits its activity, is necessary for cells to progress through the cell cycle and has important consequences in cell proliferation. We establish that Tppp1 overexpression reduces, whereas its knockdown increases the proliferation of U2OS cells. These results are supported by reports that oligodendrocytes show similar defects in replication upon prolonged Tppp1 expression (28Lehotzky A. Tirián L. Tökési N. Lénárt P. Szabó B. Kovács J. Ovádi J. Dynamic targeting of microtubules by TPPP/p25 affects cell survival.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6249-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and increased cell proliferation when Tppp1 expression is reduced using the microRNA-206 (miR-206) (29Lehotzky A. Lau P. Tokési N. Muja N. Hudson L.D. Ovádi J. Tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP/p25) is critical for oligodendrocyte differentiation.Glia. 2010; 58: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our findings also provide further insight into the mechanism by which Tppp1 temporally regulates cell proliferation, whereby it modulates the transition of cells from G1 into S-phase as well as from mitosis into G1-phase. Herein, we focused on the signaling pathways that regulate Tppp1 activity and their impact on its regulation of cell proliferation. This initially involved the evaluation of our recently established Rock-Tppp1 signaling pathway (4Schofield A.V. Steel R. Bernard O.

Chem. 2012; 287: 43620-43629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We show that Rock-mediated phosphorylation of Tppp1, which inhibits TPPP1 binding to Hdac6 and results in reduced MT acetylation, promotes the transition of cells through G1/S-phase. These results suggest that down-regulation of acetyl-MT levels is a critical event at the onset of the cell cycle. This is supported by our studies demonstrating that knockdown of Tppp1 promotes the G1/S-phase transition and those of others showing that increased MT acetylation delays cell cycle entry and promotes cell senescence (12Wickström S.A. Masoumi K.C. Khochbin S. Fässler R. Massoumi R.

Moreover, Rock signaling has previously been implicated in the regulation of the G1/S-phase transition, with the observation that Rock activation enhances the entry of cells into S-phase (20Croft D.R. Olson M.F. The Rho GTPase effector ROCK regulates cyclin A, cyclin D1, and p27Kip1 levels by distinct mechanisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4612-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of its activity leads to a marked decrease in DNA synthesis (32Harvey S.A. Anderson S.C. SundarRaj N.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our studies now show that Rock signaling regulates the G1/S-phase transition, at least in part via inhibition of the Tppp1/Hdac6 interaction. Our investigation into the role of Tppp1 in the regulation of the progression through mitosis into G1-phase demonstrates that Rock-mediated phosphorylation of Tppp1 alone does not inhibit this activity. However, further analysis of the Tppp1 regulatory pathways identified that it is a novel Cyclin B/Cdk1 substrate in vitro and a Cdk substrate in cells. The data presented here clearly show that Cdk-mediated Tppp1 phosphorylation inhibits its MT polymerizing activity in vitro and in cells, without affecting its Hdac6 regulatory activity. Finally, an integrated analysis of the role of Tppp1 phosphorylation by Rock and Cdk in the regulation of the transition of cells from mitosis into G1-phase shows that dual Tppp1 phosphorylation is necessary to completely inhibit Tppp1 activity and its regulation of mitosis. Although it appears that Tppp1 activity is regulated during the cell cycle via its sequential phosphorylation at late G1 by Rock to enable cells to transit into S-phase followed by its further phosphorylation at the G2/M-phase by cyclin B/Cdk1 enabling cells to re-enter G1-phase, the regulation of Tppp1 during the cell cycle is likely to be more complex. The results presented here and those of others demonstrate that the mitotic apparatus is enriched in acetylated MTs, suggesting that an increase in MT acetyltransferase activity or a reduction in deacetylase activity is crucial for the regulation of mitosis. Furthermore, Rock activity is required for the completion of mitosis (36Kosako H. Yoshida T. Matsumura F. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Inagaki M. Rho-kinase/ROCK is involved in cytokinesis through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and not ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at the cleavage furrow.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6059-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 37Lowery D.M.

Therefore, we propose a model whereby the cellular Tppp1 pool is phosphorylated or partially phosphorylated at late G1-phase by Rock to permit cells to enter S-phase, followed by synthesis of the new Tppp1 protein or its de-phosphorylation during G2-phase to re-establish its Hdac6 inhibitory activity and increase MT acetylation, enabling the formation of the stable mitotic apparatus. Finally, subsequent phosphorylation of Tppp1 during mitosis by Rock and cyclin B/Cdk1 completely inhibits its activity and enables cells to re-enter the G1-phase (Fig. 8). In summary, we establish a role for Tppp1 in the regulation of cell proliferation via inhibition of the entry of cells into S-phase and re-entry into G1-phase from mitosis, respectively. Tppp1 reduces the G1/S-phase transition through inhibition of Hdac6 activity, which modulates MT acetylation levels. Moreover, we discovered a novel Cdk-Tppp1 signaling pathway that inhibits Tppp1-mediated MT polymerization. Finally, we demonstrate that dual phosphorylation of Tppp1 by Rock and Cdk during mitosis is necessary to inhibit its activity and enable cells to re-enter the G1-phase."

However, mechanisms that underlie the invasion and persistence of non-CI strains are less well understood. Here, we established a spider mite Tetranychus phaselus population multiply infected by Cardinium as well as two distinct lineages of Wolbachia, designated wCon and wOri, to study the forces driving the spread of the non-CI strain of Wolbachia wOri. Interestingly, we found that wOri provided a longevity advantage to its female hosts under ideal conditions, making wOri stay longer in this population, and then being transmitted to more offspring. Furthermore, the lifespan of uninfected females was reduced when mated with multiple-infected males. As a result, the uninfected population is attenuated by the multiple-infected males. Thus, we infer that the host age effects of multiple infection may represent sufficient forces driving the spread of wOri through the host population."
https://openalex.org/W1965735691,"Any change in the invariant aspects of the auditory environment is of potential importance. The human brain preattentively or automatically detects such changes. The mismatch negativity (MMN) of event-related potentials (ERPs) reflects this initial stage of auditory change detection. The origin of MMN is held to be cortical. The hippocampus is associated with a later generated P3a of ERPs reflecting involuntarily attention switches towards auditory changes that are high in magnitude. The evidence for this cortico-hippocampal dichotomy is scarce, however. To shed further light on this issue, auditory cortical and hippocampal-system (CA1, dentate gyrus, subiculum) local-field potentials were recorded in urethane-anesthetized rats. A rare tone in duration (deviant) was interspersed with a repeated tone (standard). Two standard-to-standard (SSI) and standard-to-deviant (SDI) intervals (200 ms vs. 500 ms) were applied in different combinations to vary the observability of responses resembling MMN (mismatch responses). Mismatch responses were observed at 51.5-89 ms with the 500-ms SSI coupled with the 200-ms SDI but not with the three remaining combinations. Most importantly, the responses appeared in both the auditory-cortical and hippocampal locations. The findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a role in (cortical) manifestation of MMN."
https://openalex.org/W2029386427,"Group II introns are self-splicing RNAs that act as mobile retroelements in the organelles of plants, fungi and protists. They are also widely distributed in bacteria, and are generally assumed to be the ancestors of nuclear spliceosomal introns. Most bacterial group II introns have a multifunctional intron-encoded protein (IEP) ORF within the ribozyme domain IV (DIV). This ORF encodes an N-terminal reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, followed by a putative RNA-binding domain with RNA splicing or maturase activity and, in some cases, a C-terminal DNA-binding (D) region followed by a DNA endonuclease (En) domain. In this study, we focused on bacterial group II intron ORF phylogenetic classes containing only reverse transcriptase/maturase open reading frames, with no recognizable D/En region (classes A, C, D, E, F and unclassified introns). On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of the maturase domain and its C-terminal extension, which appears to be a signature characteristic of ORF phylogenetic class, with support from the phylogeny inferred from the RT domain, we have revised the proposed new class F, defining new intron ORF varieties. Our results increase knowledge of the lineage of group II introns encoding proteins lacking the En-domain."

Once they occur, proper DSB repair is required for cell survival and maintenance of genome integrity. DSBs can arise during normal cellular activities, such as metabolism and DNA replication, by exposure to exogenous DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation (IR) and various chemotherapeutic drugs, or as a programmed event during lymphocyte development and meiosis. DSBs are repaired by two major DSB repair mechanisms: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In somatic cells, HR operates primarily in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle during which neighboring sister chromatids are available as a repair template for potentially error-free HR, termed sister chromatid recombination (1.Johnson R.D. Jasin M. Sister chromatid gene conversion is a prominent double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2.Kadyk L.C.

HR defects often result in “chromatid-type” aberrations, including chromatid radial structures and chromatid breaks, and are associated with many human cancers (3.Helleday T.

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase family that also includes DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), serves as a master controller of the DSB response (5.Shiloh Y.

Upon DSBs, ATM is activated to phosphorylate a host of DSB response proteins, including histone H2A variant H2AX, MDC1, BRCA1, and NBS1 (5.Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Rapid phosphorylation of H2AX on serine 139 (Ser-139) of the C-terminal SQEY motif expands over a large chromatin domain flanking DSBs (6.Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. Megabase chromatin domains involved in DNA double-strand breaks in vivo.J.

Cells lacking ATM or H2AX exhibit DSB repair defects, genomic instability, radiosensitivity, and checkpoint dysfunction (5.Shiloh Y.

Cell. 2009; 34: 298-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), ATM may be responsible for this H2AX HR function. However, whether ATM has a function in HR independent of H2AX is not clear. Several lines of evidence support a role for ATM in HR. 1) Besides H2AX and MDC1, many HR factors, including BRCA1 and NBS1, are ATM substrates (5.Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins by ATM may regulate HR. 2) Because poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition selectively kill cells defective for HR (16.Martin S.A. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. DNA repair deficiency as a therapeutic target in cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), synthetic lethality caused by combined deficiency of ATM and PARP1 or PARP2 may be due to synergistic impacts on ATM-dependent HR and repair function of PARP1/2 (17.Ménisser-de Murcia J. Mark M. Wendling O. Wynshaw-Boris A. de Murcia G. Early embryonic lethality in PARP-1 Atm double-mutant mice suggests a functional synergy in cell proliferation during development.Mol. Cell.

PARP-1, PARP-2 and ATM in the DNA damage response: functional synergy in mouse development.DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In fact, cells carrying homozygous ATM kinase-dead mutations display HR defects and elevated sensitivity to PARP inhibition (19.Daniel J.A. Pellegrini M. Lee B.-S. Guo Z. Filsuf D. Belkina N.V.

Rohaly G. Mansour W.Y. Dikomey E. Dornreiter I. Dahm-Daphi J. Radiation-induced double-strand breaks require ATM but not Artemis for homologous recombination during S-phase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 8336-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22.Serrano, M.

Oncogene 10.1038/onc.2012.257Google Scholar). 4) In proliferating cells, although the majority (∼85%) of IR-induced DSBs are likely repaired by NHEJ with fast kinetics in an ATM-independent manner, repair of the remaining ∼15% of IR-induced DSBs is dependent upon ATM and has slower repair kinetics that may reflect either NHEJ-mediated repair in heterochromatin or a possible HR-directed postreplication repair process (23.Beucher A.

Unlike proliferating cells, Purkinje neurons require ATM for repairing the majority of IR-induced DSBs likely by NHEJ (27.Dar I. Yosha G. Elfassy R. Galron R. Wang Z.-Q. Shiloh Y. Barzilai A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 15361-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 5) ATM drives the ATM-to-ATR switch that may promote HR (28.Shiotani B. Zou L. Single-stranded DNA orchestrates an ATM-to-ATR switch at DNA breaks.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Despite this strong supposition of ATM HR function, there is evidence contradicting it. For example, high levels of spontaneous, unrepaired DSBs in ATM−/− cells are mainly chromosome breaks, which generally represent a deficiency in repairing prereplication DNA lesions by NHEJ (11.Franco S. Gostissa M. Zha S. Lombard D.B. Murphy M.M. Zarrin A.A. Yan C. Tepsuporn S. Morales J.C. Adams M.M. Lou Z. Bassing C.H. Manis J.P. Chen J. Carpenter P.B. Alt F.W.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9302-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, DNA lesions in H2AX−/− cells are equally divided between chromosome and chromatid breaks (11.Franco S. Gostissa M. Zha S. Lombard D.B. Murphy M.M. Zarrin A.A. Yan C. Tepsuporn S. Morales J.C. Adams M.M. Lou Z. Bassing C.H. Manis J.P. Chen J. Carpenter P.B. Alt F.W.

Sekiguchi J. Brush J.W. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Complementary functions of ATM and H2AX in development and suppression of genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9302-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Occurrence of chromatid breaks is at least in part due to inactivation of H2AX-dependent HR/sister chromatid recombination (10.Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Scully R. Control of sister chromatid recombination by histone H2AX.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1017-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this regard, the difference in genomic abnormalities between ATM−/− cells and H2AX−/− cells implies that H2AX HR function may be independent of ATM. In addition, it has been suggested that ATM is dispensable for HR in human embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells (30.Adams B.R. Golding S.E. Rao R.R. Valerie K. Dynamic dependence on ATR and ATM for double-strand break repair in human embryonic stem cells and neural descendants.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ATM and H2AX synergistically suppress genomic instability in mammalian cells (29.Zha S. Sekiguchi J. Brush J.W. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Complementary functions of ATM and H2AX in development and suppression of genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9302-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This synergistic impact may be partly mediated by their independent functions in HR. In this study, using ATM and H2AX double deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells carrying a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based HR reporter, we directly tested whether ATM has separable HR functions that are either H2AX-dependent or H2AX-independent. Because at least three possible fractions of γ-H2AX can be generated in response to DSBs, each by ATM, DNA-PKcs, and ATR, respectively, we investigated whether the ATM-dependent γ-H2AX fraction is responsible for H2AX-dependent HR. Surprisingly, we found that ATM is dispensable for HR and not even required for HR controlled by γ-H2AX. The ROSA26 targeting vector for the HR reporter and pcDNA3β-based expression vectors with the hygromycin-resistant (HygR) marker for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human H2AX, mouse MDC1 tandem BRCT domain (MDC1 BRCT), H2AX mutants, and MDC1 BRCT K1554M mutant were described previously (10.Xie A.

Adeno-Cre infection to generate isogenic ES reporter clones lacking either ATM or H2AX and transfection of mouse ES cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were performed as described before (10.Xie A.

To analyze histones, cells were first lysed using cytolysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100). Histones were then acid-extracted from pellets of cell lysates as described previously (10.Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Scully R.

To analyze the effect of small molecule inhibitors of ATM, DNA-PKcs, and ATR on IR or hydroxyurea (HU)-induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX and Chk1, cells were pretreated with drugs for 30 min at the doses indicated, irradiated with 10 Gy of IR or treated with 5 mm HU for 30 min, recovered for 30 min, and lysed for Western blotting. Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼5 × 106 cells using the Puregene DNA Isolation kit (Gentra Systems). Southern blotting analysis for correct gene targeting was performed on 5 μg of genomic DNA using a ROSA26 probe and a GFP probe as described before (10.Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I.

Specifically, mouse BRCA1flox/mut ES cells (34.Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J. Hickson I. Knights C. Martin N.M. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C.

Mixed cells were cultured for 1 day and treated the next day with either drugs for 18–20 h or IR at different doses. After culturing for another 5 days, percentages of viable GFP+ cells for each treatment were determined by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences SORP LSR II analyzer. Percentages of viable GFP− cells were derived and normalized with percentages of viable GFP− cells for the untreated set at 100%. Relative survival of each sample was then determined as percentage of control with relative survival of control normalized to 100%. Analysis of I-SceI-induced GFP+ frequencies in mouse HR reporter ES cells was performed as described previously (10.Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Scully R. Control of sister chromatid recombination by histone H2AX.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1017-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, each expression plasmid and the I-SceI plasmid were used in a 2:3 ratio. Transfection efficiencies were measured by parallel transfection of wild-type (WT) GFP expression vector at an amount that was one-tenth of that of total DNA. If drug treatment was required, drugs were added at 5 h post-transfection, replaced with fresh addition at 24 h, and removed at 48 h. I-SceI-induced GFP+ was measured at 72 or 96 h by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences SORP LSR II analyzer. Relative HR of tested cells was determined as percentage of control with relative HR of control normalized to 100%. Statistical comparisons between two unpaired populations and between paired samples were analyzed by Student's two-tailed unpaired t test (unknown variance) and two-tailed paired t test, respectively. To define the role of ATM in HR, including that controlled by H2AX, we targeted an HR reporter into the ROSA26 locus of mouse ATMflox/floxH2AXneo/neo ES cells (29.Zha S. Sekiguchi J. Brush J.W. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Complementary functions of ATM and H2AX in development and suppression of genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9302-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar to the HR reporter described previously (10.Xie A. Puget N. Shim I. Odate S. Jarzyna I. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Scully R. Control of sister chromatid recombination by histone H2AX.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 1017-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this HR reporter (Fig. 1A) contains two inactivated GFP copies, one (TrGFP) truncated at the 5′-end and the other (I-SceI-GFP) interrupted with an 18-bp recognition site for the rare cutting endonuclease I-SceI (35.Rouet P. Smih F. Jasin M. Introduction of double-strand breaks into the genome of mouse cells by expression of a rare-cutting endonuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8096-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Using TrGFP as a template, HR-directed repair of a site-specific chromosomal DSB induced by I-SceI cutting generates a WT GFP copy and thereby GFP+ cells (Fig. 1A). The frequency of I-SceI-induced GFP+ cells reflects HR efficiency. Following gene targeting, ATMflox/floxH2AXneo/neo ES reporter clones containing a single copy of the HR reporter at the ROSA26 locus were established and identified by Southern blot (supplemental Fig. S1). These clones exhibit a low frequency of spontaneous GFP+ cells (background) and a high frequency of I-SceI-induced GFP+ cells (supplemental Fig. S2A and data not shown). Using adenovirus encoding Cre-recombinase to delete ATM or H2AX through flanking loxP sites (29.Zha S. Sekiguchi J. Brush J.W. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Complementary functions of ATM and H2AX in development and suppression of genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

ATM deletion seemed to be always accompanied with H2AX deletion; as a result, we were unable to generate ATM−/−H2AX+/+ (A−H+) clones. Cells lacking either ATM or H2AX were identified by Western blot (supplemental Fig. S2B). I-SceI-induced HR assays were performed on isogenic A+H+, A+H−, and A−H− reporter clones (four clones for each genotype). To correct f"
https://openalex.org/W1987469905,"The inner ear develops from a patch of thickened cranial ectoderm adjacent to the hindbrain called the otic placode. Studies in a number of vertebrate species suggest that the initial steps in induction of the otic placode are regulated by members of the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family, and that inhibition of FGF signaling can prevent otic placode formation. To better understand the genetic pathways activated by FGF signaling during otic placode induction, we performed microarray experiments to estimate the proportion of chicken otic placode genes that can be up-regulated by the FGF pathway in a simple culture model of otic placode induction. Surprisingly, we find that FGF is only sufficient to induce about 15% of chick otic placode-specific genes in our experimental system. However, pharmacological blockade of the FGF pathway in cultured chick embryos showed that although FGF signaling was not sufficient to induce the majority of otic placode-specific genes, it was still necessary for their expression in vivo. These inhibitor experiments further suggest that the early steps in otic placode induction regulated by FGF signaling occur through the MAP kinase pathway. Although our work suggests that FGF signaling is necessary for otic placode induction, it demonstrates that other unidentified signaling pathways are required to co-operate with FGF signaling to induce the full otic placode program."

Then, a Mav I digested 107-bp KRAS gene fragment was directly introduced into the microfluidic device and analyzed by µCE, in which field amplified sample stacking (FASS) technique was employed to obtain the enrichment of the RFLP digestion products and extremely improved the sensitivity. The accurate analysis of KRAS statuses in HT29, LS174T, CCL187, SW480, Clone A, and CX-1 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines by µCE-based RFLP were achieved in 5 min with picoliter-scale sample consumption, and as low as 0.01% of mutant KRAS could be identified from a large excess of wild-type genomic DNA (gDNA). In 98 paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, KRAS codon 12 mutations were discovered in 28 (28.6%), significantly higher than that obtained by direct sequencing (13, 13.3%). Clone sequencing confirmed these results and showed this system could detect at least 0.4% of the mutant KRAS in CRC tissue slides. Compared with direct sequencing, the new finding of the µCE-based RFLP platform was that KRAS mutations in codon 12 were correlated with the patient’s age. In conclusion, we established a sensitive, fast, and cost-effective screening method for KRAS mutations, and successfully detected low-abundance KRAS mutations in clinical samples, which will allow provision of more precise individualized cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2122499426,"The human THP-1 cell line is widely used as an in vitro model system for studying macrophage differentiation and function. Conventional culture conditions for these cells consist of ambient oxygen pressure (∼20% v/v) and medium supplemented with the thiol 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and serum. In consideration of the redox activities of O₂ and 2-ME, and the extensive experimental evidence supporting a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the differentiation and function of macrophages, we addressed the question of whether culturing THP-1 cells under a more physiologically relevant oxygen tension (5% O₂) in the absence of 2-ME and serum would alter THP-1 cell physiology. Comparisons of cultures maintained in 18% O₂versus 5% O₂ indicated that reducing oxygen tension had no effect on the proliferation of undifferentiated THP-1 cells. However, decreasing the oxygen tension to 5% O₂ significantly increased the rate of phorbol ester-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophage-like cells as well as the metabolic activity of both undifferentiated and PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Removal of both 2-ME and serum from the medium decreased the proliferation of undifferentiated THP-1 cells but increased metabolic activity and the rate of differentiation under either oxygen tension. In differentiated THP-1 cells, lowering the oxygen tension to 5% O₂ decreased phagocytic activity, the constitutive release of β-hexosaminidase and LPS-induced NF-κB activation but enhanced LPS-stimulated release of cytokines. Collectively, these data demonstrate that oxygen tension influences THP-1 cell differentiation and primary macrophage functions, and suggest that culturing these cells under tightly regulated oxygen tension in the absence of exogenous reducing agent and serum is likely to provide a physiologically relevant baseline from which to study the role of the local redox environment in regulating THP-1 cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2021595496,"Controversy on whether local (deterministic) or regional (stochastic) factors control the structure of communities persists after decades of research. The main reason for why it has not been resolved may lie in the nature of evidence which largely comes from realized natural communities. In such communities assembly history leaves a mark that may support either set of factors. To avoid the confounding effects of assembly history we controlled for these effects experimentally. We created a null community by mixing 17 rock pool communities. We then divided the null community into replicates and distributed among treatments representing a gradient of factors from local to regional. We hypothesized that if deterministic factors dominate the assembly of communities, community structures should show a corresponding gradient from being very similar and convergent to dissimilar and divergent. In contrast, if local processes are predominantly stochastic in nature, such a gradient of community configurations should emerge even in the homogeneous setting. Our results appear to partially support both hypotheses and thus suggest that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of communities. Furthermore, we found that to satisfactorily explain patterns observed in natural communities environmental heterogeneity and regional processes must also be considered. In conclusion, although deterministic mechanisms seem to be important in the assembly of communities, in natural systems their signal may be diluted and masked whenever other factors exert meaningful influence. Such factors increase the number of possible paths to the point that the number of paths equals the number of communities in a metacommunity."
https://openalex.org/W2093462355,"Nurr1 (NR4A2) is a transcription factor that belongs to the orphan NR4A group of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Nurr1 plays key roles in the origin and maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons, and peripheral inflammatory processes. PIASγ, a SUMO-E3 ligase, represses Nurr1 transcriptional activity. We report that Nurr1 is SUMOylated by SUMO-2 in the lysine 91 located in the transcriptional activation function 1 domain of Nurr1. Nurr1 SUMOylation by SUMO-2 is markedly facilitated by overexpressing wild type PIASγ, but not by a mutant form of PIASγ lacking its first LXXLL motif (PIASγmut1). This PIASγmut1 is also unable to interact with Nurr1 and to repress Nurr1 transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the mutant PIASγC342A that lacks SUMO ligase activity is still able to significantly repress Nurr1-dependent transcriptional activity, but not to enhance Nurr1 SUMOylation. A SUMOylation-deficient Nurr1 mutant displays higher transcriptional activity than the wild type Nurr1 only in promoters harboring more than one Nurr1 response element. Furthermore, lysine 91, the major target of Nurr1 SUMOylation is contained in a canonical synergy control motif, indicating that SUMO-2 posttranslational modification of Nurr1 regulates its transcriptional synergy in complex promoters. In conclusion, PIASγ can exert two types of negative regulations over Nurr1. On one hand, PIASγ limits Nurr1 transactivation in complex promoters by SUMOylating its lysine 91. On the other hand, PIASγ fully represses Nurr1 transactivation through a direct interaction, independently of its E3-ligase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1976838704,"Objective Pain without known pathology, termed “functional pain,” causes much school absenteeism, medication usage, and medical visits. Yet which adolescents are at risk is not well understood. Functional pain has been linked to childhood abuse, and sexual orientation minority youth (gay, lesbian, bisexual, “mostly heterosexual,” and heterosexual with same-sex sexual contact) are more likely to be victims of childhood abuse than heterosexuals, thus may be at greater risk of functional pain. Methods We examined sexual orientation differences in past-year prevalence of functional headache, pelvic, and abdominal pain and multiple sites of pain in 9,864 young adults (mean age = 23 years) from a large U.S. cohort. We examined whether childhood abuse accounted for possible increased risk of functional pain in sexual minority youth. Results Sexual minority youth, except for gays and lesbians, were at higher risk of functional pelvic and abdominal pain and multiple sites of pain than heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian youth had elevated prevalence only of abdominal pain. Childhood abuse accounted for 14% to 33% of increased experience of multiple sites of pain in minority youth. Conclusions Youth who identify as “mostly heterosexual” or bisexual or who identify as heterosexual and have had same-sex partners comprised 18% of our sample. Clinicians should be aware that patients with these orientations are at elevated risk of functional pain and may be in need of treatment for sequelae of childhood abuse. Conventional categorization of sexual orientation as heterosexual or homosexual may fail to distinguish a large number of youth who do not wholly identify with either group and may be at elevated risk of health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2041758174,"Although P. aeruginosa is especially dangerous in cystic fibrosis (CF), there is no consensus as to how it kills representative cell types that are of key importance in the lung. This study concerns the acute toxicity of the sequenced strain, PAO1, toward a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Toxicity requires brief contact with the target cell, but is then delayed for more than 12 h. None of the classical toxic effectors of this organism is required and cell death occurs without phagocytosis or acute perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton. Apoptosis is not required for toxicity toward either RAW 264.7 cells or for alveolar macrophages. Transcriptional profiling shows that encounter between PAO1 and RAW 264.7 cells elicits an early inflammatory response, followed by growth arrest. As an independent strategy to understand the mechanism of toxicity, we selected variant RAW 264.7 cells that resist PAO1. Upon exposure to P. aeruginosa, they are hyper-responsive with regard to classical inflammatory cytokine production and show transient downregulation of transcripts that are required for cell growth. They do not show obvious morphologic changes. Although they do not increase interferon transcripts, when exposed to PAO1 they dramatically upregulate a subset of the responses that are characteristic of exposure to g-interferon, including several guanylate-binding proteins. The present observations provide a novel foundation for learning how to equip cells with resistance to a complex challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2075370937,"Background Women who smoke have higher risk of lung function impairment, COPD and lung cancer than smoking men. An influence of sex hormones has been demonstrated, but the mechanisms are unclear and the associations often subject to confounding. This was a study of wheeze in relation to smoking and sex with adjustment for important confounders. Methods In 2008 the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) questionnaire was mailed to 45.000 Swedes (age 16–75 years), and 26.851 (60%) participated. “Any wheeze”: any wheeze during the last 12 months. “Asthmatic wheeze”: wheeze with breathlessness apart from colds. Results Any wheeze and asthmatic wheeze was reported by 17.3% and 7.1% of women, vs. 15.8% and 6.1% of men (both p<0.001). Although smoking prevalence was similar in both sexes, men had greater cumulative exposure, 16.2 pack-years vs. 12.8 in women (p<0.001). Most other exposures and characteristics associated with wheeze were significantly overrepresented in men. Adjusted for these potential confounders and pack-years, current smoking was a stronger risk factor for any wheeze in women aged <53 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.85 (1.56–2.19) vs. 1.60 (1.30–1.96) in men. Cumulative smoke exposure and current smoking each interacted significantly with female sex, aOR 1.02 per pack-year (p<0.01) and aOR 1.28 (p = 0.04) respectively. Female compared to male current smokers also had greater risk of asthmatic wheeze, aOR 1.53 vs. 1.03, interaction aOR 1.52 (p = 0.02). These interactions were not seen in age ≥53 years. Discussion In addition to the increased risk of COPD and lung cancer female, compared to male, smokers are at greater risk of significant wheezing symptoms in younger age. This became clearer after adjustment for important confounders including cumulative smoke exposure. Estrogen has previously been shown to increase the bioactivation of several compounds in tobacco smoke, which may enhance smoke-induced airway inflammation in fertile women."
https://openalex.org/W2017404805,"Background The duration of sounds can affect the perceived duration of co-occurring visual stimuli. However, it is unclear whether this is limited to amodal processes of duration perception or affects other non-temporal qualities of visual perception. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we tested the hypothesis that visual sensitivity - rather than only the perceived duration of visual stimuli - can be affected by the duration of co-occurring sounds. We found that visual detection sensitivity (d’) for unimodal stimuli was higher for stimuli of longer duration. Crucially, in a cross-modal condition, we replicated previous unimodal findings, observing that visual sensitivity was shaped by the duration of co-occurring sounds. When short visual stimuli (∼24 ms) were accompanied by sounds of matching duration, visual sensitivity was decreased relative to the unimodal visual condition. However, when the same visual stimuli were accompanied by longer auditory stimuli (∼60–96 ms), visual sensitivity was increased relative to the performance for ∼24 ms auditory stimuli. Across participants, this sensitivity enhancement was observed within a critical time window of ∼60–96 ms. Moreover, the amplitude of this effect correlated with visual sensitivity enhancement found for longer lasting visual stimuli across participants. Conclusions/Significance Our findings show that the duration of co-occurring sounds affects visual perception; it changes visual sensitivity in a similar way as altering the (actual) duration of the visual stimuli does."
https://openalex.org/W1975741781,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer fatalities worldwide, with limited treatment options and five year survival rates of between <5 and 15%. To address this medical need, we conducted a screen of a drug-like small molecule library for HCC-selective cytotoxins. We report here the identification of a disubstituted aminothiazole termed HBF-0079, with remarkable selective toxicity for HCC-derived cell lines versus non-HCC liver lines and most other cancer lines. HBF-0079 caused irreversible growth arrest and apoptosis of the HCC lines Huh7, Hep3B, HepaRG as well as the hepatoblastoma line HepG2, with CC₅₀ values from ∼0.7-7.7 µM, while more than 45 µM was needed to achieve CC₅₀ values for the immortalized normal hepatocyte lines THLE-2 and PH5CH. Of the sixty cancer lines from the National Cancer Institute panel, only five exhibited >50% growth inhibition by HBF-0079. In Huh7 cells, HBF-0079 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 and concomitant apoptosis, and its effects were irreversible after removal of the compound. These observations corroborate a loss of AKT phosphorylation at the mTORC2-targeted residue S473, with concurrent loss of phosphorylation of the mTORC1 targets SK6 and 4EBP1 in Huh7 but not PH5CH cells. Finally, growth of Hep3B-derived tumors in a murine xenograft model was significantly repressed by the compound through either systemic or intratumoral administration of formulated HBF-0079. The potential for development of this drug candidate is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2053870751,"Background Periodontal infections are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this link are yet unclear. Here, we evaluate the in vivo effects of bacteremia with a periodontal pathogen on endothelial progenitors, bone marrow-derived cells capable of endothelial regeneration, and delineate the critical pathways for these effects. Methods 12-week old C57bl6 wildtype or toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 deficient mice were repeatedly intravenously challenged with 109 live P. gingivalis 381 or vehicle. Numbers of Sca1+/flk1+ progenitors, circulating angiogenic cells, CFU-Hill, and late-outgrowth EPC were measured by FACS/culture. Endothelial function was assessed using isolated organ baths, reendothelization was measured in a carotid injury model. RANKL/osteoprotegerin levels were assessed by ELISA/qPCR. Results In wildtype mice challenged with intravenous P.gingivalis, numbers of Sca1+/flk1+ progenitors, CAC, CFU-Hill, and late-outgrowth EPC were strongly increased in peripheral circulation and spleen, whereas Sca1+/flk1+ progenitor numbers in bone marrow decreased. Circulating EPCs were functional, as indicated by improved endothelial function and improved reendothelization in infected mice. The osteoprotegerin/RANKL ratio was increased after P. gingivalis challenge in the bone marrow niche of wildtype mice and late-outgrowth EPC in vitro. Conversely, in mice deficient in TLR2, no increase in progenitor mobilization or osteoprotegerin/RANKL ratio was detected. Conclusion Recurrent transient bacteremias, a feature of periodontitis, increase peripheral EPC counts and decrease EPC pools in the bone marrow, thereby possibly reducing overall endothelial regeneration capacity, conceivably explaining pro-atherogenic properties of periodontal infections. These effects are seemingly mediated by toll-like receptor (TLR)-2."
https://openalex.org/W1986110688,"The tumor-suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2 are mutated in tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a protein complex that inhibits the signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) pathway. mTORC1 is a crucial molecule in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and survival. When the TSC1/TSC2 complex is not functional, uncontrolled mTORC1 activity accelerates the cell cycle and triggers tumorigenesis. Recent studies have suggested that TSC1 and TSC2 also regulate the activities of Rac1 and Rho, members of the Rho family of small GTPases, and thereby influence the ensuing actin cytoskeletal organization at focal adhesions. However, how TSC1 contributes to the establishment of cell polarity is not well understood. Here, the relationship between TSC1 and the formation of the actin cytoskeleton was analyzed in stable TSC1-expressing cell lines originally established from a Tsc1-deficient mouse renal tumor cell line. Our analyses showed that cell proliferation and migration were suppressed when TSC1 was expressed. Rac1 activity in these cells was also decreased as was formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. Furthermore, the number of basal actin stress fibers was reduced; by contrast, apical actin fibers, originating at the level of the tight junction formed a network in TSC1-expressing cells. Treatment with Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor diminished the number of apical actin fibers, but rapamycin had no effect. Thus, the actin fibers were regulated by the Rho-ROCK pathway independently of mTOR. In addition, apical actin fibers appeared in TSC1-deficient cells after inhibition of Rac1 activity. These results suggest that TSC1 regulates cell polarity-associated formation of actin fibers through the spatial regulation of Rho family of small GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W1988081516,"The CCR5 chemokine receptor is a rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor that mediates the effects of pro-inflammatory β-chemokines. CCR5 is also the major co-receptor for entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into human cells. G protein-coupled receptors exist in ensembles of active and inactive conformations. Active receptor conformations can be stabilized by mutations. Although binding of the HIV envelope protein to CCR5 stimulates cellular signaling, the CCR5 conformation that induces fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes is not known. We mutated conserved amino acids to generate constitutively active CCR5 receptors, which are stabilized in active conformations, and tested the ability of constitutively active CCR5 receptors to mediate HIV envelope-directed membrane fusion. Mutation of the Asp³·⁴⁹(¹²⁵) and Arg⁶·³²(²²⁵) residues of CCR5 did not cause constitutive activity, but Lys or Pro substitutions for Thr²·⁵⁶(⁸²), in the TxP motif, caused high basal inositol phosphate signaling. Signaling did not increase in response to MIP-1β, suggesting that the Thr²·⁵⁶(⁸²) mutants were fully stabilized in active conformations. The Thr²·⁵⁶(⁸²)Lys mutation severely decreased cell surface CCR5 expression. Combining the Thr²·⁵⁶(⁸²)Lys mutation with an Arg⁶·³²(²²⁵)Gln mutation partially reversed the decrease in expression. Mutants with Thr²·⁵⁶(⁸²)Lys substitutions were poor mediators of HIV envelope-directed membrane fusion, but mutants with the Thr²·⁶⁵(⁸²)Pro substitution exhibited full co-receptor function. Our results suggest that the Thr²·⁶⁵(⁸²)Lys and Thr²·⁶⁵(⁸²)Pro mutations stabilize distinct constitutively active CCR5 conformations. Lys in position 2.65(82) stabilizes activated receptor conformations that appear to be constitutively internalized and do not induce envelope-dependent membrane fusion, whereas Pro stabilizes activated conformations that are not constitutively internalized and fully mediate envelope-directed membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2000749314,"High susceptibility of the African population to develop cardiovascular disease obliges us to investigate possible contributing risk factors. Our aim was to determine whether low 25(OH)D status is associated with increased blood pressure and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity in black South African women. We studied 291 urban women (mean age: 57.56±9.00 yrs.). 25(OH)D status was determined by serum 25(OH)D levels. Women were stratified into sufficient (>30 ng/ml), and insufficient/deficient (<30 ng/ml) groups. Cardiovascular variables were compared between groups. Women with low 25(OH)D levels had significantly higher SBP (150.8±27.1 vs. 137.6±21.0), DBP (94.7±14.5 vs. 89.3±12.3) and PP (53.15(50.7;55.7) vs. 46.3(29.4;84.6)) compared to women with sufficient levels. No significant difference was observed with regards to c-rPWV. ANCOVA analyses still revealed significant differences between the two groups with regards to SBP, DBP as well as PP. Partial correlations revealed significant inverse association between SBP and 25(OH)D (p = .04;r = -.12). Women with low 25(OH)D levels were ∼2 times more likely to have high SBP (95% CI: 3.23;1.05). To conclude, women with deficient/insufficient 25(OH)D had significantly higher SBP compared to women with a sufficient 25(OH) status."
https://openalex.org/W2053821814,"LIGHT/TNFSF14 is a costimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells for activation and maintenance of T cell homeostasis. LIGHT over expressed in T cells also down regulates hepatic lipase levels in mice through lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling. It is unclear whether LIGHT regulates hepatic lipase directly by interacting with LTβR expressing cells in the liver or indirectly by activation of T cells, and whether Kupffer cells, a major cell populations in the liver that expresses the LTβR, are required. Here we report that LIGHT expression via an adenoviral vector (Ad-LIGHT) is sufficient to down regulate hepatic lipase expression in mice. Depletion of Kupffer cells using clodronate liposomes had no effect on LIGHT-mediated down regulation of hepatic lipase. LIGHT-mediated regulation of hepatic lipase is also independent of LIGHT expression by T cells or activation of T cells. This is demonstrated by the decreased hepatic lipase expression in the liver of Ad-LIGHT infected recombination activating gene deficient mice that lack mature T cells and by the Ad-LIGHT infection of primary hepatocytes. Hepatic lipase expression was not responsive to LIGHT when mice lacking LTβR globally or only on hepatocytes were infected with Ad-LIGHT. Therefore, our data argues that interaction of LIGHT with LTβR on hepatocytes, but not Kupffer cells, is sufficient to down regulate hepatic lipase expression and that this effect can be independent of LIGHT's costimulatory function."

No clear biological or physiological data exist for Kif6. We sought to investigate the impact of a deleterious KIF6 mutation on cardiac function in mice. Kif6 mutant mice were generated and verified. Cardiac function was assessed by serial echocardiography at baseline, after ageing and after exercise. Lipid levels were also measured. No discernable adverse lipid or cardiac phenotype was detected in Kif6 mutant mice. These data suggest that dysfunction of Kif6 is linked to other more complex biological/biochemical parameters or is unlikely to be of material consequence in cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2153710594,"The functional role of the C2 insert of nonmuscle myosin II-C (NM II-C) is poorly understood. Here, we report for the first time that the expression of the C2 insert-containing isoform, NM II-C1C2, is inducible in Neuro-2a cells during differentiation both at mRNA and protein levels. Immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis reveal that expression of NM II-C1C2 peaks between days 3 and 6 of differentiation. Localization of NM II-C1C2 in Neuro-2a cells suggests that the C2 insert-containing isoform is localized in the cytosol and along the neurites, specifically at the adherence point to substratum. Inhibition of endogenous NM II-C1C2 using siRNA decreases the neurite length by 43% compared with control cells treated with nonspecific siRNA. Time lapse image analysis reveals that neurites of C2-siRNA-treated cells have a net negative change in neurite length per minute, leading to a reduction of overall neurite length. During neuritogenesis, NM II-C1C2 can interact and colocalize with β1-integrin in neurites. Altogether, these studies indicate that NM II-C1C2 may be involved in stabilizing neurites by maintaining their structure at adhesion sites."

Navigation is based upon the fundamental assumption of a ubiquitous Preference for the Nearest of otherwise equivalent navigational goals (PfN). However, the magnitude and triggers for PfN are unknown and there is no clear evidence that PfN exists. I tested for PfN in human participants on a retrieval task. Results of these experiments provide the first evidence for PfN. Further, these data quantify the three primary PfN triggers and provide an experimental structure for using PfN as a behavioral metric across domains. Surprisingly, PfN exists at a high, but not universal, magnitude. Further, PfN derives most from the absolute distance to the farthest of multiple goals (df), with little influence of the distance to the nearest goal (dn). These data provide previously unavailable quantification of behavioral motivation across species and may provide a measurable index of selection. These methods hold particular import for behavioral modification because proximity is a powerful determinant of decision outcomes across most behaviors."
