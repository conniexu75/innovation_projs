https://openalex.org/W1516077580,"During the purification of rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 (P-450LM), evidence was obtained for the occurrence of at least four distinct forms. These were distinguished by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence or absence of mercaptoethanol and were shown to have characteristic spectra as the reduced carbon monoxide complexes. They are designated by their relative electrophoretic mobilities. P-450LM2, which was purified to apparent homogeneity, is induced by phenobarbital and has a subunit molecular weight of 50,000. P-450LM4, which was also extensively purified, is induced by beta-naphthoflavone and has a molecular weight of 54,000. P-450LM1,7, which is induced neither by phenobarbital nor beta-naphthoflavone, is a mixtureMIXTURE OF ABOUT EQUAL AMOUNTS OF TWO FORMS WITH MOLECULAR WEIGHTS OF 47,000 AND 60,000 RESPECTIVELY. Some preparations were obtained containing primarily P-450LM1 or P-450LM7. Benzphetamine, ethylmorphine, and p-nitroanisole are hydroxylated preferentially by P-450LM2, and benzpyrene by P-450LM1,7. Biphenyl is hydroxylated in both positions 2 and 4 by all of the preparations, but the latter position is strongly favored by the action of P-450LM2. Testosterone is hydroxylated primarily in position 16alpha by P-450LM2 and in position 6beta by P-450LM1,7. Although the occurrence of additional forms of the cytochrome with highly similar electrophoretic behavior is not ruled out, it appears that the presence of these forms differing in subunit molecular weight may account for the variety of catalytic activities attributed to this pigment of liver microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1499573413,"Incubation of monolayers of cultured human fibroblasts with oxygenated sterols (25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, or 6-ketocholestanol) markedly enhanced the rate at which the cells esterified their endogenous cholesterol and produced an increase in the cellular content of cholesterol esters. The enhanced esterification capacity was associated with an increase in the activity of a membrane-bound fatty acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase. Incubation of cells for 5 hours with 5 mug/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol produced an 8-fold increase in the specific activity of this enzyme when assayed in cell-free extracts. Since the oxygenated sterols that elevated the activity of fatty acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyl-transferase also suppressed the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the data suggest that the processes of cholesterol ester formation and cholesterol synthesis in human fibroblasts are regulated in a reciprocal manner by coordinate changes in the activities of these two membrane-bound enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2091357535,"Defining the units in which the eucaryotic genome is transcribed and translated is central to any analysis of eucaryotic gene expression. The relationship between heterogeneous nuclear RNA and messenger RNA raises the question of whether the primary transcript may be more complex than the sequence which is translated; as I concluded last month in the first part of this review, kinetic analyses of these two RNA populations provide some suggestive indications but cannot prove whether the nuclear population includes messenger precursors that are much longer than mature cytoplasmic messengers (Lewin, 1975). Here I discuss recent analyses of the sequence components present in hnRNA and mRNA and how they may be related to each other and to the organization of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1594872187,"The administration of cobalt to rats caused a marked increase in the oxidative degradation of heme (hematin, iron protoporphyrin-IX) BY HEPATIC MICROSOMAL ENZYMES. The onset of this enzyme stimulation was very rapid, beginning within 2 hours after injection of the metal and reaching its maximum in 16 to 24 hours. During the rapid phase of stimulation, i.e. the first 2 to 4 hours, when heme oxidation was 450% above control values, there was a significant decrease in microsomal oxidative N-demethylation activity and in microsomal oxidative Ndemethylation activity and in microsomal content of heme with an insignificant decrease in cytochrome P-450 content. Within 24 hours the oxidative activity of the microsomal electron transport chain for drugs was decreased to about 30% of the control. However, during the same period the oxidation of heme approached levels 800% above control. During this period there was a further decrease in the microsomal content of heme with a significant decrease in cytochrome P-450 content and an increase in the activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase. The activity of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase reached its maximum within 8 hours after cobalt treatment. Repeated injections (at 24-hour intervals) of cobalt were necessary to maintain these changes in microsomal enzyme activities since, after single injections of the metal, these parameters returned to normal within 72 hours. The inducing effect of cobalt on the oxidation of heme could be inhibited by the administration of actinomycin D and puromycin. Furthermore, this stimulatory effect could not be elicited by in vitro treatment of microsomes with cobalt nor could the effect be attributed to any soluble components of the cytoplasm. Cobalt protoporphyrin-IX was less effective than cobalt chloride in stimulating heme oxidation. 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole did not enhance hepatic heme oxidation activity, while allylisopropylacetamide decreased this activity. The oxidative degradation of heme was found not to be cytochrome P-450 dependent since the highly increased levels of heme oxidation in microsomes from cobalt-treated animals could be retained despite the fact that the cytochrome P-450 content of such microsomes was decreased to spectrally undetectable amounts and drug oxidation was eliminated by treatment of the microsomes with 4 M urea. These findings exclude an obligatory role for cytochrome P-450 in the oxidation of heme compounds, although the possibility that this process is a heme-dependent oxidation is not ruled out."

https://openalex.org/W1498794674,"In comparison to normal prothrombin, the abnormal prothrombin produced in response to vitamin K antagonists has been found to bind much less tightly, if at all, to phospholipid surfaces. As a consequence, the activation of abnormal prothrombin by Factor Xa and Ca2+ is not accelerated by the addition of phospholipid to the mixture while the activation of normal prothrombin under these conditions is greatly accelerated by phospholipid addition. In the absence of phospholipid, however, the rate of activation of abnormal prothrombin by Factor Xa and Ca2+ in both the presence and absence of Factor Va is indistinguishable from that of normal prothrombin. The distribution of the partial proteolysis products during activation by Factors Xa, Va, and Ca2+ also appears to be the same for both prothrombins. These observations provide an explanation for the function in prothrombin activation of the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues formed in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2082402740,The theory of demographic transition as it was originally applied to nineteenth century Europe is explained in some detail. When analyzed with nineteenth century European data the theory is empirically supported at the highest level of generality. The theory fails to explain differentials in overall fertility levels among various pretransition European countries. It also does not take into account differences in timing of onset and pace of fertility declines in these several countries. The explanatory and predictive functions of the theory when applied to modern-day Asian African and Latin American countries is examined. Factors such as present high levels of pretransition fertility and international migration militate against so-called natural fertility declines. Certain differences between the situation of European transition and that of modern developing countries such as the accelerated pace of socioeconomic development favor more rapid fertility declines. Today the question of population has become politicized and cannot be considered in wholly scientific terms.
https://openalex.org/W1519298936,"L-[14C]Iduronic acid-containing sulfated galactosaminoglycans were formed by incubation of a fibroblast particulate fraction with UDP-D[14C]glucuronic acid, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, and sulfate donor (3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate). The formation of L-iduronic acid was strongly promoted by concomitant sulfation of the polymer. In the absence of sulfate donor 5 to 10% of the [14C]uronic acid residues were L-iduronic acid. However, when 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate was included in the incubation mixture the amount of L-iduronic acid in the product increased 3 to 5-fold. Furthermore, approximately the same quantity of L-[14C]iduronic acid was recovered from the product formed in a pulse-chase experiment where incorporation of 14C-isotope preceded sulfation. It was therefore concluded that C-5 inversion of D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid occurred on the polymer level as shown previously for the biosynthesis of heparin (Hook, M., Lindahl, U., Backstrom, G., Malmstrom, A., AND Fransson, L-A., J. Biol. Chem. (1974) 249, 3908). This conclusion was supported by the finding that no L[14C]iduronic acid could be detected in the UDP-hexuronic acid pool during this experiment. Nonsulfated and sulfated [14C]galactosaminoglycan products were degraded separately with chondroitinase-AC. The non-sulfated products afforded primarily disaccharide and a small amount of tetrasaccharide, while the sulfated products yielded, in addition, a considerable amount of larger oligosaccharides. Tetrasaccharides from nonsulfated products contained L-iduronic acid indicating that C-5 inversion at solitary sites can occur in the absence of sulfation of adjacent hexosamine moieties. The larger oligosaccharides obtained after chondroitinase-AC digestion of sulfated products yielded L-iduronic acid upon acid hydrolysis and were susceptible to chondroitinase-ABC digestion. The split products were almost exclusively 4-sulfated disaccharides. These results demonstrate that formation of blocks of L-iduronic acid-containing repeat periods is associated with 4-sulfation of adjacent hexosamine moieties."
https://openalex.org/W2066705273,"Sixteen virus-specific polypeptides have been resolved in reovirus-infected mouse L cells by using SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of these, ten have been designated as primary products of the genome by the following criteria: they are present in lysates of infected cells labeled for a short time; they co-migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels with polypeptides synthesized in cell-free-extracts of wheat germ in response to purified viral mRNA; and their molecular weights correspond to the values expected if all ten reovirus mRNA species are monocistronic. Reovirus mRNA species lack 3' poly(A) but are translated into proteins of the expected size. The pattern of synthesis of the primary gene products observed in vitro mimicks that observed in reovirus-infected cells suggesting that the structure of the mRNA may profoundly influence its translation. The results further indicate that there is little, if any, exclusively regulatory information in the reovirus genome since both in vivo and in vitro, transcripts of the ten genome segments direct the synthesis of ten polypeptides that presumably correspond to the primary gene products. The expression of the reovirus genome thus appears to be complete."

https://openalex.org/W1558731734,"The structure of rat proalbumin, a liver precursor to rat serum albumin, has been determined to consist of the hexapeptide Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg attached to the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide chain of rat serum albumin. Edman degradation of a proalbumin preparation for 14 rounds gave the major sequence Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg-Glu-Ala-His-Lys-Ser-Glu-Ile-Ala. A comparison of cyanogen bromide fragments suggests that these two proteins differ only in this respect. On treatment with cyanogen bromide, these proteins gave three classes of peptides with molecular weights of 30,000, 10,000, and smaller than or equal to 5,000. A combination of gel filtration, electrofocusing, and ion exchange established that these peptides were indistinguishable, with exception of those of 10,000 molecular weight. By amino acid and sequence analyses this fraction from rat serum albumin was found to be the NH2-terminal fragment. Radiochemical amino acid and sequence analyses show that the NH2-terminal hexapeptide is the major fragment released from proalbumin by limited tryptic hydrolysis. The protein that remains cannot be distinguished from rat serum albumin."

It is estimated that the enzyme is between 85 and 90% pure and has a molecular weight of 230, 000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis shows that the enzyme is composed of two subunits very close in molecular weight (57, 500 and 60, 900). The substrate specificity and the reaction stoichiometry catalyzed by the enzyme in the presence of 6, 7-dimethyltetrahydropterin, 6-methyltetrahydropterin, and tetrahydrobiopterin have been determined. The effect of some natural occurring phospholipids on the purified enzyme was investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1591369875,"In these studies intestinal lipoproteins were injected intravenously into recipient rats in order to study the kinetic characteristics of cholesterol uptake by the liver cell and inhibition of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Net cholesterol uptake from circulating intestinal lipoproteins took place only in the liver, and only this tissue manifested inhibition of cholesterol syntheses. Cholesterol uptake by the liver, quantified by a rise in the cholesterol ester content, was a linear function of time and of the amount of lipoprotein cholesterol administered to the animals. Using groups of rats that were either fed cholesterol or injected intravenously with intestinal lipoproteins as a bolus or as a continuous infusion, there was generally a correlation between inhibition of the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the cholesterol ester content of the liver. However, there was no consistent quantitative relationship between these two variables suggesting either that cholesterol ester was not the immediate effector of the inhibition or, alternatively, that there was intracellular localization of the effector at the site of control of the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterogenic pathway."

This is the first uniflagellate spermatozoon known in the Turbellaria; it is indicative of the primitiveness of Nemertoderma and is evidence in support of the view that the Turbellaria as a whole are among the most primitive living Bilateria."
https://openalex.org/W2027011687,"As an initial step towards understanding the role of mRNP complexes in translational regulation during compensatory renal hypertrophy, characteristics of polysome-associated mRNP isolated by affinity chromatography were studied. Renal mRNP contained 15-30 percent of the counts after a 1 hr pulse with -3H-orotic acid; it sedimented mainly between 10S and 100S and had a buoyant density of 1.42-1.44 g/cm-3. RNA derived from the mRNP sedimented between 5S and 40S on sucrose density gradients, with the greatest radioactivity in the region of 15S. After labeling with -3H-adenine for 1 hr, up to 17 percent of the radioactivity present in the mRNP-associated RNA was resistant to digestion by pancreatic and T1 ribonucleases. The mRNP protein moiety contained six polypeptides with molecular weights 69,000, 75,000, 80,000, 100,000, 109,000, and 118,000 daltons, which were undetected in the material not binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose."

https://openalex.org/W1570468181,"The hemocyanins from molluscs and from arthropods differ in the size of their polypeptide chains. A variety of physical techniques including sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and column chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate and guanidine HCl indicate that the polypeptide chain of mollusc hemocyanin has a molecular weight of 290,000. These results were corroborated by quantitative end group analyses. Several experiments designed to count the number of tryptophan and methionine-containing peptides in the hemocyanin from the whelk Busycon canaliculatum indicate that sequence homology within the polypeptide chain of the mollusc hemocyanins accounts for their large size. Digestion of the native protein with subtilisin produces a 50,000-dalton fragment in high yield which corresponds to one binding site for oxygen. On the other hand, the polypeptide chain molecular weight of lobster hemocyanin is 76,000 to 78,000 and this seems to be a general property of all arthropod hemocyanins. The pigment from lobster consists of two very similar polypeptide chains which are not present in equal amount. Analysis of the cysteine-containing and of the tryptophan-containing tryptic peptides confirms the value of the molecular weight. However, separation of fragments which contain methionine indicates that there is sequence homology withing the polypeptide chain of this protein. It is concluded that the mollusc and arthropod hemocyanins have little structural similarity."
https://openalex.org/W1572454990,"N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibits the transport of phosphate in mitochondria but is without effect on permeation of other metabolities. In spite of its specificity for inhibition of phosphate transport, NEM reacts in an unspecific manner with inner membrane proteins in general. Treatment of mitochondria with [3H]NEM just sufficient to produce inhibition of phosphate transport results in labeling of at least 10 polypeptide components of the inner membrane. A marked increase in the specificity of reaction of NEM for components of the phosphate transport system is attained by first protecting the transport system with p-mercuribenzoate (p-MB) and then by irreversibly blocking reactive sulfhydryl groups unassociated with transport by the addition of unlabeled NEM. Subsequent addition of dithiothreitol removes p-MB and restores 65 to 75 percent of the original phosphate transport activity. Reinhibition of transport with [3H]NEM results in both a 6-fold decrease in the amount of [3H]NEM bound by purified inner membrane vesicles and a substantial reduction in the number of labeled polypeptide components. Five distinct labeled species are detected by this method, one of which is a 32,000 molecular weight protein containing 40 percent of the bound radioactivity, or approximately 160 pmol/mg of inner membrane protein. Correlation of binding of [3H]NEM by inner membrane proteins with inhibition of phosphate transport suggests that the maximum concentration of the NEM-sensitive component of the phosphate transport system is 60 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. This value, when combined with V-max of NEM-sensitive transport of 205 nmol times min-1 times mg-1 at O degrees (Coty, W. A., and Pedersen, P. L. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2593) yields an approximate minimum turnover for this process of 3500 min-1 at 0 degrees. This turnover number is at least 20-fold greater than similarly calculated values for adenine nucleotide transport and succinate oxidation in rat liver mitochondria at this temperature. Taken together these results suggest that the NEM-sensitive phosphate transport system in rat liver mitochondria has an unusually high catalytic activity compared to other mitochondrial processes, and that at least one of the five NEM-binding proteins is likely to be an essential component of this transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1479774356,"Abstract N-Methylglutamate synthetase, reconstituted from apo-protein with 5-deazaFMN, catalyzes the reversible formation of N-methylglutamate via the same two-step mechanism previously elucidated for native enzyme (Reactions 1 and 2).(See article).This conclusion is based on the observation that: 1. Enzyme-bound deazaFMN (gamma-max equals 410, 338, epsilon410 equals 10,400 m-minus 1 cm-minus 1) is reduced by L-glutamate, N-methyl-L-glutamate but not D-glutamate. At saturating concentrations of L-glutamate Reaction 1 proceeds at 1% of the rate observed with FMN-reconstituted enzyme. 2. Substrate-reduced deazaFMN enzyme is reoxidized by methylamine or ammonia. 3. A glutaryl enzyme intermediate, isolated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, contains radioactivity when prepared from [U-14C]glutamate, [alpha-3H]glutamate, or N-[glutaryl U-14C]methylglutamate; however, this intermediate is not labeled from N[methyl 14C]methylglutamate. 4. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the intermediate is stoichiometric with the amount of deazaFMN reduced during its formation. 5. Intermediate prepared with [U-14C]glutamate yields alpha-[14C]ketoglutarate when denatured with acid and N-[glutaryl-U-14C]methylglutamate when incubated with methylamine. In the absence of methylamine deazaFMN enzyme intermediate slowly decays to yield alpha-hydroxyglutarate. 6. The rate of deazaFMN glutaryl enzyme intermediate formation at a fixed glutamate concentration is equal to the rate of the over-all reaction while the rate of intermediate reaction with methylamine is approximately 50 times greater than the over-all reaction. DeazaFMN enzyme intermediate prepared with [alpha-3H]-glutamate yields [3H]deazaFMNH2 when denatured with acid or phenol and N-[3H]methylglutamate when incubated with methylamine. These results show that the alpha-hydrogen of glutamate is transferred to deazaFMNH2, presumably at the 5 position, during Reaction 1 and that the same hydrogen is utilized for the reformation of the alpha C-H bond during Reaction 2. These results provide the first direct evidence for enzymic hydrogen transfer from substrate to flavin."

https://openalex.org/W1517363932,"Abstract The size of the polyadenylic acid region of newly synthesized globin mRNA was determined on mRNA isolated from nucleated erythroid spleen cells of anemic mice. The globin mRNA was purified by a combination of affinity chromatography on oligodeoxythymidylate-cellulose (oligo-(dT)-cellulose) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purified RNA was shown to be globin mRNA by virtue of its ability to direct the synthesis of mouse alpha- and beta-globin chains in a cell-free system and by the presence of two bands migrating identically with authentic mouse alpha- and beta-globin mRNA when subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of formamide. When labeled for 1 hour with [3H]adenosine, the newly synthesized radioactive mRNA also migrated as two bands in these gels but they moved slower than the main bands suggesting that they have higher molecular weights. The polyadenylic acid region of the mRNA was isolated from the T1 and pancreatic RNase digestion mixture by acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The polyadenylic acid region was found to contain approximately 150 adenylate residues. As it is known that globin mRNA isolated from reticulocytes contains only 40 to 60 residues, it follows that at least 150 adenylic acid residues are added to the globin mRNA soon after its synthesis and that some of these are removed during the subsequent maturation of the erythroid cell."
https://openalex.org/W1502751676,"Acinetobacter glutaminase-asparaginase was chemically modified by succinylation and glycosylation with glycopeptides from human fibrin and gamma-globulin. These modifications markedly prolonged the half-lives of the enzyme in mice, rats, and rabbits. The plasma half-life in mice increased with decreasing isoelectric point. Glycosylation caused greater prolongation in rodents than succinylation. The kinetic properties of the modified enzymes were unchanged. Succinylation protected the enzyme from trypsin digestion. Glycosylated preparations had less heat inactivation than native and succinylated enzyme. Sedimentation equilibrium studies on a succinylated preparation showed reversible dissociation to a dimer (71, 400 g/mol) with an association constant of 1.3 times 10-6 liters/mol. This dissociation was identical with native enzyme, except for a 3% increase in molecular weight due to succinate groups. Sedimentation equilibrium studies on glycosylated preparations showed mixtures of molecular weight from 60, 000 to over 180, 000. Gel filtration and active enzyme sedimentation showed active polymers, but no active species smaller than tetramer."

With the use of a radioactive coupling reagent, [35S]phenylisothiocyanate, and minor modifications in the sequenator program, sequence analyses have been performed on nanomole quantities of protein. The radioactive phenylthiohydantoin derivatives produced in the degradation are identified at the 10 to 100 pmol level by two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic procedures with autoradiography and are quantitated by scintillation counting. This high sensitivity approach, which is about 100 times more sensitive than conventional automated Edman procedures, has allowed continuous amino acid assignments for 15 or more cycles on quantities of protein less than 5 nmol. It has been employed in the NH2-terminal sequence analysis of several proteins whose sequences were previously undetermined."

Cigarette smokers have previously been estimated to receive 20 rads to areas of the bronchial epithelium from deposited polonium-210. This finding thus supports the hypothesis that alpha radiation resulting from the polonium-210 or lead-210 present in cigarette smoke may be a significant causative factor in human lung cancer.
https://openalex.org/W1546952848,"Employing mercaptoethylamine as a reducing agent, it was demonstrated by analytical ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) was reduced to a 10 S dimer and 7 S monomer, and that dimer IgA was more resistant to reductive cleavage than the higher polymers. When dimer and monomer IgA were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in 8 M urea or chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-200 equilibrated in 4 M guanidine HCl, there was no dissociations into H, L, or J chains, suggesting that the interchain disulfide bridges between H--H, L--H, and H--J were intact and that mercaptoethylamine produced selective cleavage of intersubunit bonds. Only the dimer, with a sedimentation coefficient of 10.2 S, released J chain upon reduction with dithiothreitol. Polymers of IgA were reduced with mercaptoethylamine and subsequently alkylated with [14C]-iodoacetamide and the dimer and monomer isolated. The results demonstrated that the isolated dimer contained 2 mol of [14C]labeled S carboxyamidomethylcysteine per mol of dimer, while the monomer contained 1 mol of --SH per mol of monomer. The labeled dimer was then completely reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with [14C]iodoacetamide and J chain isolated. It was shown that the J chain contained no 14C-labeled sulfhydryl groups, while the monomer contained 1 mol of --SH per mol of monomer. These results suggest that J chain is disulfide-bonded to only two of the subunits of polymeric IgA and that the remaining subunits in the higher polymers are disulfide-bonded one to the other. This is similar to the model previously suggested for 19 S immunoglobulin M (IgM). The sulfhydryl data also suggests that polymeric IgA may not be a covalently bonded circular structure as has been shown for IgM. However, no conclusions can be made from this study regarding the structure of pentameric IgA, since this species was present in very small amounts in our polymer preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1512339499,"Homoserine transacetylase (EC 2.3.1.31), the first enzyme of methionine biosynthesis, has been purified to near homogeneity from extracts of a methionine auxotroph of Bacillus polymyxa. The enzyme is subject to rapid irreversible inactivation. Its half-life at 0 degrees is 15 min and much less at higher temperatures, but ethylene glycol affords some protection. In addition, Zn2+ reversibly inhibits the enzyme with a K-I of 3 muM. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 40,000 and consists of a single polypeptide chain. Besides catalyzing the acetyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to L-homoserine, homoserine transacetylase promotes a homoserine-O-acetylhomoserine exchange reaction in the absence of CoA, suggesting the formation of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. The results of kinetic studies are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. Homoserine transacetylase is subject to multivalent feedback inhibition by L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Analysis of the inhibition data and specificity studies suggest that the inhibitors bind to separate sites on the enzyme which are distinct from the active site. Inhibition is competitive with respect to both substrates, and the saturation curves for the inhibitors, as well as substrate saturation curves in the absence or presence of the inhibitors, are hyperbolic. The absence of cooperativity is, in fact, a property which would be expected in a monomeric allosteric enzyme such as homoserine transacetylase."
https://openalex.org/W1573769735,"Orcinol hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.6), which catalyzes the first reaction of orcinol catabolism in Pseudomonas putida 01, has been purified to homogeneity, and crystallized. Orcinol hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of orcinol with equimolar consumption of O2 and NADH (or NADPH) to 2, 3, 5-trihydroxytoluene, which is nonenzymically oxidized to a quinone. The visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme shows maxima at 373 and 454 nm and a shoulder at 480 nm. FAD can be dissociated from the protein. Reconstitution of enzymic activity was achieved with FAD, and to a limited extent by FMN. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 63,000 to 68,000 and contains 1 mol of FAD per mol of protein. K-m values for the three substrates orcinol, NADH, and O2 are 0.03, 0.13, and 0.07mM, RESPECTIVELY. The molecular activity of the crystalline enzyme is 1560 min minus 1. In the absence of orcinol, NADH is only slowly oxidized with formation of H2O2. Several analogs of orcinol also serve as substrates for hydroxylation, namely resorcinol, 4-methylresorcinol, and 4-bromoresorcinol. Other analogs, m-cresol, m-ethylphenol, 4-ethylresorcinol, and phloroglucinol, mimic orcinol as effectors, in that they (a) accelerate electron flow from NADH to the flavin and (b) decrease the apparent K-m for NADH but not to the same extent as the substrates that are hydroxylated. The latter compounds are not hydroxylated. Instead H2O2 accumulates as the only product of O2 reduction. The enzyme therefore behaves either as a hydroxylase or an oxidase. The ratio of hydroxylase to oxidase activities of the enzyme is decreased by an increase in the temperature of incubation; at 60 degrees the reaction with orcinol is almost 50% uncoupled from hydroxylation. The apparent K-m values for the effectors are in good agreement with the D-D values obtained for orcinol, resorcinol, and m-cresol. K-D values were obtained by measurement of the effector-induced perturbations of the visible absorption spectrum of the flavoprotein by difference absorption spectroscopy. The circular dichroism spectrum of orcinol hydroxylase is also altered in the presence of orcinol. The participation of the flavin in the over-all reaction is demonstrated by its rapid reduction under anaerobic conditions by NADH in the presence or orcinol, resorcinol, or m-cresol. Subsequent introduction of oxygen restores the oxidized form and yields H2O2 when m-cresol is the effector, but not when orcinol is the effector. Transfer of reducing equivalents from the reduced flavoprotein to free FAD may also occur. Reduction of orcinol hydroxylase by NADH in the absence of an effector is 10-4-fold slower than in the presence of an effector. The minimal structural requirements for effectors appear to be a 1,3-dihydroxy or 1-alkyl-3-hydorxybenzene, but only the former are substrates for hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1584685293,"Direct evidence is presented that a chloroplast gene mutation in Chlamydomonas reinhardi alters one of the chloroplast ribosomal proteins. Proteins of 30 S subunits of chloroplast ribosomes from mutant strains, carrying maternally inherited antibiotic resistances, were compared with those from the wild type strain by CM-cellulose column chromatography and gel electrophoresis. When 30 S ribosomal proteins from a [3H]arginine-labeled streptomycin-resistant strain and a [14C]arginine-labeled wild type strain, or vice versa, were cochromatographed on a CM-cellulose column, one peak (Peak 17) was absent from the mutant profile. Instead, a pronounced peak was observed to elute at a slightly lower ionic strength than Peak 17 in the region of Peak 16. The molecular weights in both Peak 16 and Peak 17 regions determined by discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were indistinguishable, approximately 18,000. Thus, a chloroplast gene mutation to streptomycin resistance has altered the chromatographic behavior of a chloroplast ribosomal protein of the 30 S subunit. We interpret the additional protein in the mutant eluting at Peak 16 as most likely the mutationally altered form of the Peak 17 protein."

https://openalex.org/W2001242012,"Zinc-free insulin elicited a reduction in the potassium conductance of muscle fibers from potassium-depleted muscle, which led to depolarization, blockade of action-potential mechanism, and paralysis. These changes are proposed as the mechanism of insulin-induced paralysis in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A similar effect by concanavalin A suggests that the effect may be mediated through the insulin receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1534023673,"Procedures have been developed for the facile preparation of wheat seedling nuclease in highly purified form. The preparation appears to be homogeneous by many physical criteria; however, analytical gel electrophoresis reveals 12 protein bands, only one of which is catalytically active. It is suggested that most of the inactive species are artifacts formed from active enzyme by processes which increase the negative charge of the protein. The enzyme rapidly catalyzes the hydrolysis of denatured DNA and RNA to acid-soluble products and also of the 3'-phosphomonoester linkage of a variety of 3'-mononucleotides. The enzyme has very little, if any, activity toward native DNA with respect to the production of acid-soluble substances; however, athe succeeding paper demonstrates that native DNA is cleaved at a few specific loci to yield large duplex DNA fragments. The nuclease has been characterized as having endonucleolytic activity towards denatured DNA and primarily exonucleolytic activity towards RNA. The mononucleotides produced under the influence of the enzyme bear 5'-phosphomonoester groups. Various lines of evidence indicate a relatively high preference of the enzyme for the hydrolysis primarily of 3'-phosphoester linkages of adenylic acid units and secondarily of thymidylic or uridylic acid units in DNA and in ribohomopolymers, respectively. Corresponding linkages involving cytidylic acid and especially guanylic acid are relatively resistant. The 3'-nucleotidase activity of the enzyme at pH 5.0 towards the various mononucleotides fits the same pattern; i.e. nucleotides containing adenine are hydrolyzed most rapidly, followed in decreasing order by those containing thymine or uracil, cytosine, and guanine."
https://openalex.org/W1601627414,"Metabolic utilization of glucosyl [3H]ceramide (glucocerebroside) by human skin fibroblasts from normal and glucosylceramidotic subjects was examined in cell culture. Exogenous glucosyl [3H]ceramide in the culture medium did not influence activity of beta glucosidase in either cell type. Expectedly in the lipidotic cells, the enzymatic activity was markedly (similar to 20-fold) lower. Normal cells were found preferentially to utilize exogenous tritium-labeled glucosylceramide for a source of precursors for phopholipid biosynthesis. The fatty acid and the sphingosine components of sphingomyelin, and the fatty acid components of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, were tritium-labeled. In contrast, glucosylceramidotic cells utilized labeled glucosylceramide far more for synthesis of lactosylceramide (lactocerebroside) and also higher neutral glycosphingolipid homologues. These experimental findings suggest that glucosyl [3H]ceramide is hydrolyzed in normal skin fibroblasts to [3H]ceramide and further to [3H]dihydrosphingosine and 3H-labeled fatty acids. These compounds are subsequently incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Flux of glucosyl [3H]ceramide through this catabolic sequence and reincorporation of its breakdown products into phospholipids predominates in normal skin fibroblasts. In contrast, it is greatly reduced in glucosylceramidotic skin fibroblasts. Consequently, a greater amount of glucosyl [3H]ceramide remains intact for the synthesis of more highly glycosylated glycosphingolipids in the latter cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582756937,"Poly(8-bromoadenylic acid) (poly(8-BrA)) has been synthesized by polymerization of 8-BrADP with polynucleotide phosphorylase in the presence of oligonucleotide primers. In the absence of oligonucleotides, significant (i.e. more than 1%) polymerization does not occur. Oligo(I) primer was removed selectively from the polymer with ribonuclease T1 to yield the homopolymer, poly(8-BrA). End group analysis, based on quantitative infrared measurement of the (Ip)3I-primed polymer, indicates an average degree of polymerization of about 70 residues. The primed polymers and the homopolymer appear to have similar helical structures, probably double-stranded with mutual hydrogen bonding interaction of BrA residues. Preliminary NMR observations of poly(8-BrA) with a tetrainosinic acid primer at the 5' ends of the polymer chain ((Ip)3I-(8-BrA)n) are consistent with the existence of a rigid helical structure below the melting range of the primed polymer. Above the melting range (81 degrees) the H1' coupling constants of (Ip)3I-(8-BrA)n and of polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) suggest a significantly higher population of C3' endo conformation of ribose residues in the primed polymer than in poly(A) at 81 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1598566599,"The levels of homoserine transacetylase (EC 2.3.1.31) in Bacillus polymyxa grown in minimal medium can vary over a 40-fold range, depending on whether methionine limits growth or is present in excess. This suggests that the synthesis of the enzyme is under control by methionine or one of its metabolites. The stability of homoserine transacetylase in growing cells was measured after repression of further synthesis by the addition of methionine. At 30 degrees, the enzyme was stable for 2 hours, whereas at 37 degrees it decayed with a half-life of 40 min. This contrasts with the striking instability in cell-free extracts described in the preceding paper (Wyman, A., and Paulus, H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3897-3903). The properties of homoserine transacetylase were also studied in cells of B. polymyxa that had been made permeable to small molecules by treatment with toluene. They differed in two important respects from those of the enzyme in cell-free extracts described in the preceding paper: the enzyme was relatively stable, with a half-life of 15 min at 37 degrees, and responded in a sigmoid manner to increasing concentrations of the inhibitors L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. These observations suggest that homoserine transacetylase is an oligomeric protein within the bacterial cell but dissociates into monomers in cell-free extracts. When B. polymyxa was transferred at 39 degrees from a rich medium to one without amino acids, growth resumed only very slowly. The growth lag after shift-down was not observed at 37 degrees or in the presence of methionine or cystathionine. This phenomenon appears to be due to a need for derepression of homoserine transacetylase upon shift-down which is thwarted at 39 degrees by the rapid thermal inactivation of the enzyme. A possible physiological function of the striking thermolability of the first enzyme in methionine biosynthesis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1534214584,"Abstract The observation that thyroxine stimulated in vitro protein synthesis in the absence of mitochondria (Carter, W.J., Faas, F.H., and Wynn, J (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4973-4977) has been disputed on the basis that radioactivity incorporated into protein did not represent peptide synthesis but incorporation of labeled contaminants present in the L-(U-14C) valine precursor (Sokoloff, L., and Roberts, P.A. (1972 Fed. Proc. 31, 1525). The question of mitochondrial requirement is important in determining whether thyroxine has a direct action on the polysome or causes the release of stimulatory factors from mitochondria. In this paper, thyroxine stimulation of peptide synthesis in mitochondria-free systems has been confirmed. Peptide synthesis is required for the thyroxine effect since it is dependent on the presence of polysomes and an energy source in the reaction mixture and is abolished by puromycin. The thyroxine effect is not due to incorporation of labeled contaminants since hydrolysis of labeled protein recovered from control and thyroxine-treated reaction mixtures yields the labeled amino acid precursor as the only radioactive product. Thyroxine stimulates polyuridylic acid-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, providing further evidence that thyroxine is stimulating peptide synthesis rather than incorporation of radioactive contaminants by mechanisms other than peptide synthesis. Although thyroxine stimulates polyphenylalanine synthesis, it does not influence polyuridylic acid hydrolysis measured in the same reaction. Therefore, thyroxine stimulation of peptide synthesis is not due to prevention of hydrolysis of nucleic acid components of the reaction mixture. Thyroxine does not influence the size or specific activity of the free valine pool in the reaction mixture, indicating that observed increases in valine incorporation reflect increased peptide synthesis rather than increased specific activity of the valine precursor. The fact that thyroxine stimulates peptide synthesis using (14C)aminoacyl-tRNA precursors strengthens this conclusion. Therefore, thyroxine stimulation of protein labeling is dependent on the presence of peptide synthesis and cannot be explained by incorporation of labeled contaminants, prevention of RNA hydrolysis, or change in the specific activity of the amino acid precursor. Thyroxine causes a genuine increase in peptide synthesis by a direct action at the polysomal level."

https://openalex.org/W1505081674,The interaction of phosphoenolypyruvate with isolated rat liver mitochondria has been further investigated. The uptake of P-enolpyruvate is accompanied by the stoichiometric release of intramitochondrial adenine nucleotides resulting in the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Addition of specific inhibitors of either the adenine nucleotide carrier or the tricarboylic acid carrier blocks the P-enolpyruvate-stimulated loss of adenine nucleotides and thereby prevents the resultant inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. These data suggest that there is a specific interaction between the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase and the tricarboxylic acid carrier resulting in the control of intramitochondrial adenine nucleotide levels of phosphoenolpyruvate.

https://openalex.org/W1554073811,"ATP has two significant effects on the mitochondrial tricarboxylate transporting system. First, it alters the concentration gradients at equilibrium for the substrates of this transporter. ATP (2MM) caused the uptake of 10 nmol of citrate into the mitochondria coincident with the output of a similar amount of L-malate. This redistribution was dependent on ATP transport, the effect being inhibited by atractyloside and mimicked by the nonmetabolizable derivative adenylyl imidodiphosphate. A mechanism to account for these observations is proposed. Secondly, preincubation of mitochondria with ATP resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the K-m of the mitochondrial citrate transporter. This effect of ATP was not produced by ADP and P-i, nor by N, N, N1, N1-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine and ascorbate. It was prevented by the addition of rotenone and antimycin A. This effect of ATP was observed in the presence of oligomycin and could not be attributed to a change in the content of the known tricarboxylate carrier inhibitor, palmitoyl-CoA, nor to the ATP concentration. The origin of possible regulatory factor (or factors) is discussed."
