https://openalex.org/W1941339056,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mammalian mRNA. This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric and adds another layer to the dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The stability of m6A-modified mRNA is regulated by an m6A reader protein, human YTHDF2, which recognizes m6A and reduces the stability of target transcripts. Looking at additional functional roles for the modification, we find that another m6A reader protein, human YTHDF1, actively promotes protein synthesis by interacting with translation machinery. In a unified mechanism of m6A-based regulation in the cytoplasm, YTHDF2-mediated degradation controls the lifetime of target transcripts, whereas YTHDF1-mediated translation promotion increases translation efficiency, ensuring effective protein production from dynamic transcripts that are marked by m6A. Therefore, the m6A modification in mRNA endows gene expression with fast responses and controllable protein production through these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2134634125,"Much study has been devoted to the possible causes of an apparent decrease in the upward trend of global surface temperatures since 1998, a phenomenon that has been dubbed the global warming ""hiatus."" Here, we present an updated global surface temperature analysis that reveals that global trends are higher than those reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, especially in recent decades, and that the central estimate for the rate of warming during the first 15 years of the 21st century is at least as great as the last half of the 20th century. These results do not support the notion of a ""slowdown"" in the increase of global surface temperature."

Deutsch et al. combined data on metabolism, temperature, and demographics to determine the impact of marine deoxygenation on a variety of fish and crustacean species (see the Perspective by Kleypas). Predicted climate and oxygen conditions can be expected to contract the distribution of marine fish poleward, as equatorward waters become too low in oxygen to support their energy needs. Furthermore, even the more-poleward waters will have reduced oxygen levels. Science , this issue p. 1132 ; see also p. 1086"

Zhang et al. found that a multitasking transcription factor called Rev-erb-α regulates expression of both clock and metabolic genes through distinct mechanisms. At clock genes, it binds directly to a specific DNA sequence, displacing a competing transcription factor. At metabolic genes, it interacts not with DNA but with other transcription factors that regulate metabolic gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. Science , this issue p. 1488"

Patients need to consume multiple tablets over several months and frequently fail to complete their treatment. Consequently, drug-resistant strains of the pathogen have emerged, which add to the threat. Kling et al. revisited a natural product called griselimycin, extracted from the same organism that produced the prototype anti-TB drug, streptomycin. Unmodified griselimycin has poor pharmacological properties. However, one synthetic derivative had improved oral uptake and penetrated cells of the immune system that harbor the TB mycobacterium. In combination with other drugs, the griselimycin derivative showed high potency in mice with TB. Science , this issue p. 1106"
https://openalex.org/W1946360318,"Aneuploidy in human eggs is the leading cause of pregnancy loss and several genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Most aneuploidy results from chromosome segregation errors during the meiotic divisions of an oocyte, the egg's progenitor cell. The basis for particularly error-prone chromosome segregation in human oocytes is not known. We analyzed meiosis in more than 100 live human oocytes and identified an error-prone chromosome-mediated spindle assembly mechanism as a major contributor to chromosome segregation defects. Human oocytes assembled a meiotic spindle independently of either centrosomes or other microtubule organizing centers. Instead, spindle assembly was mediated by chromosomes and the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran in a process requiring ~16 hours. This unusually long spindle assembly period was marked by intrinsic spindle instability and abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which favor chromosome segregation errors and provide a possible explanation for high rates of aneuploidy in human eggs."
https://openalex.org/W1925325850,"The detailed molecular interactions between native HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) hexamers that shield the viral genome and proteins have been elusive. We report crystal structures describing interactions between CA monomers related by sixfold symmetry within hexamers (intrahexamer) and threefold and twofold symmetry between neighboring hexamers (interhexamer). The structures describe how CA builds hexagonal lattices, the foundation of mature capsids. Lattice structure depends on an adaptable hydration layer modulating interactions among CA molecules. Disruption of this layer alters interhexamer interfaces, highlighting an inherent structural variability. A CA-targeting antiviral affects capsid stability by binding across CA molecules and subtly altering interhexamer interfaces remote to the ligand-binding site. Inherent structural plasticity, hydration layer rearrangement, and effector binding affect capsid stability and have functional implications for the retroviral life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1667397546,"We determined the NF-κB- and NOD-like receptor (NLR)P3-dependent molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis and evaluated the role of retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-α in melatonin's anti-inflammatory actions. Western blot, RT-PCR, ELISA, and spectrophotometric analysis revealed that NF-κB and NLRP3 closely interact, leading to proinflammatory and pro-oxidant status in heart tissue of septic C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, mitochondrial oxygen consumption was reduced by 80% in septic mice. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that melatonin administration blunts NF-κB transcriptional activity through a sirtuin1-dependent NF-κB deacetylation in septic mice. Melatonin also decreased NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory response and restored redox balance and mitochondrial homeostasis, thus inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. In an important finding, the inhibition of NF-κB by melatonin, but not that of NLRP3, was blunted in RORα (sg/sg) mice, indicating that functional RORα transcription factor is necessary for the initiation of the innate immune response against inflammation. Our results are evidence of the NF-κB/NLRP3 connection during sepsis and identify NLRP3 as a novel molecular target for melatonin. The multiple molecular targets of melatonin in this study explain its potent anti-inflammatory efficacy against systemic innate immune activation and herald a promising therapeutic application for melatonin in the treatment of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2148890902,"Females may display dramatically different behavior depending on their state of ovulation. This is thought to occur through sex-specific hormones acting on behavioral centers in the brain. Whether incoming sensory activity also differs across the ovulation cycle to alter behavior has not been investigated. Here, we show that female mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) are temporarily and specifically rendered ""blind"" to a subset of male-emitted pheromone ligands during diestrus yet fully detect and respond to the same ligands during estrus. VSN silencing occurs through the action of the female sex-steroid progesterone. Not all VSNs are targeted for silencing; those detecting cat ligands remain continuously active irrespective of the estrous state. We identify the signaling components that account for the capacity of progesterone to target specific subsets of male-pheromone responsive neurons for inactivation. These findings indicate that internal physiology can selectively and directly modulate sensory input to produce state-specific behavior. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W1504179404,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the immune response to viral infection through the facilitation of cell-intrinsic antiviral activity and the activation of adaptive immunity. HIV-1 infection of DCs triggers an IRF3-dependent innate immune response, which requires the activity of cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS). We report the results of a targeted RNAi screen utilizing primary human monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) to identify immune regulators that directly interface with HIV-1-encoded features to initiate this innate response. Polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) emerged as a strong candidate through this analysis. We found that PQBP1 directly binds to reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA and interacts with cGAS to initiate an IRF3-dependent innate response. MDDCs derived from Renpenning syndrome patients, who harbor mutations in the PQBP1 locus, possess a severely attenuated innate immune response to HIV-1 challenge, underscoring the role of PQBP1 as a proximal innate sensor of a HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1544123057,"An analysis of present-day global depth distributions of reef-building corals and underlying environmental drivers contradicts a commonly held belief that ocean warming will promote tropical coral expansion into temperate latitudes. Using a global data set of a major group of reef corals, we found that corals were confined to shallower depths at higher latitudes (up to 0.6 meters of predicted shallowing per additional degree of latitude). Latitudinal attenuation of the most important driver of this phenomenon-the dose of photosynthetically available radiation over winter-would severely constrain latitudinal coral range extension in response to ocean warming. Latitudinal gradients in species richness for the group also suggest that higher winter irradiance at depth in low latitudes allowed a deep-water fauna that was not viable at higher latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1669958838,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas and a major cause of stratospheric ozone depletion, yet its sources and sinks remain poorly quantified in the oceans. We used isotope tracers to directly measure N2O reduction rates in the eastern tropical North Pacific. Because of incomplete denitrification, N2O cycling rates are an order of magnitude higher than predicted by current models in suboxic regions, and the spatial distribution suggests strong dependence on both organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Furthermore, N2O turnover is 20 times higher than the net atmospheric efflux. The rapid rate of this cycling coupled to an expected expansion of suboxic ocean waters implies future increases in N2O emissions."

In a large international cohort we have evaluated the effect of gender on disability accumulation and disease progression to determine if male MS patients have a worse clinical outcome than females. Methods Using the MSBase Registry, data from 15,826 MS patients from 25 countries was analysed. Changes in the severity of MS (EDSS) were compared between sexes using a repeated measures analysis in generalised linear mixed models. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to test for sex difference in the time to reach EDSS milestones 3 and 6 and the secondary progressive MS. Results In relapse onset MS patients (n = 14,453), males progressed significantly faster in their EDSS than females (0.133 vs 0.112 per year, P<0.001,). Females had a reduced risk of secondary progressive MS (HR (95% CI) = 0.77 (0.67 to 0.90) P = 0.001). In primary progressive MS (n = 1,373), there was a significant increase in EDSS over time in males and females (P<0.001) but there was no significant sex effect on the annualized rate of EDSS change. Conclusion Among registrants of MSBase, male relapse-onset patients accumulate disability faster than female patients. In contrast, the rate of disability accumulation between male and female patients with primary progressive MS is similar."
https://openalex.org/W1590330896,"The manipulation of domains by external fields in ferroic materials is of major interest for applications. In multiferroics with strongly coupled magnetic and electric order, however, the magnetoelectric coupling on the level of the domains is largely unexplored. We investigated the field-induced domain dynamics of TbMnO3 in the multiferroic ground state and across a first-order spin-flop transition. In spite of the discontinuous nature of this transition, the reorientation of the order parameters is deterministic and preserves the multiferroic domain pattern. Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations reveal that this behavior is intrinsic. Such magnetoelectric correlations in spin-driven ferroelectrics may lead to domain wall-based nanoelectronics devices."

https://openalex.org/W1719834687,"Friction between ordered, atomically smooth surfaces at the nanoscale (nanofriction) is often governed by stick-slip processes. To test long-standing atomistic models of such processes, we implemented a synthetic nanofriction interface between a laser-cooled Coulomb crystal of individually addressable ions as the moving object and a periodic light-field potential as the substrate. We show that stick-slip friction can be tuned from maximal to nearly frictionless via arrangement of the ions relative to the substrate. By varying the ion number, we also show that this strong dependence of friction on the structural mismatch, as predicted by many-particle models, already emerges at the level of two or three atoms. This model system enables a microscopic and systematic investigation of friction, potentially even into the quantum many-body regime."

However, the consequences this should have for goal-setting, planning and implementation of training for boys and girls of different ages remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to quantify performance developments in athletic running and jumping disciplines in the age range 11-18 and identify progression differences as a function of age, discipline and sex.The 100 all-time best Norwegian male and female 60-m, 800-m, long jump and high jump athletes in each age category from 11 to 18 years were analysed using mixed models with random intercept according to athlete.Male and female athletes perform almost equally in running and jumping events up to the age of 12. Beyond this age, males outperform females. Relative annual performance development in females gradually decreases throughout the analyzed age period. In males, annual relative performance development accelerates up to the age of 13 (for running events) or 14 (for jumping events) and then gradually declines when approaching 18 years of age. The relative improvement from age 11 to 18 was twice as high in jumping events compared to running events. For all of the analyzed disciplines, overall improvement rates were >50% higher for males than for females. The performance sex difference evolves from < 5% to 10-18% in all the analyzed disciplines from age 11 to 18 yr.To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to present absolute and relative annual performance developments in running and jumping events for competitive athletes from early to late adolescence. These results allow coaches and athletes to set realistic goals and prescribe conditioning programs that take into account sex-specific differences in the rate of performance development at different stages of maturation."
https://openalex.org/W579197986,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics in order to defeat multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, thirteen antimicrobial peptides were designed based on two natural peptides indolicidin and ranalexin. Our results revealed that four hybrid peptides RN7-IN10, RN7-IN9, RN7-IN8, and RN7-IN6 possess potent antibacterial activity against 30 pneumococcal clinical isolates (MIC 7.81-15.62µg/ml). These four hybrid peptides also showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity (7.81µg/ml) against S. aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and E. coli. Furthermore, the time killing assay results showed that the hybrid peptides were able to eliminate S. pneumoniae within less than one hour which is faster than the standard drugs erythromycin and ceftriaxone. The cytotoxic effects of peptides were tested against human erythrocytes, WRL-68 normal liver cell line, and NL-20 normal lung cell line. The results revealed that none of the thirteen peptides have cytotoxic or hemolytic effects at their MIC values. The in silico molecular docking study was carried out to investigate the binding properties of peptides with three pneumococcal virulent targets by Autodock Vina. RN7IN6 showed a strong affinity to target proteins; autolysin, pneumolysin, and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) based on rigid docking studies. Our results suggest that the hybrid peptides could be suitable candidates for antibacterial drug development."
https://openalex.org/W1803642874,"PAX6 is a master regulatory gene involved in neuronal cell fate specification. It also plays a critical role in early eye field and subsequent limbal stem cell (LSC) determination during eye development. Defects in Pax6 cause aniridia and LSC deficiency in humans and the Sey (Small eye) phenotype in mice (Massé, K., Bhamra, S., Eason, R., Dale, N., and Jones, E. A. (2007) Nature 449, 1058–1062). However, how PAX6 specifies LSC and corneal fates during eye development is not well understood. Here, we show that PAX6 is expressed in the primitive eye cup and later in corneal tissue progenitors in early embryonic development. In contrast, p63 expression commences after that of PAX6 in ocular adnexal and skin tissue progenitors and later in LSCs. Using an in vitro feeder-free culture system, we show that PAX6 knockdown in LSCs led to up-regulation of skin epidermis-specific keratins concomitant with differentiation to a skin fate. Using gene expression analysis, we identified the involvement of Notch, Wnt, and TGF-β signaling pathways in LSC fate determination. Thus, loss of PAX6 converts LSCs to epidermal stem cells, as demonstrated by a switch in the keratin gene expression profile and by the appearance of congenital dermoid tissue.

https://openalex.org/W618738618,"The worldwide increase of hybridization in different groups is thought to have become more important with the loss of isolating barriers and the introduction of invasive species. This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2286381411,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) comprise a subclass of neurotransmitter receptors whose surface expression is regulated at multiple levels, including processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intracellular trafficking via the Golgi apparatus, internalization, recycling, and degradation. With respect to early processing, NMDARs are regulated by the availability of GluN subunits within the ER, the presence of ER retention and export signals, and posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation. However, the role of N-glycosylation, one of the most common posttranslational modifications, in regulating NMDAR processing has not been studied in detail. Using biochemistry, confocal and electron microscopy, and electrophysiology in conjunction with a lentivirus-based molecular replacement strategy, we found that NMDARs are released from the ER only when two asparagine residues in the GluN1 subunit (Asn-203 and Asn-368) are N-glycosylated. Although the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits are also N-glycosylated, their N-glycosylation sites do not appear to be essential for surface delivery of NMDARs. Furthermore, we found that removing N-glycans from native NMDARs altered the receptor affinity for glutamate. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which neurons ensure that postsynaptic membranes contain sufficient numbers of functional NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W605341035,"Estimates of climate change impacts on global food production are generally based on statistical or process-based models. Process-based models can provide robust predictions of agricultural yield responses to changing climate and management. However, applications of these models often suffer from bias due to the common practice of re-initializing soil conditions to the same state for each year of the forecast period. If simulations neglect to include year-to-year changes in initial soil conditions and water content related to agronomic management, adaptation and mitigation strategies designed to maintain stable yields under climate change cannot be properly evaluated. We apply a process-based crop system model that avoids re-initialization bias to demonstrate the importance of simulating both year-to-year and cumulative changes in pre-season soil carbon, nutrient, and water availability. Results are contrasted with simulations using annual re-initialization, and differences are striking. We then demonstrate the potential for the most likely adaptation strategy to offset climate change impacts on yields using continuous simulations through the end of the 21st century. Simulations that annually re-initialize pre-season soil carbon and water contents introduce an inappropriate yield bias that obscures the potential for agricultural management to ameliorate the deleterious effects of rising temperatures and greater rainfall variability."
https://openalex.org/W2124541366,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) arose in evolution as the cell's largest and most versatile transport channel. Current models for selective transport mediated by NPCs are focused on properties of intrinsically disordered regions of nucleoporins that bind transport factors. In contrast, structured regions are considered to provide static anchoring sites for the disordered regions without affecting transport factor binding. Here, we demonstrate allosteric coupling between a structured domain of a channel nucleoporin (Nup58) and its neighboring disordered domain in interaction with another channel nucleoporin (Nup54) and a transport factor (Kapβ1). Analysis of multiple equilibria showed that multivalent interactions of Kapβ1 with the disordered domains of Nup58 stabilize the neighboring structured domain associated with Nup54, shifting conformational equilibria from homo-oligomers to hetero-oligomers. Based on these and previous crystallographic results, a quantitative framework was established to describe constriction and dilation of the central channel as a function of transport factor occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W2239883203,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are very short (18-24 nucleotides) nucleic acids that are expressed in a number of biological tissues and have been shown to be more resistant to extreme temperatures and pH compared to longer RNA molecules, like mRNAs. As miRNAs contribute to diverse biological process and respond to various kinds of cellular stress, their utility as diagnostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets has recently been explored. Here, we have evaluated the usefulness of miRNA quantification during postmortem examination of cardiac tissue from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Cardiac tissue was collected within one week of the patient's death and either frozen (19 samples) or fixed in formalin for up to three years (36 samples). RNA integrity was evaluated with an electropherogram, and it appears that longer RNAs are fragmented after death in the long-term fixed samples. Quantitative PCR was also performed for seven miRNAs and three other small RNAs in order to determine the appropriate controls for our postmortem analysis. Our data indicate that miR-191 and miR-26b are more suitable than the other types of small RNA molecules as they are stably detected after death and long-term fixation. Further, we also applied our quantitation method, using these endogenous controls, to evaluate the expression of three previously identified miRNA biomarkers, miR-1, miR-208b, and miR-499a, in formalin-fixed tissues from AMI patients. Although miR-1 and miR-208b decreased (1.4-fold) and increased (1.2-fold), respectively, in the AMI samples compared to the controls, the significance of these changes was limited by our sample size. In contrast, the relative level of miR-499a was significantly decreased in the AMI samples (2.1-fold). This study highlights the stability of miRNAs after death and long-term fixation, validating their use as reliable biomarkers for AMI during postmortem examination."
https://openalex.org/W1586683987,"We examined the temporal changes of isokinetic strength performance of knee flexor (KF) and extensor (KE) strength after a football match. Players were randomly assigned to a control (N = 14, participated only in measurements and practices) or an experimental group (N = 20, participated also in a football match). Participants trained daily during the two days after the match. Match and training overload was monitored with GPS devices. Venous blood was sampled and muscle damage was assessed pre-match, post-match and at 12 h, 36 h and 60 h post-match. Isometric strength as well as eccentric and concentric peak torque of knee flexors and extensors in both limbs (dominant and non-dominant) were measured on an isokinetic dynamometer at baseline and at 12 h, 36 h and 60 h after the match. Functional (KFecc/KEcon) and conventional (KFcon/KEcon) ratios were then calculated. Only eccentric peak torque of knee flexors declined at 60 h after the match in the control group. In the experimental group: a) isometric strength of knee extensors and knee flexors declined (P<0.05) at 12 h (both limbs) and 36 h (dominant limb only), b) eccentric and concentric peak torque of knee extensors and flexors declined (P<0.05) in both limbs for 36 h at 60°/s and for 60 h at 180°/s with eccentric peak torque of knee flexors demonstrating a greater (P<0.05) reduction than concentric peak torque, c) strength deterioration was greater (P<0.05) at 180°/s and in dominant limb, d) the functional ratio was more sensitive to match-induced fatigue demonstrating a more prolonged decline. Discriminant and regression analysis revealed that strength deterioration and recovery may be related to the amount of eccentric actions performed during the match and athletes' football-specific conditioning. Our data suggest that recovery kinetics of knee flexor and extensor strength after a football match demonstrate strength, limb and velocity specificity and may depend on match physical overload and players' physical conditioning level."
https://openalex.org/W1845184874,"Although sleep restriction is associated with decrements in daytime alertness and neurobehavioural performance, there are considerable inter-individual differences in the degree of impairment. This study examined the effects of short-term sleep restriction on neurobehavioural performance and sleepiness, and the associations between individual differences in impairments and circadian rhythm phase. Healthy adults (n = 43; 22 M) aged 22.5 ± 3.1 (mean ± SD) years maintained a regular 8:16 h sleep:wake routine for at least three weeks prior to laboratory admission. Sleep opportunity was restricted to 5 hours time-in-bed at home the night before admission and 3 hours time-in-bed in the laboratory, aligned by wake time. Hourly saliva samples were collected from 5.5 h before until 5 h after the pre-laboratory scheduled bedtime to assess dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) as a marker of circadian phase. Participants completed a 10-min auditory Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and had slow eye movements (SEM) measured by electrooculography two hours after waking. We observed substantial inter-individual variability in neurobehavioural performance, particularly in the number of PVT lapses. Increased PVT lapses (r = -0.468, p < 0.01), greater sleepiness (r = 0.510, p < 0.0001), and more slow eye movements (r = 0.375, p = 0.022) were significantly associated with later DLMO, consistent with participants waking at an earlier circadian phase. When the difference between DLMO and sleep onset was less than 2 hours, individuals were significantly more likely to have at least three attentional lapses the following morning. This study demonstrates that the phase of an individual’s circadian system is an important variable in predicting the degree of neurobehavioural performance impairment in the hours after waking following sleep restriction, and confirms that other factors influencing performance decrements require further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1187728706,"The zona pellucida (ZP) surrounding the oocyte is an extracellular fibrillar matrix that plays critical roles during fertilization including species-specific gamete recognition and protection from polyspermy. The mouse ZP is composed of three proteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, all of which have a ZP polymerization domain that directs protein fibril formation and assembly into the three-dimensional ZP matrix. Egg coats surrounding oocytes in nonmammalian vertebrates and in invertebrates are also fibrillar matrices and are composed of ZP domain-containing proteins suggesting the basic structure and function of the ZP/egg coat is highly conserved. However, sequence similarity between ZP domains is low across species and thus the mechanism for the conservation of ZP/egg coat structure and its function is not known. Using approaches classically used to identify amyloid including conformation-dependent antibodies and dyes, X-ray diffraction, and negative stain electron microscopy, our studies suggest the mouse ZP is a functional amyloid. Amyloids are cross-β sheet fibrillar structures that, while typically associated with neurodegenerative and prion diseases in mammals, can also carry out functional roles in normal cells without resulting pathology. An analysis of the ZP domain from mouse ZP3 and ZP3 homologs from five additional taxa using the algorithm AmylPred 2 to identify amyloidogenic sites, revealed in all taxa a remarkable conservation of regions that were predicted to form amyloid. This included a conserved amyloidogenic region that localized to a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids previously shown in mouse ZP3 to be essential for fibril assembly. Similarly, a domain in the yeast protein α-agglutinin/Sag 1p, that possesses ZP domain-like features and which is essential for mating, also had sites that were predicted to be amyloidogenic including a hydrophobic stretch that appeared analogous to the critical site in mouse ZP3. Together, these studies suggest that amyloidogenesis may be a conserved mechanism for ZP structure and function across billions of years of evolution."

Gold nanoparticles functionalized with biologically-compatible layers may achieve improved uptake and distribution while enabling cytotoxicity through synergistic combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation. Evaluation of nanoparticle uptake in vivo remains difficult, as detection methods are limited. We employ hyperspectral imaging of histology sections to analyze uptake and distribution of phosphatidylcholine-coated citrate gold nanoparticles (CGN) and silica-gold nanoshells (SGN) after tail-vein injection in mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For CGN, the liver and tumor showed 26.5±8.2 and 23.3±4.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm from the nearest source and few nanoparticles beyond 50μm, respectively. The spleen had 35.5±9.3 particles/100μm2 within 10μm with penetration also limited to 50μm. For SGN, the liver showed 31.1±4.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm of the nearest source with penetration hindered beyond 30μm. The spleen and tumor showed uptake of 22.1±6.2 and 15.8±6.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm, respectively, with penetration similarly hindered. CGH average concentration (nanoparticles/μm2) was 1.09±0.14 in the liver, 0.74±0.12 in the spleen, and 0.43±0.07 in the tumor. SGN average concentration (nanoparticles/μm2) was 0.43±0.07 in the liver, 0.30±0.06 in the spleen, and 0.20±0.04 in the tumor. Hyperspectral imaging of histology sections enables analysis of phosphatidylcholine-coated gold-based nanoparticles in pancreatic tumors with the goal to improve nanotherapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1556976858,"Lin28 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein that inhibits processing of pre-let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulates translation of mRNAs that control developmental timing, pluripotency, metabolism, and tumorigenesis. The RNA features that mediate Lin28 binding to the terminal loops of let-7 pre-miRNAs and to Lin28-responsive elements (LREs) in mRNAs are not well defined. Here we show that Lin28 target datasets are enriched for RNA sequences predicted to contain stable planar structures of 4 guanines known as G-quartets (G4s). The imino NMR spectra of pre-let-7 loops and LREs contain resonances characteristic of G4 hydrogen bonds. These sequences bind to a G4-binding fluorescent dye, N-methyl-mesoporphyrin IX (NMM). Mutations and truncations in the RNA sequence that prevent G4 formation also prevent Lin28 binding. The addition of Lin28 to a pre-let-7 loop or an LRE reduces G4 resonance intensity and NMM binding, suggesting that Lin28 may function to remodel G4s. Further, we show that NMM inhibits Lin28 binding. Incubation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line with NMM reduces its stem cell traits. In particular it increases mature let-7 levels, decreases OCT4, HMGA1, CCNB1, CDK4, and Lin28A protein, decreases sphere formation, and inhibits colony formation. Our results suggest a previously unknown structural feature of Lin28 targets and a new strategy for manipulating Lin28 function.

LIN28 binds messenger RNAs at GGAGA motifs and regulates splicing factor abundance.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling instead suggested that Lin28 recognizes a critical “A bulge” flanked by two G:C bonds in an extended double-stranded region of the LREs of mRNAs (39Jin J. Jing W. Lei X.-X. Feng C. Peng S. Boris-Lawrie K. Huang Y. Evidence that Lin28 stimulates translation by recruiting RNA helicase A to polysomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 3724-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A single A to U mutation in OCT4, HMGA1, and RPS19 mRNAs inhibited the ability of Lin28 to stimulate their translation (39Jin J. Jing W. Lei X.-X. Feng C. Peng S. Boris-Lawrie K. Huang Y. Evidence that Lin28 stimulates translation by recruiting RNA helicase A to polysomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 3724-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the “A bulge” is not present in pre-let-7 miRNAs. These structural, sequencing, and modeling data have suggested short Lin28 recognition elements. Such sequences are abundant in mRNAs throughout the transcriptome and hence are unlikely to uniquely define Lin28 binding specificity. None of these motifs are useful for predicting LREs of Lin28-regulated mRNAs. Thus, the key RNA features that determine Lin28 binding remain unclear. We hypothesized that Lin28-regulated miRNAs and mRNAs share common structural features. We observed that Lin28 targets have an abundance of guanine and guanine repeats. Because guanine rich nucleic acids can form stable planar structures called G-quartets (G4s) by G:G:G:G hydrogen bonding, we hypothesized that Lin28 might recognize structured RNAs that contain G4s. To address this hypothesis, we used bioinformatics, NMR spectroscopy, a fluorescent dye that specifically binds to G4s, and gel shift assays to analyze the structural features of the pre-let-7s and their loops, which contain the 3′-GGAG motif; the LREs of DSG2, HSPA5, and SUN1, which contain the putative Lin28 consensus sequences AAGNNG, AAGNG(N), and (N)UGUG(N), respectively; and the LRE of OCT4, which contains the proposed “A bulge.” We provide evidence that a G-quartet structure is a unifying feature of Lin28 RNA targets. Further, we demonstrate that Lin28 may function to unwind G4s and that G4-stabilizing agents represent a novel class of Lin28 inhibitors. Sequences of RNA used in this study are as follows: pre-let-7d, 5′-CCUAGGAAGAGGUAGUAGGUUGCAUAGUUUUAGGGCAGGGAUUUUGCCCACAAGGAGGUAACUAUACGACCUGCUGCCUUUCUUAGG-3′; let-7d-loop, 5′-UUAGGGCAGGGAUUUUGCCCACAAGGAGGU-3′;pre-let-7g, 5′-AGGCUGAGGUAGUAGUUUGUACAGUUUGAGGGUCUAUGAUACCACCCGGUACAGGAGAUAACUGUACAGGCCACUGCCUUGCCA-3′; let-7g-loop, 5′-GAGGGUCUAUGAUACCACCCGGUACAGGAG-3′; DSG2 LRE, 5′-GGUCUGCUAUGUGGGCAGAGG-3′; HSPA5 LRE, 5′-GGCGUGAGGUAGAAAAGGCUAAGAGAGCCUUGUCUU-3′; SUN1 LRE, 5′-UAUCCAGAAGGAGCUGGAAG-3′; OCT4 LRE, 5′-GCAGAAGAGGAUCACCCUGGGAUAUACACAGGCCGAUGUGGGGCUCACCCUGGGGGUUCUAUUUGGGAAGGUAUUCAGCCAAACGACCAUCUGCC-3′; miR-21, 5′-GAUGUUGACUGUUGAAUCUCAUGGCAACAC-3′. For NMR studies, template DNA containing the T7 promoter, sequence of interest, and restriction enzyme cleavage site for linearization (SmaI or DraI) were generated by PCR and inserted into the pUC19 plasmid after EcoRI and BamHI digestions. After linearizing the plasmid with SmaI or DraI, the templates were amplified by PCR, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. RNAs were synthesized from this template by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, in 10–20-ml reactions. After denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, the RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and purified by electrophoresis on urea-containing polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Note that these RNAs have 1–3 additional guanosines at their 5′ termini for efficient transcription, and one additional uracil (HSPA5) or 1–3 additional cytosines (the others) at their 3′ termini for linearization of the template by DraI or SmaI, respectively. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker 500- or 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired after incubating 100–500 μm RNA in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2 in 90% H2O/10% D2O. Samples were equilibrated at 5 °C. Data were accumulated with 1,024 transients over a frequency width of 10.33 kHz with 32,768 data points. Spectra were processed using MestReNova. NMM was obtained from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT). Fluorescence assays were performed in 30 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm NMM. The RNA concentration ranged from 0 to 100 μm. All fluorescence experiments were performed using a FlexStation III plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 399 nm and 614 nm, respectively. Fluorescence measurements were repeated three times for each sample, and the intensities were averaged and corrected by running a buffer control without RNA before each series of experiments. Fluorescence intensities were normalized to the maximum intensity of UG4U. Results shown are the average of 3–5 independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation between experiments. The cDNA for mouse Lin28A were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The region containing the CSD and ZnFs (residues 36–186) was PCR amplified and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET15b, adding a C-terminal His6 tag. Lin28-His6 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Millipore). Cells were grown in Luria Broth (LB) at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.9 and induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 10 units of Benzonase nuclease (Sigma). Lin28-His6 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 prep-grade column in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. EMSAs were conducted using 2 × 105 cpm 32P-5′-end-labeled RNA probes. Binding buffer contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Binding reactions were conducted in 20 μl with increasing amounts of recombinant Lin28-His6 (0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10 μm). Bound complexes were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Unwinding assays were carried out with constant amounts of let-7g loop or HSPA5 LRE (50 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm NMM to which recombinant Lin28 or BSA protein was added. The protein concentration ranged from 0 to 6.25 μm. After the addition of protein, samples were allowed to equilibrate at least 4 h at 4 °C. Fluorescence intensities were recorded using a FlexStation III plate reader, as in the NMM fluorescence assay. Protein only samples were recorded in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5 μm NMM without RNA. Fluorescence intensities were normalized to the maximum intensity without protein. Results shown are the mean value and standard deviation of 3 replicates. Competition EMSAs were conducted using 2 × 105 cpm 32P-5′-end-labeled let-7g loop or HSPA5 LRE probes and a constant rLin28A (10 μm). Competition reactions were conducted in the same EMSA binding buffer with increasing amounts of NMM (0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 μm). Bound complexes were resolved on native 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using autoradiography. Human NCCIT cells were cultured alone or in the presence of 100 μm NMM. RNA and protein were harvested after 3 and 48 h, respectively. miRNA levels were assessed using TaqManTM miRNA probes. The protein levels of Lin28 mRNA targets were measured by Western blot (OCT4, GeneTex GTX100622; HMGA1, Abcam ab129153; c-Myc, Cell Signaling 9402; CCNB1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-718; CDK4, Cell Signaling 2906; Lin28, Abcam ab46020). Mature, precursor, and primary miRNA levels were measured after 3 h of NMM incubation by quantitative RT-PCR using the TaqManTM miRNA and pri-miRNA assays (Life Technologies) and miScript precursor assay (Qiagen). Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo (Promega) after 48 h. For the sphere-forming assay, 1,000/ml viable cells were cultured in suspension in serum-free DMEM/F12 1:1 (Invitrogen), supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml, BD Biosciences), B27 (1:50, Invitrogen), 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 4 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). Spheres were counted after 1 or 2 weeks. For the colony-forming assay, 1,000 viable cells were plated on 10-cm plates in serum-containing medium. Medium was replaced every 3 days. After 8–14 days, cells were fixed in methanol (−20 °C) and stained with crystal violet. Human NCCIT cells were transfected alone, with 5 nm wild-type pre-let-7g (5′-AGGCUGAGGUAGUAGUUUGUACAGUUUGAGGGUCUAUGAUACCACCCGGUACAGGAGAUAACUGUACAGGCCACUGCCUUGCCA-3′), or 5 nm mutant pre-let-7g (5′-AGGCUGAGGUAGUAGUUUGUACAGUUUGAGAAUCUAUGAUACCACCCGGUACAAAAGAUAACUGUACAGGCCACUGCCUUGCCA-3′) and 25 ng of psiCHECK3 (Promega) vector containing two copies of the let-7-binding site cloned into the multiple cloning site (NotI and XhoI) of Renilla luciferase. After 48 h, cells were incubated with 100 μm NMM for 3 h and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Data were normalized to firefly luciferase. We examined the sequences of the 12 let-7 loops and of all 15 Lin28 targets with an experimentally defined LRE (Table 1)"
https://openalex.org/W560853235,"The purpose of this study was to a) determine the heart rate variability (HRV) and saliva markers of immunity (salivary immunoglobulin A; sIgA) and stress (salivary alpha-amylase; sAA) responses to chronic training in elite swimmers with a disability; and b) identify the relationships between HRV, sIgA, sAA and training volume. Eight members of a high performance Paralympic swimming program were monitored for their weekly resting HRV, sIgA and sAA levels in the 14 weeks leading up to a major international competition. The 14 week training program included aerobic, anaerobic, power and speed, and taper training phases, while also incorporating two swimming step tests and two swimming competitions. Specific time (root mean square of the successive differences; RMSSD) and frequency (high frequency normalized units [HFnu]) domain measures, along with non-linear indices (standard deviation of instantaneous RR variability; SD1 and short term fractal scaling exponent; α1) of HRV were used for all analyses with effects examined using magnitude-based inferences. Relationships between HRV and saliva markers were identified by Spearman rank rho (ρ) correlation coefficients. Compared with week 1, SD1 was very likely lower (96/4/0, ES = -2.21), while sAA was very likely elevated (100/0/0, ES = 2.32) at the beginning of week 7 for all athletes. The training program did not alter HRV or saliva whereas competition did. There were also no apparent differences observed for HRV, sIgA and sAA between each of the training phases during the 14 week swimming program. Correlations were observed between sAA and SD1 (ρ = -0.212, p<0.05), along with sAA and mean HR (ρ = 0.309, p<0.05). These results show that high level national competition influences depresses HRV (SD1) and increases saliva biomarkers of stress (sAA). It appears that a well-managed and periodised swimming program can maintain these indices within normal baseline levels. The study also highlighted the parasympathetic nervous system influence on sAA."
https://openalex.org/W570761472,"Growing evidence shows that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is already starting in childhood however there is no consensus regarding how to diagnose this condition in pediatric population. Studies in adults show that altered levels of specific micro-RNAs are related with components of the MetS.We determined the plasma levels of four MetS-associated micro-RNAs (miR-126, miR-132, mir-145 and Let-7e) in 10 to 12 years old children with or without MetS traits.Pediatric subjects were selected from a cohort of 3325 school-age children, and clustered by the absence (control, n = 30), or the presence of 1 (n = 50), 2 (n = 41) or 3 (n = 35) MetS traits according to Cook´s criteria. Micro-RNAs were isolated from plasma, and levels of miR-126, miR-132, miR-145 and Let-7e were determined by Taqman qPCR.Regression analysis of the different MetS traits regarding the different miRNAs analyzed showed that Let-7e presented a negative association with HDL-C levels, but a positive correlation with the number of MetS traits. Levels of miR-126 presented a positive correlation with waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, BMI, and plasma triglycerides and VLDL-C. Levels of miR-132 showed a positive correlation with waist to hip ratio. Plasma levels of Let-7e were increased (~3.4 fold) in subjects with 3 MetS traits, and showed significant AUC (0.681; 95%CI = [0.58, 0.78]; p < 0.001) in the ROC analysis which were improved when miR-126 was included in the analysis (AUC 0.729; p < 0.001). In silico analysis of the interaction of proteins derived from mRNAs targeted by Let7 and miR-126 showed an important effect of both Let-7e and miR-126 regulating the insulin signaling pathway.These results suggest that changes in the plasma levels of Let-7e and miR-126 could represent early markers of metabolic dysfunction in children with MetS traits."
https://openalex.org/W655117382,"Background Although the testis is considered an immunoprivileged organ it can orchestrate immune responses against pathological insults such as infection and trauma. Experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO) is a model of chronic inflammation whose main histopathological features it shares with human orchitis. In EAO an increased number of macrophages infiltrate the interstitium concomitantly with progressive germ cell degeneration and impaired steroidogenesis. Up-regulation of nitric oxide (NO)-NO synthase (NOS) system occurs, macrophages being the main producers of NO. Objective The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of NO-NOS system in orchitis development and determine the involvement of NO released by testicular macrophages on germ cell apoptosis and testosterone secretion. Method and Results EAO was induced in rats by immunization with testicular homogenate and adjuvants (E group) and a group of untreated normal rats (N) was also studied. Blockage of NOS by i.p. injection of E rats with a competitive inhibitor of NOS, L-NAME (8mg/kg), significantly reduced the incidence and severity of orchitis and lowered testicular nitrite content. L-NAME reduced germ cell apoptosis and restored intratesticular testosterone levels, without variations in serum LH. Co-culture of N testicular fragments with testicular macrophages obtained from EAO rats significantly increased germ cell apoptosis and testosterone secretion, whereas addition of L-NAME lowered both effects and reduced nitrite content. Incubation of testicular fragments from N rats with a NO donor DETA-NOnoate (DETA-NO) induced germ cell apoptosis through external and internal apoptotic pathways, an effect prevented by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). DETA-NO inhibited testosterone released from Leydig cells, whereas NAC (from 2.5 to 15 mM) did not prevent this effect. Conclusions We demonstrated that NO-NOS system is involved in the impairment of testicular function in orchitis. NO secreted mainly by testicular macrophages could promote oxidative stress inducing ST damage and interfering in Leydig cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1161790691,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with a heterogeneous and unpredictable course. To date there are no prognostic biomarkers even if they would be extremely useful for early patient intervention with personalized therapies. In this context, the analysis of inter-individual differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome may lead to the discovery of biological markers that are able to distinguish the various clinical forms at diagnosis.To this aim, a two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) study was carried out on individual CSF samples from 24 untreated women who underwent lumbar puncture (LP) for suspected MS. The patients were clinically monitored for 5 years and then classified according to the degree of disease aggressiveness and the disease-modifying therapies prescribed during follow up.The hierarchical cluster analysis of 2-DE dataset revealed three protein spots which were identified by means of mass spectrometry as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and two isoforms of vitamin D binding protein (DBP). These three protein spots enabled us to subdivide the patients into subgroups correlated with clinical classification (MS aggressive forms identification: 80%). In particular, we observed an opposite trend of values for the two protein spots corresponding to different DBP isoforms suggesting a role of a post-translational modification rather than the total protein content in patient categorization.These findings proved to be very interesting and innovative and may be developed as new candidate prognostic biomarkers of MS aggressiveness, if confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W1005587648,"In many countries, a single cochlear implant is offered as a treatment for a bilateral hearing loss. In cases where there is asymmetry in the amount of sound deprivation between the ears, there is a dilemma in choosing which ear should be implanted. In many clinics, the choice of ear has been guided by an assumption that the reorganisation of the auditory pathways caused by longer duration of deafness in one ear is associated with poorer implantation outcomes for that ear. This assumption, however, is mainly derived from studies of early childhood deafness. This study compared outcomes following implantation of the better or poorer ear in cases of long-term hearing asymmetries. Audiological records of 146 adults with bilateral hearing loss using a single hearing aid were reviewed. The unaided ear had 15 to 72 years of unaided severe to profound hearing loss before unilateral cochlear implantation. 98 received the implant in their long-term sound-deprived ear. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the relative contribution of potential predictors to speech recognition performance after implantation. Duration of bilateral significant hearing loss and the presence of a prelingual hearing loss explained the majority of variance in speech recognition performance following cochlear implantation. For participants with postlingual hearing loss, similar outcomes were obtained by implanting either ear. With prelingual hearing loss, poorer outcomes were obtained when implanting the long-term sound-deprived ear, but the duration of the sound deprivation in the implanted ear did not reliably predict outcomes. Contrary to an apparent clinical consensus, duration of sound deprivation in one ear has limited value in predicting speech recognition outcomes of cochlear implantation in that ear. Outcomes of cochlear implantation are more closely related to the period of time for which the brain is deprived of auditory stimulation from both ears."
https://openalex.org/W579624100,"Background Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. However, its clinical exploitation as an anti-inflammatory agent is hampered by its anticoagulant effect and the associated risk of bleeding. Objective The aim of the current study was to examine the ability of non-anticoagulant fractions of enoxaparin to inhibit the release of key inflammatory cytokines in primed peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from allergic mild asthmatics. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from allergic asthmatics were activated with phytohaemag glutinin (PHA), concanavalin-A (ConA) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence or absence of enoxaparin fractions before cytokine levels were quantified using specific cytokine bead arrays. Together with nuclear magnetic resonance analysis,time-dependent and target-specific effects of enoxaparin fractions were used to elucidate structural determinants for their anti-inflammatory effect and gain mechanistic insights into their anti-inflammatory activity. Results Two non-anticoagulant fractions of enoxaparin were identified that significantly inhibited T-cell activation. A disaccharide fraction of enoxaparin inhibited the release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α by more than 57% while a tetrasaccharide fraction was found to inhibit the release of tested cytokines by more than 68%. Our data suggest that the observed response is likely to be due to an interaction of 6-O-sulfated tetrasaccharide with cellular receptor(s). Conclusion and Clinical Relevance The two identified anti-inflammatory fractions lacked anticoagulant activity and are therefore not associated with risk of bleeding. The findings highlight the potential therapeutic use of enoxaparin-derived fractions, in particular tetrasaccharide, in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1749622785,"Vaccinia virus polymerase holoenzyme is composed of the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit E9 associated with its heterodimeric co-factor A20·D4 required for processive genome synthesis. Although A20 has no known enzymatic activity, D4 is an active uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG). The presence of a repair enzyme as a component of the viral replication machinery suggests that, for poxviruses, DNA synthesis and base excision repair is coupled. We present the 2.7 A crystal structure of the complex formed by D4 and the first 50 amino acids of A20 (D4·A201-50) bound to a 10-mer DNA duplex containing an abasic site resulting from the cleavage of a uracil base. Comparison of the viral complex with its human counterpart revealed major divergences in the contacts between protein and DNA and in the enzyme orientation on the DNA. However, the conformation of the dsDNA within both structures is very similar, suggesting a dominant role of the DNA conformation for UNG function. In contrast to human UNG, D4 appears rigid, and we do not observe a conformational change upon DNA binding. We also studied the interaction of D4·A201-50 with different DNA oligomers by surface plasmon resonance. D4 binds weakly to nonspecific DNA and to uracil-containing substrates but binds abasic sites with a Kd of <1.4 μm. This second DNA complex structure of a family I UNG gives new insight into the role of D4 as a co-factor of vaccinia virus DNA polymerase and allows a better understanding of the structural determinants required for UNG action."
https://openalex.org/W632098736,"We investigated the relationship between HSP27 phosphorylation and collagen-stimulated activation of platelets in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared from blood of type 2 DM patients. The platelet aggregation was analyzed in size of aggregates by an aggregometer using a laser scattering method. The protein phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting. Phosphorylated-HSP27 and PDGF-AB released from platelets were measured by ELISA. The phosphorylated-HSP27 levels at Ser-78 and Ser-82 induced by collagen were directly proportional to the platelet aggregation. Total HSP27 levels in platelets were decreased concomitantly with the phosphorylation. The released HSP27 levels were significantly correlated with the phosphorylated levels of HSP27 in the platelets stimulated by 0.3 μg/ml collagen. The low dose collagen-stimulated release of HSP27 was detected but relatively small in healthy donors. The released levels of PDGF-AB were in parallel with the levels of released HSP27. Area under the curve (AUC) of small aggregation (9-25 μm) induced by 0.3 μg/ml collagen was inversely proportional to the levels of released HSP27. AUC of large aggregation (50-70 μm) was directly proportional to the levels of released HSP27. Exogenous recombinant phosphorylated- HSP27 hardly affected the aggregation or the released levels of PDGF-AB induced by collagen. These results strongly suggest that HSP27 is released from human platelets accompanied with its phosphorylation induced by collagen, which is correlated with the acceleration of platelet aggregation in type 2 DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W626441758,"Background To date, putative prognostic biomarkers have shown limited utility from the clinical perspective for bladder urothelial carcinoma. Herein, the expression of beta-tubulin-3 and c-Myc was evaluated to determine their prognostic potential. Methods In formalin fixed-paraffin embedded blocks, immunohistochemical expression of c-Myc and beta-tubulin-3 was evaluated. H score ranging from 0 to 300 was obtained by multiplying the percentage of positive cells by intensity (0–3); c-Myc and beta-tubulin-3 expression was defined: 0: negative, 1: weakly positive, 2: strongly positive. Results beta-tubulin-3 and c-Myc immunoexpression was available for 46 cases. At the univariate analysis, node-involvement, beta-tubulin-3 and c-Myc overexpression discriminate shorter DFS (HR 2.19, p = 0.043; HR 3.10, p = 0.24 and HR 3.05, p = 0.011, respectively); 2-yrs DFS log-rank analysis according to low versus high level of immunoexpression were statistically significant; beta-tubulin-3, 53% low vs 12.7% high (p = value 0.02) and c-Myc 28 low vs 8 high (p-value 0.007). Patients displaying negative beta-tubulin-3/c-Myc had statistically significant better 2-yrs DFS than those with mixed expression or double positivity (54.5% versus 18.7% versus 0%, log-rank p = 0.006). Conclusions c-Myc and beta-tubulin-3 show improvement for prognostic risk stratification in patients with muscle invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma. These molecular pathways may also be candidate to improve predictiveness to targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2115868572,"Oncogenic mutation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase is observed in several human malignancies. Here, we describe three novel type II RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), ALW-II-41-27, XMD15-44 and HG-6-63-01, that inhibit the cellular activity of oncogenic RET mutants at two digit nanomolar concentration. These three compounds shared a 3-trifluoromethyl-4-methylpiperazinephenyl pharmacophore that stabilizes the ‘DFG-out’ inactive conformation of RET activation loop. They blocked RET-mediated signaling and proliferation with an IC50 in the nM range in fibroblasts transformed by the RET/C634R and RET/M918T oncogenes. They also inhibited autophosphorylation of several additional oncogenic RET-derived point mutants and chimeric oncogenes. At a concentration of 10 nM, ALW-II-41-27, XMD15-44 and HG-6-63-01 inhibited RET kinase and signaling in human thyroid cancer cell lines carrying oncogenic RET alleles; they also inhibited proliferation of cancer, but not non-tumoral Nthy-ori-3-1, thyroid cells, with an IC50 in the nM range. The three compounds were capable of inhibiting the ‘gatekeeper’ V804M mutant which confers substantial resistance to established RET inhibitors. In conclusion, we have identified a type II TKI scaffold, shared by ALW-II-41-27, XMD15-44 and HG-6-63-01, that may be used as novel lead for the development of novel agents for the treatment of cancers harboring oncogenic activation of RET."
https://openalex.org/W575058579,"Several papers have reported elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides in patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer. We have explored whether N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma levels predict a future diagnosis of cancer in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).We studied 699 patients with CAD free of cancer. At baseline, NT-proBNP, galectin-3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I plasma levels were assessed. The primary outcome was new cancer diagnosis. The secondary outcome was cancer diagnosis, heart failure requiring hospitalization, or death.After 2.15±0.98 years of follow-up, 24 patients developed cancer. They were older (68.5 [61.5, 75.8] vs 60.0 [52.0, 72.0] years; p=0.011), had higher NT-proBNP (302.0 [134.8, 919.8] vs 165.5 [87.4, 407.5] pg/ml; p=0.040) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (3.27 [1.33, 5.94] vs 1.92 [0.83, 4.00] mg/L; p=0.030), and lower triglyceride (92.5 [70.5, 132.8] vs 112.0 [82.0, 157.0] mg/dl; p=0.044) plasma levels than those without cancer. NT-proBNP (Hazard Ratio [HR]=1.030; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=1.008-1.053; p=0.007) and triglyceride levels (HR=0.987; 95%CI=0.975-0.998; p=0.024) were independent predictors of a new cancer diagnosis (multivariate Cox regression analysis). When patients in whom the suspicion of cancer appeared in the first one-hundred days after blood extraction were excluded, NT-proBNP was the only predictor of cancer (HR=1.061; 95%CI=1.034-1.088; p<0.001). NT-proBNP was an independent predictor of cancer, heart failure, or death (HR=1.038; 95%CI=1.023-1.052; p<0.001) along with age, and use of insulin and acenocumarol.NT-proBNP is an independent predictor of malignancies in patients with CAD. New studies in large populations are needed to confirm these findings."

https://openalex.org/W569728217,"Selenocysteine tRNA 1 associated protein (Trnau1ap) has been characterized as a tRNA[Ser]Sec-binding protein of 43 kDa, hence initially named SECp43. Previous studies reported its presence in complexes containing tRNA[Ser]Sec implying a role of SECp43 as a co-factor in selenoprotein expression. We generated two conditionally mutant mouse models targeting exons 3+4 and exons 7+8 eliminating parts of the first RNA recognition motif or of the tyrosine-rich domain, respectively. Constitutive inactivation of exons 3+4 of SECp43 apparently did not affect the mice or selenoprotein expression in several organs. Constitutive deletion of exons 7+8 was embryonic lethal. We therefore generated hepatocyte-specific Secp43 knockout mice and characterized selenoprotein expression in livers of mutant mice. We found no significant changes in the levels of 75Se-labelled hepatic proteins, selenoprotein levels as determined by Western blot analysis, enzymatic activity or selenoprotein mRNA abundance. The methylation pattern of tRNA[Ser]Sec remained unchanged. Truncated Secp43 Δ7,8mRNA increased in Secp43-mutant livers suggesting auto-regulation of Secp43 mRNA abundance. We found no signs of liver damage in Secp433-mutant mice, but neuron-specific deletion of exons 7+8 impaired motor performance, while not affecting cerebral selenoprotein expression or cerebellar development. These findings suggest that the targeted domains in the SECp43 protein are not essential for selenoprotein biosynthesis in hepatocytes and neurons. Whether the remaining second RNA recognition motif plays a role in selenoprotein biosynthesis and which other cellular process depends on SECp43 remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W595269560,"DNA replication in higher eukaryotes initiates at thousands of origins according to a spatio-temporal program. The ATR/Chk1 dependent replication checkpoint inhibits the activation of later firing origins. In the Xenopus in vitro system initiations are not sequence dependent and 2-5 origins are grouped in clusters that fire at different times despite a very short S phase. We have shown that the temporal program is stochastic at the level of single origins and replication clusters. It is unclear how the replication checkpoint inhibits late origins but permits origin activation in early clusters. Here, we analyze the role of Chk1 in the replication program in sperm nuclei replicating in Xenopus egg extracts by a combination of experimental and modelling approaches. After Chk1 inhibition or immunodepletion, we observed an increase of the replication extent and fork density in the presence or absence of external stress. However, overexpression of Chk1 in the absence of external replication stress inhibited DNA replication by decreasing fork densities due to lower Cdk2 kinase activity. Thus, Chk1 levels need to be tightly controlled in order to properly regulate the replication program even during normal S phase. DNA combing experiments showed that Chk1 inhibits origins outside, but not inside, already active clusters. Numerical simulations of initiation frequencies in the absence and presence of Chk1 activity are consistent with a global inhibition of origins by Chk1 at the level of clusters but need to be combined with a local repression of Chk1 action close to activated origins to fit our data."

At 14 years, participants completed an emotional variant of the dot-probe task, as well two personality measures, namely the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale and the revised NEO Personality Inventory. At 14 and 16 years, participants and their parents were interviewed to determine symptoms of mental disorders.Personality traits were general and specific risk indicators for mental disorders at 14 years. Increased specificity was obtained when investigating the likelihood of mental disorders over a 2-year period, with the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale showing incremental validity over the NEO Personality Inventory. Attentional biases to emotional faces did not characterise or predict mental disorders examined in the current sample.Personality traits can indicate concurrent and prospective risk for mental disorders in a community youth sample, and identify at-risk youth beyond the impact of baseline symptoms. This study does not support the hypothesis that attentional biases mediate the relationship between personality and psychopathology in a community sample. Task and sample characteristics that contribute to differing results among studies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W591497760,"Rule-based languages such as Kappa excel in their support for handling the combinatorial complexities prevalent in many biological systems, including signalling pathways. But Kappa provides little structure for organising rules, and large models can therefore be hard to read and maintain. This paper introduces a high-level, modular extension of Kappa called LBS-κ. We demonstrate the constructs of the language through examples and three case studies: a chemotaxis switch ring, a MAPK cascade, and an insulin signalling pathway. We then provide a formal definition of LBS-κ through an abstract syntax and a translation to plain Kappa. The translation is implemented in a compiler tool which is available as a web application. We finally demonstrate how to increase the expressivity of LBS-κ through embedded scripts in a general-purpose programming language, a technique which we view as generally applicable to other domain specific languages."
https://openalex.org/W2211382893,"Homing endonucleases are useful tools for genome modification because of their capability to recognize and cleave specifically large DNA targets. These endonucleases generate a DNA double strand break that can be repaired by the DNA damage response machinery.

HEs have been classified in five families, the largest of which contains the conserved LAGLIDADG sequence motif (9Marcaida M.J. Muñoz I.G. Blanco F.J. Prieto J. Montoya G. Homing endonucleases: from basics to therapeutic applications.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of several LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases (LHEs) indicate that these proteins adopt a similar active conformation as homodimers or as monomers with two separate domains. LHEs that contain a single copy of this motif, such as I-CreI and I-CeuI, act as homodimers and recognize a nearly palindromic DNA target. Conversely, LHEs containing two copies, such as I-DmoI, I-SceI, and PI-SceI, act as monomers with two domains, each bearing an LAGLIDADG motif, that recognize non-palindromic DNAs. The interface between the two domains forms the catalytic center, which is composed of two sites, each responsible for cleaving one DNA strand (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The I-DmoI catalytic center has two acidic residues located at the end of the two LAGLIDADG α-helixes: Asp-21 (from domain A) and Glu-117 (from domain B) that define two different metal sites (sites A and B, respectively) for cleaving each DNA strand. These sites are separated and need the entrance of a third metal in a central position in the catalytic center (site C) to cleave the DNA strands in a sequential manner by a two-metal ion mechanism (10Molina R.

The DNA targets were purchased from Proligo and consisted of the following duplexes: 1) 5′-GCCTTGCCGGGTAAGTTCCGGCGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCGGAACTTACCCGGCAAGGC-3′ (wild type; not nicked DNA); 2) 5′-GCCTTGCCGGGTAA-3′, 5′-GTTCCGGCGCG-3′, and 5′-CGCGCCGGAACTTACCCGGCAAGGC-3′ (nicked in strand A); and 3) 5′-CGCGCCGGAACTTACC-3′, 5′-CGGCAAGGC-3′, and 5′-GCCTTGCCGGGTAAGTTCCGGCGCG-3′ (nicked in strand B). Individual strands in Tris-EDTA buffer in the presence of 50 mm NaCl were combined in a 1:1 ratio and annealed by incubating at 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooling to room temperature to form DNA duplexes. All of them form a 25-bp blunt end duplex after incubation. Sample concentrations were quantified by UV spectroscopy using the calculated extinction coefficients. Protein concentrations were further confirmed by Bradford assay. To discard that differences in mutant cleavage activity could arise from changes in protein stability or DNA binding affinities, the I-DmoI mutants were analyzed by circular dichroism, thermal denaturation, and binding to the 25-bp DNA target in fluorescence binding assays.

Additional duplexes (purchased from Sigma as a racemic mixture) that possess the same 25-bp target sequence but a phosphorothioate bond in place of the scissile bond in the 5′-phosphate of 3GstrandA or the 5′-phosphate of −3CstrandB were used to measure strand cleavage accessibility. The dissociation constants of the I-DmoI variants for their cognate DNA were determined using the change in the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the proteins as the protein·DNA complexes are formed. Binding reactions were performed by mixing 500 nm I-DmoI with various concentrations (0–2000 nm) of the 25-bp-long natural I-DmoI target duplex in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2) and incubating for 15 min at 50 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at room temperature using a QuantaMaster QM-2000-7 model spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) with excitation fixed at 280 nm and emission in the 325–340-nm range. Each spectrum was the average of five consecutive scans. After normalization, the dissociation constants (KD) were determined by non-linear least square fitting (Prism, GraphPad) of the observed change in fluorescence at 334 nm to the following equation. ΔF=ΔFmax×12×[P][([DNA]+[P]+KD)](Eq. 1) where ΔF is the change in protein fluorescence upon complex formation, ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence change, [P] is the total protein concentration, and [DNA] is the total concentration of the DNA duplex. Three independent titration curves were carried out for each protein and used to determine the average fluorescence values and the standard errors at each titration point. All data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the XALOC beamline (ALBA, Barcelona, Spain) and PXI beamline (Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland). Diffraction data were recorded on ADSC-Q315r, Mar225 CCD, or Pilatus detectors depending on the beamline. Processing and scaling were accomplished with XDS (16Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The reaction paths, obtained by formation of the phosphorus bond with the oxygen of the deoxyribose and cleaving the hydroxyl-phosphorus bond, were calculated for both A and B strands. At each step, all the atoms not directly involved in the reaction were fully relaxed. The system was divided into two parts using ONIOM (22Dapprich S. Komaromi I. Byun K.S. Morokuma K. Frisch M.J.

The quantum mechanical part, formed by the phosphate group, the manganese ion, and its ligands, was modeled via density functional theory using the B3LYP functional and a 6–311G(d,p) basis set. The non-quantum mechanical part, including all the atoms within a distance of 8 Å from the reacting phosphate, interacts with the quantum mechanical subsystem by electronic embedding.

After 10 ns of equilibration, a molecular dynamics simulation of 50 ns was performed using a time step of 2 fs. The temperature was kept constant at 343 K using the velocity rescaling algorithm (25Bussi G. Donadio D. Parrinello M. Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling.J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126014101Crossref PubMed Scopus (9208) Google Scholar). Every 2 ps, the electric field given by the atomic charge distribution was calculated and projected on the phosphorus-oxygen bond of the coding and non-coding strands. Time course strand cleavage assays showed that in I-DmoI the non-coding strand is cleaved first before the second phosphodiester hydrolysis takes place on the coding strand (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The catalytic center contains the Asp-21 and Glu-117 residues defining metal sites A and B, respectively (11Marcaida M.J. Prieto J. Redondo P. Nadra A.D. Alibés A. Serrano L. Grizot S. Duchateau P. Pâques F. Blanco F.J. Montoya G.

A. 2008; 105: 16888-16893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each residue binds a metal ion (Fig. 1A). In addition, we have identified a metal site (site C) that contacts the catalytic acid residues (Asp-21 and Glu-117), the 5′-phosphates of 3GstrandA and −3CstrandB, and the 3′-hydroxyl groups of the riboses of 2AstrandA and −2CstrandB (Fig. 1B). The I-DmoI cleavage mechanism follows a determined cleavage sequence; the metal sites are occupied in a specific order allowing catalysis (Fig. 1C). Initially, site A is filled followed by site B, and finally a third metal ion enters the central location in site C (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The metal ion in site C has a pivotal role in the reaction, allowing the proper geometry for two-metal ion catalysis and triggering the digestion of the DNA target. Thus, this metal in the central site has a role equivalent to that of the second metal site in the classical two-metal ion mechanism of phosphodiester bond catalysis. After phosphodiester bond cleavage, the metal in site C abandons the active center, and its position is occupied by a water molecule (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The metal in site C does not seem to be responsible for the sequential order of cleavage. The active site pocket is lined with several basic residues that contact both DNA and solvent atoms. Thus a lysine residue is essential for proton transfer and solvent activation and does not participate in metal binding but instead is found in a basic pocket near the scissile phosphate and nucleophilic water (26Chevalier B. Sussman D. Otis C. Noël A.J. Turmel M. Lemieux C. Stephens K. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Metal-dependent DNA cleavage mechanism of the I-CreI LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14015-14026Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structure comparison allowed finding similar residues in other HEs (Table 2). The asymmetry between sites A and B in I-DmoI is defined by the presence of Lys-120 on site A. This residue coordinates the water molecule that attacks the scissile phosphate of the non-coding strand (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although no equivalent residue is found on site B (Table 2), a water molecule can be found at the right position for the second nucleophilic attack (10Molina R. Stella S. Redondo P. Gomez H. Marcaida M.J. Orozco M. Prieto J. Montoya G. Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).TABLE 2Summary of conserved motif and active site residues for monomeric LHE structures Open table in a new tab Moreover, the use of phosphorothioates (27Armalyte E.

Therefore, after analyzing these data, we searched for different strategies to generate I-DmoI variants that could cut only one of the target strands. Initially, we attempted to inactivate the acidic metal binding residues in site A or site B. However, mutations such as D44A or D145A in I-SceI, another monomeric member of the LAGLIDADG family (28Niu Y. Tenney K. Li H. Gimble F.S. Engineering variants of the I-SceI homing endonuclease with strand-specific and site-specific DNA-nicking activity.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and D21N or E117Q in I-DmoI (29Lykke-Andersen J. Garrett R.A. Kjems J. Mapping metal ions at the catalytic centres of two intron-encoded endonucleases.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) completely abolished the LHE DNA cleavage, thus inactivating the active center. These mutants revealed an intricate coordination between the active sites in the monomeric LHEs, indicating that the mutation of the catalytic residues will not yield nickase variants. This behavior was also observed in other mutants, D21A, D21G, E117A, and E117G, in I-DmoI that lead to totally inactive variants of the enzyme (Table 3). However, in contrast to previous reports (29Lykke-Andersen J. Garrett R.A. Kjems J. Mapping metal ions at the catalytic centres of two intron-encoded endonucleases.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the D21N mutation generated a DSB in the target and low nickase activity using a plasmid containing I-DmoI target (Fig. 3A). We also checked whether changes in the length of the side chain of acidic residues could influence the catalysis. We generated the D21E, E117D, and D21E/E117D variants. Both D21E and D21E/E117D variants were inactive (Table 3), most likely due to the fact that site A cannot accommodate a glutamic side chain. However, I-DmoI E117D cleaves both DNA strands although at a reduced rate. These results are consistent with those of Silva and Belfort (30Silva G.H. Belfort M.

Upon graduating from high school in Hong Kong, I did not particularly want to work in science; I just wanted a job, because I rarely left the dinner table with my stomach full. For graduate school, I went to Columbia University with a scholarship. There, I was surrounded by Nobel laureates—Isidor Isaac Rabi, Polykarp Kusch, Tsung-Dao Lee—and laureates-in-waiting: James Rainwater, Jack Steinberger, Leon Lederman. The most important moment in my physics education was when I noticed Lee standing next to me in the men's room, peeing. Nobel laureates are ordinary people, I learned, just like you and me. At Columbia, I was influenced by the student antiwar movement and the Cultural Revolution that was raging in China. I and several others (including Peter Kwong, now at Hunter College, and Jean Quan, who would become the mayor of Oakland, California) started the Chinatown Food Co-op; our aim was to “serve the people.” I wasn't interested in solving small problems; I wanted to save the world, to return to China and join the revolution.

I finally made it in 1978, at the beginning of the country's “reform and opening up” movement. I was assigned to do physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics. In China, the spring of 1978 is called “Science Spring” because for 10 years science had come to a virtual halt. Basic science was banned. My colleagues and I resumed the work with great enthusiasm; if China was in ruins, we figured, the best option was to fix it. I helped open the door to the West, discovering bowlics—a type of liquid crystal—and publishing the first paper by mainland-only authors ever to appear in Physical Review Letters .

We did not have journals—only copies of journals—and there was just one Chinese-made copying machine in the institute, which broke down every half hour or so. Everything was scarce, including tofu and writing paper, but we were not troubled by the minimal calories available to fuel us. We worked diligently, day and night, except on Sundays. Sundays were for washing clothes, by hand.

China started sending scientists to the West—many to the United States—as visiting scholars and to international conferences. Among China's billion people were dozens of notable physicists, but the number of excellent ones was smaller; I was the only government-approved doctoral mentor in liquid crystal physics. Physics research can't be learned properly by reading books or papers; it should be learned by working alongside masters. China did have a few masters—those who had been trained in the West before 1949—but they were all busy establishing institutes or working on the atomic bomb.

Today, China is making progress scientifically, but there is still some distance to go. The Cultural Revolution sacrificed a whole generation of scientists. Among all the problems this created, it led to a scarcity of experts who could act as academic judges. Qualitative assessment was replaced by counting papers—a poor substitute. The damage lingers.

Lately, and happily, China's priorities have shifted toward innovation. Innovation is not easy, though, in a culture that for 2000 years has prided itself on taking the middle course in everything, for the sake of harmony and stability. It's the opposite of the Socratic method that's at the heart of Western science. Great scientists like Galileo show that breakthroughs can be made even in environments that emphasize orthodoxy—but then no one was counting Galileo's papers. China has very good scientists, but the country needs to find its way of doing innovative science.

After 6 years, I left China and returned to the United States—not for scientific or political reasons, or due to material want, but for family. During a visit to the United States with our daughter, my wife announced that she intended to stay. Forced to choose between the motherland and a daughter, I chose my daughter. I left China on good terms.
